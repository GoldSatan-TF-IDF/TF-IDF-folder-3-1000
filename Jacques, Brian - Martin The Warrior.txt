the path and open flatlands to the west capped with snow the beautiful building resembled a vast frosted cake walls battlements belltower and abbey fringed with icicles hanging over its red sandstone

celery sugared plums and honeyed pears vied for place with winter salads and vegetable flans aubretia and bultip joined in the merriment enjoyed the food and basked in the legendary hospitality of redwall abbey it was late night sleepy little ones had been carried off to their dormitory beds and fresh torches placed in the wall sconces bultip nibbled on his fourth pastie draining a tankard of

chairs were set in a halfcircle round the big fireplace fresh logs placed on the fire damped down with snowsoaked herbs to give a sweet aroma to the air every redwaller who did not want to sleep took a seat aubretia and bultip were installed in carved highback chairs the audience settled down watching the two travellers eagerly today as we walked through your beautiful abbey we saw a tapestry the mousemaid began immediately recognized the mouse pictured there martin the warrior as i understand it he is the guiding spirit of this place and one of its founders do you know much about him abbot saxtus sighed shaking his head slow martin has always been here to guide us in times of trouble his presence was felt when two of our young ones dandin and mariel were here unfortunately they have been gone a season and a half now martins presence has not been felt since we know too little of our abbey warrior dearly wish we knew more a faint smile hovered about the face of aubretia she leaned forward and looked at the abbot and his redwallers sitting in the flickering firelight then you shall for i have a long and great tale to relate to you it is said that badrangs dream was to be lord of all the eastern coast a former corsair he ceased plundering the high seas to carve out his own empire on land he chose good territory facing the eastern sea with hills to the north cliffs to the south marshes to the west and wild forests beyond secure at the edge of the shoreline the battlehardened stoat could defend his position from any attack there he set about making his dream become reality a fortress of timber and stone marshank badrang was chieftain of a horde weasels ferrets foxes and rats he did not trust other stoats considering his species to be the most cunning and resourceful of all creatures scuttling his crippled ship on the northwest coast badrang had set out overland striking for the far coast where corsairs and searats seldom sailed the greyblue waters of the great eastern sea as he travelled the vicious stoat ravaged the land killing those he could not conquer and enslaving those he could it took two long seasons until he finally arrived triumphant at his destination laden with plunder backed by his ruthless horde and driving a long chain of wretched slaves before him badrang set his slaves to work forcing them to carve a rock quarry and commence building his fortress the work went well and soon a living quarters was erected followed by a perimeter guard wall with its gates facing the shoreline he scanned the open sea each day for he had made enemies among his own kind when he was pirating fortunately there was never a sign of sail or ship on the horizon however he bullied and drove both slave and hordebeast to have the fortress fully built and established only then could he rule completely burning and killing his way in all directions until he was absolute ruler of all he surveyed tyrant badrang loved the sound of the word tyrant book one the prisoner and the tyrant he was only a young mouse but of strong build with a glint in his eye that proclaimed him a born fighter a creature of few words who never chattered needlessly the early summer sun of the eastern coast beat down pitilessly on his unprotected head as he carried and stacked chunks of rock beside the masons who would shape it into blocks that would enlarge fort marshank a weasel captain named risk swaggered up cracking his long whip threateningly looking for an excuse to cut loose on the slaves who toiled in the dusty heat around him his eye settled on the young mouse you there liven yourself up come on stir yer stumps lord badrang will be round for an inspection soon get movin or yll taste my whip the mouse dropped the rock he was carrying and stood staring levelly at the bullying weasel hisk cracked the lash viciously the tip flicking the air a fraction from his victims face the young mouse did not move his eyes hooded over as he stood in silent defiance the weasel captain drew the lash back to strike but the bold angry eyes of the young slave seemed to challenge him like all bullies the weasel was a coward at heart averting his gaze from the piercing stare hisk snapped his whip in the direction of some more timid creatures cmon you worthless idlers no work no food move your carcasses ere comes lord badrang flanked by his aides gurrad the rat and skalrag the fox badrang the tyrant strode imperiously onto the site he waited while two hedgehogs hurriedly built him a makeshift seat from stone blocks skalrag swiftly covered it with a velvet cloak badrang sat gazing at the work going on around him the stoat lord addressed hisk will my fortress be finished before summer is out hisk waved his coiled whip about at the slaves lord if the weather was cooler an we ad more creatures badrang moved swiftly in his anger seizing a pebble he hurled it striking hisk on the jaw the weasel captain stood dumbly blood trickling from his lip as the tyrant berated him excuses i dont want to hear complaints or excuses dyou hear me what i need is a fortress built before autumn well dont stand there snivelling get on with it immediately hisk got to work flaying about with the whip as he passed on his masters bad mood move you useless lumps you heard lord badrang marshank must be ready before the seasons out itll be double the work an half rations from now on move an old squirrel was staggering by bent double under the burden of a large rock hisk lashed out at him the whip curled around the aged creatures footpaws tripping him as he dropped the rock the weasel began laying into his victim striking indiscriminately at the old ones frail body you worthless layabout ill strip the misrable hide off yer the lash rose and fell as hisk flogged away at the unprotected creature on the ground ill teach yer a lesson yer wont ferget suddenly the whip stopped in midswing it went taut as hisk pulled on the handle he tugged at it but was yanked backwards the young mouse had the end of the whip coiled around his paw hisks eyes bulged with temper as he shouted at the intruder leggo my whip mouse or ill gut yer the weasel reached for the dagger at his waist but he was not fast enough the mouse hurled himself upon hisk wrapping the whiplash round the captains neck he heaved hard hisk thrashed furiously about in the dust choking and slobbering as the lash tightened gurrad blew a hasty alarm on a bone whistle he carried slung about his neck in a trice the mouse was set upon by the nearest six guards he disappeared beneath a jumble of ferrets weasels and rats as they pounded him mercilessly stamping upon his paws and breaking his hold on the whip they continued relentlessly beating him with spearhandles rods and whips until badrang intervened thats enough bring him to me his paws pinioned by whips and a spear handle pulled hard across his throat the young mouse was dragged struggling and kicking into the stoat lords presence badrang drew his sword and pressed the point against the young ones heaving chest leaning forward he hissed into the captives face you know the penalty is death for attacking one of my horde i could run you through with my sword right now and snuff out your life what dyou say to that mouse the strong young mouses eyes burned into the tyrants face like twin flames as he gritted out scum that sword is not yours it belongs to me as it belonged to my father badrang withdrew the swordpoint he sat back shaking his head slowly in amazement at the boldness of the creature in front of him well well youre not short of nerve mouse whats your name the answer was loud and fearless i am called martin son of luke the warrior see the roving river run over hill and dale to a secret forest place o my heart noonvale look for me at dawning when the suns reborn in the silent beauty twixt the night and morn wait till the lark ascends and skies are blue there where the rainbow ends i will meet you the mousemaid rose sat quite still as the last tremulous notes of her song hovered on the evening air from a vantage point in the rocks south of marshank she looked out to sea the water was tinted gold and scarlet from soft cloud layers reflecting the far westering sun at her back below on the shore an ebbing tide gurgled and chuckled small secrets to itself as it lapped the pebbles hurr miz roser youm cumm an get this yurr supper oi baint acooken vittles to lay abowt an git cold n soggy bo urr no roses companion grumm waved a heavy digging paw at her and the mousemaid wandered over to join her mole friend at the low fire he had been cooking on she sniffed appreciatively hmm wild oatcakes and vegetable soup good old grumm you could make a banquet from nothing grumm smiled his dark velvety face crinkling around two bright button eyes he waved the tiny ladle which he always carried thrust through his belt like a sword hurr an you udd charmee burds outener trees with yurr

understand grumm the name brome and the word trouble go together he was always in trouble with father at home thats why he went off wandering you werent there at the time but they had a furious argument over brome just taking off and roaming as he pleased father said it was no way for the son of a chieftain to learn his responsibilities but brome wouldnt listen he ran off alone well weve tracked him this far grumm and im certain that my brother has run straight into trouble again thats why im sure hes been taken by badrangs scouts i hope that he hasnt been forced to tell them where

finished eating they extinguished the fire and broke camp a stiff breeze had sprung out of the east bringing with it a light spatter of raindrops which threatened to get heavier as night set in scrambling down the rocks the two friends gained the shore their paws making soft chinking noises as they trotted through the shingled tideline marshank stood grim and forbidding up ahead a dark hump of misery in the moonless night the old squirrel martin had saved peered through the cracks of the wooden slave compound at the lone figure tied between two posts on the walltop above the main gates his son a burly male named felldoh stood behind the elder he gritted his teeth savagely the scurvy toads theyll pay for this someday barkjon the old one shook his head sadly martin will have a bad time tonight if the weather gets worse felldoh thumped a sturdy paw against the wooden compound fence its the morning im more worried about when the gannets and gulls and those other big hungry sea birds come searching for food and see him tied up there theyll rip martin to bits a weasel guard called rotnose banged his spearbutt on the fence alongside barkjons nose gerraway from there you two or youll be next up there with the mouse double work for you tomorrow get some sleep while you can sweet dreams now hawhawhaw floodtide returned bringing with it a storm the gale shrieked driving heavy rain before it on the walltop martin bowed his head against the battering elements it was all that he could do tied as he was by four paws between two thick wooden posts rain plastered the single frayed garment he wore close to his body and the wetness ran down his back into his ears across his eyes and over his nose into his mouth battering his bowed head and numbing his whole body which shook and quivered in the ceaseless gale he hung there like a rag doll in the wind martins mind went back to the caves on the northwest shore where he had been born luke the warrior was his father he had never known a mother she had been killed in a searat raid when he was a tiny infant luke had raised him the best way he could but luke was a warrior and sworn to the destruction of searats and corsairs he was unused to rearing babies martin was only two seasons out of infancy when his father and some other warriors captured a searat galley after a hard pitched battle on the shoreline flushed with success and driven by the awful rage to take vengeance upon his wifes murderers luke the warrior gathered a crew and decided to sail off in his prize vessel to wage war on the searats martin remembered he was still very young but fired with a determination to accompany his father luke however would not hear of it he left martin in the care of his wifes mother windred the day he sailed martin sat stonefaced outside the cave luke could not reason with him son son you would not last two moons out there on the high seas i cannot risk your life pitting you in battle against the sea scum i am sworn to do war with listen to me i know what is best for you but martin would not listen i want to sail on the ship and be a warrior like you luke spread his paws wide and sighed with frustration what am i going to do with you martin you have my warrior spirit and your mothers determination listen son take my sword it was a fighting sword and well used luke pressed it into his sons paws the young mouse gazed wide eyed at the battlescarred blade and gripped the handle tight as if he would never let go luke smiled recalling the time when his father had passed the sword on to him tapping a paw against the crosshilt luke said i can see it is in you to be a fighter martin the first thing warriors must learn is discipline martin felt as though the sword were speaking for him tell me what to do and i will obey relief surged through luke as he commanded the wouldbe warrior you will stay and defend our cave against all comers protect those weaker than yourself and honor our code always use the sword to stand for good and right never do a thing you would be ashamed of but never let your heart rule your mind he tapped the blade once more as its pitted edge glinted in the winter morning and never ever let another creature take this sword from you not as long as you live when the time comes pass it on to another maybe your own son you will know instinctively if he is a warrior if not hide the sword where only a true warrior who is brave of heart would dare go to find it swear this to me martin i swear it on my life the young mouses grey eyes reflected the wintry sea as he spoke coming back to reality martin lifted his head in the teeth of the gale was it a tear or just rain running from his eyes as he pictured the small figure standing upon the pebbled strand alone waving the sword in a warriors salute as his fathers ship was lost on the horizon in an afternoon of snow and icy winter spume martins head slumped onto his sodden chest as he recalled the day of his capture timballisto was a budding warrior several seasons martins senior he had been left in charge of the tribe by luke the young mouse resented his older friends authority and often showed it by wandering far along the coast away from the safe boundaries of the caves it was on one such day that martin took his fathers sword following the tideline north until the short winter afternoon began darkening he was busy chopping away with the great blade at a driftwood log reasoning that he could not be scolded for bringing back firewood to the cave fires windred saw him from afar she had been following his pawtracks since early noon they stood out clearly in the smooth wet sand marked with a straight furrow where the swordpoint trailed at martins side she hurried forward scolding her grandson martin ive been out of my mind with worry what have you been told about going off alone dyou realize youre almost a league from the caves suddenly windred stopped berating him she was staring beyond martin to where a band of villainouslooking creatures were running along the shore towards them the old mouse threw off her shawl martin come to me we must get away from here quickly the young mouse turned and saw the corsairs dropping the firewood he took up the sword in both paws run grandma windred would not have run anyway but she was rooted to the spot with fear a stoat headed the band they stopped within two paces of their victims the stoat grinned wickedly thats a big sword for a little mouse to be wielding youd better give it to me before you hurt yourself the sword was heavy and martins paws were tired but he held it point forward unwavering leave us alone stay back my father told me never to let another creature take this sword from me now the corsairs began spreading out slowly encircling martin and windred licking knives and spearblades as they chuckled evilly at the old mouse and the small wouldbe warrior the stoat took a pace forward his voice deceptively friendly a wise beast your father did he ever tell you about those who could slay with a single spear thrust like this or this as he spoke the stoat brought up his spear and began jabbing expertly at martin the young mouse parried fighting off the questing spearpoint amid the laughter of the cruel corsairs at a nod from the stoat a weasel ran forward from behind martin he dealt the young mouse a heavy blow with an oaken pikestaff laying him out flat on the sand badrang picked up the sword stepping over martins senseless body he winked at windred she was held tight between two searats tied and gagged by her own shawl eyes wide with terror the stoat stared along the swordblade at her well grandma hes a bold brat that one of yours hmm nice sword it should serve me well hisk weve wasted enough time chain these two up and get em back to the slavelines shackled to windred martin was halfdragged halfcarried further north along the wintry shore into the gathering night it was in the short hours before dawn that martin came awake shivering and moaning as a fiery drum of relentless pain beat inside his skull whips cracked he was pulled upright by other slaves as the chain began moving then came the long march two seasons trekking under the rods and whips of slavedrivers tied by the neck to a succession of wretched creatures all captives together he lost count of the days they rolled interminably on into spring summer then autumn with windred long dead from hunger thirst and hardship under the lash martin recalled his grief for the old mousewife the closest he had ever come to knowing a mother his stifled tears and the leaden weight of sadness at her loss the reeling of loneliness and desolation without her she had deserved far better a fate than the one she suffered his body began trembling at the thought of the vermin who had caused all of this cruelty badrang the laughing sneering commanding stoat swaggering along wearing the sword he had taken from martin a strength born of builtup rage coursed suddenly through the young mouse he stood erect tugging at his bonds oblivious to the pounding storm as a mighty roar welled up from deep inside him i am a warrior martin son of luke i will live i will not give in and die up here do you hear me badrang i will live to take back my fathers sword and slay you one day badraaaaaaaannggg stormwater filled his mouth rushing winds tore at his face martin son of luke can you hear me a voice called up to him from the shore outside the fortress he could not see the speaker but he heard the voice clearly above the gale yes i hear you what is your name there are two of us my friend grumm trencher the mole and myself laterose daughter of the chieftain urran voh we heard you calling out tell me is there a prisoner in there called brome a young mouse he is my brother martin could feel the storm beating the senses from him he rallied and shouted back i do not know of a mouse called brome and i dont think ill have much chance to i am sentenced to die up here laterose the answer came back in as kindly a tone as the mousemaid could shout under the circumstances laterose is my full title please call me rose my friend and i will do anything possible to help you though we cannot climb up the walls are too sheer and high what can we do is there a message you wish carried to another creature martin shook his head no message i am alone the guards told me that if i live through the night the big sea birds will finish me off in the morning is there any way you can keep them off me rose thought for a moment before answering maybe yes we are not warriors but we can use our slings also i know a trick to drive sea birds away she waited but there was no reply grumm stepped away from the wall out on to the beach shading his eyes against the downpour as he gazed up at the limp figure slumped between the posts yurr eem lost is senses fallen aconshuss ifn you ask oi pore creetur rose joined grumm and together they watched the unconscious form sway slackly as the elements assaulted it the mousemaid chose a hard round pebble and fitted it to her sling we must help him to live we must her lip quivered as she spoke ooh that badrang the cruel cowardly heartless vermin grumm chuckled softly noice wurrds fer a mouseymaid oi must say hurr hurr himn ull live sure nuff iffen ee be arf as illtempurred as ee mizzy dawn came pearly grey shot with shafts of peach and dusky pink as the sun broke the eastern horizon in the wake of the night storm the sea was a dim shade of oily turquoise with creamcrested waves in the middle distance badrang the tyrant had his carved throne chair brought out on to the courtyard where he could watch the fun gurrad the rat and skalrag the fox stood along with two weasels called lumpback and stiffear awaiting orders as the tyrant stoat pointed to martins limp figure with his sword he looks strong enough to have lived through a bit of wind and rain gurrad go and wake the sleeping beauty when hes conscious and wriggling about the birdsll soon spot him gurrad sniggered as he looked up at the circling sea birds that were beginning to mass above the fortress aye lord that lot look in good appetite as usual eh badrang nodded never knew a gannet that wasnt ho there hisk dont send the slaves to the quarry yet parade em out here where they can see the sentence being carried out itll show em what happens to anybeast who puts a paw wrong in my fortress gurrad slapped martin around the face with a wet piece of rag until the young mouse revived he held a beaker of fresh water to the captives lips chuckling as the prisoner drank greedily thats the stuff drink up now mouse those sea birdsll soon be down for breakfast hehee look at em big uns aint they great pointed beaks theyve got good as a knife fer rippin an tearin theyll enjoy n you martin managed to spit the last of the water full into gurrads face the rat backed off spluttering nastily tough eh well i ope they takes yer eyes first chancing a glance upwards martin could see a great gannet preparing to dive two other grey gulls were beginning to swoop low and others rushed to join them in the descent for food his paws were swollen by the wet ropes that held him tightly he struggled wildly shutting his eyes tight after gurrads cruel remark all eyes were on martin now the horrified slaves the gloating horde of badrang the hungry sea birds plus two other pairs rose and grumm were crouched behind a stony outcrop on the beach the young mousemaid watching very carefully as she placed a paw across her throat and took a deep breath the birds wheeled and dived lower towards the struggling figure bound between the posts on the walltop grumm nudged his friend urgently aow do asten an urry mizzy they burds be agoen fpeck marthen to death aowurr oi carnt lukk no moare grumm closed his eyes tight as the sea birds dived for the kill badrang had forgotten to scan the seaward horizon that day preoccupied as he was with martins death sentence a sail appeared two points north on the eastern qrizon it was a great green singlemasted craft practi cally invisible against the sea because of its camouflaged coloring three banks of oars protruded to port and starboard one atop the other giving it the appearance of a monstrous insect crawling over the waves it was badrangs old partner in murder and treachery upon the high seas a stoat like himself capn tramun clogg of the great ship seascarabl clogg was a villainous sight an enormously fat stoat dressed in stained and tawdry silks wearing a massive pair of carved wooden clogs every part of his fur wherever possible was plaited and braided beard eyebrows moustache all over his gargantuan body plaits and braids stuck out of his ragged sleeve frills spilled through rents in his shirt coat and pantaloons even curled over the tops of the oversized clogs he gnawed on a halfdead lobster as he slurped seaweed grog from a flagon belching aloud and spitting shell fragments everywhere throwing back his tousled head he roared up at the lookout a ferret in the crowsnest boggs any shape o land out there yet matey the keeneyed boggs peered into the distance naw capn nary a glimmer o wait aye land ahoy the lobster tail fell from tramun cloggs open mouth to disappear down his open shirt front haharr harr i knowed it where away boggs y ole bilgedog two points south capn aye an there be a liddle lump astickin up either a cliff or some buildin clogg gurgled happily drawing a broad cutlass

their oarstrokes urry now matey with this wind in our sails an a flowin sea well make landfall soon hohohoharrharr wont me ole messmate badrang be pleased ter see is greatuncle clogg agin after all

ill use is skull as me figurehead an feed the rest of im to the fishes only fair aint it growch both pirates burst out laughing at the joke clogg liked a joke but he was joking in deadly earnest this time he hated badrang the sea birds came diving in voraciously at martins unprotected body they were within a hairs breadth of his head when a wild earsplitting screech halfway between a whistle and a cry rent the morning air immediately the scavenging birds swooped away and zoomed high into the air shrilling anxiously and wheeling about willynilly another loud screech followed and the gulls and gannets milled about high above martin some of them bumping into each other in their apparent confusion badrang gaped upwards in amazement whats the matter with em why arent they tearing him apart a further screech followed even louder and more fngrysounding than the former two this time the sea sheared off sharply and dispersed the tyrant stoat was furious what in the name of hellgates is going on a ferret called bluehide who had lived in the far north called out as he scratched his ears in puzzlement thats the huntin cry of a great eagle ive heard it afore gurrad shoved him scornfully garn there aint no great eagles on this coast a small venturesome kittiwake who had just arrived on the scene took a swift dive at martin the screech rang out swift and harsh the frightened kittiwake took off like a sky rocket bluehide shrugged eyeing gurrad in a patronizing manner thats a great eagles huntin cry id stake me oath on it the rat raised his spearbutt threateningly listen addlebrain ive said there aint no gr gurrad stow that gab and get over here the rat broke off his argument with the ferret and scuttled across to badrangs side the tyrant scowled as he glowered at the clear blue sky never mind what it is theres something about thats scaring the sea birds witless well have to tempt them down on to the mouse with a bait they cant resist bring a dead fish from the cookhouse hurriedly the fish was brought to badrang he took his sword and cut the cord holding up the weasel lumpbacks ragged kilt there was a snigger from the slaves as lumpback stood grinning sheepishly with his only garment draped around his footpaws on the ground ignoring the weasels plight badrang tossed the cord to gurrad here tie the fish to this and hang it round the mouses neck thatll bring hungry sea birds in to feed eagle or no eagle from their hiding place on the shore rose scanned the sky it was clear and free of sea birds thank goodness i wont have to do the eagle call again grumm it was beginning to strain my throat hurr hurr the mole chuckled oi be glad too mizzy twere a vurry froightenen sound oi didden loik et one liddle bit hurr no grumm peeked over the rocky outcrop at martin on the walltop mizzy roser earken wot be they villuns adoin to marthen the mousemaid began twirling her loaded sling i dont know but whatever it is well have to stop them gurrad was trying to get the cord noose that held the fish over martins head but the young mouse was ducking and struggling wildly the rat was losing his temper hold still mouse or ill pin this fish tyer with me spearpoint thwack gurrad dropped the fish with an agonized yelp as the slingstone bounced off his paw badrang did not see the stone all he saw was gurrad dropping the fish and hopping about sucking on his paw the tyrant stood up knocking his thronechair backwards as he yelled at the unfortunate rat stop playing the fool an get that fish round his neck before i come up there and batter some sense into you with it as gurrad bent to pick the fish up grumm fitted a sizeable rock into the spoon of his ladle and whipped it off in the direction of the rats bent bottom thwumpl it struck hard and true knocking gurrad from the walltop he plummeted over and landed with a sickening thud in the courtyard below badrang leapt forward sword in paw waving at the creatures around him to the walltop quick somebeasts hurling rocks they piled up the broad wooden ladders on to the walltop rotnose and hisk were ately hit by flying stones crouched massaging an ducked another salvo as he ing at the others where can you see skalrag stood upright deserted shore must be lord first up they were immedihisk fell senseless rotnose aching breastbone badrang went into a halfstoop shoutare the stones coming from peering at the seemingly somebeast hidin out there below at the corner of the courtyard where the slaves were grouped the big squirrel felldoh decided to take part in the action he ducked to the back of the crowd picking up several large pebbles as he went with energy born of anger he chucked a large rough stone at the back of skalrags head many times felldoh had bent under skalrags rod now was the chance to repay the sadistic fox the flying rock did not strike skalrags skull it narrowly missed but took half of his left ear in the process ripping it off as it whizzed by felldoh immediately flung two more stones then keeping his paws at his sides gazed around in amazement as if some other creature were doing the throwing as skalrag screeched in pain stiffear sprang up pointing down into the courtyard as he shouted excitedly the stones are coming from inside our own fortress thwack a stone from the shoreside struck him square in the back rotnose still rubbing his chest sneered at stiffear rubbish theyre coming from the shore i tell yer i was hit meself eeeyowch a stone from the courtyard stung his tail confusion reigned on the walltop badrang and his creatures did not know which side the missiles were coming from the tyrant lay flat and raised his head slightly he could not see the shore clearly but he had an uninterrupted view of the sea his stomach churned suddenly and he began to curse at the sight his sharp eyes rested on one more quick look to ascertain that he was not wrong sent badrang scrambling for the ladder calling hoarsely as he went cut that mouse down from there and bring him with you get down into the fortress quick but sire we think that theres somebeast behind those rocks slinging stones badrang shot a venomous glance at rotnose as he hissed do as i say scumbrain weve more to worry about than a few stones tramun cloggs out there with the seascarab sailing on a direct course for us grumm was running out of good rocks to fit his ladle when rose pointed to the wall look theyve had enough theyre cutting martin loose and retreating into the fortress thank the seasons that we were able to help the poor mouse eh grumm the mole mopped his brow and sat with his back against the rocks of their hideout on the beach in the hot midmorning sunlight yurr boi okey usns serpintly gave they vurmints summat to think abowt oi gave em billyoh wi moi ole ladler hurr hurr rose could not help grinning at her faithful companion so you did grumm that ladle comes in useful for other things than stirring soup with but grumm was not listening facing seaward he was pointing straight out at the seascarab which was drawing closer by the moment lookit mizzy searatters an vurmints oill be bounden a chill of fear ran through the mousemaid corsairs they had seldom visited this coast but the tales of horror and death that surrounded the raiders from the sea were legendary hastily they gathered their few belongings lets not hang about here grumm come on well lie low in the marshes behind the fortress capn tramun clogg was in high villainous humour he cut an awkward jig his clogs clattering noisily on the poopdeck haharrharr i reckernizes that flag flyin oer yon place ashore ho lucky day i knowed it i could feel it in me clogs theres me messmate of bygone seasons badrang built hisself a stone castle pretty as you please ow many pore liddle slaves would

crosstooth lots or crowds why bless yer eart capn crowds that means lots an lots haharrharr well said matey break out the weapons while i lays plans for a reunion party with me ole messmate badrang martin stood swaying on swollen footpaws his arms still bound badrang sat upon his thronechair eyes narrowed as he watched the reprieved prisoner hmm like i said before youre not short of nerve martin hearken to me now i could use a creature like you from beneath hooded eyelids martin watched the tyrant as he spoke the young mouses gorge beginning to rise at the stoats proposal how would you like to be a captain in my horde the best of food slaves to command as you please ill even give you a spear to carry if you swear loyalty to me as your master well whatve you got to say to that young un martin made no reply his paws were deadened by the tight bonds but his rage was aroused and his jaws were strong he launched himself in a flash upon bad rang setting his teeth into the stoats outstretched paw and biting it savagely to the bone the tyrant roared and bellowed in agony as martin was set upon by guards his jaws prised apart with a dagger blade as rods and spearbutts beat furiously at him the young mouse went down on the ground as badrang sprinkled blood about shaking his paw in anguish as he gritted from between clenched teeth youll wish the gannets had got you by the time im finished with you whelp oh dont worry youll die but not fast fraction by fraction until you scream to welcome death take him away and lock him up ill see to him after im rid of clogg inside the courtyard slightly to the left of the main gate was a prison pit dug deep into the ground with a heavy grating on top the cover creaked as it was slid to one side martin was hurled in still with both paws bound to his sides he fell through the darkness and landed with a cushioned thump on something soft there was a grunt and somebeast was helping him upright while another untied his bonds a gruff voice spoke martin well at least youre still alive im felldoh the squirrel the young mouse rubbed his paws grimacing as the blood began circulating properly the squirrel rubbed and patted him until he felt able to move easily again martin recognized him he knew felldoh as a kindred spirit another born rebel who had fallen foul of the vermin regimes justice felldoh what are you doing down here awaiting the tyrants pleasure like you martin that rotten toad stiffear saw me flinging rocks at him while he was on the walltop still you saved my old dad and i did what i could for you matey martin grasped the big squirrels paw in the darkness you are a true friend felldoh thank you they both sat on the hardpacked earth floor there was a movement to martins right and as he tensed a small quiet voice echoed hollowly in the pit what do you suppose badrangs going to do with us martin peered into the dimness whos there felldoh reached out and brought their paws together martin this young feller was here before i arrived meet brome so brome said martin he was younger and smaller than martin and felldoh and his voice sounded tiny and frightened i never did harm to anybeast i was lost and blundering along the shore one night when the sentries on the wall saw me and i was captured and thrown down here did they capture you martin will they keep us down here for ever patting his paw and ruffling his ears goodnaturedly martin reassured the youngster you stick with us brome well get you out of here while i was staked out on the walltop felldoh was throwing rocks from inside and your sister rose chucking them from outside shes out there with a mole named grumm i owe them my life brome grasped martins paw rose and grumm hahaha good old grumm i knew theyd find me with those two out there and you and felldoh in here well escape easily itll be as simple as picking daisies the joy and relief in the young ones voice was so evident that martin felt a wave of sympathy for him nudging felldoh in the darkness martin spoke with a confidence he did not feel aye simple as picking daisies eh felldoh the squirrel was a kindly beast he threw his paws about both of them playing along with martins bravado right lads three warriors like us and extra help from outside hah the only thing badrangll eat for dinner will be our dust when we scoot out of here friends together shortly after that brome fell asleep cushioned between martin and felldoh their eyes now accustomed to the gloom they sat staring at each other easy as picking daisies hmm when was the last time you picked daisies matey a long time ago friend felldoh some of them were pretty tough to pick as i remember but not impossible aye with a little outside help we might stand a chance martin yawned and settled down beside brome sleep first being tied out on a walltop in a storm isnt the most restful place around here well think of something later friend we cant disappoint this young un felldoh sat listening to the soft snores of his companions oh yes lets think of something later he chuckled lightly to himself how to sprout wings and defeat badrang and his horde with outside help from a mole and a mousemaid by my brush why didnt i think of those two good ideas before the ship seascarab rode at anchor in the bay as four longboats were beached above the tideline the pirates had come ashore surrounded by his savage ragtag crew capn tramun clogg strode into fortress marshank badrang had the way lined with heavily armed soldiers they gripped spears tightly scowling at the ill assorted mob from the seascarab with a great clatter of clogs tramun hauled out his cutlass and roared playfully as he made a mock dash at badrangs soldiers they drew back in alarm and clogg winked roguishly at them haharr caught yer nappin there mateys youve all gone soft playin at bein landlubbers ho there frogbit nipwort an you fleabane been a bit o water passed under the keel since we sailed tgether yore lookin plump an prosperous these days swaggering up to the tyrants wooden longhut clogg booted the door anyone ome treceive a pore seadog whos down on his luck the weasel captain hisk swung the door open and announced in a dignified manner enter capn my master awaits your pleasure oh do e now well aint that pretty a searat called oilback sniggered at hisk badrang knew he was playing a dangerous game but slyness and treachery had always been the order of the day between himself and clogg the idea was for neither stoat to show he was afraid of the other and to keep up a pretence of being old friends with this in mind badrang rushed at his former partner hugging him tightly as he dropped into corsair slang well well burn me bilges if it aint capn tramun clogg how are yer ye ole wavedog tramun pounded the others back grinning widely badrang me messmate stripe me but yore lookin fit as a fish an spry as a wasp oh it is good for me ole eyes tsee ye agin me earty look wot ive brought fer you at a signal from clogg two searats upended a cask upon the table they smashed in the head and scooped out two beakers which they presented to the stoats badrang brought the drink swiftly to his mouth halting slyly as clogg took a great gulp of his it flowed down through the pirate stoats chinplaits as he swigged noisily damson wine matey the best on earth an all fer me n you badrang took a drink that was more of a sip than a gulp prime stuff you allus knew a good barrel o drink you rascal clogg released badrang and slumped down in the tyrants thronechair resting his clogged footpaws noisily on the tabletop just like in the ole days eh badrang seated himself on the edge of the table smiling aye just like in the ole days mate ow long is it since we was last tgether dyou reckon clogg took another swig grinning and winking badrang took a sip pursing his lips too long id say tramun its good to see you agin they continued to play the game this time with cloggs paw straying close to his cutlass while badrang toyed with the bone handle of a long skinning dagger i recalls when we was last together you left me stranded on a reef whilst you sailed off wid twoscore slaves half o which was mine by rights now the pirates voice began to carry a menacing undertone badrangs face was the picture of injured innocence me sailed off n left you more the other way round as i recall there was a mighty storm an we were blown off course my vessel was wrecked an the slaves lost all of em when you never turned up to elp me i trekked off overland an ended up in this place in a trice the time for merriment and reminiscence was over clogg hurled his beaker at the wall and stood up aye an lookit you now lord badrang if yer please surrounded by a fine fortress an a passel o slaves ill wager well i wants whats due ter me ive come fer my share badrang leaped up confronting his enemy eye to eye i worked too hard to get what ive made ere clogg yore share is nothin an thats what yll get do yer hear that lads the pirate stoat drew his blade lets show this blackearted swab that we aint ere to beg weve come to take a full complement of slaves to row the seascarab from all three decks with a wild roar cloggs crew unsheathed their weapons and stood ready for slaughter make a move an yer capns a dead un the tyrant made his move like lightning kicking aside cloggs blade he grabbed the stoats plaited beard a dagger appeared in his other paw dangerously close to tramuns throat this blade is poisoned one nick is all it takes hisk the archers have surrounded these quarters lord the weasel captain called from the doorway theyre standin ready with poisoned shafts none of this scum will leave alive clogg held up a paw to his crew wait hold yer rush lads put those carvers up he was still smiling but badrang could sense the animal rage behind cloggs grinning features as the pirate addressed him you win matey though i never thought youd use a dirty trick like poisoned weapons against an ole shipmate put up yore blade ill go peaceful like back to me ship badrang stood at the main gates until every last corsair was out of his fortress the tyrant was satisfied he had outwitted his foe without bloodshed which would have been considerable on both sides if a fight had broken out inside marshank the archers had their shafts trained on clogg as he jabbed a warning paw at his enemy thats twice youve crossed me badrang but the third time ill win im goin but ye can take an oath ill be back so dont rest easy matey one dark night ill slip in when yore least expectin it then ill slit yer gullet take the slaves an burn this fancy place down round yore dead ears thats a promise owing to the heightened tension and upset of the pirates visit it was not until late night that the prisoners were fed armed with a bowl of kitchen scraps and accompanied by gurrad a young male otter named keyla stood dropping the leftovers through the grating to the prisoners below gurrad drew his cloak close against a chill breeze from the sea he wanted to be back by the fire eating roasted fish and drinking the damson wine that clogg had left the rat shoved keyla sharply cmon you stir your stumps its cold out ere keyla shrugged as he sat down on the grating poking scraps between the bars one bit at a time cold sir i think its quite warm out here still you do look a bit drawn and peakish maybe youre coming down with fever fever i aint got no fever the rat shuddered and sniffed gurrad was quite taken aback when the young otter stood up and tucked the cloak more snugly around him you never know sir those searats bring all kinds of illness ashore with them why dont you take yourself indoors by the fire and have a nice beaker of wine ill see to these idiots huh theyre only making things harder for us other slaves behaving the way they do dimwitted fools you run along now sir ill take care of feeding these three gurrad hesitated a moment then shivered as a fresh wind blew around him that seemed to settle the issue listen im getting inside where ill be warmer dont be too long out here and report straight back to the compound guard when youre finished dyou hear keyla threw the rat a smart salute dont you worry sir i need my sleep i wont be long better hurry now your eyes look a bit cloudy to me gurrad needed no further urging he scurried off shivering and rubbing at his eyes convinced he was sickening for fever giggling quietly to himself the otter pressed his face to the grating and called down felldoh are you all right the squirrel stood upon martins shoulders and drew himself up so he was close to the bars keyla my friend listen carefully heres what i want you to do rose and grumm stood on the tideline watching the silvery wake of seascarab as the craft headed out veering on a southerly tack into the open sea yurr miz rose worrm you surpose ee villyuns wanted rose tossed a pebble into the shallows ive no idea grumm but whatever it was they didnt seem too happy leaving here the two companions walked back to the fortress walls to the spot beneath the main gates where rose had conversed with martin the mousemaid looked up at the twin posts with rope ends blowing loosely from it in the night wind i hope martin is all right trust badrang to think up something cruel like that binding a poor creature up there in the middle of a storm grumm held up a paw for silence shush naow roser do ee ear that somebeast asingen keyla had a fine deep voice that carried well rose and grumm listened to his song as it drifted over the walls to them i know a mouse called martin and a young un whos named brome captured by some vermin scouts as he strayed from his home so if youre out there listning ill pause awhile and wait for ive been singing half the night on this side of the gate rose almost wept for joy she was answering in an instant being both a good singer and balladeer grumm grunted softly as she hugged him tight with happiness her clear voice ringing out plaintively on the night breeze my name is rose of noonvale the tribe of urran voh my only brother is called brome and martins name i know were here so we can help them so please friend tell to me what we can do to aid those two and try to set them free immediately a hurried few lines rang out clear in reply a vermin guard approaches quick get yourselves from sight ill try to get back to you this time tomorrow night heeding the warning rose and grumm withdrew swiftly to the rocky outcrop where they had hidden earlier that day fleabane and rotnose the weasels came striding forward and grabbed keyla roughly whats all the singin for otter you aint got nothin to sing about yeah slaves dont sing what were you singin about well you see gurrad thought he had fever keyla explained so he went inside and left me to feed the prisoners when i finished giving them their food i thought id better sing an old otter charm to keep the fortress free from sickness singin charms what a load of ole nonsense fleabane sneered rotnose was superstitious and terrified of sickness no it aint come on otter lets hear you sing it keyla obliged making up the words as he went along o spirit of the seasons who rules the land and sea from crabby claws and runny snouts good spirit keep us free from tummy ache soretail and sniffs from grunge and whisker cramp from wobbly paws and flurgy twin o keep all in this camp hah grunge and wobbly paws rubbish fleabane scoffed aloud and whos ever heard of flurgy twinj keyla looked aghast at the weasel you dont know what flurgy twinj is no and i dont care keyla leaned close to the two guards whispering confidentially i knew a fine big strong hedgehog long ago he laughed at flurgy twinj poor creature he never laughed again the young otter looked so serious that the weasels were taken aback take no notice of fleabane young un hes a fool rotnose apologized in hushed tones you carry on singin yore charms an sing an extra one fer me the two guards carried on their patrol arguing among themselves wobbly paws and grunge i still dont believe it listen you dont scoff at what yer dont know about lookit that mark on yer ear that could be the start of grunge where what mark there that sort of yellow mark on yer left ear cant yer see it loafbrain how cn i see me own ear er does it look serious well it wasnt there at the start of the season i think wed best learn the words of that charm how does it go from flurgy paws and grungy tummy spirit keep us free wobbly whiskers an dah de dah dah de dah yerself boulder bottom theyre not the right words keyla laughed aloud as he made his way back to the compound badrang ordered a wallguard to be posted night and day against the return of tramun clogg he harbored no doubts at all that the pirate would be back doubly bent on revenge and conquest extra guards were put to watch the slaves when they were quarrying stone fishing or tending crops to feed the horde felldohs father barkjon had wheedled himself on to kitchen duty he kept his old eyes and ears open gathering all the information he could in the slave compound at night he discussed it with others since martins open defiance of badrang and felldohs rock throwing a new mood was beginning to make itself felt among the captives keyla barkjon and a hedgehog named hillgorse were a little bolder than the rest they soon became the ringleaders of a rebellious little group that met each night around the compound fire barkjon was a squirrel with a wise old head and everybeast listened when he talked we must do all we can to help felldoh and martin escape and the other little mouse brome if they can make it to freedom i know that they will do all in their power to defeat badrang and free us all felldoh and martin are the only ones ever to defy the tyrant i am certain that if they were on the outside they would not leave us here to rot in captivity there were murmurs of agreement from the creatures that crowded round to listen at the meeting a mouse called purslane who sat with her husband and babe called out tell us what to do barkjon were with you get them extra rations to keep up their strength keyla answered for the old squirrel shellfish or shrimp if youre out with a fishing party crops or fruit if you work in the fields they need to be fit if theyre to escape a female otter named tullgrew spoke up what if you work in the quarry like i do how can i help hinder hamper work as slowly as you can hillgorse answered her if at all able try to steal anything that can be used as a weapon tools sharp rock shards anything they may all be needed someday dont listen to them youll only land us all in trouble barkjon stood up and gazed out over the slaves is that you druwp a surlylooking bankvole who was trying to hide behind others lifted his head yes its me tullgrew grabbed him and stood him upright then dont hide at the back muttering stand up and speak up face to face with others instead of slinking about go on druwp have your say hillgorse nodded towards the bankvole it was clear whose side the bankvole was on when he spoke were slaves and its better to be alive than killed trying to do foolish things badrang and his horde are too strong for us if you start stealing fish and crops and tools well all be punished i dont want to be suffering for the foolishness of others count me out of your plans purslane threw a piece of firewood at druwp shut your snivelling little trap ive seen you hanging around the guards and carrying tales youre a sneak druwp a toady angry murmurs arose from the crowd barkjon held up a paw for order when there was quiet he confronted the bankvole unfortunately we cannot count you out of our plans druwp you are one of us therefore all we do affects you and anything you choose to do must affect us together we can be a stream coursing its way powerful and silent even a small stream can wear away large rocks but separate us and we become as single droplets of water ready to be scattered by the flick of a paw you are either on our side or you are with badrang and his horde druwp lowered his eyes avoiding barkjons gaze i am alone i side with nobeast leave me to live my own life as i see fit barkjon silenced the angry murmurings of the slaves with a growl so be it druwp no creature is forced to join us you may stay alone but let me warn you bankvole if one word of our business reaches badrang and his creatures i will hold you responsible when that happens you will be a deadbeast i promise this druwp slunk out of the crowd to a deserted corner of the compound the silence that followed was eventually broken by keyla oh well if thats all for tonight ill be on my way feeding time for the prisoners you know rose and grumm lay behind the rocks watching fortress marshank helpless and unable to approach the gates because of the two sentries who stood on the walltop keeping a lookout for the return of tramun clogg the mousemaid shook her head despairingly with those two up there we wont be able to communicate with our friend what can we do grumm oi says we sitn toight an wait youm friend be a cleverbeast eell tmnk o summat miz youm see hurr aye inside the fortress keyla was racking his young brains for an idea he poked scraps through the grating as he whispered to the prisoners below theyre guarding the walltop mates its going to be

spread his paws wide appealingly not me sir i havent said a word its these poor wretches in the pit theyre callin to me they say that theyve got the fever and they want to be let out frogbit and

otter listen theyve even upset that eagle bird now get away from there go on get back to the compound youve caused enough mischief around here keyla knew his job was done martin and his friends could

there are three of us in this awful pit the fever the fever as deep as three mice and a bit im goin to die of fever we need the claws of a good old chum the fever the fever i know that you can do it grumm dont let me die of fever there was a moments silence then the call of the eagle screeched out three times rose had received the message a quiet peace fell over the startraced seas the shingled beach and the weary sentries on the walltop the only sound was small waves gently lapping the land as the tide ebbed frogbit unplugged his ears nipwort followed his mates example cwaw aint it lovely an quiet aye i think the eagle bird frightened em inter silence silence wot a lovely word itd sound better if you shut yer gob an gave it a chance rose had written it all down on a smooth rock with a piece of sea coal she read the instructions carefully to grumm face the center of the gates walk twenty paces to the south brome says theres three of them in a pit that is as deep as three and a bit mice so if we or should i say you dig down twice my height then straight tunnel from the twentypace mark sooner or later youll break into the pit at about head height can you do it grumm the mole

ohoohoohurrhurr mizzy doant youm do that et tickles hoohoohurrhurr skalrag the fox watched as badrang tore at a roasted sea bird and drank deeply of the good damson wine that clogg had brought him when the tyrant stoat had eaten and drunk his fill he wiped his mouth daintily on a dockleaf and nodded at skalrag make your report the fox swallowed visibly then spoke moving from paw to paw as he did so badrang had that effect on most creatures his swift mood changes were a byword among the horde lord there are no signs of clogg and his ship the sentries are keeping a sharp eye out day and night the prisoners in the hole have some sort of sickness lord it may be fever bluehide and lumpback are taking stock of the armory everything else is quiet and in order there is nothing more to report badrang poured himself a little more wine fever eh that young mouse brome he mustve brought it in with him pity i was going to have some fun with those three make an example of em still fever is a good enough lesson to the slaves throw the wrongdoers in the pit where theyll catch the fever what a clever idea slaves getting fever from slaves they cant blame us for that eh skalrag hahahaha the fox laughed nervously along with his master badrang suddenly stopped laughing leaving the other to carry on skalrags thin giggle trailed away as the tyrants eyes hardened ive just had another clever idea skalrag if my fortress isnt finished by the end of summer i might just throw a few of my captains in the fever pit to rot thatd liven their ideas up what do you say skalrag could feel his paws beginning to shake uncontrollably a splsplendid idea lord rose waited until the wallguard changed there was a considerable interval when nobeast was on the walltop and she took advantage of this to sneak up to the fortress standing facing the centre of the gate she measured out twenty paces to the south marking the wall with a piece of charcoal she dodged back to the cover of the rocks grumm was waiting for her he nodded over to the x marked on the stones of the fortress wall be that et miz roser she nodded watching him sizing the area up rose trusted grumm to do the job swiftly and silently in all the country there was no stronger digger than her friend the mole scratched the tip of his button nose yurr taint easy but taint ard noither miz youm see they rock oer thurr it was another rocky outcrop similar to the one they were hiding behind rose let grumm explain his plan that thurr rock be on straightline wi thoi marker oill start diggen frum thurr thatwise they vurmin guarders on wall woant see usns an youm kin spread tunnel durt behoind ee rock the plan was perfect it was but the work of a moment to slip from one rock to the other grumm took one last look at the mark on the wall muttering calculations to himself as he squinted at it then he held both his heavy diggmg paw to the earth and recited his goodfortune charm luck to oi an every mole as ever went to dig an ole tunnel gudd for all oim wurth mole be best when diggen urth rose was amazed at his speed and strength grumm went straight down in a shower of pebbles and sand widening as he went the mousemaid sat and waited digging a flat oatcake from their pack she munched it and sipped cold mint tea from a canteen soon grumm called out to her doee jump daown yurr mizzy urry naow without a backward glance she leaped into the hole grumm caught her easily and set her steady she looked up as he rumbled bo urr that be zactly two mousey lengths he was right it was exactly the height of two mice yurr stan on moi ead an climb owt naow roser no sense in youm agettin all durty wot udd yore mama an dad say ifn oi brought youm back all mucked up hoo urr the mousemaid hopped out assisted by grumm and began strewing the rubble from the hole around as he dug steps in the side of it blowing sand from his snout grumm eyed his work nawthin fancy but eell do hurr aye he went straight to tunnelling through the bottom side of the hole in a direct line faster than any two moles in the whole of noonvale skalrag stood at the rear of badrangs longhut trying hard to stop his paws shaking after the interview with the tyrant a bankvole was idly pulling up weeds that grew against the side of the building the fox watched him for a while before calling to him druwp over here the bankvole pretended not to hear but worked his way along until he was close to skalrag the fox looked this way and that making sure he was unobserved as he spoke out of the corner of his mouth well whats happening in the compound matey im not your matey or anybeasts druwp answered without looking up theres lots happening in the compound but itll cost you food and wine to find out skalrag looked at his paws they had steadied somewhat i know that youll find a roast fish and some wine here tonight just under the corner there where it usually is now tell me whats happening druwps voice was lowkeyed and surly im taking a chance doing this if they ever found out theyd kill me for sure so id like a proper whole roast fish none of your table scraps and some of the dark damson wine the corsairs brought when they paid a visit skalrags eyes widened how dyou know they brought damson wine druwp sniffed youd be surprised at what i know well do i get proper food yes yes get on with it skalrag chewed impatiently at a hangclaw right listen close now theres three ringleaders hillgorse the old hedgehog barkjon the squirrel and that young otter called keyla these three are urging all the slaves to steal fish crops and also tools from the quarry sharp stones anything they can make into weapons theres a plan of some sort to free martin felldoh and another mouse from the prison pit keyla has been doing something when he takes the food to the prisoners each night skalrag urged his informer on whats the plan what is keyla doing why do they need weapons still keeping his eyes down druwp shrugged i dont know how they plan to get them out of the pit and im not sure what keylas up to but the general talk is that when theyre free theyll be able to help from outside meanwhile the others are collecting weapons against the day when they get a chance to strike back at badrang and all of you thats all i know ive got to go now skalrag placed a footpaw swiftly on druwps neck holding him still a moment youve done well druwp ill make sure the fish and wine are the best but find out more i need to know more when will i see you again my friend the bankvole struggled loose of skalrags paw and hurried off im not your friend ill be in touch in the gloom of the prison hole young brome was getting very depressed after the initial euphoria of contact with the outside had faded he began to speculate miserably suppose they get caught outside the fortress where will we be then felldoh tried reasoning with him dont be silly brome your sister and that mole arent daft they know what theyre doing the youngster was silent awhile then he started again they might have the directions wrong suppose grumm tunnels the wrong way he could have missed this place by a few lengths just think of it poor old grumm digging and digging and getting nowhere while we sit down here twiddling our paws martin gave brome a light thump on the back here now whats all this gloom an doom for young feller youve already told us that grumm is the champion digger in all the country well let me tell you moles are amongst the most sensible beasts over or under land if your friend grumm is a champion digger why id trust him with my life anyday so would you eh felldoh before the squirrel had a chance to answer a spear blade clanged on the grating above the three friends looked up they could not see clearly but skalrags voice was unmistakable they say youve all got the fever down there how dyou feel sick dizzy sweating not very nice is it felldoh laughed scornfully it doesnt hurt as much as the rock that i hit you with mangenose skalrag banged the grating with his spear angrily ive half a mind to come down there and run you through with my spear but you wont will you because youre terrified of catching fever felldohs answer came back mockingly skalrag thwacked his spear on the grating a few more times youre right squirrel i wont come down but then nothing else will and that means food or water hah we dont feed useless mouths around here nor do we play nursemaid to sick beasts so you can all stay down there until you die and rot the fox swaggered off proud that he had won the argument martin felt a tear from bromes cheek as it damped his paw he threw an arm about the youngster i dont know about rotting but pretty soon hell get a rotten surprise when he finds were gone from here imagine the foxs face brome managed a sniff and a smile haha yes and well be safe in noonvale martin began kicking the side of the pit wall felldoh caught on and joined him their footpaws thudded away at the packed earth wall brome squinted at them in the darkness what are you doing giving your mole friend a little help and guidance hes probably very sensitive to underground noises take no notice of us brome tell us about noonvale where do you live what sort of a place is it are the creatures nice and is the food good go on as they listened martin noticed that bromes heavy mood of sadness disappeared when he talked of his home er let me see what sort of place is noonvale well its a deep glade far in the forests a secret place you might say at dawn the sunlight comes filtering like golden dust through the oaks and sycamores and elms it is quiet you can almost hear the sounds of peace light blue smoke drifts up from the cookhouse fires mingling with the green leaves above soft mosses and dark green grass carpet its slopes and there are flowers columbines foxgloves bluebells wood anemones and ground ivy ferns grow there too sometimes i would lie among them at dawn catching dewdrops on my tongue felldoh blinked back a tear surprised by the young ones eloquence sounds like my kind of place brome what about the creatures there hmm the creatures well theres my sister rose and me our father is urran voh chieftain of noonvale and our mamas name is aryan we live with other creatures who have found noonvale moles squirrels hedgehogs even some otters my father rules the vale he is always very kind but sometimes he can be stern to naughty ones you would like my mama though she is the best cook anywhere martin almost forgot his aching paws as he thumped away at the wall does she cook anything nice she cooks everything nice brome sighed longingly mushroom and chestnut stew wild onion and leek soup spring vegetable pasties nutbread oatfarl wheatcob all piping hot from the ovens she bakes blackberry and apple tarts plum maple pudding elderberry pie with yellow summercream gooseberry preserve scones hot with buttercup spread felldoh massaged his shrunken stomach as he wailed aloud stop stop i cant stand it all that beautiful food mushroom and chestnut stew plum maple pudding oh my aching teeth martin wiped a paw across his dripping mouth brome gave a loud chuckle as he mischievously continued tormenting his hungry friends my father helps the moles and the hedgehogs they brew all our drinks dandelion ale strawberry cordial chestnut brown beer owoooh chestnut brown beer stop you little fiend stop martin and felldoh beat their footpaws harder against the wall grumm backed out of the hole pushing a mound of earth before him rose cleared it away helping the mole out into the late afternoon sun you seem to be making good progress grumm rattling his digging claws against the rock to clean off the loose sandy soil the mole blinked his eyes against the sunlight that oi be miz hurr aye oi be agoin the roight way too bo urr they beasts be abangen loik two drummers at a winter fayre guidin oi straight to em hurr hurr et woant be long naow

to the tunnel murmuring to cover his embarrassment oi baint no deer oi be a mole an doant ee fergit it mizzy a sliver of moon appeared like a slice of lemon rind suspended in the soft starstrewn darkness the tide was at full flood without a wind to drive it small silvertipped waves lapped shyly on the shore gradually devouring the coastland up to the tideline little sound was heard save for the muted splash of muffled oars and the hoarse muttered curses of capn tramun clogg as he urged the four longboats through the dark waters cmon bend yer backs ye bottlenosed bandits yer mightve broken yer mothers earts but ye wont break mine pull me bullies pull cloggs ship was beached around a point south of the headland the wily stoat was planning a surprise attack on marshank the corsairs

arrow protruding from his neck lumpback screamed as the dark shapes hurried towards the fortress walls attack attaaaaaack rose had seen the corsairs first she was about to empty more rubble away when the soft thud of paws on sand reached her ears turning towards the sea the mousemaid could see the four boats on the tideline and a mob of dark shapes scurrying across the shore towards marshank she jumped down into the shaft grumm had dug and held her breath fortunately nobeast saw her they dashed past swiftly intent on reaching the fortress anxiously she crouched at the tunnel entrance murmuring under her breath grumm where are you oh hurry grumm please brome had fallen asleep he lay between martin and felldoh as they slapped their feet wearily against the prison pit wall exhaustion was overcoming them both and they grunted with exertion as they tried to continue cant keep this up any more felldoh how about you martin gasped the squirrel nodded droopingly me too mate the young un could be right maybe his mole friend has tunnelled in the wrong direction suddenly martins frustration boiled over with a wild effort he kicked the wall fiercely shouting between each thud were not going to die down here without warning both his footpaws shot through the side of the wall and a muffled cry rang out from the hole bo urr zurrs old ard tis oi grumm badrang leaped from his bed as gurrad roused him with a panicked squeak lord its clogg an his corsairs theyre attackin throwing on a chainmail vest and grabbing his sword the tyrant pushed his frightened henchrat to one side of course he is addlebrain i wouldnt expect him to do anything else come on are the horde positioned on the walls gurrad scurried along at badrangs side aye lord they were up as soon as the guard shouted a warning good ill be at the main gate send skalrag to me right away moments later skalrag came hurrying down from the walltop sire theyre pressing hard but were holding em off wheres cloggs ship on the tideline or in the bay badrang yelled to the fox above the clash of battlesound theres no sign of it sire they came in longboats badrang pondered a short moment then rapped out orders hell have come in from the south he sailed off that way the ship is probably beached or anchored round the other side of the headland right listen hard now skalrag take ten good archers get oil tinder and flints find cloggs vessel and burn it to ashes with fire arrows leave over the back wall while the thick of the fightings at the front go and dont fail me as skalrag hurried to do his masters bidding the tyrant dashed up the ladder to the walltop and joined the melee arrows whistled through the night from both sides clogg was trying to keep up heavy volleys of shafts and slingstones to make the defenders keep their heads down badrang seemed to be everywhere at once hacking at grapnel ropes hurling boulders and roaring orders dont let them grapplers get ahold slash the ropes push that siege ladder over risk get to the north corner use the big spears and long pikes to stab downward you there take four more and get down into the courtyard reinforce the gates with anything rocks timber sand anything you can lay paws on capn tramun clogg howled aloud at his archers and slingthrowers as he awaited the upsidedown longboat that was being trundled over the beach towards him give em blood an brokenbones ye blacklivered flotsam growch keep those arrows aflyin an make every one count haharr badrang ill soon be wearin yer guts fer garters bring that longboat tme earties well knock on the tyrants door haharrharr the longboats keel was plated with a heavy sheath of copper that culminated in a lump at its prow upside down it made a battering ram twenty or more vermin stood underneath the boat using it as an umbrella against missiles from the walltop tramun clogg joined them heading the operation roaring orders gleefully straight ahead as she goes buckoes pound that ole door to splinters mates charge paws grasped the undersides of the craft tightly as they raced madly across the shore arrows spears and rocks bounced vainly off the plated keel unable to stop the corsairs battering ram striking marshanks gates with tremendous force whump most of the ram crew fell flat under the impact as thick copper plate met door timber with a splintering crash paws atingle from the reverberation they hoisted the boat aloft under cloggs triumphant commands hoho cullies back er off an lets do it again gruzzle dedjaw floater up front ere with me arf a dozen whacks like thatn an we can use yonder gates fer toothpicks at our victory feast nothin can stop wavebeasts such as us mates chaaaaaarge gurrad slashed at a climbing rope with his cutlass feel ing the walltop shudder slightly as the ram struck once more he looked anxiously towards badrang the tyrant had a stack of light javelins at his side and he was throwing them with deadly accuracy snarling with satisfaction each time he was rewarded with the screams of another searat impaled by his good aim pausing momentarily he grabbed a passing ferret tailwart get down below and see that the gates are well shored up with rock and rubble clogg can batter our doors until his whiskers turn grey if theres enough packing behind em hell never break through the battle raged on into the night its infernal din of roaring clangour overriding the hiss and swell of the restless sea brome was last to enter the escape tunnel grumm hauled the young mouse in alongside him gudd to see youm maister you be looken fittern a bumblybee martin and felldoh pounded the moles furry back joyfully well done friend brome was right you are a champion digger grumm wrinkled his nose modestly no moren moi job zurrs you uns get along

three friends crawled on all fours through the darkness felldohs tail touching the tunnel top and brushing down a light drift of sand closing their eyes they pushed forward in the eerie underground silence their bodies quivering with the anticipation of freedom it was the battlenoise and a soft breeze tickling his whiskers that told felldoh they had made it he sneezed and rubbed fine sand from his eyes as rose helped him out up you come treejumper is grumm with you the squirrel rolled to one side as martin pulled him self from the runnel together they hauled young brome out as martin answered hell be along shortly when hes blocked off the hole phwah ive swallowed so much sand ill be spitting it out all season here wash it out with some cold mint tea martin rubbed dust from his eyes and stared at the mousemaid as he accepted the canteen of liquid he was thunderstruck you must be martin he stared silently into the most gentle hazel eyes that ever reflected starlight lost for words as a quiet smile spread over the mousemaids serene features drink up martin your friend and my brother are waiting their turn he took a quick mouthful suddenly finding his voice as he did yurn brosty nose i beg your pardon her laughter was like a summer breeze among bluebells martin took another gulp and cleared his throat sorry you must be rose felldoh grinned as he grabbed the canteen from his friends faltering paws aye she is remember me im felldoh and this other creature is brome your names martin and the beast whose head youre standin on is our rescuer grumm martin hastily shifted his footpaw mumbling an apology as the mole levered himself from the tunnel thankee maister hurr et be gurt n noisy out ere wi they vurmin akillen each other oer yonder suddenly martin became aware of the battlenoise around marshank it shook him out of his daze and he began thinking clearly oh er right well i think our best bet is to put as much distance between ourselves and that lot right away felldoh bristled slightly i cant leave until my father is free im staying martin gripped his friends paw we wont be a bit of help to anybeast if we get killed or captured in the midst of a battle listen felldoh im with you one day well free all the slaves from badrangs clutches but right now were only five too few to stand against the tyrants horde i say we should go to noonvale brome and roses father is a chieftain and surely he will tell his tribe to help us then when we are strong in numbers we can return and defeat badrang and all his vermin wipe them from the face of the land and free our friends what do you say brome shook his head my father urran voh is a creature who goes his own way he will never leave noonvale as for our tribe well they generally do what he tells them to rose spoke up aye brother our father is as stubborn as you thats why the two of you always quarrel but maybe i can persuade mother shed ask him to help you i know she would martin held the squirrels paw tighter what do you say felldoh shall we give it a try there was a moments silence then felldoh nodded im with you if we can raise an army at noonvale then one day ill return to dance on badrangs grave martins eyes shone at the thought of it and ill be dancing with you friend holding the sword that once belonged to my father rose brome and grumm clasped their paws with martin and felldoh over the escape hole well do it friends together capn tramun clogg was beginning to feel discouraged no matter how hard and long he beat at marshanks gates with his battering ram they seemed to hold up gruzzle dedjaw floater and the rest were seated on the shore beneath the upturned boat blowing for breath as they massaged weary paws clogg struck the side of the boat with his cutlass wots the matter yer lilylivered seascum weary already come on now earties up on yer paws an give it one more go shes splinterin i tell yer why a couple more bangs an well be through inter the fortress gruzzle sucked noisily at a skinned paw ahh capn i thought you said one more go arf an hour back an were still chargin those gates like madbeasts clogg cocked a fierce eye at the complaining sea rat yore grizzlin gruzzle always grizzlin now up off those hunkers mate an charge that gate afore i charges you wid this frogsticker he waved his cutlass threateningly there was a knocking on the outside of the boat capn its wetpaw come quick an take a look out ere the boat was lifted and clogg poked his head from underneath lookit wot mate the ferret pointed to reddyorange glow illuminating the sky beyond the headland it took a moment for realization to sink in then the pirate stoat let out an agonized wail and began tearing at his braided beard the clumsy wooden clogs clicking together as he performed an anguished jig on the shore whaaaagh the slimecoated villains burnin me ship yarrggh me luvverly seascarab pride o me eart badrang yer rotten foulnosed worm stinkin screwtailed stoat warpeyed snottysnouted shark the corsair crew looked on in dismay as their capn gave full vent to his spleen hurling himself at the gates he hacked with his cutlass kicked with his clogs even gnawed savagely at the woodwork with his teeth as he yelled between mouthfuls of splinters ill rip yer liver n lights out an feed em to the crabs ill cut offn yer ead an throw it in yer face ill string up yer tripes fer riggin ill pickle yer tail in burnin brine ill ill yaaahaaagh skalrag and his archers stood pawdeep in the sea the water scarlet and gold with reflections from the blazing vessel they blinked as ashcloth from the sail drifted sootily by on the breeze the seascarab was settling down in flames on the shallow bay bed and timbers crackled as blazing pitch bubbled from seams two rats who had been left on watch were draped limply in death over the gunwales blazing arrows extinguishing themselves in their backs with its great green sail burned away the mast stood like a fiery beacon against the starstudded night it cracked and broke falling in an avalanche of sparks the vessel heeled over listing at a crazy angle as sea water met flames with a loud steaming hiss skalrag turned to his archers satisfied theres one ship that wont put out to sea again form up and follow me well take care of those longboats before we head back to marshank the wily fox did not want to attract attention from the battle area by burning the longboats put up those bows use your swords an knives to hole these boats thatll leave clogg trapped on the shore unaware that the longboats were being destroyed martin and his companions were heading for them figuring to take one and sail further up the coast where they would leave the boat and travel to noonvale for help felldoh looked to the fiery glow beyond the headland wed better hurry those searats will be coming for the longboats to see if they can save their ship martin glanced back towards the fortress as he remarked to his friend good guess felldoh theres a whole bunch of them coming this way the dark shapes of yelling corsairs could be seen leaving the fray and making for the longboats martin grasped bromes paw lets put a move on otherwise theyll catch up with us grumm had been looking ahead towards the boats hurr lookit thurr be other vurmin by they boats an they see usns he groaned in dismay felldoh gritted his teeth foebeasts behind an before us martin either way is trouble martin sized the situation up quickly we cant turn back now theres less of em in front of us keep going well have to chance rushing them rose take grumm and brome pick out a boat and get going felldoh and i will hold them off please dont argue just do as i say right felldoh the big squirrel nodded right i recognize that halfeared rogue at the boats its skalrag theres about ten with him lets get at it martin the young mouse and the squirrel dashed towards skalrags group yelling at the top of their voices freedom chaaaaaaaarge skalrag was not sure whether the swiftly advancing pair were armed though he knew by their warlike cries that they intended doing battle the fox hesitated a moment unsure whether to meet them sword in paw or go for his bow he lost the initiative barely having time to shout a warning to his archers before martin and felldoh were on him the squirrel grabbed skalrags sword paw struggling to get hold of the blade as martin dealt the nearest rat a flying kick with both footpaws help me help skalrag was screaming now some of cloggs creatures spotted the activity by the longboats they unsheathed their weapons and dashed forward to protect their boats two rats went down under the hefty digging claws of grumm and a hearty wallop from a chunk of driftwood held by rose brome began shoving the smallest of the boats out into the surf and grumm and rose lent their weight to his efforts martin was holding on to one rat who was trying to stop the boat while he held the head of another under the water felldoh had a stranglehold on skalrag whose sword belt had snapped both sword and belt were lost somewhere in the shallows the corsairs came charging in yelling surf splashing beneath their paws rose leaned over the stern of the small boat pulling brome in while grumm found the oars she began shouting martin felldoh over here quickly thinking swiftly martin stunned a sea rat with a heavy blow grabbing a halfthrottled skalrag from felldoh he thrust the fox at the corsairs here mates one of badrangs lot tryin to steal our boats with a concerted howl of rage the corsairs threw themselves upon skalrag and another rat felldoh pushed towards them martin nudged his friend whispering urgently quick into the boat half wading half swimming through the nightdark waters they made for the boat grumm and brome held oars over the stern to them burr asten zurrs as they grabbed the oars and began climbing aboard the corsairs suddenly realized what was going on those aint searats stop em the ferret called boggs yelled hoarsely martin scrambled into the boat but felldoh was having a hard time with his huge bushy tail weighed down by sea water the rat called growch floundered forward and seized the squirrels footpaws from the boat martin managed to grab felldoh by his other two paws then another searat latched on to felldohs tail and a tug of war began felldoh was stretched between water and boat helpless his mouth filled with salt water rose leaned over the stern wielding an oar thonkf boff she stunned the rats with two direct hits martin heaved mightily and felldoh came tumbling into the boat while some of the corsairs held skalrag and his platoon prisoner the rest jumped into the boats and began rowing after the escapers row martin cried out to his friends paddle with your paws anything hurry theyre coming after us grumm sat in the stern not moving rose looked at him curiously come on grumm paddle dont just sit there the mole shrugged unhappily oi carnt move mizzy iffen oi do usll sink oi be setten roight on a gurt ole in ee boat the mole sat completely soaked blocking the hole as best he could with water swilling around the bottom of the boat brome started to laugh felldoh eyed him disapprovingly i cant see much to laugh about young un its not a very funny situation were in brome held his sides as he tried to paddle and stop laughing at the same time whooheehee im sorry felldoh cant help it heeheehee oh dearie me look at those creatures hahahahahaha the two boats loaded with corsairs that were following were only going one way down rose joined in with bromes laughter of course thats what badrangs creatures were doing holing the boats after theyd set fire to the big ship lucky old us we picked the one with the smallest hole in it the corsairs faces were a picture of abject misery as they baled furiously while the boats filled up and sank beneath them they floated about treading water and watching the small craft low in the water but going strong head straight out to sea a joyous shout rang out across the choppy night waves as the little boat pulled away freeeeeeeeeeeeee dawn brought with it a lull in the battle at fortress marshank the weather was humid and a heavy grey sky hung like a pall with greenish purple tinges out on the horizon badrang stood with gurrad on the walltop his battleweary horde ranged along the ramparts dulleyed as they ate breakfast and catnapped at their positions the tyrant stoat noted with grim satisfaction that he had successfully defended marshank against the corsair invasion but clogg was a resourceful enemy what would his next move be oilylooking plumes of smoke rose into the still air from the cooking fires of the corsairs on the shore the pirates were in surly mood not only had they failed to breach the gates of the fortress but they had also suffered the indignity of having their ship gutted by fire and sunk capn tramun clogg and several of his messmates were holding an interrogation session behind a semicircular rocky outcrop close to the tideline the unfortunate skalrag and six of his remaining archers were the prisoners they were questioning they huddled together on the beach cruelly bound paw and muzzle with tough dried kelp strands skalrag stifled a terrified whimper as he stared wideeyed at the ruthless faces of the searats and the vicious twinkle in the eyes of clogg the pirate stoat drew his cutlass grinning evilly as he licked the blade and squinted along it towards the quaking fox harr tell me skalrag what would you do to anybeast who set fire to yore ship an scuttled er skalrags muzzle was tightly bound the most he could manage was a strangled sob clogg swung the cutlass at the petrified foxs head it clipped several whiskers and neatly severed the gag skalrag fainted clean away in a heap the corsairs laughed uproariously as they doused him with sea water to bring him round tramun clogg put the point of his cutlass to skalrags nosetip i wouldnt chop yer ead off bucko ho no thatd be too quick fer the likes o you avast mates tell this scum wot we do t ship burners an scuttlers the corsairs tickled skalrag with their knifepoints as they told him string im upside down in a crab pool roast im oer a slow fire chop off is paws an make im eat em use im fer a batterin ram agin the fortress gates oh no please capn skalrag wailed in despair dont let them do it i was only carrying out badrangs orders clogg sat by the fox and stroked his head soothingly there there now matey dry yore eyes an dont blubber no more ole tramun cloggs got an eart soft as swansdown i wont let nobeast kill yer but earken now y must swear on yer oath that youll do exactly as i tell yer skalrag nodded vigorously i will capn i will i swear on my oath as a fox tramun chuckled as he patted the foxs cheek tenderly of course yer will matey cos if yer dont the things my crew threatened to do to yer would be as nothin to wot id do when i caught up with ye lissen now eres wot youll do what about them skalrag nodded towards his six bound comrades tramun winked broadly oh dont fret yore eart over that lot worms like thatd be too much trouble as galley slaves theyll be fishbait afore nightfall mate skalrags former archers gave a muted moan of anguish the slave compound was a circular palisade of upright logs driven into the ground and bound together by ropes it had a single gate which was generally kept locked inside the occupants shifted as best as they could for themselves most slept on their sack mattresses against the walls some underneath a rough wooden awning that shaded part of the structure at night the slaves were allowed a fire in the center of the dirt floor keyla and the rest of the slaves had been on barricade duty all night piling rubble and rocks against the gates to reinforce them against the battering ram now they sat locked inside the slave compound relieved of quarry and field labors while marshank was under siege old barkjon shook his head its a bad business if badrang wins well still be slaves here however if the victory goes to the corsairs well all end up as galley slaves after weve been forced to refloat their vessel or build a new ship slavery is bad enough but the life of a galley slave is worse than death amid the troubled muttering that followed keyla came forward thats the bad news now heres some of the good before we were herded back in here at dawn i checked the prison pit there was nobeast inside martin felldoh and brome have escaped theyre free barkjons chin quivered a little as he patted keylas paw that is good news indeed my son felldoh a free creature hell bring help to us youll see aye and martin too hillgorse the old hedgehog chimed in hes a tough one that young mouse hell see that we get help of some sort the slaves nodded agreement one or two of them even emitting low cheers barkjon silenced them with a wave of his paw keyla was there something else you wanted to say the young otter held a piece of sacking it clinked as he strode about speaking in a low clear voice all very good but what are we doing to help ourselves its no use just sitting here on our tails making fine speeches and waiting for others to do something look he flung the sacking open and weapons clattered to the ground three knives a spearhead and four slings i collected them from dead vermin while we were working through the battle last night theres a start to our armory purslane a mother mouse stepped forward carrying her infant she took an axehead and a broken swordblade from inside the little ones shawl and added them to keylas weapons i managed to get these its not much but its a start others started to come forward and add their contributions this daggers got no handle but its sharp heres the top from a long pike it only needs a pole i got a whip and these two arrows the bow was too big to carry pouchful of slingstones a sling and this iron hook a hedgehog little more than a baby tottered out and threw his offering on the small pile of armaments dagga an stones to fro the otter called tullgrew began gathering them up well done wed best hide these until the right time comes along ill bury them in the earth underneath my pallet hillgorse nodded approvingly good work remember now stick together help each other steal anything you can from badrangs creatures each day my friends we will become stronger more determined only our bodies are held in slavery our minds and hearts are free the meeting ended tullgrew began burying the weapons druwp the bankvole pretended to be sleeping but he was noting through halfclosed eyes the spot where tullgrew was digging slavebeasts snuffled and moaned in their slumbers the fire burned low in the crowded compound and stars in the soft dark sky looked down on the misery of the wretched creatures below as they slept all save two keyla was still watching druwp dawn light found the small boat had been carried far out by the ebbing tide it bobbed about on the heaving grey waves like a leaf in a storm felldoh martin and brome baled with paws and oarblades trying to splash the water over the sides they were fighting a losing battle rose stood in the stern straining her eyes for a sight of land all she could see were mountainous greygreen waves wherever she looked grumm sat miserably blocking the leak with his bottom baling with his little ladle as the boat settled ever lower in the water burr oi cant swim et be a shame t finish up drownded something struck the side of the boat causing the timbers to creak brome looked up from his baling i hope that was a rock or something floating by id hate to think it was a big fish rose peered down into the water her eyes went wide with shock she looked up pretending to scan the horizon her brother shook his head cmon rosie you cant fool me i saw you gaping into the water whats down there its a big fish roses voice was little more than a whisper they stopped baling felldoh chuckled halfheartedly big enough for us to catch and eat rose shook her head the other way round friend its big enough to catch and eat us there was another thump against the boats side grumm sat tight staring uncomfortably at the sky burr oi ates t think omoi pore bottom apoken through ee bowt wi a gurt fisher swimmen under oi the fish struck again this time it fractured the planking and sea water squirted in as the boat settled lower martin grabbed an oar this will make a good float felldoh you and brome hang on to that other oar ill take this one with rose and grumm if we get separated well meet up at noonvale look out here we go the boat filled up sea water rushing in over the sides as it dropped from beneath them plummeting into the depths below in an instant they were all in the sea struggling and kicking out as they held on to the oars submerging his head martin gazed down into the depths he could dimly make out the gigantic shape of some deepsea fish as it chased the sinking craft into the greeny depths as he pulled his head from the waters rose was shouting brome felldoh over here can you reach us the young mouse and the squirrel were being swept away on the crest of a big roller while martins oar was being pushed under weighted as it was by three creatures instantly martin released his hold on the oar it bobbed up and began travelling away from him on the waves and he struck out after it rose paddled madly turning the oar so it would drift nearer to martin grumm helped as much as he could calling out marthen swim oer ere see iffen youm can catch a hold o moi paw painfully martin came fractionally nearer his friends on the oar rose kicked back with all her might to hold the oar from being swept off and grumm stretched himself full length in the water the sun began breaking through the windswept grey cloud masses bringing with it a heavy summer rain slashing and hammering on to the face of the deeps half blinded and spitting sea water martin felt his outstretched paw come in contact with grumms footpaw he clung on furiously for dear life as rose cried out hang there martin just tread water itll relieve the weight on this paddle when im tired ill change places with you rose kicked out with the waves sending the oar skimming along through the rainwashed sea felldoh had his mouth open to the sky trying to drink in some rainwater brome had heaved himself up on the oar anxiously he scanned the sunny stormswept wastes theres no sign of em the waves are too high before felldoh had a chance to reply the water beneath them heaved and they were both lifted high into the air the big fish had hauled the sinking boat around like an empty peapod it had found something to play with its huge body buffeted and banged the boat about felldoh was still holding on to the oar as the fish temporarily lost interest in the boat and charged at the oar the squirrel saw the wide mouth gaping through the water rows of pointed white teeth and a cavernous pink interior whooshed through the sea towards him felldoh let go of the oar and submerged he felt a thump on his back as the giant creature seized the oar and made off with it frolicking and leaping sometimes half its own length above the surface suddenly it dived and was gone the hull of the upturned boat struck his head as brome leaned over and seized his ears gotcha matey scrambling and kicking felldoh managed to haul himself on to the upturned keel where brome was clinging with all paws whew that was a close call still fair exchange is no robbery the fish can have the oar well keep the boat felldoh wiped dashing rain from his eyes lets hope that monster doesnt feel playful again and come back for the boat after hes chewed our oar up hang on to my tail and steady me young un im going to take a look around for the others with brome clinging to his tail felldoh stood gingerly and surveyed the stormy scene sunlight shafted down through the cloud masses which were showing areas of bright blue sky between them the wind whipped the wavetops into white foam sending massive rollers combing across the main any sign of em felldoh shaded his eyes from the rain with a paw not a glimpse but theres a dark splotch on the horizon that must mean land it must be floodtide were headed straight for it brome was not sure whether it was rain or tears in his eyes thank the seasons for that i wouldnt become a seafarer at any price leave the water to the fishes i say the morning wore on but the rain showed no signs of abating grumm clung to the oar half asleep with rose hanging on to his footpaw martin paddled doggedly on pushing the oar in front of him his body numbed from the cold of the sea and the driving rain the sun was now coloring the sea in glorious tints rose stared at it through saltrimmed eyes lost in its beauty for a moment until martins voice cut into her reverie the sun sets in the west doesnt it rose nodded hmm suppose it does martins voice became suddenly hoarse with excite ment this is the eastern sea if it were morning the sun would rise on its horizon dont you see what that means rose im too tired to work it out martin tell me what it means it means that we have to face inland to see the sun in the afternoon so if we can see the sun in front of us now we are travelling towards land rose came fully awake hauling herself up on grumms back she gave a loud yell land it was still distant but it was definitely land dark cliffs showed against the sky she patted her mole friends wet back heartily land grumm its land ahead oi woant berleev et until these yurr diggen claws cn scrape it mizzy an then iffen et be so thiz yurr beast woant never even be caught drinken water agin never moind aswimmen in et martin found renewed strength and kicked out harder towards firm ground o hisk the weasel captain watched the bankvole rummaging about near badrangs longhouse sneaking silently up he pressed a dagger against the unsuspecting creatures back be

torture rack extracting information from him brome and felldoh got on all fours and kissed the damp sands several times it was sweet to be on land whether damp or dry the squirrel took stock of their position i know exactly where we are brome you see all this charcoal on the tideline bromes paws crunched on the stuff as he bent in the darkness and picked up a piece hmm its burnt wood half waterlogged wonder where its from felldoh pointed out into the bay right there mate where the corsair ship burned and sank over yon hills lies fortress marshank so wed best go quietly brome grasped felldohs paw firmly where you go i go mate by the way where are we going to noonvale eventually but first we must look for our friends well find somewhere to hide up for a bit and dry out then well see if we can lay our paws on some food we cant do a thing until its light except rest and eat they walked south across the beach towards the cliffs brome chattered incessantly rest and eat that sounds like a good idea ill bet an acorn to an eggshell thats exactly what rose and martin are doing right now lying back and feeding their faces grummll be doing the cooking next to my mama hes the best cook in noonvale once he starts stirring stew or soup with that little ladle he always carries mmmm it smells so good why ill even bet that hes found so hush brome whats that sound the squirrel had clamped a swift paw across his garrulous young friends mouth both creatures stood stock still listening the sound carried on the night breeze instruments were playing and somebeast was singing brome pointed to a faint glow emanating from a crevice in the cliff face when they were closer the friends both bellied down and crawled the rest of the way cautiously it was a type of leanto tent erected between a twowheeled wagon and some rocks a fire glimmered throwing the creatures inside into grotesque silhouetted shadows against the canvas brome and felldoh lay in the darkness listening to the song oh were the rambling rosehip players and we please both old and young oer field serene and forest green our praises have been sung were the rambling rosehip players and well take on any part bring a tear to your eye to make you cry or joy to the saddest heart though the road be tough and the patch run rough and weather be cold or grey with a smile and a song well travel along on our rambling rosehip way hey a heavy voice boomed out as the song finished no no ballaw youre supposed to catch celandine as the last line is sung you did it far too early and she wasnt there to take the fan from gauchee its not good enough lets try it again from the beginning one two ooooh were the ram ballaw will you stop eating that pastie and take up your position here give me that confounded thing youve had quite enough a halfeaten mushroom pastie was flung from the leanto and struck felldoh squarely between his ears the pastie was followed by a hare who dived on it jumping on felldohs head in the process bad form that chuckin a chaps supper about rowan hey there theres a bally squirrel here tryin to use me pastie as a hat confusion followed brome leaped on the hare trying to wrest him off felldoh the squirrel was hanging gamely on to the hares whiskers trying to avoid the long flailing legs mice a mole and two squirrels came pouring out of the leanto tripping and falling into the confusion of paws legs ears and tails pandemonium reigned as the jumble of creatures squeaked grunted and howled felldoh was a seasoned fighter scrambling from under the others he climbed to the top of the heap about to set his teeth into the tail of whoever was headlocking brome here whats all this about come out of it this instant felldoh was swung aloft by a massive paw to find himself staring into the stern dark eyes of a big old female badger she growled fiercely at him clamp those lips and put those teeth out of sight otherwise ill do a bit of biting and ive got bigger teeth than you with her other paw the badger cuffed out sending creatures rolling this way and that catching sight of brome she hoisted him high off the ground in her other paw and shook him behave yourself you little wretch whats your names both of you and whatre you doing hanging around our camp felldoh reached between his ears disentangling a bit of pastie he tasted it and nodded approvingly hmm mushroom pastie wait dont tell me its been fried with spring onion gravy very nice the hare picked up the remains of the pastie from the ground wiping it off he ate it speaking through mouthfuls if y wanted some of our tucker old lad you should knock on the wagon an ask politely wot stead of sneakin round brome waggled his paws indignantly from his position in the air we werent sneaking around we saw your firelight and heard you singing so we came over to investigate oh by the way im brome only son of urran voh and this is felldoh late of marshank hello the badger set them gently down as the hare made a very elegant leg pleased t meetcher im sure allow me to introduce us we sirs are the rambling rosehip players i am ballaw de quincewold actor and tragedian my large friend here is rowanoak she

sir my backbone was just talking to my stomach about food they tend to stick together when im hungry the hare nodded admiringly his floppy ears waving to and fro well said young feller a creature of infinite jest wot inside the leanto it was snug and warm after the stiff night breeze on the shore the rambling rosehip company were kindness itself to felldoh and brome they were given cloths to dry off their seadamped fur as they sat round the fire sipping carrot and celery broth from scallop shells rowanoak brought out two tunics similar to the ones the rest of the rosehips wore quartered gold and crimson with a green border and black tie belt here youd best put these on though ill have to let yours out a touch when i have time felldoh youre quite a sturdy sort for a squirrel celandine stroked felldohs strong bushy tail hmm ill say you are felldoh coughed nervously and accepted a hot mushroom pastie from buckler the friendly mole passed brome a sizeable wedge of pie yurr maister

try and stop me gauchee ballaw picked up a small harecordion and tuned it good f you young feller dyou know the bobble o riddle song brome winked you play it and ill sing it ballaw played the introduction and brome began singing with rowanoak providing a fine baritone harmony line it was so catchy that the entire company even felldoh clapped their paws in time with the lively melody bobble o bobble o bobble o if you know tell me where i do grow high above the lowly earth and yet i flourish for all im worth bobble o bobble o bobble o tell me now if you think you know i hang between the earth and sky green or brown as the seasons pass by as around me all the birds do fly and just before winter away go i bobble o bobble o bobble oohhhh tell me true id like you to try there was long applause and brome had his back patted so heartily it began to ache excellent top hole young un youm gorra foin voice zurr broom oh it was the best ive ever heard you never missed a beat well done i wish we had a tenor who could sing half as good felldoh scratched his head what was it brome took a bite of his pie what was what the thing in the riddle song green brown growing in the sky and then flying away before winter with the birds what was it ballaw nodded towards brome thats for the singer to tell old lad brome winked at felldoh what else could it be but a leaf rowanoak sat down between the two friends now tell me about yourselves where are you from and how did you come to this place outside the wind whistled across the bleak northeast sea the rain had stopped and a quartermoon showed between the scudding night cloud formations throwing down a moving pattern of dark and silver across the shore snug in the crevice of the lowering cliffs the company crouched in their makeshift tent inside the leanto felldoh and brome sat around the fire eating and drinking as they related their story to the newfound friends they had made the rambling rosehip players when the rain stopped martin felt his footpaws touching solid ground beneath the water he stood upright with the sea lapping his neck shaking rose and grumm who had both fallen asleep land weve made it help me push this oar ashore hardly feeling the wood of the paddle their bodies numbed from constant immersion in cold sea water the three friends crawled out onto a sandy beach situated at the foot of high dark cliff formations they sat on the sand shivering and hungry their teeth chattering and paws trembling uncontrollably through saltbleared eyes grumm peered up at the cliffs wunner wot be up thurr martin rose stiffly massaging his limbs some small cave where we can shelter for the night i hope do you two want to rest here while i take a look rose and grumm staggered on to their paws i dont like it here grumm and i will go with you burr aye tis creepy rounden yurr the rocks were dark and slippery from the rain martin went in front with rose bringing up the rear they kept grumm in the middle as he was not a very good climber moles seldom are holding the paddle between them they strove upwards scrabbling and sometimes sliding back in the darkness after what seemed an eternity of grappling with the wet cliff face they rested on a narrow ledge the three friends sat catching their second wind listening to the tide far below as it surged and hissed along the nightcloaked shore martin peered upwards i think if we climb a little further there is a much broader ledge above us theres bound to be some sort of cave or crevice where we can shelter carnt oi stay yurr grumm sighed wearily moi pesky ole paws be gone asleeping on oi rose rubbed her molefriends paws vigorously poor grumm champion diggers cant be champion climbers too not far to go now and you can have a good sleep ill get breakfast tomorrow so you can have a little extra liein this offer perked grumm up no end burr thankee koindly miz roser youm a guddbeast martin gave an involuntary shiver theres something about this place i dont like still this is where we landed up and beggars cant be choosers come on all three had their paws on the rim of the ledge after a short hard climb when the nets came hurling down and enveloped them tough closewoven meshes of kelp weighted down all around with stones the friends were swept from the rock face and held dangling their paws tails and heads entangled in the snaring nets tiny dark shapes masses of them jibbered and pranced on the broad ledge as they hauled their catch swiftly upwards it was over in a flash martin rose and grumm were landed like fishes and swiftly clubbed into unconsciousness swimming up through dark mists martins head lanced with pain as he opened his eyes in bright sunlight a stick prodded him sharply in the back biggamouse wake up muggamug plennygood catchim the young mouse opened his eyes fully and saw he was boxed inside a stout wooden cage tiny mouselike creatures with long wiggling snouts surrounded the cage they danced up and down with excitement one more venturesome than the rest darted forward and jabbed martins paw with a sharpened stick gotcha gotcha biggamouse higgig notso bigganow the young mouse reacted speedily with a swipe he snapped the stick baring his teeth savagely as he gripped the wooden bars gerroutofit you jibbering little idiots and leave me alone he shouted so loudly that the tiny creatures scattered like chaff before the wind clapping paws over their ears martin glared through the cage at them growling fiercely keep your distance or ill eat you all he clashed his teeth several times sending fresh pain waves through his throbbing head rubbing a sizeable bump on the back of his skull martin looked around and took stock of his position his cage was in the entrance to a large cave on the opposite wall he could see two other wooden cages in which the senseless forms of rose and grumm lay more of the tiny creatures passed giving him a wide berth they were carrying several fish which had been lashed to driftwood poles smelts shannies and butterfish they had brought up from the shore behind them carrying nets and fishing gear came a hedgehog his footpaws had been bound to a heavy log that he was forced to tow in his wake martin shook the cage bars calling to him hey what is this place and who are all these little wretches the hedgehog gave martin a quick smile and a friendly wink im pallum be still ill get back to you he was urged on by more little creatures following up the rear urryurry pinpiggy mouthashut as they passed into the recesses of the cave grumm stirred burr oo moi pore ole ead et be bumpen an abangen orfully the sound of the moles voice seemed to waken rose immediately she was up on her paws and despite her aching head she battered and tugged at the bars of her cage let me out of here this instant dyou hear let me out grumm held paws over his ears hurr doant ee make such a gurt noise mizzy youm urtin moi brains martin was relieved his friend had suffered no permanent damage grumms right rose best lie still how do you feel the mousemaid managed a wan smile apart from being caged up with an ache in my head and a bump like a thrushs egg plus a raging thirst and an empty stomach i feel fine how are you this morning martin grinned wryly actually i feel pretty silly wait until you see the beasts who did this to us as if on cue several of the tiny creatures materialized out of the dimness at the rear of the cave grumm nodded pigmy shrews oi moight ave knowed pigmy shrews martin echoed the name questioningly the hedgehog came lumbering up to them surrounded by pigmy shrews they chattered ceaselessly in their odd dialect some of them sitting impudently on the hedgehogs towing log their ride adding to the burden he dragged along it did not seem to bother him unduly he smiled in a foolish disarming way hello there its me pallum listen never look angry in front of pigmy shrews smile all the time it confuses them martin pasted a large grin on his face as he introduced himself and his friends the shrews were never still hopping jumping dancing and gabbling on in an unintelligible manner the one who had jabbed martin with a stick began to do it once more the young mouse dodged this way and that to avoid the sharp wood grinning furiously as he spoke from between clenched teeth pallum let me tell you something friend in a moment im going to grab that stick and stuff it up that little wretchs long squiggly excuse for a nose pallum shook his head smilingly itd be the worst days work you ever did martin these are babies squidjees is their

little snips best way to stop em is to encourage them theyll always do the opposite to what you want specially this one rose wiped a paw across her parched lips pallum is there any chance of us getting some food and water a tiny drum sounded from within the cave pallum held up a paw thatll be the queen amballa when you speak to her bow your head and call her ballamum be very respectful shes vindictive and all powerful round here dont mention the word higgig that means you are laughing and she might think you were laughing at her please do as i say and leave the rest to me amballa was a plump little figure she wore golden pantaloons and a cloak of light blue on her head was a coronet studded with bright shell pieces and small polished beach pebbles a seagull feather stuck up at the back of it had she not been such an important personage the three friends would have burst out laughing at the comical sight she made drawing herself up to the peak of her minuscule height she pointed a tiny sword at martin biggarnouse you what namesay o ballamum i am martin the young mouse bowed his head speaking respectfully that other mouse is called rose and the mole is grumm we mean no harm to

hooligans i think i would have preferred death rose giggled oh come on martin you love them really especially little dinjer at the mention of the villainous infant martin clenched his paws oh yes i

grumm spent the remainder of the afternoon towing gangs of squidjees around the tiny beasts sat on the wooden hobbles singing and laughing uproariously as they urged their transports on to greater speeds rose had been detailed with pallum into cleaning up the little ones sleeping area and making beds martin and his friends picked up much of the pigmy shrews language during the course of the day it was relatively simple when they realized that the highbeast tribe spoke by running words together in pairs sometimes in threes toward evening martin and grumm supervised squidjee suppertime the mole wiped wild oat porridge from between his ears where a bowl had been upturned burr theym squinjers serpintly be woild liddle villyuns iffen oi ad moi ladle to paw why oid tan a few tails oi tell youm the squidjees who could not understand a single word of mole talk chuckled madly as they squirted strawberry cordial from their mouths at the mole martin sighed the fixed smile on his face beginning to hurt theyve got the table manners of a wolfpack great seasons look at the way they waste food and mess it about pallum and rose appeared smiling dutifully comecome sleepytime squidjeebabes sleepytime this was the signal for a mass escape the infant pigmy shrews fled squealing to hide wanting the captives to chase them higgigig catchus chaseymouse pallum knew all the hiding places from long experience as they gathered the little ones up for bed martin noticed amballa and several of the other pigmy shrews watching them carefully lest they became roughpawed or spoke harshly to the babes squidjees were almost revered in the highbeast tribe the tiny beasts ran wild over the newly made beds flinging the covers about and trampling pillows what do we have to do to make these rogues sleep pallum martin groaned singasong instantly the squidjees flung themselves flat on their beds straightening the covers about them and plumping pillows as they called out singasong wewanna singasong pallum immediately began singing go to sleep you filthy bunch id love to lay you all out with a punch howd you win a mothers heart with a squiggly trunk like an eels back part is that awful smell the reason you havent been washed all season so go to sleep in your scruffy beds may nightmares enter your beastly heads and when sunlight heralds the new daybreak may you wake with tummy ache strangely the squidjees were half asleep smiling and yawning they mumbled verynice verynice singamore stifling a chuckle grumm took over with his deep soothing bass youm a dreadful orrible crew an oi wuddent give to you supper nor dinner brekfis nor tea oid spank the dayloights out of ee an oid make ee wash ten toimes each day til youm bad manners wurr scrubbed away tiny snores announced that the squidjees were all asleep rose mopped her brow with relief whew thank the seasons the little monsters are finished for the day small wonder their mothers dont look after them pallum pointed to some spare mattresses in the corner all right you can stop smiling now and get some rest lie there and relax ill go and get some supper for us i think i saw a big mixed fruit pudding with cream and some new cider grumm flopped down thankfully swiftly followed by martin and rose their wooden hobbles clacked together noisily and rose winced as she held up a paw sshh not so much noise you might waken the monsters burr oid throw moiself offen ee clifftop iffen they waked from slavery to slavery in one easy pawstep where will it end martin sighed loud and long rose shook his paw comfortingly in noonvale someday we wont be here all our lives with a warrior like you about martin being a nursemaid is not in your stars i wonder what became of brome and felldoh theyll have drifted in to land no doubt that felldoh is a good tough squirrel i know hell look after my brother i hope theyre safe and well martin could hardly keep his eyes open as he watched pallum approach bearing a heavily laden tray wherever felldoh and brome landed up they couldnt possibly be worse off than us nursemaids to those tiny rogues huh an alliance had been made between badrang the tyrant and capn tramun clogg still not trusting each other the two villainous stoats affixed their signatures to a sprawling birchbark parchment badrang writing his name in a curly flourishing script whilst clogg laboriously scrawled an x and a crude sketch of a wooden clog his mark it was witnessed by gurrad the rat for marshank and boggs the ferret for the corsairs tramun repeated the terms as he and the tyrant took a joint beaker of best parsley wine harr so as i sees it youre goin to call off yer troops an lend me some slaves to refurbish an refloat my ship meself on the other paw wont attack arass or demand slaves from you im to unnerstand that the slaves you lend me is still yores an ave to be returned right badrang sipped his wine and nodded tapping the parchment aye agreed and dont forget all this at such times as you have a seaworthy craft to sail off in i keep half of your crew as hostages when or if you return having taken more slaves then they get divided equally between us and you get your hostages returned to give you a full crew clogg stroked his plaited whiskers narrowing one eye fairly said partner fairly said an i can feed me crew from yer supplies an billet them ere in yer fancy fort though im never to tell other corsairs or searats as i may come across on the igh seas the location of this ere place badrang nodded refilling cloggs beaker right but dont forget tramun after the first cargo of slaves is split between us you guarantee to sell any further slaves from other voyages only to me ill give you the best of weapons trade goods and supplies clogg slopped wine as he threw back his head and drained the beaker then draped a paw around badrangs shoulders haharr just like in the good ole days eh matey the tyrant reciprocated by throwing his paw about cloggs neck aye as y say just like in the good ole days tramun but this time therell be no underpaw dealings traitors nor spybeasts spybeasts i aint never used spybeasts matey the pirate stoat adopted a look of injured innocence there there badrang patted cloggs neck affectionately i know you havent theres nothing worse than a spybeast why if i thought there was one in my fortress id tie him to the gates and let my archers use him for target practice look just like that fox over yonder he turned cloggs neck with his paw so that the corsair was looking at the inside of marshanks main gates the carcass of skalrag hung there stuck with so many arrows it was like a pincushion even though he was seething inwardly clogg grinned from ear to ear foxes was allus traitors i never liked that one badrang tightened his grip on cloggs neck momentarily then released him the tyrant matched the corsair grin for grin neither did i matey neither did i early morning sun bathed the shore beyond the headland promising a high hot day rowanoak harnessed herself between the shafts of the rosehips gaily painted cart and they moved further along the shoreline away from the close proximity of marshank felldoh and brome enjoyed the company of the rambling rosehip creatures greatly they had been accepted immediately as friends and possible members by midmorning they had set up their camp on the clifftops where they had an excellent view of the area without revealing their presence the hare ballaw de quincewold and rowanoak were in close conference while the rest unpacked and prepared lunch brome helped gauchee and kastern to prepare a leek and bean soup sniggering with the two mice as they watched the pretty squirrel celandine trying to flirt shamelessly with a much embarrassed felldoh as he unloaded the cart blushing to his tailtip at her simpering compliments oh mister felldoh youre so strong you lifted that trunk as if it were no more than a feather ill bet you must be the most powerful squirrel in the whole country felldoh was completely lost for words he turned away from the cart and started breaking some driftwood up for the fire celandine dabbed at her brow with a dainty lace square oh my oh my id be all season just trying to break one teensy piece of that wood with an axe and look at you sir snapping it in those great paws of yours like it was dead grass

caterpillar felldoh shook his head in bewilderment as buckler stuck a large red ball on the tip of his nose it sounds just crazy enough to work it was still early morning and already martin was feeling tired he and his friends had been roused several times that night by the familiar squidjee cry gluggadrink it seemed that every baby pigmy shrew woke at least twice nightly wanting a drink rose hauled her log away from the noisy breakfast table she was spattered with food and drink good morning martin youll never guess whats planned for the morning after breakfast is through martin shook his head dont tell me i dont want to know rose told him anyway stifling a smile as she did were taking all the squidjees down to the beach for a paddle in the rock pools evidently the whole tribe goes down there every day to check on their fishing nets if its good weather like today the little fiends are brought along to amuse themselves oh how nice it will be fun martin put on his fixed smile grumm and pallum had their paws full wiping off sticky baby whiskers cumm yurr youm orrible liddle toad thoi whiskern be full o oatmeal the squidjees dodged about chanting ceaselessly wannago shoreshore wannago shoreshore no descent to the shore from the high cliffs was not as difficult as it first looked there was a hidden stairway cunningly carved into the rock by the pigmy shrews martin and his companions had to make the trip several times watched by amballa and her ever vigilant shrews the four friends had to carry each squidjee piggyback fashion down to the sand when all the shrews were attending their nets the queen turned to pallum squidjees playnow youwatch plennygood she shook her sword at them in warning before seating herself comfortably where she could keep an eye on everything the queens infant son dinjer was trouble on wheels the other squidjees were relatively calm and happy burying grumm up to his neck in the sand martin rose and pallum were building a sandcastle for some others pallum pointed to grumm that was what i always hated when they decided to bury me grumm seems to be enjoying it the mole pulled loose a digging paw and waved to them burr aye tis noice n cool on an ot morn loik thisn stillagrumm staystill several squidjees started draping wet seaweed on the moles head martin looked about for dinjer rose spotted him there he is the little blaggard look climbing dinjer had strayed from the rest and taken a notion to scale the cliff face the section he chose was slippery and steep with sharp crags sticking out above it martins patience snapped he leaped up pointing at the miscreant get down from there you stupid little beast or youll fall the queen heard him angrily she threw a rock catching martin sharply on his unprotected back biggamouse biggamouth notalk ballamum son likethat badtalk ballamum killslay biggamouse martin was about to make some reply when there was a loud screech yeeeaaakkk a great gannet had swooped down and snatched dinjer from the rocks the infant pigmy shrew was carried high into the air held by his tail and the hem of his loose robe in the lethal amber beak of the predator he wriggled and squealed like a midget piglet immediately all activity on the shore ceased as amballas wails rent the air waaah waaah dinjergone himdead likefather like father i remember that when i was younger pallum whispered to rose dinjers father was taken by a big gannet like that one poor little mite hes as good as dead now amballa had slid down from her seat on the rocks she covered her eyes and wept inconsolably nomore dinjerbabe himgone deadnow martin grabbed her by the paws pulling her upright notdead ballamum dinjer notdead biggamouse savehim seizing the queens sword which was no more than a dagger in his paw martin bowled the nearest two pigmy shrews over and snatched their fishing net dashing off along the shore after the gannet he called back to his friends get more nets and follow me hurry the gannet soared upwards wheeled and dropped down on to a high ledge in an isolated part of the cliffs dinjer was stunned by the landing the infant lay limp between the big birds wellclawed and webbed feet there was a large untidy nest on the ledge with two scrawny halffeathered gannet chicks in it on seeing their mother they set up a cackle as he ran martin watched the bird descend and alight on the high ledge without pausing he ran to the cliff face directly below it pausing only to grip the swordblade in his teeth he hurled the fishing net upwards the meshes caught on the rocks giving a quick tug to check its firmness martin began climbing pulling himself up paw over paw on the tough kelp net when he reached where the net had caught he disentangled it whirling it around his head he hurled it aloft catching another rocky crag again he began hauling himself up over the meshes below on the beach the whole of the highbeast pigmy shrew tribe had gathered they watched as martin continued his ascent rose began spreading the other nets on the sand lashing four of them together the pigmy shrews were getting in her way ignoring her as they trampled the nets and gazed up rose pallum and grumm bulled into them pushing them backwards get out of the way cant you see were trying to help him one of the highbeasts kicked out at rose cheekamouse notalka me likethat amballa bit him savagely on the neck and knocked him down gettaway quicknow like mousesay allayou a piercing cry came from dinjer as he woke and saw his predicament eeeee helpme helpmeeeeee martin heard the cry and redoubled his efforts throwing the net upwards and scrambling over it he chanced a quick look up only about three more lengths to go dinjers tearstained face appeared over the rim of the ledge eeeeeee helpadinjer eeeeeee he was dragged back by the formidable beak of the gannet the huge bird tossed him against the side of the nest dinjer curled up tight as the two hungry chicks tried to crane their floppy necks over the edge of the nest to get at him below on the shore amballa hid her face in horror of what might happen to her little son rose put a comforting paw around the queens shoulders nocry ballamum biggamouse martin is mighty warrior he will get your dinjer back yousee yousee amballa seemed to understand rose she clung to the mousemaid as she anxiously watched the high ledge breathing raggedly with exertion martin pulled himself up on to the ledge hauling the net up after him dinjer saw him and jumped up yelling biggamouse martinmouse savemeeeee the gannet turned its bright dangerous eyes on martin as he took the sword from his mouth dinjer nomake nonoise bestill still the gannet took a stalking stride towards martin lowering its lethal yellow beak the young mouse swung with the little sword it clacked harmlessly off the great birds beak but caused the gannet to stop where it was now martin shook the net out and swished it at the birds feet it took a step back behind him he could hear dinjer sobbing with terror working his way across the ledge jabbing with the sword and sweeping with the net martin gradually got himself into a position where he was between the gannet and its nest sensing danger to its chicks the gannet began spreading its wings lowering its neck and opening its beak wide as it hissed at the intruder martin knew there was not much time it was getting ready to attack he would have to act quickly throwing back his head he shouted aloud into the gannets face hoping that he could be heard below on the beach stretch the nets hold them up lots of you be ready rose heard him she had thought of giving her eagle call but if martin or dinjer were in the nest they would be crushed under the gannet which would naturally sit on its nest to defend the chicks against anything grasping a corner of the net rose held it high yelling aloud holdup net stretch it tight now the highbeast tribe stood uncertainly for a moment until a harsh order from amballa their queen sent them scurrying to the edges of the net with rose pallum grumm and amballa at each corner the queen snapped out directions holda netup upup stretcher tightnow the net was ready up and tightly stretched martin reached back with his footpaw keeping a wary eye on the gannet as he kicked dinjer lightly movenow dinjer get over to the edge dinjer began crawling on all fours the gannet sensing it was being robbed of its prey tried to pass martin to get at dinjer martin jabbed with the sword this time he nipped the bird in its open mouth it retaliated with lightning swiftness pecking him sharply in the side martin drew his breath in short at the pain he clamped his paw over the spot feeling warm damp blood dinjer was now at the edge of the cliff peering over at the dizzy drop down to the shore jump dinjer jump martin hissed at him eeee nojump nojump dinjer fraid there was nothing else for it martin turned swiftly and gave the baby pigmy shrew a hefty kick on the bottom that sent him flying outwards over the edge yeeeeeeeeeeehhhkkkk whumpl dinjer bounced up and down in the center of the net saved the gannet gave a shrill squawk and attacked martin leaping to one side he whirled the net and threw it straight over the birds head the kelp fishing net enveloped the gannets head and one wing and draped on the ground trapping one of its webbed feet martin fell to one side dragging at the net the birds head came awkwardly askew and it tried to pull its leg free martin kicked out at its other leg sending the gannet crashing on its side loosely trapped in the net the young mouse leapt up his chest heaving the net would not hold the big sea bird for long and he did not wish to kill it the two chicks were squawking raucously in the nest turning to the fallen mother bird martin loosed off the net then he ran for the edge shouting aloud one for the net coming dooooooooown he leaped into the blue summer morning up and out momentarily he was robbed of breath as the wind whistled past his ears spreadeagled with all limbs flailing he dropped like a stone plummeting down into the net whumff a mighty cheer rose up from everybeast on the shore rose pallum and grumm hurried to help martin from the net the mousemaid tore a strip from her smock youre hurt let me see oh thank goodness its not serious martin let her bandage his side amballa came over smiling through her tears martin offered her sword back but she refused martinmouse warriormouse greatbrave savemy dinjerbabe ballamum saythis warrawant anything foryou pallum nudged martin as he whispered shes just offered you anything you want for saving dinjer ive never heard the queen do a thing like that before a silence fell over the assembled highbeasts martin lifted the sword and with two swift strokes freed rose of her hobbling log striding purposefully over to pallum and grumm he slashed through the kelps that bound them to the logs pallum could not remember being without the great log impeding his footpaws he held the broken kelp ends and wept silently martin faced the queen of the pigmy shrews eye to eye we want free the silence on the shore intensified as amballa drew herself up regally her fierce little eyes burning into martins ballamum saythis yougo allfree the ranks of the highbeast tribe parted to let the four friends pass through they walked in silence holding the slashed kelp ends lest they tripped suddenly dinjer ran out in front of martin swinging a stick he struck the young mouse hard as he could martin winced as he took the blow full across the face dinjer was in a foul temper striking and screaming as his tantrum grew biggamouse kickamee killslay biggamouse he kickamee dinjer instantly amballa was between the two she grabbed dinjer snapped the stick and threw it away then seizing her son by his tail she began spanking him hard with her free paw martinmouse rightsay you stupid little beast the loud cheers of the pigmy shrews coupled with dinjers anguished wails cut through the sunlit morning as the four friends strolled free along the beach away from pigmy shrews and captivity grumm smiled fondly burr tha sound be loik music to moi ears i while capn tramun clogg took a party around the headland to see what he could salvage of his ship badrang attended to other matters druwp the bankvole stood before the tyrant in his longhouse badrang had his aides gurrad and hisk bring food for the spy roast sea bird baked fish new bread and a flagon of damson wine were placed in front of druwp but the treacherous creature had suddenly lost his appetite he eyed the long thin whipping rods held by gurrad and hisk completely overawed in the presence of the mighty badrang the bankvole had told them all he knew but badrang was not satisfied danger radiated from the stoats eyes he was in an unpredictable mood let me get this straight druwp you knew that the prisoners were going to escape from the prison pit but you dont know how they did it you know the ringleaders of the slave resistance and you know they have buried weapons but you dont know what their plans are dont play me for a fool bankvole give me some good hard information that i can act upon druwp swallowed hard his mouth dry as a bone i know exactly where the weapons are buried sire badrang smiled at hisk and gurrad coming swiftly out of his chair he patted druwps back feeling the spy flinch beneath his touch good good thats what i want to hear tell me exactly where they are lord they are inside the slave compound buried in the earth beneath the sleeping pallet of an otter called tullgrew i watched her digging the hole she did not know i saw her badrang turned to his aides come on lets go and take a look you have done well druwp from now on you will be my eyes and ears in the ranks of the slaves sit down eat drink and be easy when badrang and his cronies had left the longhouse druwp felt his confidence returning his appetite too seating himself at the table he poured a large beaker of wine and tore off a leg from the roast sea bird the bread smelled good and fresh as he stuffed it hungrily into his mouth quaffing damson wine and setting his teeth into the hot meat druwp allowed himself a rare smile let the others be helpful and noble to each other he was in the business of selfpreservation the slaves had lain idle since the hostilities with clogg but they knew it would not last badrang would soon have them toiling under the lash the afternoon was warm and lazy with hardly a breeze they made the most of it lying about in the sun a mouse called yarrow wandered over to the palisade and peered through a gap barkjon badrang is comin this way with gurrad an hisk the old squirrel was instantly at his side yes i see them i wonder what they want badrang stood in the center of the compound a knowing smile hovering round his lips the slaves shuffled nervously as hisk and gurrad wandered amongst them flicking the long thin rods the tyrants voice was soft almost friendly as he addressed his captives well youve had a nice easy few days but itll be back to work in the morning stand by your beds while we take a head count they hurried to obey giving hisk and gurrads rods a wide berth an eerie silence settled over the whole place as the two captains walked around the nervous creatures standing by their pitiful sacks of straw which served as beds gurrad took one side hisk the other tapping their canes against each animals chest as they counted hillgorse the old hedgehog stood in front of a very young mouse called hoopoe as gurrads cane snaked out to touch the youngster hillgorse batted it aside with his paw he spoke out his voice bold and enquiring whats all this about what do you want of us hillgorse is that your name the tyrants voice was still deceptively friendly thats what they call me hmm i thought so let me see now which one of you is barkjon felldohs father took a pace forward i am barkjon badrangs eyes roved this way and that keyla is there a young otter named keyla aye thats me keyla held up a paw badrang stared at the otter a moment good good you can tell me which one is tullgrew another otter like yourself keyla exchanged glances with barkjon and hillgorse before replying tullgrew theres no tullgrew here badrangs voice hardened lie to me and youll die all three of you who is tullgrew the otter could not see her friends endangered she held up her paw my name is tullgrew badrang strode across to her and kicked the sack of bedding grass move that and start digging slowly tullgrew did as she was bid the noon sun beat down on the compound a small cloud of dust arose where the otter toiled away digging the sandy clayish ground with both paws barkjon looked across to hillgorse their eyes were sad with resignation tullgrew dug until she was standing in a pit half her own height sweat ran down into her eyes hiding te look of puzzlement in them badrang sensed something was amiss gurrad hisk throw that otter out of the hole and take over the two captains scrambled to obey putting their rods aside they heaved tullgrew out of the excavation and began digging fast and hard under the tyrants hot angry eyes all their questing paws found was earth and more earth they were almost at head height when badrang snapped at them get out of it fools cant you see theres nothing there as they pulled themselves out gurrad the shorter of the two slipped and fell back into the hole there was an audible snigger among the slaves badrang whirled round to face them well see how long you laugh doing double workloads tomorrow hisk helped the rat out and they padded warily behind the tyrant as he swept out of the compound his cloak billowing darkly against the noonday brightness tullgrew spread her dusty paws wide what happened to the weapons they werent there by the seasons i wonder where they went keylas face was the picture of innocence barkjon waggled a paw under the otters nose you know you young rascal keyla smiled mischievously aye i know but druwp doesnt he watched tullgrew bury them and i watched him when he fell asleep i gently pulled tullgrew and her bedding to one side she was asleep too weary after all that digging so i just dug the weapons up and found a new hiding place for them tullgrew shook her head in amazement but where did you put them keyla hah right in the center of the compound there where badrang was standing when he first came in hee hee hee druwp was sitting among the remnants of his feast sipping the last of the wine when the longhouse door opened with a bang badrang entered flanked by gurrad and hisk wine spilled as the flagon went flying against the wall druwps chair was pulled from under him and in a trice he was flat on his back with the tyrants footclaws against his quivering throat you made a fool of me druwp the stoats voice grated with a rage he could hardly contain i dont like being made to look a fool i should kill you but i wont you will continue spying for me however first you must learn a hard lesson a sob rose in druwps throat as badrang called to his captains bring me those rods then guard the door so he cant run the hot still summer evening was bringing the day to a close tramun cloggs crew sat out on the shore grouped around cooking fires the capn would not allow them to be billeted in badrangs fancy fort where they could be surrounded by the tyrants horde while sleeping better the open shore close to the tideline clogg had inspected the hulk of his ship at low water there was a chance the hull could be towed ashore and saved to rebuild upon the corsairs clothing steamed as it dried on him by the fire he gnawed on a toasted mackerel and swigged noisily at a jug of old seaweed ale he did not notice the strangely clad hare who was sitting beside him in the twilight until the creature spoke i say old lad any chance of a nip at that seaweed ale im very partial to a drop of the old beach water the unflappable clogg hugged his jug close as he eyed the odd beast indignantly git yer own ale rabbit ere you aint one o my crew the hare nudged him cheekily and winked should bally

the corsairs gasped in amazement as ballaw began pulling a long ribbon from his mouth it opened out wide and frilly out and out it came as the hare pulled faster paw over paw changing colors as it issued from his mouth red blue pink brown green purple culminating in a vivid yellow with large black letters written upon it ballaw sat up and read it aloud capn tramun clogg why that must be your

on clifftops still warm from the days sun the rambling rosehip players rehearsed for the following nights performance felldoh and brome learned the business quickly they had to more than a days journey south on those same clifftops martin and his friends camped for the night unable to risk a fire in strange and possibly hostile territory they sprawled wearily at the edge of a small scrubby woodland that grew up almost to the cliff edge grumm massaged his ample stomach as it gurgled plaintively hurr scuse oi moi tummys athinken moi mouth as fergotted ow to eat rose propped herself up on

oak that had fallen at a crazy angle against a tall rocky outcrop the trunk was practically a stairway they followed her up to a large comfortable room built between three thick boughs it was floored with driftwood and cordage and roofed with the same material tightly chinked with moss earth and leaf packing to keep out wind and weather the walls were formed by the foliage of the surrounding trees

the mole went into a doze then she talked no more when they were finished eating they lay back on the broad comfortable bough and were soon asleep moonlight filtered through the leaves on to the faces of the four friends as they slumbered polleekin moved silently touching each of their faces tenderly she shook her head and wiped her eyes on the flowery apron pore young uns so much arpiness an sadness afore ee iffen ony youm knowed oi be glad moi seasons are near run an oi doant ave to carry otherbeasts loives around in moi ole ead for long naow martin opened his eyes to the song of small birds with dawn sun filtering green and gold through the leafy walls of the tree house rising silently he climbed down to the woodland floor there was a cool spring rising out of the rocks bubbling its way into a small pool the young mouse swilled his face and paws shaking away the droplets and drying off with a pawful of grass polleekin bustled past with a small rush basket mawnin zurr marthen lookee liddle mushyrooms celery lettuce an early azel nutters green uns some dandelion an crabapples pallum appeared looking into the basket and nodding hungrily mmm they look lovely and fresh the old molewife slapped his paw away as he reached for a young button mushroom gurr youm young roguer old still till oi make thoi breffist grumm and rose took a hurried wash at the spring shaking themselves dry they scrambled swiftly back up to the tree house for breakfast polleekin could work wonders with vegetables and she did they feasted on mushroom and celery soup garnished with young dandelion petals followed by the scones she had baked the day before now well soaked through with honey rose poured crabapple cider for them as the old mole began outlining her luncheon menu oill bake a gurt

wrote everything down sometimes making polleekin repeat things two or three times until she was satisfied the old molewife gave out her instructions almost grudgingly as she went about the business of making up four packs of provisions pallum watched her shaking his head and smiling fondly what a wunnerful ole molewife i bet even squidjees would be nice to her my eart and stummick is longin to stay longer in this place with polleekin but weve got to go still ill make myself a promise by my spikes that ill return ere someday an taste her cookin again midmorning sunlight lanced through the gently

spreading atop of a scone camp close by night watch out by day for the threeeyed one who bars the way more you will not learn until meeting the warden of marshwood hill martin scratched his chin thoughtfully i wish polleekin would have explained it a little clearer rose shrugged she doesnt want us to go the poor old creature loves to have company however knowing that we must carry on and find noonvale she did the best she could with her rhyme lets take it a bit at a time as we go follow your frontshadow do not stop what in the name of seasons is a frontshadow pallum shouldered his pack i think its when the sun is at our back and the shadow we throw is in front of us come on lets make a start now let me see he looked up at the sun calculating which way it would travel this way straight into the woodland in two hours the sun will be at our backs grumm picked up his pack reluctantly but whurrs miz polleekin rose pointed into the scrubby thickness surrounding them somewhere in there having a quiet sulk i shouldnt wonder ah well i dont blame her i feel pretty bad about leaving here myself but we must go ill sing her a farewell shell hear it im sure the friends set off into the warm midday martin kept his eyes on the country ahead listening admiringly to roses beautiful singing voice goodbye my friend and thank you thank you thank you it makes me sad to leave you upon this summer day dont shed a tear or cry now goodbye now goodbye now im sure ill see you somehow if i pass by this way for the seasons dont foretell who must stay or say farewell and i must find out what

rustling ferns they caught a glimpse of flowered apron disappearing dont fret grumm she heard roses song look four slices of plum and damson cake spread thick with meadowcream affixed to the drooping branch of a hawthorn hung bobbing in their path like strange fruit grumm picked one sitting down on the ground he began eating smiling through the tears that coursed openly down his homely face moi eart but shem a wunnerful creetur oid be fair proud t be a choild of that thurr moler book two actors and searchers i evening shadows lengthened as the hot day drew to a close the shore lay warm and dusty beneath the last rays of daylight fortress marshanks gates were thrown open wide torches and seacoal fires illuminated the courtyard as the corsair crew mingled with the tyrants horde an alfresco supper had been laid for the two leaders and their aides a temporary jollity prevailed in the light of the promised entertainment though badrang and clogg still regarded each other suspiciously the tyrant stoat nibbled a leg of roast gull sipping daintily from a beaker of greengage cordial as he smiled patronizingly at the corsair capn tramun clogg sniffed at a pickled mackerel with a defiant grimace he dunked it thoroughly in badrangs cordial bowl and wolfed it down in one mouthful choking and coughing he grabbed a halfempty puncheon of kelp beer tilting it to his mouth and drinking deeply as it splashed widespread down his braids on to the tabletop with a loud belch and a villainous grin he slammed the puncheon back on the table harr thats better ho lookit ere comes me mate tibbar an is pals badrang eyed the approaching troupe scathingly hmm so this is the entertainment weve been waiting for clogg half drew his cutlass thrusting his face close to badrang aye so tis an theyre friends of me good matey tibbar so dont you fergit it badrang turned his head avoiding cloggs fishladen breath he had dropped his corsair accent now that he held the upper paw forget it how could i youve done nothing but gabble on about it all day clogg was offended by the tyrants manner he squinted fiercely at him that werent gabblin matey twere a warnin dont mess with those creatures an get any thoughts o slavetakin outta yer ead badrang its double bad luck to any who tries to arm me magic friends see brome felt himself freeze beneath the huge frog mask that enveloped his head the sight of badrang and marshank caused panic in his mind rowanoak pushed him gently from behind hurry along now young froggy hop to it remembering that he was invisible beneath his disguise gave brome the confidence he needed giving a loud croak he hopskipped into the center of the courtyard and began setting up the scenery from the cart with the other rosehip troupers felldoh was concealed beneath a big comical fox outfit the tongue wobbled and the eyes rolled every time he moved his head beneath the mask felldoh peered wildly around seeing each familiar hated face badrang gurrad hisk but no sign of his father barkjon ballaw was in his element the show mixed with the ever present danger of appearing before enemies made his heart beat fast with excitement dressed in the flowing costume of tibbar the magic rabbit he cartwheeled boldly up to the leaders table and tweaked cloggs plaited beard cloggo me old crab carcass me jolly old wavedog companion top o the evenin to you wot wot tramun laughed uncontrollably highly amused at his new friends antics ballaw produced two spoons from cloggs beard and began clacking them rhythmically together by bouncing both spoons off the corsair stoats vast stomach whens a stoat not a stoat when he wears clogs an a velvet coat whens a stoat an old seadog when hes whiskery friskery attery biskery capn tramun clogg whoa hoho harrharrharr aint e a caution haharrharr clogg thumped badrang heartily upon the back the tyrant managed to put his beaker down before cordial spilled on his polished breastplate he glared at clogg before turning to ballaw so youre the magic rabbit well lets see some magic ballaw took badrangs beaker and emptied it at a single gulp before the tyrant could protest he refilled the beaker from a nearby flagon and tossed the contents of it into badrangs face the tyrant gave a gasp of surprise and threw up his paws only to find that the beaker showered him not with drink but with dead leaves clogg fell off his chair laughing see i told yer thats me ole matey tibbar the magic rabbit haharrhohoho make more magic tibbar ballaw bowed elegantly as he leaped down from the table lord badrang what dyou wish old chap a play or more magic badrang refilled his empty beaker checking to see that it was greengage cordial and not dead leaves ill go along with friend clogg here make more magic ballaw extended his paw dramatically bring forth the deadly dagger of death gauchee and kastern came forward bearing between them a red silk cushion on it lay a long dagger which glittered wickedly in the firelight rowanoak chanted in the background from the deepest darkest dungeons neath the mountains of the moon comes the dreadful dagger of death to bring a creature to sad doom rowanoak then came forward dragging celandine the squirrelmaid threw a paw to her brow protesting theatrically no no no no not i not i one so young and pretty as me is far too fair to die ballaw took the dagger producing an apple from an astounded searats ear he sliced it in quarters with the glittering blade smiling wickedly as he called to the assembled vermin see how sharp an murderous is me blade who would like to see me kill the maid immediately there was a silence celandine looked so tearfully beautiful nobeast made a sound to condemn her except badrang run her through rabbit and be done with it celandine shrieked and strove to get away as rowanoak held her tightly helpless before ballaw the hare held the dagger high badrang your name is feared throughout the land my lord i kill this maid at your command he struck at celandine she screamed aaaaiiiieeeeeee the blade appeared to bury itself full length in the squirrelmaids body though it had collapsed secretly back into the daggers handle celandine took the handle in both paws as ballaw let it go she looked as though she were trying to pull it out of her though she was really pressing it in ballaw turned his face a mask of horror paws quivering as he held them to his face alas no more ill laugh or sing ive murdered her the pretty little thing celandine staggered about moaning pitifully nor more ill see the dawning oer the trees nor see the golden sunlight in the sky the seasons change the birds the flowrs the bees alack a day poor me who has to die buckler stood close to her banging on a small drum as he muttered out of the side of his mouth coom on miz daunt ee make a banquet o it urry oup an die with a final heartrending sob celandine flopped gracefully into rowanoaks paws and died still clutching the dagger to her as rowanoak bore the squirrelmaids limp form around some of the corsairs began muttering shame she were a pretty liddle beast aye mate that rabbit might be magic but es fair eartless capn clogg took a huge draught of kelp beer harr tibbar matey whatd you want ter croak er for the shows spoiled now you gone an ruined a good nights entertainment ballaw twirled his magic rabbit cloak there my good friends speaks a stoat with a heart o gold me old companion cloggo just for you ill bring her back to life rowanoak laid celandine on the ground ballaw knelt over her chanting here lies a young maid whos been killed with my own paw i thrust the knife without a drop of her blood spilled see i bring her back to life hocus pocus dumbeldum dreary wackalup one two three four five gawrum pawrum cockalorum maid rise up and come alive he took hold of the dagger and made a great show of pulling it out of celandine heaving and grunting until at last it stood free and shining as he waved it in the air the young squirrelmaid sat up rubbed her eyes and smiled prettily as she stretched where am i i must have fallen asleep there was great cheering and applause for the marvellous trick ballaw swiftly collapsed the dagger back into its handle stowed it beneath his cloak and brought forth an identical one this however was no trick dagger the hare stuck it in the tabletop between clogg and badrang for their inspection tramun tested the weapon slamming its point down hard into the table several times tibbar matey yore the magickest rabbit i ever clapped eyes on badrang never bothered testing the knife he sat back chin on paw very good rabbit can you do any more tricks ballaw pointed at felldoh in his ridiculous outfit more tricks you say attend me here my magic is no trick yon fox ill make him disappear with a wave of my magic stick rowanoak whispered in felldohs ear now is the chance to free your father try to remember what you were told you wont get a second opportunity good luck the badger donned a massive black cloak as buckler and trefoil unloaded a box from the cart ballaw clapped felldoh on the shoulder haranguing him loudly as the stage was set now then young fellah you cunning fox howd you like to disappear just place yourself inside yon box and like a flash youre out of here felldoh backed off his head flopping comically as he pleaded what vanish me sir tibbar no to what strange place would i then go under the sea or maybe up there to regions of the nether air i pray you sir please let me be magic tibbar dont vanish me ballaw turned to the crowd they were laughing at the comical foxs plight assisted by the rest of the company he got a chant going that was soon picked up by everybeast wheres the best place for the fox locked up tight inside the box the entire company leaped upon felldoh and dragged him yelling to the box there was utter confusion as they thrust him in and he sprang out again in out in out he went with the delighted hordes of vermin leaping about chanting louder and louder wheres the best place for the fox locked up tight inside the box ballaw ran to the fire shouting madly in in get him in i say he extended both paws to the fire whoosh a great smoky gouting column of flame lit up the night red green and brightest blue there was a yell of alarm as creatures fell back rubbing at their eyes in the blinding light felldoh concealed himself beneath rowanoaks huge black cloak she moved swiftly away to the edge of the firelight and shook the brave squirrel free from the enveloping garment felldoh rolled deep into the shadows flattening himself against the wall as he made his way to the slave compound buckler beat furiously on his small drum secretly kicking away at the box so that it moved and shook trefoil stood at his side her lips scarcely moving as she called out in a loud imploring tone o pity gentle creatures lack a day dont leave a poor fox here all locked away clogg nudged badrang roughly hoho thats settled the foxs ash tibbars got im stowed tight in that there box kastern and celandine paraded round holding up a variety of big oldfashioned locks complete with keys and many lengths of tough seakelp rope who will lock the fox up tight who will bind the box up right there was no shortage of volunteers searats and corsairs mingled with members of the tyrants horde as they crowded round the box some proudly showed their skills in rope knotting while others secured the locks through the boxs metal eyelets ballaw strutted round the secured box nodding with satisfaction lashed stoutly by good seafaring beasts by honest soldiers locked firm no creature could possibly get out of there not even the smallest worm badrang plucked the long dagger from where it stood quivering in the table he strode across to the box his lip curling as he addressed ballaw has the fox disappeared from inside the box now ballaws long ears twitched he held up a cautionary paw wait sire let me weave the spell he circled the box gesturing and leaping now you vanish unfortunate one a wave of my wand and you are gone others may search and seek in vain but you will never be seen again by sleight of paw ballaw produced a hazel twig he tapped the box sharply once twice thrice calling out ongum bongum wollagum woe vanish disappear dematerialize go turning to badrang he panted in mock exhaustion and bowed he is gone mlord the box is empty shall i show you the tyrant smiled evilly shaking his head no leave the box secured but if the fox is really gone im sure you wont mind me doing this darting forward badrang slammed the dagger down with furious energy straight through the box lid up to its hilt there was a horrified gasp from the onlookers followed by a mad roar from capn tramun clogg as he charged out cutlass upraised murderer i warned ye badrang none of these magic beasts was to be harmed you treacherous scum ballaw acted swiftly tripping clogg he grabbed the cutlass and ran the box through with it using both paws turning he helped the pirate stoat up and dusted him off nay nay capn if i say the fox is vanished then you can be sure hes gone hi there you gurrad dyou fancy throwin your spear at the box anybeast come on have a go there was silence for a moment then gurrad threw his spear the heavy weapon crashed through the box protruding from the other side it was like a signal immediately daggers spears arrows and even swords flew through the air in seconds the box resembled a pincushion when the missiles had stopped ballaw gave the box a mighty kick with his long hindpaws it fell apart showing everybeast that the fox had really vanished the hare spread his paws wide grinning you see when tibbar the magic rabbit performs magic it is real amid the hearty applause that followed druwps voice squealed out from the direction of the stockade the slaves are escaping help come quick theyre escaping the four friends had trekked through the scrub woodlands all afternoon their shadows lengthening in front of them heralding the onset of evening it had been a still hot day and the going was slow in the heat rose wiped her brow as she caught up with pallum martin had been clearing ahead with his shrew sword phew itll get a little cooler as night falls but then well lose our frontshadows in the dark they waited as grumm caught up with them the mole blinked as he wiped the moist tip of his nose hurr be cooler unnerground usns agoen f make camp soon marthen good idea grumm we deserve a rest where dyou suggest we camp burr oi dunno wot say ee miz roser the mousemaid stood on tippaw looking around straight ahead id say it looks less scrubby and the trees are taller like a proper forest lets camp by that old dead oak a slow smile spread across pallums face do you mean that old dead oak with the three tops rose clapped her paws together as she recited the lines follow your frontshadow do not stop till you reach the one with dead three top hahah thats it an old dead threetopped oak come on they lay in a mossy hollow at the base of the long dead forest giant eating supper and looking up at the night sky above the woody canopy countless stars bejewelled the dark velvet expanse and a silent fierytailed comet flashed across the peaceful scene rose picked at a small carrot and turnip farl as she passed the canteen of mint and lavender cordial to martin well we found the dead three top easy enough tomorrow well look for the twin paths oh i do hope brome and felldoh are all right id hate to think of us lying here eating if they needed our help martin took a sip from the canteen trust polleekins words rose theres nothing else we can do brome is young but felldoh will look after him hes a warrior the mousemaid looked at the short shrew sword sticking in the ground close to martins paw where he could reach it quickly whats it like being a warrior i dont know really martin shrugged i wont consider myself a warrior until the day i take my fathers sword back from badrang rose tossed a piece of her bread it bounced off martins nose silly of course youre a warrior even polleekin saw that i know youre a warrior because you protect others look at the way youve helped me and grumm and pallum and the way you dealt with that big seabird nobeast but a warrior could have done that gentle snoring noises came from the mole and the hedgehog martin chuckled no good asking them theyre sound asleep like i should be us warriors need lots of sleep you know good night rose long after martin had gone to sleep rose lay awake thinking of her home in noonvale noonvale she said the name in a whisper to the starstrewn night to her it meant peace happiness and security filled as it was with family and friends noonvale the secret place of the ancient northeastern forest the young mousemaid closed her eyes and fell into a deep slumber far from home noonvale dawn arrived soft as a feather on air martin opened one eye and watched two ants trundling off with the tiny piece of bread that rose had thrown at him he lay still thinking of noonvale he had talked with rose the previous day as they walked she told him about her home with grumm adding the occasional comment the more martin heard of the place the more he liked it maybe someday he could live there with rose and her family and grumm and pallum coom on zurr marthen youm agoen t loi thurr all season grumm prodded martin with his little ladle naow wotll ee ave fer breffist oi cn make zoop rose sat up rubbing her eyes no soup grumm well eat from the packs martin stood and stretched aye best not light a fire in strange country grumm wandered off muttering to himself burr no foire oi do loiks moi zoop of a mornen leastways oim not agoen wiout fresh water oill go an seek summ out rose smiled as she dug apple turnovers out of her pack hes a proper old grump some mornings shouldve been called grump instead of grumm here have one of these turnovers hell be back soon with fresh water thats another thing he insists on most mornings even in winter hell sit out sucking icicles in the snow pallum martin and rose broke their fast with apple turnovers some candied hazel and chestnuts and the remains of the cordial from the canteen they sat enjoying the quiet woodland as the sun warmed the morning pallum kept some food out for grumm as he repacked their provisions rose stood up looking around anxiously where has that mole got to he only went for water ill give him a shout no dont raise your voice rose if grumm can hear it then so can others come on well take a quiet walk and look for him martin could see that rose was concerned for her friend she kept shaking her head and murmuring under her breath hes never usually gone this long grumm silly beast where are you they were not far into the tall trees when martin stopped pointing ahead he leaned close and whispered see the twin paths beware of one sweet as the spreading atop of a scone there they are rose the twin paths look two definite paths twisted and curved away through the tall treetrunks one to the left the other to the right maybe grumms gone down one but which one roses voice sounded small in the huge silent forest neither i ope they both look pretty fearful maybe i best stay ere and wait in case grumm shows up you two can explore the paths id only get in the way rose could see that the hedgehog was afraid she patted his prickles carefully good idea pallum come on martin they ventured a short way along the path that ran to the right it wound and curved but seemed safe enough martin shook his head lets try the left path creeping stealthily forward they explored the left path it seemed more tangled and overgrown than the other and oppressively hot again martin halted he made a gesture towards his ear indicating that rose should listen the mousemaid heard it right away it was a thick heavy humming like nothing she had ever heard straining her ears she caught a low frightened whimper thats grumm aye and its coming from round that bend you stay here rose martin drew his small sword im coming with you i couldnt stay here martin rose caught on to his paw all right but stay behind me and try not to make any noise they inched forward carefully the humming grew heavier until it seemed to be part of the very air they breathed there was an overpoweringly sweet smell everywhere martin brushed aside a wild dogrose and they rounded the bend it was a very strange scene that met their eyes bees there were literally millions of the insects they swarmed on shrubs bushes trees and all over the ground a fallen elm blocked the path completely and gigantic hives stood everywhere along it old hives new hives halfbuilt hives and old broken ones honeycomb could be seen exposed in parts thick golden and waxseamed amber nectar dripped to the ground and onto the heavy fungus that grew around the fallen tree with his back almost touching the trunk sat grumm the small ladle held against his nose so that he could breathe rose stared wideeyed it was hard to distinguish grumm from the bees that swarmed on him they were all over his furry body from footpaws to eartips covering him completely and buzzing dangerously grumm had his eyes tight shut every once in while he would make a small frightened sound around the ladle that protected his nostrils sit still grumm rose said in a husky whisper dont cry theres a good mole martin and i are here now hurrmm miz roser grumms voice sounded muf fled as he talked around the ladle theym trapped oi daown yurr ooch they stingen oi not all at oncet moind just when they feels loik avin some fun with oi ooch rose kept her voice low im sorry youre being stung grumm but sit still and well have you out of there soon martin spoke out of the side of his mouth rose theyve got us trapped now theres as many behind us as there are in front and theyre blocking our way out ow ive been stung on the footpaw and theyre beginning to swarm on me you cant fight bees with a sword owch rose looked at martin then down at herself thats strange not a single bee has landed on me look she held her paw forth not a single insect tried to land on it martin blinked in surprise how dyou do it owch realization dawned on rose suddenly martin grumm dont speak dont say a single word ive noticed that every time you speak you get stung now the bees arent stinging me so it must be because they like the sound of my voice ive got an idea listen im going to start singing if they like my voice when i speak theyre sure to like it if i sing gently as soon as you feel that its safe then take my paws and well walk out of here or at least give it a try well here goes let me sing a bit first martin and grumm remained still like two statues covered by masses of slowly moving bees rose began her song you will find me at noonvale on the side of a hill when the summer is peaceful and high there where streamlets meander the valley is still neath the blue of a calm cloudless sky right away martin noticed a difference in the behavior of the bees the buzzing diminished to a low background hum and the insects that were crawling over him ceased their activities its working he whispered urgently to rose keep singing im going to take your paw grumm can you hear me reach out for roses paw when she sings rose continued her voice like warm breeze on a soft night look for me at dawning when the earth is asleep till each dewdrop is kissed by the day neath the rowan and alder a vigil ill keep every moment that you are away rose stretched her paws forth feeling martin and grumm take them she turned and began walking back down the path with a slow measured pace martin and grumm trod carefully alongside the mousemaid she continued singing and as they went the bees began dropping off and buzzing lazily back to their hives the old earth gently turns as the seasons change slowly all the flowers and leaves born to wane hear my song oer the lea like the wind soft and lowly oh please come back to noonvale again pallum was waiting anxiously at the entrance to the path at the sight of his friends returning he did a small dance of joy coupled with anxiety at the lumps and bumps raised by the bee stings haha there you are thank the seasons oh look at you grumm all covered in swellins what happened the mole smiled at his worried friend bo urr that be anuther story pallum move asoide so usns can set daown an rest usns weary bodies hurr the three travellers slumped against a spreading syca more martin shook his head in amazement burying his short sword point down in the loam thank you rose that was marvellous who needs a sword to defend us thats the second time youve won a victory with your voice first as a sea eagle then as a singer you know the strange thing is that i hardly noticed the bees all i could hear was your song i could have listened to it for ever pallum made poultices of dockleaves nightshade and mud sit still now while i put these on your stings to cool them best thing in the world for stings hows that ooh you dont know how good that feels martin sighed gratefully as the fire died from the stings under pallums ministrations all we need now is another song from rose grumm spat away a bee sting that he had nipped out with his teeth ho yurss miz roser be the noicest songer in all noonvale er daddy an oi watched many a time whoil she singen ee burds outen ee trees rose was all afluster she jumped up and shouldered her pack it was only an old noonvale song every young creature there can sing it as well as me come on you two or are you going to sit there all morning the mousemaid set off down the path at a lively pace with martin and grumm bringing up the rear as pallum pulled stings from them thats it right there in the middle of my back ooh thats better get that one on the side of grumms neck oochooch go easy zurr edgepig youm wurser than ee liddle peskers as put yon stingers thurr they made good progress that day though the woodland grew high and gloomy as they traversed it it was noontide yet the sun could hardly be glimpsed through the high interwoven foliage canopy dim green light filtering down gave the path an eerie quality of unreality halting by a little brook the four friends made a late lunch of applescones washed down with the cold spark ling water when they had finished grumm and pallum sat dabbling their footpaws in the brook grunting and making small noises of happiness as the babbling water gurgled over their paws martin and rose sat behind them nudging each other and stifling silent giggles as they watched the pair enjoy their paddle i see you beware quick as a flash martin leaped up drawing his sword at the sound of a booming voice in the halflit forest he held up a paw cautioning his friends to silence they waited a moment then the voice echoed out a second time go back small ones leave my path who are you martin shouted then surprised at how the forest echoed and magnified his voice i am the mirdop the spectral sound rumbled about the treetrunks i see all none can pass me go back we mean no harm martin replied keeping his voice friendly as possible we are only travellers trying to reach noonvale leaning aside he whispered quickly to rose keep him talking ill try and find out where he is be still all of you the voice rang out hollow and angry for i am mirdop born in a storm at the night of winters moon i see all i slay all placing her paws firmly together rose did a magnificent harsh grating voice which rang and echoed wildly and i am martin the warrior i have slain more than the hairs on your hide i have defeated amballa and badrang let us pass there was more silence then the voice called threateningly one warrior is nought to a mirdop i will eat him up rose resorted to her own natural voice as she answered there is more than one warrior here there are four i am rose the deadliest slayer in noonvale i eat mirdops for breakfast what say you pallum the mighty pallum swelled until his stickles separated and shrieked out yahoooo i am pallum the mighty i carry a thousand swords i too eat mirdops though generally as snacks stay clear of me and watch out for my friend grumm the growler what is a grumm the growler the mysterious mirdop voice answered them this time rose thought she caught a note of hesitation in it the mole shuffled forward brandishing his ladle oi be grumm the growler a gurt moighty beast oi makes zoop out o mirpods an sangwiches from they tails ho urr i care not who you be the mirdops voice sounded definitely unsure now go back or die nobeast passes the mirdop hurr then they be allus a furst toime stand aside or well go right over you mirdop or no mirdop were coming stay back keep away the mirdop voice sounded strained and frantic now ive fought foxes battered badgers whipped weasels strangled stoats owooooaaahhheeeh over here friends hurry martins voice rang out loud and clear from somewhere up in front of them came a crashing and the most dreadful earsplitting screams and yells rose grabbed a fallen branch and shook it fiercely the mirdop must have got martin come on chaaaaarge the three travellers rushed forward along the path to where the horrible noises rose to a deafening intensity tullgrew and keyla threw themselves upon felldoh hugging and patting the brave squirrel haha good to see your battered old face again mate aye yore a sight for sore eyes all right friend felldoh winked at them cheerily helped by tullgrew and keyla felldoh battered aside two logs from the compound wall it was difficult to keep the joyous slaves silent and orderly barkjon and hillgorse hurried them through encouraging and advising quietly you get through marm ill pass you the young un

leave them we may have to run for it youd only be slowed down lugging that lot along felldoh and keyla had taken the two logs from the palisade laying them against the back of the fortress main wall to form an easy way to the top they lifted and pushed the slaves up to where tullgrew waited with a stout kelp rope one at a time she swung them out over the top now im going to lower you down let go of the rope and jump as soon as you can theres bedding mattresses down there to break your fall hurry now we need the rope for the others in the midst of the bustle barkjon found time to grasp his

compound quick i knew something like this would happen come on stir your stumps you addlebrained scum move the tyrants horde stumbled over each other grabbing weapons as they rushed to do their masters command badrang dashed about like a madbeast using the flat of his blade as a rod smacking heads and paws with numbing force hurry run are you deaf or stupid move you mudworms tramun clogg sat on the overturned table still drinking and eating a sly smile hovering on his greasy lips ho dearie me the liddle slaves are all runnin off ere gruzzle dyou reckon its cos they dont like it ere the tyrant cast a murderous glance at the corsair stoat this is all your fault clogg you and your magic rabbit with his performing friends theyve got something to do with this im certain of it well arent

pretty simple maister when youm be in trouble an they audience doant loik ee no more then usns run fer it loik billyoh rowanoak began singing softly to the rambling rosehip players i think well call it a day back to the cart i say its exit left without any pay wed be better off far away the company began sidling unobtrusively towards their cart clogg staggered upright throwing his drink down he began rugging to free the cutlass from his waist sash ahoy tibbar old ard there where dyou think yore off to completely unruffled ballaw made an elegant bow love to stay old cloggo old stoat but you know how tis we need our jolly old beauty sleep tramun tipped the wink to boggs crosstooth and gruzzle in a trice they had the pirate crew surrounding the players clogg licked the blade of his cutlass and closed one eye an all the time i thought you was me mateys it aint friendly like runnin off so soon ows about you doin one more bit o magic fer ole tramun ballaw gave the stoat a large toothy grin

crew of ye thats what i said old sport an the cart too an all of this whilst yore surrounded thats the ticket capn haharr tis impossible but you carry on matey ballaw collected several hefty pieces of firewood and distributed them to the troupe meanwhile rowanoak harnessed herself to the cart shafts the hare indicated by sweeping dramatic gestures that they all climb up on to the cart when they had he joined them laydeez an gennelbeasts watch closely as you see we are all holding a large magic wand each that is with the exception of my good friend the magic badger there now watch closely please as my old uncle flobbears used to say the speed of the paw always deceives the eye an more often than not blackens it are you ready one three two four whatever chaaaaarge the huge female badger threw all her weight and speed against the shafts sending the cart forward like a runaway boulder on a mountainside it smashed through the surrounding corsairs sending them scattering like ninepins as the troupe flailed and thwacked away at searat heads with their large magic wands clogg was taken aback momentarily then he was up and pursuing the cart as it headed for the open gate of marshank stop em its a trick ballaw caught gruzzle a hefty blow sending him ears over tail of course its a trick old lad i told you it was tullgrew gave a shout of alarm from the walltop as she saw the horde pounding towards the compound lookout felldoh theyre coming only half of the slaves were over the wall felldoh looked around in desperation as hillgorse and barkjon came running to him the horde were now pelting around the outside of the compound towards them barkjon groaned aloud theres too many and we have no weapons felldoh gritted his teeth at least half of us got away wait this might hold em off a bit grabbing a chunk of rock he called up to tullgrew throw that rope down catching the rope felldoh secured the rock to one end of it and began swinging it as he advanced on the horde it took out several of them before they hurriedly backed off the chunk of rock circled and whirred in a deadly blur as felldoh roared come on whos next you stinking bunch of cowards come on get him you dolts rush him badrang howled with rage as he pushed his creatures forward grabbing a spear from a weasel called rotnose badrang hurled it still swinging the rock felldoh leaped to one side the spear missed him but took barkjon through his shoulder immediately hillgorse pulled the spear from his friend the hedgehog was powerfully built despite his age wielding the spear with a strength born of desperation he launched himself at the horde of foebeasts plunging and stabbing wildly in the narrow space between stockade and wall they were driven back by the spear and the swinging rock hillgorse stuck the spear in the ground by felldoh give me the rope young un take the spear and get your father away from here hes been wounded do as i say quickly felldoh grabbed the spear as he felt the rope taken from his paws by hillgorse tullgrew had climbed halfway down the two log steps on the wall and between them they hauled the semiconscious barkjon upwards two arrows found hillgorse as others clattered and bounced off the walls around tullgrew and felldoh who had succeeded in gaining the walltop with the limp form of barkjon held between them bravely hillgorse swung the rock his strength failing as he shouted at the walltop get away from here felldoh save your father and the others another arrow struck hillgorse and the rope slipped from his paws the old hedgehogs eyes were misting over as he gave a final roar and hurled his spiky body into the ranks of the enemy felldoh tried to scramble back down to hillgorse but tullgrew hung on pulling him back we must escape he gave his life so we could be free felldoh bit his lip until blood showed he took one last look at the scene below badrang and his horde were beginning to mount the logs and scale the wall and the slaves who had not managed to escape were forcing their way back into the compound through the gap they had made felldoh still had the spear in his paw when he noticed who the last of the slaves was and shouted his name druwp the treacherous bankvole did not turn he knew who was calling him he tried to squeeze through the gap back into the stockade but found his way blocked by the slaves inside out of my way or ill report you those were the last words that druwp spoke felldoh threw the spear harder than he had ever thrown anything it found its mark between the traitors shoulder blades jump holding barkjon between them felldoh and tullgrew leaped from the walltop into the night it was a good drop but the strawpacked mattresses broke their fall the others were waiting for them they looked this way and that unsure which would be the best direction to take in the darkness suddenly a nearby rumbling caused them to crouch down in the wall shadows and a voice rang out what ho is that the disappearin fox felldoh gave a sigh of relief ballaw i see you managed to escape safely rather though at the moment theres a posse of pirates hot on our paws i say have you got ladies an young uns there aye and a wounded father and any moment now badrangll be coming over that wall with his horde calls for a bit of quick thinkin wot righto get the babes mothers an wounded into the cart everybeast fit to run get pushin but wait until i give the word wait for it the sound of cloggs crew rounding the outside of the back wall blended with the shouts of badrang and his horde who had now reached the walltop ballaw kicked the last of the straw mattresses away into the night and joined his friends at the cart head south smartly now look alive you chaps go the wheels of the small wagon nearly left the ground as it shot forward propelled by every ablebodied creature in moments it had clattered off into the darkness badrang pushed hisk and gurrad off the walltop grabbing others he began shoving them off into space jump you lilylivered toads the slaves did it easily enough come on you there nipwort fleabane jump bodies went flying from the walltop horde soldiers shut their eyes and leaped preferring the drop to badrangs towering anger the removal of the cushioning straw sacks made the landing hard for those who did not land on the heads of capn tramun clogg and several of his crew members ballaw had judged his timing right confusion reigned in the darkness as the corsair crew and the tyrants horde fought each other tooth and claw in the night a monster stood on the path in front of rose it had the body of a fox the talons of an owl and a huge snakelike head with three big goggling eyes surmounted above rows of fearsome teeth dashing madly along to where the dreadful screams were issuing from the mousemaid tried to stop at the sight of the horrendous apparition grumm and pallum cannoned into her back sending her staggering straight into the arms of the nightmare beast she screamed aloud in terror as she blundered into its embrace then it collapsed on the path in a dusty heap straw grass bark dead ferns and feathers swirled everywhere rose sneezed spitting out a mouthful of downy fur as pallum and grumm came gingerly forward to help her up burr wot be et huh mirdop its nothing but a great big doll hanging from the trees by bits of creeper rose dusted herself down looking around wildly wheres martin the horrendous screams had stopped to one side of the path martin sat upon a great hollow log chuckling quietly bravo rose youve just slain your first mirdop the mousemaid looked flustered but how and you those screams come over here and ill show you martin bent beside the hollow log and called aloud go back for i am the mirdop and i will slay you the sound thundered and reverberated around the forest magnified by the hollow ash log grumm uncovered his ears when the noise faded but oo wurr adoen all ee shouten martin took them around the other side of the big log to where four rabbits obviously mother father and two young were lying slumped oh dear you havent killed them martin rose gasped the young mouse shook his head and smiled of course not i couldnt harm creatures like these i sneaked up and saw what they were doing so i thought id take a leaf out of your book rose the mousemaid looked mystified then martin explained remember the warrior who uses the voice instead of the sword well i crept up behind them and started yelling as loud and horrible as i could of course being new at this sort of thing i suppose i underestimated the power of my cries the rabbits seemed to freeze then fainted right away rose hurried to the side of the two babes she stroked them tenderly until they began whimpering and moving poor little things you great bully martin fancy doing an awful thing like that grumm and pallum had to hide their faces to stop bursting out laughing at the sight of martin paws outstretched in bewilderment i didnt hurt them what was i supposed to do set about them with my sword or ask them nicely to please stop terrorizing travellers youre the one who went and destroyed their mirdop bully yourself rose fussed about wetting the older rabbits mouths with water until they revived instantly they drew back in horror aagh go away you savage creatures which one is grumm the growler and who is pallum the mighty and rose the slayer grumm tugged his snout respectfully at the female rabbit hurr tis oi marm but oi doant mean ee no arm martin took a slightly stronger line with them er just a moment please i think its we should be asking the questions what dyou mean by shouting threats and trying to intimidate travellers on this path the father rabbit held a shaky paw to his brow please not so loud were really delicate creatures you know allow me to introduce us im fescue this is my wife mildwort and these are the twins burnet and buttercup mirdops the family name hence the er figure we have to keep away intruders oh yes it was fescues great grandpa who built it his wife interrupted one never knows what horrid types of beast want to wander abroad on our path please dont harm us we were only protecting ourselves rose sat by mildwort mirdop and spoke soothingly we wouldnt dream of harming a nice little family like yours im sorry we frightened you but we were rather scared ourselves with all that threatening and roaring you were doing fescue laughed nervously er yes haha rather good wasnt it by the way have you had tea yet grumms stomach made a small gurgle as he rubbed it usns be allus ready furr vittles zurr do youm ave zoop mildwort stared down her snub nose at the mole hardly soup is not good for one at this time of day follow me please they followed the mirdop family down into their burrow it was large comfortable and spotless behind their backs pallum made a snooty gesture with paw to nose and grumm nodded in agreement tea was a very formal affair in the mirdop burrow first the guests were given lavenderscented soap warm water and soft barktowels to wash and dry their paws the two young rabbits were sent back several times until their parents were satisfied that their paws were cleaned properly then they all sat down at a small table mildwort mirdop brought a large pot of steaming mint tea with honey to go in it a platter of waferthin cucumber sandwiches and seven tiny oat scones each lightly spread with raspberry preserve she seated herself and in the silence that followed murmured quietly to her husband the grace before tea dear fescue coughed gently to clear his throat they all stared down at the spotless tablecloth while he repeated the grace for all we receive for tea thanks to the seasons be partake we sparingly of this good meal as they each chose a cucumber sandwich mildwort scolded burnet sandwiches first scones later put it back please baby burnet scowled slightly scones are my favrite fescue tweaked his ear lightly baby bunnies should be seen and not heard burnet dont talk back to your mother how many times must we tell you the meal was eaten rather quickly in polite frosty silence grumm made a sucking noise as he drained his teacup and sat back hurr theym noice scones marm oim partial to a noice scone mildwort sniffed so are we mr grumm there are more in the cupboard for tomorrow fescue smiled nervously as he nodded agreement indeed there are dear no sense in overstuffing with food er you say you are bound for noonvale ive no idea where the place is weve always lived by our path never moved away im afraid i cant give you any directions but im sure that from here youll have to cross the west marshes my advice to you is watch out for lizards nasty things cannibals i might add baby burnet nodded and agreed with his father cabbinals burnet fescue looked severely at him do not interrupt your elders and betters you are excused from the table you too buttercup dont stray far from the burrow and try to keep clean bedtime soon like two silent shadows the little ones got down from their chairs bobbed a curtsy and a bow to the guests and left the burrow with their mothers voice ringing in their ears walk dont run how many times must i tell you as she cleared away the tea things from under the noses of the still hungry travellers she said in a strained voice you are welcome to stay the night in our burrow rose kicked grumm beneath the table as he searched for crumbs how nice of you mrs mirdop but we wouldnt dream of imposing upon your good nature besides we have a long journey ahead of us and we must go while there is still daylight er you mentioned cannibal lizards mr mirdop fescue mirdop helped his wife to fold the tablecloth oh yes so i did right heres what you must do at the edge of the forest the marshes begin find the place called marshwood hill if the lizards trouble you then strike the gong you will see hanging from a hornbeam tree the warden will take care of you hes such a nice creature isnt he dear mildwort mirdop nodded vigorously oh yes the warden of marshwood hill a very very nice creature they took their leave of the mirdops thanking them for a pleasant stay mr and mrs mirdop waved before retreating back down their burrow grumm rummaged through their ration packs until he found some candied acorns and chestnuts the two baby mirdops were playing in front of the burrow and he gave them a pawful each of the nuts yurr babbies eatm oop noicen messy loik theym guidn sweet further along the path martin and rose fell about laughing as pallum imitated the hungry grumm at tea taking both the parts of the mole and mrs mildwort mirdop burr oim powful ungry give oi a scone missus no no you nasty rough mole one is quite sufficient hurr then give oi summ zoop marm soup lack a season the ruffian will eat us out of house and burrow go away and be off with you you gluttonous beast grumm drew his ladle and shook it at pallum one moor wurd out of ee an oill raise a bump on youm spikers late that evening they reached the forest edge standing on a small rise they looked down on the great west marshes spreading as far as the eye could see grasshoppers chirruped in the short hillgrass and myriad swarms of flies and midges were everywhere rose shooed a cloud away with a dead fern whew im not sleeping the night out here lets go back and camp in the fringe of the trees we can face this lot in the morning they slumped down wearily beneath a sycamore and a beech a slithering nearby caused martin to jump up two long slowworms snaked away hissing noisily disturbed from their rest the creatures made no move to attack but martin stood with short sword drawn watching them slither down the side of the rise toward the marshes pallum began collecting dry firewood and digging a shallow pit its all right theyre only slowworms evillooking reptiles they do lojs of hissing but they cant really harm you right grumm whatll it be cucumber sandwiches or one scone apiece the mole was busy digging out some mushrooms he had found he looked up shaking soil from his snout energetically zoop wem aven zoop aye an oill make a pudden too wi some apple an blackberries growen over yonder night fell warm and mild with the small fire burning red as they sat around it well fed and satisfied with their days progress tut tut mr grumm the growler rose teased grumm if i were you id put half that pudding away for the morrow youve eaten far too much already and its way past your bedtime the mole looked up from a ladleful of pudding and snorted oi shouldve left youm beoind wi they mirkdops mizzy teach youm some manners hurr they watched a full moon move silently from behind pillowy nightcloud formations it hung in the sky like a still newpolished silver coin the two slowworms had returned with them was a band of lizards twoscore strong their tongues slid silently in and out filmy eyes blinking constantly against the dry warmth of the night the two slowworms indicated where the sleeping travellers lay by thrusting their heads forward and hissing the lizard leader a great redfrilled reptile nodded his head slowly as he watched the glow from the red embers of the fire dying lower soon the fire would be cold and the four travellers deep in sleep the lizards waited patiently watching their leader waiting for him to move o it was fully dawn when the escaped slaves and the rambling rosehip players made their way back to the hideout on the southern cliffs puffing and panting they threw themselves down on the grass and lay in the cool morning breeze gauchee came later than the rest she had been watching their backtrack covering the cart marks and keeping a wary eye peeled for pursuers the mouse sat with her back to the cart nobeast following us they must still be busy righting among each other ballaw flopped his long ears thoughtfully from side to side maybe so but theyll try and find us i cant imagine old badthingy lettin half his slaves an us off that lightly wed be best postin a guard ill take first watch me an this jollylookin young mousey feller here whats your name sir they call me juniper righto juno me old nipper you an me are first guard rowanoak blew tenderly on her paws ooh thats better this dashing about all night doesnt suit me any more not as young as i used to be kastern what are you up to this morning well theres lot of new mouths to feed the sensible young mousemaid explained so im going to organize a forage party see what we can find to swell our larder out a bit ill take sonje of our new companions when theyve had a rest and a bite of breakfast rowanoak liked to keep her paw on the pulse of activities in camp she sat down and began massaging her footpaws hmm good idea whos on cooking duties this morning trefoil wiped wheat flour from her paws on a dockleaf it looks like its me again i did it yesterday too that celandine was supposed to take her turn today but shes probably off fluttering her pretty eyelashes at the new arrivals and enchanting them all oh is she well im not having any of that rowanoak stood up decisively there are no shirkers in this troupe everybeast pulls their weight where is she celandine celandine its no use hiding missy i want a word with you mlady rowanoak searched the camp several times before she began to get worried nobeast had seen the pretty squirrelmaid ballaw left sentry duty a moment to call an assembly attention please has anyone seen celandine barkjon held a healing poultice of herbs to his injured shoulder the wound was not as serious as it had appeared the previous night felldoh held his fathers head upright as brome fed him soup from a scallop shell drink up sir this is made from green nettles and i dont know what supposed to help recovery the old squirrel licked his lips as he finished the soup it tastes very nice whats going on over there some sort of meeting its a young squirrelmaid one of the company shes missing barkjon sat up a bit resting his back against his sons paws with his eyes halfclosed he nodded slowly i remember now was she an extremely pretty creature brome put aside the empty shell oh yes dyou recall her indeed i do though i was only half conscious i remember seeing her face over the back of the cart as she pushed i thought she was the nicestlooking squirrel i had ever seen i must have dozed off awhile because when i woke she wasnt there any more perhaps she tripped and fell aye brome nodded recalling the wild dash from marshank we were going so fast that nobeast would have noticed shes either lost or captured by now felldoh laid his father down carefully if shes lost ill find her barkjon struggled to get up but what if shes captured son then ill free her or die trying felldohs strong face radiated anger and hatred he strode off leaving brome and barkjon gazing after him the old squirrel shook his head let him go brome there is a great rage in my son against all that marshank stands for you were only there a short while he has spent most of his life as a slave i know how he feels soon the news was all over the camp that celandine was either lost or captured ballaw posted buckler on guard with juniper he conferred with rowanoak awhile then they both went to talk with felldoh the squirrel was sitting by the fire at his side lay a pile of short heavy driftwood lances he was hardening their points to needle sharpness by burning and rubbing them on a rock felldoh was intent on his work and he did not even bother to look up as the hare and badger approached what ho treejumper looks like youre armin yourself up to start a one beast war there wot felldoh continued sharpening the short lances as he replied whatever it takes ive got scores to settle at marshank rowanoak squatted alongside him need any help felldoh he pulled another lance from the fire and began grinding it to a point on the rock its not your fight i got your troupe into this and its time i did a bit myself without endangering others rowanoak nodded understandingly realizing felldoh was in no mood to be argued with she watched him awhile before picking up one of the lances and weighing it in her paw how far can you throw one of these things felldoh took the lance and stood up far enough my muscles are stronger than most after seasons working in badrangs rock quarry he threw the lance from the cliff top it sailed out over the beach a fair distance before burying itself point first in the sand not bad at all rowanoak winked at the hare ballaw and i can throw a short lance twice that distance id like to see you try felldoh laughed humorlessly ballaw sought around until he came up with a piece of driftwood not quite as long as the lances felldoh was making taking a knife he cut a deep notch across one end of the wood then hefted it and made several throwing motions a few more adjustments to the wood with his knife and ballaw nodded with satisfaction thats about right old chap pass me a javelin any onell do felldoh selected one of the short heavy javelins and gave it to ballaw the hare laid the javelin flat along his piece of wood point forward and the other end resting against the notch he had cut with the weapon lying flat on the wood against the notch he drew back his arm took a short hopskip and flung out holding on to the wood the javelin soared away passing felldohs weapon on the beach travelling onward and finally splashing down into the water on the tideline almost out of sight felldoh gasped as ballaw gave him the piece of wood here old lad you have it simple device eh wot makes your throwing arm twice its length and gives you double the distance felldoh looked at the javelin launcher as ballaw continued weve won many a supper at tribe gatherings in the south with one of those there was always some big brawny beast wagered he could throw a javelin farther than me or rowanoak the badger offered her paw to felldoh now do you want our help felldoh grasped the big paw his eyes alight with resolve lets go and see if theyve got celandine at marshank accusations flew thick and fast at marshank clogg and badrang blaming the whole thing on one another in the wake of the confusion at the rear wall while the remainder of the slaves were under heavy guard the other corsairs and horde members gathered in the courtyard to witness the argument raging between their leaders it was a fine show of rage spleen and insults hah lord igh an mighty badrang is it cant old on to arf a passel of defenceless slavebeasts yore a lobstertail id sooner be anything but a complete idiot who lets the enemy into marshank and has the gall to call them friends you always did keep your brains in your clogs tramun you buffoon buffoon yerself ye blown up pollywoggle there was

horde up and stop em lord gurrad whispered anxiously to the tyrant badrang gave the rat a withering glance stop them what for let me do the thinking gurrad if clogg recaptures the slaves wheres he going to take them whats he going to feed them on wheres he going to keep them penned up gurrad looked puzzled i dont know lord where badrang tapped a paw against his skull thats why youre a hordebeast and im a leader gurrad what else can clogg do but bring them back here when he does ill take them from him so what could be simpler than allowing capn tramun clogg to be our slave chaser gurrad sniggered gleefully rubbing his paws together youre a clever one sire a real clever one badrang buffed his claws on his fir and inspected them i could buy and sell an oaf like clogg anyday hell soon find that out to his cost celandine was lost when she tripped and fell while running through the night with the cart the young squirrelmaid had cracked her head and passed out on the spot dawn had broken a full hour before she came to celandines first reaction was to sit and cry and she did so sobbing and wailing brokenheartedly she lay on the clifftop kicking her footpaws and nursing a bruised lump just below her ear near her jawline at regular intervals she would stop and sniff calling out the names of ballaw rowanoak buckler and felldoh hearing no reply the pretty squirrelmaid would throw herself back fullthroated into a bout of copious bellowing and weeping why did no one come there was always somebeast round to dance attention when tears flowed down her beautiful face it took quite a long time for celandine to realize that she was totally alone so she set about doing what she did best preening herself and attending to her looks she brushed licked dusted and primped holding her head coyly on one side so that the curve of her bushy tail hid the unsightly bump she had suffered then she sat again and bemoaned her fate aloud to the bright morning air owwww why doesnt somebeast come for me my heads aching and i must look a dreadful sight owww im hungry and thirsty and dusty and dirty and now im lost owoooh the weasel floater had been scouting ahead he made his way back to where clogg was leading the crew no tracks of the carts capn they finish over yonder musta been somebeast coverin the trail clogg looked at the ground chewing one of his beard plaits covered ye say bad fortune fer us matey lookit ere comes ole crosstooth mayap e as some news the fox pointed at a tangent to where the cart tracks had finished found a set of pawprints goin thataway capn but tis only one beast clogg spat the plait out and scratched his nose cfcie beast is better than none i allus says mate lead on they had not gone far when the sounds of celandines lamentations reached their ears tramun clogg signalled for silence bellying down the corsairs breasted a low hill they peered over at the weeping squirrelmaid gruzzle shook his head sympathetically aint she pretty capn its enough t break yer eart clogg chewed at a dandelion still attached to its stem aye tis sad matey an even sadder when i thinks of the way im goin to make that liddle beauty wail when i tickles some information out o her with me cutlass point celandine was still crying and talking aloud to herself oh why dont any of the troupe come and find me owww oh dear i mustnt weep so much or ill look all ugly and puffy ho that ye will me liddle weepin willow come on now dry yore eyes an give ole uncle clogg a big smile celandine looked up in terror standing not ten paces from her was the corsair stoat and his villainous crew she choked out a small frightened whimper as clogg drew his cutlass and advanced on her grinning wickedly martin and his friends were captured so quickly it made their heads whirl one moment they were sleeping peacefully and in a twinkling they were dragged up on to their footpaws tough vine ropes secured their paws tight with nooses that locked around their necks the dark slithering shapes of lizards were everywhere slinking around the treetrunks and writhing over each other making no other sound than a sibilant hiss with his paws pinioned to the sides of his head by the vine that encircled his neck martin struggled to get loose and reach his short sword shouting to rose and the others rose are you all gaaaargh the big redfrilled lizard pulled savagely on the vine choking martin into silence the young mouse tugged either side of his neck striving to loosen the vine so he could breathe properly then they were off at a headlong run pulled along cruelly with countless lizards flanking them and shoving from behind splashing through marshwater cludging through mud crashing through nettles they rushed through the night rose sobbed for breath tripping on a root she fell flat in some ferns the speeding reptiles did not stop or even slow they continued their mad stampede dragging her along thumping and bumping across the soggy earth how she fought her way back upright rose never knew but she was certain she would have been dragged to her death had she not done so grumms short legs battered the earth as he was dragged and swept along in the midst of the lizard throng somewhere close he could hear pallums ragged gasps as his friend fought for air on the end of a strangling vine noose battering through evilsmelling liquid and bubbling marsh gases they pelted onward mud flying everywhere as lizard tails waved and scaly legs leaped high in the reptile stampede martin lost all count of time or distance until like his three friends he passed out from lack of air and was dragged along by the neck morning in the marshes was overcast with wraithing grey mist tinged with yellow sulphurous wisps the four bodies that lay tied to stakes were practically unrecognizable as a mole a hedgehog and two mice they were completely covered in thick caking mud and clay from the wild run martin stirred and coughed his throat hurt abominably martin are you all right it was pallum the hedgehog resembled a round ball of clay pallum im alive at least how are you be much better when my old neck stops hurtin ive been awake an hour or more but i lay still didnt want to attract attention from those creepy lizards theyre all round us martin strained his neck slightly the vine was still looped around it though now his paws were free lizards were everywhere just sitting and staring at them he noticed the large redfrilled leader had the short sword lying on the ground in front of him martin crawled across to rose loosening the vine on her neck he patted her muddied cheeks calling her name rose rose a jumble of lizards dived on him pulling the noose tight as they dragged him away from rose martin fought back as best as he could shouting through the scaly bodies that enveloped him i was only trying to let her breathe you scaly villains let me go we werent trying to escape the big redfrilled lizard stalked slowly across he kicked the others off martin and dragged the young mouse back to his stake hissing softly he gave the vine a final sharp tug indicating that martin should stay in that spot flicking his serpentine tongue he turned and slid gracefully back to his former position pallum looked across at martin and shrugged dont say much do they wed best sit tight and wait for rose and grumm to come around both rose and her mole friend revived some short time later they sat massaging sore necks easing the tight vines off to enable easier breathing the big redfrill gave the vines a tug when he thought they had messed enough with them he hissed softly and sat watching the four captives after a while they got to know the rules they were allowed to talk but only in quiet tones if they talked loudly or pulled at the nooses the lizards would yank hard tightening the vines and hiss soft warnings at them grumm picked burrs and mud from his face theym sloimy vurmints aroight soilent tho nary a word do theym lizzyards be aspeaken hush now grumm martin muttered quietly and urgently theyre coming over here silently a group of lizards came to each of the prisoners and deposited by them four large gourds of water the reptiles retreated and sat watching rose tilted one of the gourds and sipped then she drank deep gratefully its water good clean and fresh i never knew it could taste so nice they drank their fill dashed some in their faces to wash away the dirt and grime then sat waiting next to come was a great wooden pan fashioned from a section of lime trunk the redfrilled leader indicated that it be placed in the centre of the area between the four stakes where the captives could reach it again the reptiles retired to watch the vessel was filled with a warm creamcoloured mixture pallum ventured a dip into it with his paw he licked at the stuff and shrugged food tastes like some kind of porridge not much flavor in it though hmmm yes i think it tastes a bit like mushroom they all tried some and agreed it was palatable enough but had hardly any taste grumm shovelled a pawful into his mouth hurr taint zoop or nothink noice but et aint bad burr no rose had taken several mouthfuls she splashed a little water on her paws to cleanse them huh its not very good either ive had enough of that tasteless mush thank you the redfrill stalked sinuously over to her he tugged the vine sharply indicating that she should carry on eating rose sighed and looked across at martin old frilly neck wont be happy until weve eaten all our dinner up like good little creatures i suppose id better try some more martin licked his paw and dug in again mushroom porridge its deadly boring huh hu huh pallum chuckled as he spoke through a mouthful dyou think theyre trying to fatten us up a bit suddenly they stopped eating the horror of what the hedgehog had just said dawned on them what was it mr mirdop said rose whispered in a hushed voice cannibal lizards twice that day more bowls of porridge and gourds of water were brought to them if they showed signs of refusing to eat the big redfrill would tug on the vines until they began choking grumm groaned as he noticed several of the reptiles scraping ashes from a long pit at the edge of the lizard settlement others began laying charcoal and dry wood in it martin seethed silently if only he could break away and reach his short sword but it was impossible they were watched by scores of gaping lizards who seemed to have little else to do but sit and look at them the young mouse lay back his mind racing furiously against the insurmountable problem a dipper appeared on a low branch nearby the little bird nodded its head from side to side ruffling its handsome browny red plumage and preening at its fawncolored breast it made a twittering noise and rose looked at it strangely martin that bird is talking to us noting that the lizards were still watching martin kept his voice to a quiet conversational level can you understand it rose i think so its said the same thing twice now ganna aitcha gannc aitcha im pretty sure its saying going to eat you going to eat you meaning the lizards are going to eat us youre right rose martin trembled with excitement trying hard to keep his voice under control the lizards must not be able to understand it or theyd have chased it off by now see if you can get it to carry a message to the warden of marshwood hill ganna alpiz ganna alpiz rose made a strange noise halfway between a whistle and a chatter the little dipper nodded pecking at the branch alpichoo alpichoo pallum had been listening what did it say i tried to ask it for help rose explained ganna alpiz sounds a bit like going to help us it replied alpichoo which sounds like help you grumm came in on the conversation ho urr but ow youm goin t say warden o marshywood ill rose pondered a moment right how does this sound she made a lilting sound whoa hoo din alpiz whoa hoo din alpiz the dipper puffed out his tiny chest and flew off trilling whoa hoo din whoa hoo din martin sat up slowly well hes gone now i take it that whoa hoo din meant warden rose it was the closest i could get whoa hoo din alpiz warden help us lets hope the dipper understood oh no theyre bringing more porridge silent lizards replaced the empty bowl with a fresh one of the sickly warm mushroom porridge and full water gourds were brought rose held her stomach and pulled a face yukk i cant eat any more of this filthy rubbish the redfrill came striding over martin could tell that he was going to tug roses neck vine tight the young mouses warrior spirit boiled over at the thought of the reptile tormenting rose as the redfrill stalked past him martin let out a yell and smashed the water gourd over its head in a flash they were grappling martins neck vine strained tight as he pushed the redfrills head straight into the porridge leaning his full weight to keep it there as he tried to drown the reptile here frilly try some of your own medicine before rose pallum or grumm could help a mob of lizards were upon martin smothering him with their pulsing bodies as they freed their leader four of them untied martins neck vine from its stake the red frill hissed balefully at him tongue flickering in and out constantly helpless and weighted down by numbers the young mouse was dragged off towards the firepit two lizards put flint to tinder and leaped back as a curl of smoke arose other lizards flung themselves on rose pallum and grumm as the mousemaid screamed at the top of her voice leave him alone you filthy crawlers put that fire out sometimes in a pinch frivolous young squirrelmaids can turn out far more resourceful than they themselves would have known so it was with celandine as a rambling rosehip player she had acted the part of the brave and beautiful heroine many times now was her chance to give a star performance capn tramun clogg advanced on her leering and winking roguishly haharr dont be afeared o me pretty little bird soon youll be singin just fer me celandine backed off throwing up her paws in horror begone you great ugly toad put not a paw near me clogg who had always imagined himself as a handsome buccaneering beast halted indignantly ugly toad you hardnosed liddle snip come ere i say never i would rather die hoho missy that kin be arranged now be still or youll make it worse on yoreself clogg leaped at her clutching with his free paw celandine stumbled back half tripping she grabbed a pawful of the sandy soil and flung it straight into the corsairs face regaining her balance she dashed off clogg dropped his cutlass and sat down hard pawing at his eyes which were jammed full of loose gritty dust get after that bold baggage an catch er he howled at his crew lively now ill ave er ears fer dinner an er liver n tripes tore out only gruzzle stayed back to look after clogg the rest set off at a run after celandine laughing and cheering they knew a single squirrelmaid could not get far with an entire crew of corsairs hard on her paws celandine ran as she had never run before wishing that she had not added all the frills and furbelows to her rambling rosehip tunic they impeded her and often caused her to stumble behind her she could hear the whoops and guffaws of her pursuers as they drew closer the squirrelmaids breath came in ragged sobs she was unused to running any great distance capn clogg had made it plain that he meant her harm and there was no telling what might happen to her if she fell into the claws of searats and corsairs death would be inevitable not knowing where she was running to celandine forced her flagging limbs onward three searats critter crableg and bluddnose took the lead outstripping the rest of cloggs crew easily they were good runners lean and fit a sand dune rose up in front of celandine and there was no way round it she panted fitfully going down on all fours as she attempted to scramble up the hill crableg put on an extra spurt and dived forward he managed to catch the squirrelmaids back footpaw wriggling swiftly on to her back celandine kicked out she caught him hard on the snout causing crableg to release her the searat was so close he could have reached out and touched her you aint goin to be pretty no more squirrel he snarled as he wiped a stream of blood from his snout on to the back of his paw whipping a curved dagger from his waist sash he brandished it suddenly a wooden lance seemed to grow out of his chest crableg looked down at it and fell dead with a foolish expression of surprise on his face the slaying happened so quickly that gritter and bluddnose had not seen it they arrived panting at the dune to find their messmate lying dead with the short wooden lance protruding from him like a ships mast there was no other creature in sight except the squirrelmaid her eyes wide with horror gritter drew his sword and walked uphill towards her you killed crableg wi that piece o wood you lid die serpint as he raised the sword another javelin came whistling through the air and transfixed him through the throat bluddnose had drawn his sword but his nerves failed him with a small wail of fright he flung the weapon away and took to his heels back towards the main group who were now in sight celandine sat shocked looking at the two dead searats in front of her celandine climb the hill get up here quickly a hoarse urgent voice called from the hilltop she sat staring at the carcasses of crableg and gritter unable to comprehend what had happened move yourself missy ballaws voice rang out theatrically come on up here or youll miss your cue automatically celandine picked herself up and scrambled dumbly to the hilltop rowanoaks huge paws swept her over the hill and out of sight the badger clamped a paw over the squirrelmaids mouth and ballaw and felldoh fixed fresh javelins on to their throwers crosstooth the fox had always liked crablegs curved dagger he took it from the searats lifeless paw and tucked it into his belt as he nudged critters body with his spearshaft ymean to tell us that the pretty liddle squirrel did this bluddnose was shaking uncontrollably well there was nobeast else ereabouts she musta did it the ferret boggs curled his lip scornfully did ye see the squirrel kill em bluddnose sat down on the duneside head in paws no i never one moment they was large as life next thing theyre both dead she mustve done it cant yer see shes vanished i knew we should never ave messed with magic beasts a weasel called floater swapped his own chipped and rusted sword for the better blade that gritter had once owned and scoffed aloud vanished me tail we seen er go over this ere dune see theres the beautys pawtracks im goin up there an get er meself clogg stumped to join the rest with gruzzle at his side still trying to clear the corners of his capns eyes with a none too clean silk kerchief tramun shoved him away and patted floaters back aye theres the laddo up the ill ye go floater sing out if you sees anythin up there as they stood watching the weasel scale the dune clogg muttered in his beard to himself nay it werent no snip of a squirrelymaid did fer two tough rogues like crableg an ole gritter the beast that did this could sling a lance good an proper shielding his eyes clogg squinted up at the weasel who had made it to the top of the hill ahoy floater any signs o life up there the weasel waved his paws wildly shouting aloud capn its threeeeeeeeeee floater came rumbling awkwardly back down the dune flopping this way and that hampered in his fall by the short lance through the center of his back the body halted its sliding descent right in front of the capns big wooden clogs three o me best fightin beasts slain harr the murderin scoundrels ooever they are right buckoes arm yerselves an take the ill chaaarge clogg stood back whirling his cutlass as he urged them on the charge was not a notable success nobeast wanted to reach the top first and there was a deal of hanging back and accidental stumbling before clogg realized what was going on the pirate stoat did a small dance of anger clogs clicking sharply you bottlenosed bloaters get up that ill right now dye hear me thats an order from yer capn go on chaaaaarge they stood awkwardly about a third of the way up the dune still unwilling to storm the hilltop clogg unsheathed his cutlass and began bustling his way up knocking crew members left and right as he did out o me way yer mackrelfaced milkswiggin muckeads yore nothin but a pack o ringtailed cowards as they turned to look sheepishly at him a searat called wulpp screamed when a short javelin zinged out of nowhere and slammed right through his footpaw the charge immediately deteriorated into an undignified rush down the hill clogg followed in their rear berating them soundly one liddle spear an yore all runnin about like beetles in a bucket ho shame i never thought id see the day a crew o mine would dash off without even seein the enemy when they were a reasonable distance from the big dune the corsairs stopped and sat down on a grassy sward tramun came clattering up with wulpp limping slowly several lengths behind the corsair capn slumped down and began emptying sand from his clogs gruzzle im fair disappointed in you matey an you dedjaw an you boggs mateys what are ye all afeared of a few ole sharpened wooden sticks whangl a needlepointed lance arced out of the blue summer sky narrowly missing tramun clogg as it pinned his coat skirt to the ground the corsair capn leaped up as if he had been beestung ripping his coat from the quivering lance in the process tidal waves an typhoons there must be a monster beind yon ill nobeast could hurl a lance that far the rout continued with clogg in the lead as they scurried back to the safety of marshank behind the sand dune felldoh lay watching over the rim at the retreating corsairs ballaw blew a long sigh of relief as he put down his javelins and thrower good job they never charged the bally top an stormed us there was enough of the blighters rowanoak dusted sand from herself there certainly was imagine if theyd got past us our camp is only over the next hill south and east on the clifftops celandine suddenly bounced back as if nothing had happened primping the lace hems of her tunic she remarked airily oh yes i had an idea it was thats why i headed over this way ballaw rolled his eyes upward in mock despair you dreadful little fibber miss you were coming this way because a band of ruffians were chasing you o them celandine tossed her tail huffily i knew they wouldnt get me felldoh turned around from the dune rim but how did you know celandine clasped both his paws fluttering her eyelids wildly because i knew in my heart that my brave felldoh would come to my rescue and you did rowanoak smiled and shook her huge head come on brave felldoh lets get this ruthless charmer back to camp felldoh felt his face burning as celandine hung on his paws praising him outrageously youre so strong so courageous and so accurate with your sharp little sticks ooh look i pricked my paw on one when they had gone brome emerged from hiding he had followed felldoh with the intention of joining him until the badger and the hare decided to help his friend brome had stayed out of sight knowing that ballaw and rowanoak would have sent him packing back to camp so he secreted himself in a clump of tor grass and watched them rescuing celandine brome had grown a lot bolder since his escape from marshank he admired felldoh and wanted to be like him but he was treated as a young one in the camp brome climbed the dune and peered down on the three dead corsairs imagining himself launching lances alongside felldoh and simmering with resentment at being left out he slid down the dune on his bottom and sat looking at the three lifeless figures after a while the young mouse ventured to pick up the sword which lay near gritter he swung it in the air trying a few fancy strokes an idea forming in his head as he did there were still a good number of slaves to be freed from marshank imagine the looks on the faces of felldoh ballaw and rowanoak if he brome came marching back with a score or so of slaves that he had rescued the more brome swung the sword the more he liked the idea he would do it arming himself with the sword and a dagger from floaters belt he dressed himself up in an assortment of corsair gear which he took from the three bodies smudging up his face with a few pawfuls of dust brome pulled the brim of crablegs floppy hat down at a rakish angle and set off for fortress marshank swaggering along like a villainous searat he practised the brogue haharr im bucktail as good a matey that ever sailed the seas an plundered landlubbers haharr an hoho as grumm pallum and rose tugged at their neck vines they screamed and shouted insults and threats despite the menacing presence of the lizards who surrounded them martin did not waste breath on words he fought savagely tooth and paw as the reptiles dragged him bodily towards the fire pit the redfrilled leader stood impassively by tongue flickering throat pulsing silent as the rest of his tribe martin drew blood from several of the beasts kicking butting biting and gouging whenever he could force a movement among the swarming lizards whose bodies swamped and stifled his every attempt the fire took off and began crackling pale wisps of smoke rising to blend with the fetid air as hungry golden red flames danced and nickered in the cooking pit a piercing offkey cry rang through the marshlands immediately all activity among the lizards stopped the noise rent the still air a second time it was not a pleasant sound something akin to the screech of a gate with rusty hinges coupled with a loud gurgling ululation the redfrilled leaders head shook from side to side eyes flickering and filming as he hissed what appeared to be some type of warning or command the rest of the reptiles went into swift silent action hustling martin and his three friends together they hauled the neck vines tight securing them firmly to the stakes so that the four captives were forced to lie with their faces in the dirt ferns leafy boughs rushes shrubs and all manner of vegetation were piled hurriedly on the prisoners until they were lost to view several lizards perched on top of the pile stretching themselves out as if napping beneath the oppressive heap martin and his companions fought desperately for breath a fully grown male grey heron stalked majestically into the lizard encampment towering high over the heads of the reptiles as they stood still like statues the warden of marshwood hill was an immense bird he glared down at the lizards from his enormous height darkpupilled pale gold eyes watching them from over a savage yellow pair of beak spikes throwing back the snakelike column of his powerful neck he gave throat to a chilling shriek the twin black feathers on his skull back vibrating the dipper zoomed down from the branches of a gnarled wychelm at the edge of the clearing it landed among the lizards perched on top of the vegetation and did an excited hopskip dance the grey heron moved fearlessly and fast long black sticklike legs pounding the ground as it spread awesome silk grey wings and charged the heap the lizards scuttled over each other in their attempts to get out of its way but they were flung high into the air as the heron scattered the foliage demolishing the entire pile with wings beak and claw webbed feet martin rose grumm and pallum lay exposed on the ground writhing feebly as they pulled at the taut neck vines the wardens dangerous amber beak clacked perilously close to their heads as he severed the vines with careless ease he watched them for a moment until martins eyes opened leaning close he spoke to the young mouse in a precise clipped manner lie still stay there do not interfere lizards got to deal with them the warden strode a measured pace around the camp there was complete silence he glared at the reptiles the lizards stood motionless tongues in eyes filmed over as if completely cowed by the mad intensity of the herons stare martin watched fascinated the whole affair was carried out in complete silence the heron would point to the captives with its beak then glare at the lizards they remained motionless regardless of whether or not he trod on heads bodies or tails the warden stalked about the camp finally halting in front of the redfrilled leader with a slow contemptuous movement of one leg the heron flicked the redfrill over on to its back it was obviously a challenge that the lizard leader had to accept wriggling upright the redfrill hissed and circled to attack lying between pallum and martin rose watched in horror as the grey herons beak flashed down oh how horrible martin covered her eyes with his paw dont look rose i think i can guess what hes going to do next grumm turned his face aside burr oo dearie oi never could oi be that ungry pallum nodded in agreement as the warden turned on another lizard guaw i never seen nothing like that its disgusting martin shrugged maybe youve forgotten but those lizards were going to eat us the big bird is dealing out his justice to them the killers beak flashed down several more times until the warden of marshwood hill had taken his fill he swallowed and gulped then threw back his head and gave a sharp cry it was a signal that the lizards were dismissed they scattered into the marshes in seconds leaving the camp deserted except for the four friends and the grey heron wiping his beak methodically on a grassy tussock he strode across to them i am warden of marshwood hill these are my marshes and i am the only law lizards are lawbreakers toads and snakes also i do what must be done martin bowed formally i am martin this is rose pallum and grumm we wish to thank you for saving our lives we are travelling through your marshes on our way to noonvale i was hoping you could help us with some directions the little dipper had landed next to rose she was stroking its head the warden preened his huge downy breast awhile as if considering what martin had said i know no noonvale but i have heard its name spoken i will guide you through my marshes obey my laws or i kill you lawbreakers must be killed gather your things and follow me martin picked up his sword grumm found his ladle rose and the dipper found the packs they were untouched the lizards had not bothered with them can you put out fire the warden pointed his beak at pallum i do not like fire the hedgehog was about to reply when grumm ambled over oi cn put theym foire out zurr wardun ho urr the mole positioned himself by the fire pit and set to work with his remarkable digging claws shooting damp marsh earth backwards he dug furiously in a short time the fire pit was reduced to a smouldering mass covered in the earth that grumm had spread on it the warden nodded abruptly i could not do that you are a useful creature grumm tipped a paw to his snout thankee zurr tho youm as thoi own uses oi spect keepin ee law in these yurr swamps but the warden was not listening he was stalking off out of the camp calling back to them come follow me i will guide you through my marshes to the mountain i must stay here i am the law as they trekked over what appeared to be a slender trail through the wetlands grumm whispered to pallum yurr they burd doant say much do ee pallum could not resist doing a comical impression of the warden strutting stifflegged he glared at grumm and spoke sharply i am the law these are my marshes i am the law both the hedgehog and the mole burst into subdued chuckles the warden turned and glared at them make fun of the law and i deal with you i am the law pallum and grumm froze for a moment then they saluted vigorously yes sir understood sir youm ee law zurr ho urr gudd foine martin walked along with rose he nodded at the little bird hopping by her side i see youve got a new friend rose whats his name the mousemaid stroked the little creatures downy head dipper thats what he is and thats what ill call him martin did you hear what the warden said hed guide us to the mountain i wonder where that is me too i suppose the only way well find out is by following him he seems to know the country well enough oh yes and dyou know why that is martin smiled knowingly leaning close he whispered into roses ear so that the warden could not hear because he is the law the marshes were dreary foggy and misty drab and treacherous the travellers followed the grey heron step for step being careful not to deviate from the tortuously narrow trail either side of them mosshung branches stuck up like spectral limbs from the greendark ooze that exuded occasional bubbles and wisps of swamp gas the only sign that evening was approaching was that the atmosphere grew decidedly gloomier the warden halted at a juncture where two paths crossed to form a wooded islet they sat down in the damp grass as the grey heron looked about camp here tonight travel tomorrow grumm took out his ladle and set about snapping dead twigs hurr thank gudness fur that cmon pallum lend ee thoi paw yurr the piercing eyes of the warden stopped them in their tracks what do you do make zoop zurr grumm waved his ladle about chuckling per zoop youm need a foire youm loik moi zoop i do not know zoop make no fire i am the law i do not like fire somewhere nearby a frog croaked in the marsh the warden followed the direction of the sound with his savage eyes he swallowed hungrily stay here do not move frogs are about they are lawbreakers i am the law i will deal with them he stalked off into the darkening mists when he was out of sight pallum gave a short humorless laugh looks to me like the law wants its supper rose was unpacking rations what a dreadful idea she shuddered martin helped her prepare their meal maybe so but without the warden of marshwood hill wed have been lizard lunch today the bird is a necessary evil believe me rose laid out two fruit flans some hazelnut scones and the last canteen of mint and lavender cordial the food was a bit battered and squashed but still very tasty rose laughed as they watched the dipper pecking furiously at a scone oh look martin dippers really enjoying himself ill bet hes never tasted anything as nice the tiny bird sprayed them with crumbs as he attempted to communicate his pleasure to his newfound friends goodiz goodiz after supper the dipper whistled and chirped happily when he had finished they applauded him martin lay back sipping at the tangy cordial wish i could sing like that ive got the worst singing voice in the world come on rose sing something to cheer us up in this gloomy marsh the mousemaid obliged willingly her wondrous clear voice ringing melodiously into the deep marshland night o happy is as happy does misery never useful was and i am happy now because im with the ones i love sing fol lol loh a lairy lay let the sun shine bright all day so ill go happy on my way with the good ones that i love o fie on you o great disgrace look at that sad unhappy face ill not walk with you not one pace youre not the one i love sing dumble dum and derry dee youll have to smile to

ho no oim no gurt shakes at ee darncen youm papa allus used to larff when oi darnced well papas not here now so youll dance or well tell the warden that youve been making fun of him rose picked up

darnce then youm awful crool beasts rose could see that the mole wanted to sing and dance come on grummyface do your party piece the one about your old grandfather i like that one mole dancing is a

took a bow he was puffing from the exertion of song and dance combined the warden appeared as if from nowhere he stared hard at grumm and shook his head once good at putting out fire not at singing mouse rose is the best singer i know this sleep now dipper you go back to your family nest sometime before dawn martin stirred vague muffled sounds had gradually wakened him he lay awhile taking stock of their hostile surroundings the muffled sounds continued rolling over slowly he checked the sleeping forms of rose grumm and pallum they were deep in slumber breathing peacefully martins eyes strayed over to where the grey heron was lying it was hard to tell in the darkness but he sensed that something was not right he peered long at the bird his paw straying to the short sword stuck in the ground near his head the warden appeared to be rolling about in his sleep making muffled noises slowly martin rose until he was crouching placing his paws carefully among the damp grass tussocks he edged over something slimy slapped him in the face as he reached the moving figure of the warden there were dark shapes all over the great bird and it was moving more slowly and weakly as his eyes became accustomed to the darkness martin saw that creatures he could not make out were strangling the grey heron winding about its neck while others secured its legs and wings so that was what the muffled noises were they must have been attacking the warden for some time because the big birds struggles were very weak martin threw himself into the fray with a shout that wakened his three friends instantly yaaaaah maaaaartin it was getting towards evening and shadows were beginning to lengthen on the shoreline as brome climbed down from the cliffs ahead of him he could see wulpp the searat who had taken felldohs javelin through his footpaw limping along by himself suddenly brome had an idea that might gain him entrance into marshank he padded silently up until he was almost level with wulpp hi there mate you the beast they left beind wulpp sat down on the sand wincing as he nursed his paw aye thats me whats yer name matey brome sat down by him and began ripping a strip from his shirt harr im bucktail capn sent me back for ye i was walkin along the clifftops when i saw you down ere old still while i binds that paw up fer ye messmate wulpp gritted his teeth as brome worked aagh it urts bad bucktail wot dye think will it give me a limp for the rest o me life moren likely bucko brome nodded as he tied the improvised bandage off neatly you was lucky it didnt catch you igher or youda been a goner come on mate up on yer paws ill give yer a lift back to the fortress hopping on one paw the injured searat threw an arm about bromes shoulders and leaned on him as they made their way slowly back bucktail eh well my names wulpp an i wont fergit yer fer the elp youve give me this day messmate they entered the fortress as darkness fell nobeast paid much attention to them both the main center of attraction was the continuing feud between the two leaders clogg sat on the courtyard stones surrounded by his crew as he tore ravenously at hard bread and dried fish guzzling seaweed ale from an oversized tankard badrang stood on the porch of his longhouse haranguing the corsair now let me get this right one creature a single squirrelmaid at that killed three of your great hairy waverobbers and wounded another well lack a season and lose a day clogg hurled a hard crust at badrang it fell short harr go an boil yer ead stoatears you was safe enough inside o yer fancy fortress surrounded by yer lubbernosed orde badrang leaned over the porch rail his voice mocking and what pray was the dreaded capn tramun clogg doing while this dreadful slaughter took place hiding from the squirrelmaid cloggs nose glinted purple with rage as he spat out dried fish it werent no squirrelymaid did the killin it was those excaped slaves o yourn throwin javelins an by the way they could throw id ate t be in yer shirt if they attacks ere the tyrant spread his paws appealingly to the listeners why should they come back here after escaping strikes me theyd want to put as much distance between themselves and marshank as possible by the way hows your ship refloating coming along a slow smile spread across cloggs villainous face much the same as yer stone quarryin an field croppin me ole messmate ave yer done much empire buildin today haharrharr stung by the taunt that had rebounded on him badrang pointed his sword at the corsair ill remind you that youre eating my food clogg and your worthless mob of seascum are filling their bellies at my expense too but all thats going to change from now on if you want to eat our supplies at marshank youll have to earn your food like any of my creatures clogg hurled the tankard it smashed on the ground in front of badrang as the corsair bellowed defiantly we aint yer creatures me an my crew is seabeasts rovers an freebooters were onourin you by takin our meals ere cos you owe us that much you boatburnin barnacle wed ave sailed off from this fort long since but for yer treachery brome threw a paw about wulpp steering him towards the walls of the slave compound cmon mate lets find someplace for you to sit easy we cant stand around listenin to those two stoats jawin each other to death while yer paws injured bad they sat with their backs against the wooden fence harr tis rest you need wulpp brome spoke loudly on purpose a good deep sleepd do you a power o good matey sleep the best healer of all wulpp did not argue he was weary and his footpaw throbbed relentlessly closing his eyes he lay back right you are bucktail i feel like i could sleep fer a season keyla had been listening to the two creatures on the other side of the fence curiosity overcame the young otter and he was not long in climbing the timbers to peer over the top at the pair brome made sure that wulpps eyes were closed and they were not being observed then he swept the floppy hat from his head and grinned cheekily up at keyla holding up a warning paw he pointed at wulpp stroking the searats head gently and crooning in a soft voice sleep matey you need a long deep sleep long an deep keyla understood he gave a broad wink and disappeared brome continued speaking soothingly to the halfasleep wulpp sleep matey thats all you need sleepy sleep sleep wulpps eyelids flickered he glanced at brome and smiled lazily bucktail me ole matey you looks like some kind o mouse without yore hat on assisted by a mouse named yarrow keyla popped up over the compound top between them they held a big improvised sandbag whump wulpps head was a target they could not miss the heavy object landed forcefully knocking the searat out like a light hes got enough on his mind to keep him asleep a good while the irrepressible keyla giggled brome what are you doing back here friend the young mouse clamped his floppy hat back on ive come to get you and the rest away from here keyla though i thought youd have escaped with the last lot the young otter shook his head i could have but theres old ones and some babes here that werent quick enough to get away i couldnt hop it and leave them just because i was young and fast now could i brome propped wulpps head on the sandbag as if it were a pillow youre a good otter keyla listen heres the plan well get them all out between us tonight gurrad watched as badrang poured poison into a flagon of blackberry grog great seasons sire theres enough in there to lay an army out badrang shook the small vial to make sure the last drops went in clogg could never resist a drop of blackberry grog itll be his last drop laced with wolfbane and hemlock theres not a creature born who could drink that and live to tell the tale he pulled gurrad close his voice a sinister hiss listen now rat heres what you must do the rat called oilback threw his knife it zipped through the air to bury itself deep in the driftwood spar set up on the beach capn tramun clogg grunted as he tugged the quivering blade free and returned it to its owner good throw matey i likes to see a beast whos skilled at slingin a frogsticker do it agin oilback the searat twirled his knife expertly closed one eye sighted and threw hard this time the blade went a third of its length into the timber clogg clapped his back heartily haharr yore a murderer born oilback now cock a lug matey an listen to a liddle plan that ive arranged fer that stingy grubswipin former partner o mine the moon appeared over marshank casting pale light and deep shadow over the fortress where three separate schemes were being laid two for death and one for freedom brome hastily rearranged his corsair gear there was little difference in the illassorted rags worn by cloggs pirates and those of badrangs soldiers and in no time brome looked every inch the hordebeast keyla did the same improvising with wulpps tawdry rags minutes later two ruthless hordebeasts marched straight past the guards and into the slave compound stay at the rear and help any stragglers brome signalled to yarrow righto listen friends all you have to do is follow keyla and me if anybeast stops or challenges us dont you say a word leave the talking to me stay in the shadows as much as possible dont hurry too much and above all be silent they set off towards the main courtyard with brome and keyla leading the group badrang corked the flagon shaking it well before he gave it to gurrad see if theyre asleep dont chance it otherwise if everything is all right then sneak up close to clogg hes usually sleeping near to the largest campfire place the flagon in his paw or as close as you can get to it that stupid plaited buffoon doesnt care what he drinks when he wakes in the morning the flagon will be the nearest thing to him hell pop the cork and guzzle it right off i know him of old go now im trusting you to do the job right gurrad swathed in a dark cloak the rat left the longhouse standing in the shadows at the side of the longhouse was another cloaked figure oilback held his knife by the blade ready to throw the doorway area was illuminated in a patch of moonlight his paw trembled a little from the tension of waiting and the enormity of his task it was not just any common crewbeast that got to kill lord badrang the tyrant of marshank no it was he oilback the best knifethrower in all capn cloggs crew he heard the creak of the door as it opened tightening his grip on the blade he closed one eye and took aim a cloaked figure stole out shutting the door carefully behind it oilback grunted with exertion as he hurled his weapon it was a good throw the cloaked figure collapsed silently off the porch oilback hurried forward retrieving his knife from gurrads throat he wiped the blade giving a low snarl of dismay when he saw the dead features of the creature he had slain it was not badrang his footpaw struck something a flagon of wine never being one to pass up a free gift he rammed it into his runic and turned to run away it was at that exact moment brome was passing with the slaves oilback ran slapbang into brome there was a moments silence as they confronted each other then brome said in a quiet but commanding tone what are you doing around here oilback answered hesitantly thinking fast as he did er oh im er gettin rid of this dirty spy for lord badrang hes one o those corsairs i caught im angin about ere brome nodded good he was about to turn away when oilback became suspicious just a moment mate what are you doin wid that bunch keyla stepped in boldly if its any of your business were puttin them in the prison pit lord badrang doesnt want this lot escapin like the others he wants em down the pit where he can keep an eye on em the corsair was slightly taken aback by keylas aggressive stance oh er right well ill bid ye good night unfortunately they were both travelling in the same direction keyla and brome were forced to walk along with oilback who was heading for the main gate which lay in the same direction as the prison pit they walked in silence with the slaves following oilback glanced at the thirty creatures yore gonna have a job on yer paws gettin all them down that pit theyll be standin on each others eads do em good brome sniffed officiously were not here to argue we carry out our leaders orders an dont ask too many questions the searat nodded agreement aye thats all the likes of us can do eh mate though the gates of marshank were open to the corsairs camped on the shore there was still a sentry posted on top of the wall it was the ferret bluehide he saw the slaves being led to the pit and called down what in the name of frogfeathers are you doin down there oilback winked at keyla and shouted back arrogantly what does it look like were doin takin a swim bluehide shook his spear leave that gratin alone all those beasts cant fit down there besides there was three escaped from that pit brome sighed wearily placing paws on hips he called out in an insulting manner its none of your business how many slaves lord badrang wants us to put in the pit and another thing those three wouldnt have escaped if the sentry that night had been keepin an eye on this grating they broke out by movin it bluehide fixed his eyes on the grating leaning his elbows on the walltop well they wont escape from there tonight while im watchin you werent put up there to watch gratings slophead keyla called out in a stern voice its your job to keep a close eye on those corsairs on the shore now bluehide was completely confused keyla chuckled as he slapped oilback heartily across the shoulders ha ha ha that showed him eh matey oilback continued on his way laughing falsely as he answered ho ho ho it certainly did mate ill just take a look out there meself you cant trust corsairs y know keyla and brome waited until bluehide had his back to them on the wall top then shifted the heavy grating to one side whew that was a close thing the young mouse murmured under his breath outside in the shadow of the wall oilback wiped sweat from his nose muttering silently to himself whew that was a close thing he uncorked the flagon and took a deep drink to calm his nerves brome and keyla ushered the freed slaves into the pit and then climbed in after them pulling the grating shut over them once they were in an old mousewife called geum started to complain aloud its stuffy down here im stuck like a pea in a pod why did we have to come into this dirty place brome was thumping the walls to find the opening hush mother this is the way were going to escape keep your voice down but geum was not about to be quiet the main gate was open why didnt we just go out that way and dont call me mother cheekyface im not your mother keyla clamped a paw across her mouth silence you old scold brome knows what hes doing we wouldnt stand a lame sea birds chance of walking through cloggs crew to freedom this way well come up between some rocks beyond their camp have you found the opening yet brome a shower of loose earth and some pieces of driftwood fell on to the heads of keyla and geum hahah here it is brome cried excitedly for a moment i wasnt sure i could find it good old grumm he did a great job disguising his tunnel ill go first keyla you and yarrow help the others in and bring up the rear well have to move fast theres not many hours left until dawn the last thing we want is to be caught out on the open shore it took a considerable time to get all the slaves into the tunnel they pushed up against each other in the darkness infants began whimpering and geum started to complain again ugh its dark and stuffy down here i dont like it yarrow shoved her further along from behind none of us are exactly joyful about being down here old one just keep going and put a latch on your lip youre upsetting the little ones geums dignity was offended stop pushing me you young rip and mind how you speak to your elders oh dear theres sand falling on the back of my head brome crawled as fast as he was able to hearing geums last statement added to his haste he knew the tunnel was only a makeshift affair and could collapse at any moment particularly now with the added disturbance of thirtyodd creatures blundering their way through it suddenly just when he thought he was at the end of the tunnel brome found he could crawl no farther the young mouse let out a groan into the thick air the tunnel had caved in at the exit end they were trapped rose was wakened by martins cry and the great feathered bulk of the grey heron rolling over her something brushed by her she felt slithering scales and kicked out at them martin was locked in the coils of some reptilian creature what it was he did not know it felt like a snake but it had more than one head and tail stabbing viciously with his short sword he was rewarded by the sound of anguished hissing as the coils fell away from him nearby grumm swung out with his ladle and caught something hard on the skull it went limp pallum hung on grimly to a third sinuous shape as rose battered it with a supply pack martin felt another reptile at his back swinging sharply he slashed crosswise and stabbed down twice the creature was instantly slain rose was still hitting with the pack as she cried out in the darkness fire grumm make fire the mole fumbled for flint and tinder as martin found rose and pallum in the darkness afraid to use his sword in such close proximity to them he dropped it and went headlong at the creature they had been trying to tackle butting punching and kicking like a mad beast martin rendered the thing senseless there were no more opponents to fight they stood still while sparks flew and grumm could be heard blowing on the tinder suddenly there was a small flame the mole fed it with dry grass and twigs in the ensuing firelight they viewed the attackers and the attacked it was the two slowworms they had first seen on entering the marshes they were both dead slain by martin and lying stunned close by was an enormous grass snake and a young adder grumm shuddered violently surrpints pallum scrambled over to the limp figure of the warden i think theyve killed him rose was at his side instantly let me take a look as she inspected the big bird martin called pallum and grumm to help him between the three of them they heaved the bodies of the four reptiles into the deep ooze of the marsh over here this bird is alive rose was massaging the wardens long neck his eyelids fluttered feebly as she rubbed skillfully one of the herons eyes opened momentarily i am the laaaaaww it managed to croak the mousemaid put a paw to its beak yes i know be still now those snakes nearly strangled you grumm put some water on to heat and see if you can find some soft moss and herbs to make a poultice as dawn broke over the little camp rose sat nursing her patient the warden was a fierce bird quick to recover and hard to keep still she had bound his neck with a warm soothing poultice of moss and herbs checking the rest of him to assure herself that the young adder had not struck him youll be all right the adder didnt bite you warden please lie still your neck was badly squeezed try not to move it the grey heron tried to rise but fell back croaking hoarsely snakes are lawbreakers i will punish them i am the law grumm looked up from the soup he was making doant youm never be soilent burd close thoi gurt beak hurr as they were held up by the wardens injuries breakfast was a leisurely affair pallum roasted some vegetables leek pennycress and shallots grumm made excellent wild celery and herb soup then experimented on some barley scones the warden became so fierce when pallum tried to feed him soup that the hedgehog hid behind grumm i dont think he likes your soup grumm shook his ladle at the heron doant be natural creetur not loikin moi zoop hem never grow big n strong loik oi i am warden of marshwood hill warden does not eat zoop oh goo an boil thoi ead gurt burdbag rose was surprised at the wardens powers of recovery barely halfway through the morning he was up and walking as he conversed with martin the young mouse told him the story of what had taken place in the night the big bird glared savagely at him i thank you martin is mouse warrior but you must learn learn what learn to kill all lawbreakers two snakes not dead but i threw them in the swamp next time kill first then they will never break the law again the warden was inflexible when dealing with lawbreakers by noon they were back on the path again travelling behind the warden rose was mentioning to martin that the mists were beginning to clear and sunlight was now plainly visible filtering through when pallum called ahead look up there was the mountain rising above the mists into the summer day it towered in solitary splendor the lower slopes clad in verdant pine rising to shrub and wild lupin which gave way to naked dunhued rock all the way to its majestic peak grumm shielded his eyes with a digging claw peering up well dig moi tunnel usns got t cloimb yon gurt ill the warden halted fixing them with his fierce eye you can see the mountain rose nodded her head awed at the sight we surely can have we got to climb over it the heron stood on one leg no only halfway do you see the cave the four friends searched the rocky mass straining their eyes martin looked at rose and shrugged before turning to the warden we cannot see a cave but if you say it is there then we believe you halfway up you said the warden nodded yes halfway up it is a runnel through the mountain now i must leave you these are my marshes i am the law here i stay with an awkward hopskip he took to the air wings beating until he caught a thermal swooping over them the bird called out you saved my life i will not forget this you are not lawbreakers maybe i will be able to help you someday i go now goodbye as he swooped away rose cried aloud thank you for your help besides the cave is there anything else we should look out for when we climb the mountain wheeling in a halfturn the heron called a final message ask boldred the mountain is not mine these are my marshes and i alone am the laaaaaaaawwwwwww with that the warden of marshwood hill was gone soaring above his domain of treacherous ooze and reptilian subjects in the late afternoon they came out of the marshlands crossing a stretch of dry scrub country the four travel lers stopped at the fringe of pines in the mountainous foothills it was green and shady where martin decided they would camp well rest here until the morning before attempting to climb the mountain a good meal and a long sleep is what we need grumm shook the food packs out his homely face a picture of dismay as he took stock of their supplies burr ardly any vittles left two wizened apples a few pawfuls of wheat flour one or two candied nuts and three raspberry scones were all that remained of polleekins good food the mole shook their final canteen lack a day ony arf full o mint cordial rose chuckled as she prodded her friends tubby little stomach oh dearie me grumm trencher are you going to let us all starve and waste away to leaf shadows grumm polished his ladle vigorously with dry grass youm a snip miz roser no mistake about that roight oim taken charge yurr an now pallum surch furr veggibles zurr marthen an youm miz roser lukk for water an gather wudd oill see wot can be unted oop listen now oi wants youm all back yurr afore sunset be that clear pallum martin and rose giggled as they whispered among themselves grumm waved the ladle at them oi said be that clear they turned to him with serious faces trying hard not to laugh as they stood stiffly to attention saluting to hear is to obey lord grumm we will not come back emptypawed o mighty one we are yours to command for you are the law they dashed off laughing leaving grumm polishing his ladle oi doant see nuthin funny vittles be serious ho urr twilight found the four friends seated around a cozy little fire their foraging had proved extremely fruitful apples early wild plums and some green acorns parsley dandelion wild oats and a piece of honeycomb which pallum had found floating in a small rivulet of icecold mountain water there were also a few mushrooms and some watercress which had been growing by the rivulet grumm borrowed martins sword and used the blade to peel and chop the others took their ease laying back under a small spreading pine to watch him hurr mushrooms n cress goes with parsley n danneeline the mole explained as he prepared supper chop up they green acorns too twill make gudd zoop amost thick as stew he paused to rap roses paw with the ladle as she tried to steal a wild plum gurroff mizzy oi needs they to put wi last o flour and woild oaters an hunny chop ee apples vurry liddle pass oi yon flat stone oi needs it furr moi asperimend martin looked at rose as he passed grumm the flat thin rock asperimend what does he mean he means experiment grumm is always experimenting with food hes very good his experiments can turn out tasty the soup when it came was savory and they blew on it as they sipped it from their scallop shells grumm had patted his mixture of wild plum flour oats honey and apples into small round cakes that he cooked on the flat rock over the fire the sweet smell wreathed round the camp as he turned off the first batch to cool in the grass taking one gingerly he broke it giving half to rose wot youm think o that mizzy the mousemaid juggled it in her paws blowing on it as she took several quick nibbles oh grumm it tastes wonderful so sweet and sticky the mole wrinkled his snout in a satisfied manner hurr oi knew t would oill make a couple o batches an well pack theym furr rations oi opes oi cn amember moi asperimend when we reaches ome to noonvale grumm gave them a cake apiece to eat after their soup he was packing the rest of them away when a cracking of branches coupled with screams and wild laughter sounded close by before martin could retrieve his sword from grumm a dozen or more young squirrels bounded into the camp screeching scrabbling and fighting one of the creatures tripped and stumbled over rose he snapped at her and pushed her roughly as he struggled to rise martin was across to him in a twinkling he dealt the squirrel a hefty blow and sent him sprawling again now the camp seemed to be full of wildlooking squirrels they wore sashes of gaily colored barkcloth and had bird feathers fastened to their tails disregarding the four travellers they fought and screeched all round them ignoring the upset and discomfort they were causing one creature grabbed hold of grumm using him as a shield to escape from another who was trying apparently to steal the feathers from his tail martin had stood enough he did not want to kill any of them as they had not directly attacked him or his friends but he was determined that they should be taught a lesson seizing grumms ladle he dashed at the two who were whirling the mole about as one tried to catch the other whopp thock martin dealt out two stunning blows which sat the wild pair down flat on their tails he brandished the ladle and roared stop this dyou hear me stoppit this instant the squirrels halted panting heavily and grinning at each other martin shook the ladle his voice stern and loud you hooligans what dyou mean by dashing in and wrecking our camp like this eh have you no manners at all youre like a mob of wild beasts one squirrel grabbed a feather from the tail of another and hopped nimbly on to a low pine branch hah snot your land its ours were the gawtrybe we do what we like so there he stuck his tongue out impudently at martin pallum was quick leaping up he caught the branch and twanged it catapulting the squirrel onto the ground the other squirrels thought this was hilarious and started doing it to each other one leaping on a low branch as the other twanged it off rose was furious placing her paws on her hips she yelled at them do you want me to call the warden of marshwood hill they stopped momentarily again then started laughing as one of their number began imitating the grey herons sticklike walk and doing a passable impression of the bird i am the law i slay all lawbreakers heeheehee warden cant touch us he only rules the marshland never comes up here rose drew herself up to her full height then ill tell boldred all activity ceased they looked around nervously then one of them pulled an impudent face yah you cant cos shes not here look jumping up and down he chanted boldred boldred boulderhead old boldred spreading his paws wide he smirked cheekily see shes not here with a series of wild whoops the squirrels sprang off into the trees leaving the camp at peace once more martin stood listening to them as they shrieked and shouted off into the gathering night the gawtrybe eh i dont like that crowd one little bit wed best post a sentry tonight ill take first watch grumm will you take second you can use my sword the mole brandished his trusty ladle fearlessly burr this be all oill need furr they rarscally beasters rose placed damp wood on the fire to burn slowly through the night she sat with her back against a pine and settled to rest martin did you notice how they stopped when i mentioned boldred i know they joked and clowned a bit but theyre obviously scared of her i wonder who boldred is and where we can find her martin shouldered the small sword his keen eyes questing around the nightcloaked woodland your guess is as good as mine rose i dont think weve seen the last of the gawtrybe though however the night passed uneventfully for the four travellers the wooded foothills remaining calm and peaceful the following morning was presided over by a hot blue cloudless sky promising even greater heat as the day progressed they breakfasted sparingly on cold water and some of grumms invention cakes before setting off to scale the mountain three hours after dawn they left the forest entering a country of sloping shale scree carpeted with shrub fern and lupin as they toiled upwards in the oppressive breezeless warmth martin gritted his teeth jibes and insults were coming at them from all around though they saw no squirrels heehee ill tell the warden on you badmannered hooligans camp wreckers heehee still no sign of boldred please boldred save us from the gawtrybe heehee pallum clapped a paw to his ear yowch theyre chucking pebbles at me a small stone clacked off martins swordblade he kept his eyes straight ahead speaking in a voice strained by temper ignore them the stupid vermin ignore them the stupid vermin heeheehee a voice echoed back at him the young mouse was about to pick up a pebble and hurl it back in the direction of the voice when rose halted she muttered urgently to him out of the side of her mouth look up ahead the way was blocked by about fifty gawtrybe squirrels one larger than the rest and obviously some kind of chieftain stood forward he scuffed the ground with his paw and pouted like a naughty infant as he spoke this is gawtrybe land youve got to pay to pass through martin eyed him levelly we have only some food for ourselves nothing of any value i am martin the warrior this is rose pallum and grumm let us pass we will be off your land by nightfall the squirrel leader did a mincing little dance holding his paws together imploringly as he mocked let us pass please let us pass martin noticed that more squirrels had come up behind them cutting off any chance of retreat the leader squirrel had more feathers in his tailbrush than any of the others he arched the bushy tail skillfully towards martin i am called wakk leader of the gawtrybe give me your sword and ill let you pass the young mouses eyes were cold as he answered nobeast takes this sword from me wakk puffed out his chest and made his tail stand straight then i will fight you for it martin curled his lip derisively oh youll fight my friend backed up by all your bunch i suppose wakk did not sneer or joke he held up both paws to show he was not armed no no we two will fight together just me and you none of my bunch will interfere give your sword to the mousemaid and lets see how good you are without a weapon instantly the squirrels formed a large ring as martin passed the sword to rose he had his back turned to wakk look out martin pallum shouted he thrust the sword into roses paws and whirled around to see wakk hurtling through the air at him teeth bared and claws outspread trapped the word ran back like wildfire along the creatures packed into the escape tunnel and panic took over in the dark airless place were all going to die down here help ooh i knew we should never have tried to escape i cant breathe let me out of here at least we were alive in the stockade its that bromes fault the stupid young fool something within keyla snapped suddenly the young otter was crushing and pushing lashing out as he climbed over heads squeezing and scraping past other creatures bashing out with all paws and his rudderlike tail as he battled towards brome at the blocked exit gerrout of my way i never came down here to suffocate an die let me by you stupid snivellin moaners bulling and pushing kicking and shoving the resourceful otter strove on through the packed airless tunnel until he felt bromes corsair rags in his paws brome whats the matter why cant we get out his face touching keylas brome yelled in the darkness we were nearly out im sure of it but the exits caved in the otter pushed him backwards into the press of wailing slaves get out of my way and give me space ill get us out of here with a surge of strength born of desperation keyla threw himself at the blockage all four paws going like windmills despite the screams and cries of outrage from behind he tore bit gouged kicked dug and flailed at the sandy earth as it sprayed around him in gouts and showers his shouts could be heard throughout the tunnel as he flung his body forward eeyaahhh what dycm want somebeast to dig ill show you how keyla digs like this and this wahoooooooooo the otters nose fountained blood as it struck a large rock keyla wrapped his whole body around it and yanked grunting and squeezing past the rock he savaged the loose earth scraping biting and thudding until his head burst through into the hole on the shore between the rocks wriggling out keyla spat earth and wiped his mouth out with a paw chuckling quietly he shook with delight haha just shows what you can do when you feel like it brome leapt from the tunnel casting aside his disguise and hugging keyla tightly at the same time keyla you rogue you did it you got us free then it was bromes turn to act sensibly as he helped the first slaves out of the hole he issued instructions to keyla we were trapped down there quite a while time was lost and its not long until dawn im going to run to the camp and get felldoh with some others to help ill bring them back as quickly as i can you must follow my pawprints and move everybeast along as fast as you possibly can once the fortress is roused badrang will have his horde out after our blood dawn was crimsoning the grey from the sky as the ebb tide lapped gently on the shore it was bluehides favorite time of day he had catnapped most of the night through his sentry watch on the walltop of marshank now he stretched gratefully in anticipation of breakfast and a sleep until noon shortly his relief arrived another ferret called stumptooth bluehide passed the sentry spear over happily its goin t be a scorcher of a day mate youll sweat up ere stumptooth took the proffered spear and leaned heavily on it aye yer right there blueide taint fair is it me stannin up ere on guard all day while those boneidle slaves lie round the compound scratchin theirselves hoho dont you fret yer ead about the slaves stumpy bluehide began climbing down a wall ladder theyre all down the prison pit alf of em will be dead afore the days through stumptooth was pushing past bluehide on the ladder slaves in the prison pit i never seen any an i looks down there every mornin when i passes bluehide landed on stumptooths head they bumbled down the ladder to fall in a heap at the bottom scrambling on all fours they both raced to the pit bluehides jaw went slack in dismay but but they was there last night he began explaining i saw em go down with me own eyes it was two of our horde put em down there stumptooth was not listening he was dashing for the longhouse screaming escape escape the slaves ave escaped badrang came thundering out tripped over gurrads body picked himself swiftly up and kicked the carcass badtemperedly slaves escaped how many where from the prison pit lord prison pit who put em down there i dont know sire blueide was on duty las but badrang was not listening he was dashing about the courtyard yelling hisk fleabane get the horde together now halfasleep weasels ferrets and rats stumbled out pulling their clothes on as they trailed weapons behind them badrang was in a towering fury he lashed out with the flat of his sword you halfbaked slobberfaced slugs move there still might be time to catch those slaves stir your stumps you useless blatherbrained beasts filling your stomachs and resting your heads is about all you lot are good for hisk and fleabane scuttled about echoing their masters threats and insults not quite sure of what they were supposed to do the tyrant returned to gurrads carcass obviously clogg had forestalled the assassination attempt he would get rid of the body before clogg saw it and started gloating grabbing a passing rat badrang snarled you nipwort bring that thing and follow me nipwort struggled along behind badrang dragging the limp figure as he tried to keep up with a frenzied burst of energy the tyrant stoat dragged the grating from the pit lying flat he thrust his head in and could not fail to see the escape hole here nipwort leave the body there and climb into this pit see that hole in the side of the wall get yourself in there and see how far it goes report back to me when you find out where the exit is before going to attend his horde badrang watched the unhappy nipwort climb into the escape tunnel when the rat was lost to view badrang pushed gurrads body into the pit and replaced the grating with a swift heave tramun clogg had been up and about before badrang that day anxious to know the result of his murderous plan when gruzzle and boggs reported the rinding of oilbacks body clogg knew the scheme had failed hastily they disposed of the poisoned rat tossing him into the sea clogg had his crew stand by fully armed lest badrang should come seeking revenge for the attempt on his life crosstooth the fox took a swift glance toward marshanks open gates stand by capn ere comes badrang with trouble aplenty tramun stood prepared as the tyrant and his horde pounded out across the shore however his keen ears caught the drift of what hisk and fleabane were shouting double quick you lot come on there lord badrang wants every last one o those slaves back aye if you dont catch those escapers youll find yourselves doing their work so move clogg sheathed his cutlass chewing thoughtfully on a beard plait as an idea formed in his sly fertile mind ho buckoes put up yer weapons an foller me with a look of concern on his villainous face the corsair ran towards badrang calling out aloud ahoy matey wots the trouble the tyrant stoat halted glaring suspiciously at clogg didnt you know the rest of the slaves escaped during the night horror and indignation stamped themselves on the corsairs features why the rotten bunch o scallawags ill never get me new ship built now badrang matey lets call a truce between us until we catch em which way dyou reckon they went badrang could not waste time bandying words with his old adversary he realized he would need all the help he could get to recapture the slaves theyve probably headed south and to the cliffs thats the way were going clogg stroked the braids on his chin thoughtfully aharr maybe thats wot they wants you to think mate maybe they went north to fool ye ill take my crew that way before badrang could reply clogg had hauled out his cutlass and was running north along the shore with his corsairs come on you flotsam if ye ever want to feel a deck neath yer paws agin youll ave to find them scummy slaves badrang led his horde off to the south at a lively run nipwort emerged from the escape tunnel dusting himself down he climbed on to the rocky outcrop to get his bearings the tracks were clear shading his eyes against the morning sun nipwort scanned the shoreline he saw the unmistakable form of a group in the distance they were hurrying towards the cliffs turning round the rat could see badrang and the horde running in his general direction jumping up and down he waved frantically over here lord i can see them ballaw rowanoak buckler and felldoh in company with ten or more of the most ablebodied free slaves jogged along the clifftop behind brome felldoh looked grim as he muttered to the hare what a reckless little fool brome is he could have been captured at marshank or smothered in that tunnel ballaw hefted his lance lightly matter of opinion old lad if you fail youre a bally fool if you win youre a jolly hero rowanoak puffed along behind them towing the cart ballaws right id say if he pulls this off hes a reckless hero who would have thought it young brome brome stopped pointing down to the shore he yelled proudly there they are felldohs eyes roved further afield aye and look whos following on the double rowanoak gave a great groan of dismay theres far too many of them for us our only hope is to get those poor creatures on to the clifftop up here before the horde gets to them come on lets give it a try stout vine ropes were anchored to rocks and thrown over the steep cliff slope ballaw roared to the slaves projecting his voice magnificently i say you chaps over here felldoh and some others shinned hurriedly down the ropes on to the shore and ran to help the stragglers buckler threw his paws about an old mousewife glancing back at the pursuers they be comen on apace oi doant think usns ull make et badrangs paws slapped hard on the strand as he put on a great burst of speed calling to his horde come on weve got em old geum grasped the rope gazing upwards she pursed her lips ill never be able to haul myself up there what dyou think i am a young squirrel i dont know about a young squirrel mother but youll be a dead mouse if you hang about here felldoh threw geum across his shoulder with a single heave and began hauling himself up the rope buckler and six others launched a salvo of short javelins directly at the horde four of badrangs creatures fell the rest parted ranks spreading themselves to avoid being hit all of the escapers were now on the ropes scrambling up the steep cliff face fear of their pursuers and the scent of freedom lending speed to their paws felldoh had delivered geum and hopped back down without using the ropes now he was on his way back up with two small young ones clinging to his tail buckler and the others were backed up hard to the cliffside as the horde advanced on them two had been brought down by spears from badrangs creatures rowanoak looked worriedly down as she called to them get on the ropes come up here brome and those on the clifftop began hurling javelins and slingstones to cover their friends retreat badrang dashed forward as buckler began scrambling up the rope he picked up a fallen javelin and hurled it the mole cried out in agony as it took him through the shoulder hold tight buckler hold tight rowanoak bellowed furiously as she seized the rope in both paws and heaved mightily badrang leaped for the rope but found himself grasping dust despite the fact that there were six others climbing the rope above buckler the strength of rowanoaks tremendous pulls made the whole thing fairly fly up she dashed backwards muscles straining as she towed the taut vine rope behind her it hummed and sang under the tension sending creatures who were clinging to it flying along the clifftop on their stomachs ballaw pulled the javelin from bucklers shoulder how are you doin old scout the mole winced then smiled take moren a likkle ole spear to slay oi ballaw theyre climbing the other ropes bromes shouts brought ballaw to the cliff edge badrang was standing on the shore directing his creatures upwards get on those ropes the rest of you start climbing come on we can swarm them theyre too few to stop us move you dolts get climbing felldoh pulled the last slave over the clifftop below him he could see ferrets rats and weasels scaling the remaining four ropes while the rest were climbing up spurred on by badrang rowanoak joined felldoh and stood watching let them get a bit closer to us then ill move move what felldoh looked at the badger quizzically those four large boulders the ropes are tied to of course ballaw waggled his ears expressively should give the rotters somethin to think about wot lets do it now before they get any further ill get all the gang to lend a paw right gather round chaps and ill explain the drill badrang was about to mount one of the ropes himself when he heard the ominous rumble from above leaping clear he shouted up off get off the ropes back down everybeast quick some of the horde were almost at the top they hesitated looking at the long drop to the shore others clung to the cliff face not knowing what to do rowanoak threw her great bulk against the first boulder it rolled quite freely ballaw and felldoh had a thick branch under the next one they levered down and the boulder began moving brome and some others charged the third boulder with the cart setting it on the move as the stout little vehicle bumped it forward amid the screams and yells of panic as the first boulder came rumbling over the edge rowanoak dashed to the fourth and final one she bulled into it with a deep growl a ferrets head appeared over the clifftop as the boulder rolled forward he gave a wail of dismay and flung himself into space the devastation caused by the four boulders was considerable they tore huge chunks out of the cliff face as they bounced downwards and several creatures tangled in the ropes attached to the boulders were given a fast harsh sleigh ride on their backs down the steep slope the less fortunate were crushed in the path of the great stones or caught by them as they bounced and thudded towards the shore badrang had pulled a score of archers back they knelt on the beach directing a volley of shafts upwards cries from the clifftop told the tyrant that his strategy was being rewarded as rowanoak harnessed herself into the cart shafts an arrow buried itself in the wood by her paw time we werent here felldoh can you and ballaw get the slow and wounded in the cart double quick please it was but the work of a moment the cart trundled off at a fast lick propelled by rowanoak and every ablebodied creature cease fire hold those bowstrings bluehide was the last to hear he could not stop his arrow twanging off over the clifftop nor could he avoid the swift kick from badrang that sent him sprawling whats the matter cloth ears cant you tell that theres nobeast up there any more the tyrant sighed heavily and sat on one of the boulders hisk fleabane count em up how many did we lose fifteen in all sire about that many injured too we got eight of theirs though and some more up on top must have been slain by arrows eight of theirs badrang snorted you mean eight of ours they were my slaves the only one of theirs was the mole i got him though i never got him good enough to finish him off the horde members sat about in silence awaiting their leaders mood which could range from indifference to foul bad temper badrang watched them licking their wounds and retrieving their weapons then he summoned hisk take ten make sure youve got a couple of good trackers i want you to find where theyve gone when you do report back to me at marshank dont try to fight or even show yourselves just come straight back to me with the information have you got that hisk saluted with his spear yes lord i will do exactly as you say good when they are least expecting it we will come in full force and ambush them they are not soldiers or warriors merely escaped slaves and some ragtag actors who have been lucky so far capn tramun clogg sat back in badrangs chair enjoying the comfort of the longhouse he drank damson wine and picked his teeth with the bones of a herring he had eaten his clogs clacked noisily as he swung his legs on to the tabletop and gave crosstooth a huge wink brains thats wot yneed to outsail yer enemies brains the fox shook his head admiringly an youve certainly got em capn you fooled ole badrang cloggs huge stomach shook with merriment ill elp ye to find the slaves sez i you go that way an ill go this way aye an this is the

locked barred an bolted tight capn the crew is on the walls well fed an armed to the fangs clogg lost the fishbone in his stomach plaits and forgot it all waitin for pore uncle badrang to come visitin with his tail atwixt is legs an a flea in is ear hahaharr wakka chieftain of the gawtrybe was a savage fighter swift too though not as swift as martin the warrior the young mouse saw the squirrel hurtling through the air at him and danced nimbly to one side wakka hit the ground on all fours whirling fast he was up and into martin setting his claws tight into martins sides his sharp teeth seeking his opponents throat as the bushy tail pushed itself stiflingly over the mouses face martin bit into the tail hard throwing himself backwards and shooting all four paws straight up wakka gave a shriek of pain and sailed over martins head straight into a bunch of squirrels martin was up immediately joining both paws tight like a club he swung out knowing what the squirrels would do they heaved their leader bodily back at the young mouse hoping to crush him whopp martins tightjoined paws cannoned straight into wakkas nose the squirrel sat down licking away blood and seeing stars his head cleared and he rushed martin this time he feinted slightly as martin leapt aside wakka went the same way and caught him locking his legs round the mouses waist the squirrel chieftain clung like a limpet scratching wildly at martins face the young mouse winced as the foebeasts claws scored his cheeks deeply trying to find his eyes martin threw himself forward hitting the ground with wakka beneath him the breath was knocked from the squirrel in one gasp punishing him with another hard double pawblow to the nose martin was first up with both paws held tight to his damaged nose wakka staggered up martin grabbed him spun him around and leapt on to the squirrels shoulders clamping his footpaws round wakkas neck martin grasped both the squirrels ears as tight as he could and pulled upwards the squirrel screamed in agony jumping from side to side and trying to dislodge his tormentor but martin hung grimly on jaw muscles rigid as he pulled the ears tighter and locked his legs harder wakka bucked and leaped all around the ring formed by his bunch as martin rode him pulling savagely until the tendons stood out on his paws half strangled and with his ears near pulled out by the roots wakka went down like a stone dust rising around as both creatures hit the earth martin jumped free placing his footpaw on wakkas head he ground down hard forcing the squirrels injured nose into the dirt the chieftain of the gawtrybe struggled feebly sobbing for breath as martins paw stamped down harder the young mouse was breathing hard as he rasped out the question have you had enough squirrel because if you havent we can carry on until the death gnurff gnurff rose ran out grasping martins paw she cried piteously hes had enough dont kill him martin the sound of roses voice brought martin back to reality veils of red mist fell from his eyes and the warriors desire to kill left him he allowed her to lead him back to his friends and grumm set about bathing his deepscored face the gawtrybe had gone unusually silent they broke the circle leaving their beaten chieftain deserted in the dust the squirrels dispersed into the ferns and lupins where they immediately began howling with laughter and playing again some of them sitting on others shoulders and pulling their ears as martin had done to wakka pallum shook his head gravely listen to that what a bunch of savages rose applied strips of dockleaf to martins wounded face there thats the best i can do for now lets get away from this place i hate it and those horrible wild squirrels too the tall lupins and ferns provided some coolness against the heat of the day as they made their way to the mountain slope it was pallum who spotted the cave high up above them on the dusty duncoloured mountain face it stood like a single eye on some great beast martin shook his head i doubt if well reach it by nightfall rose was all concern for him never mind if we dont we can camp on the mountainside until morning and reach it tomorrow theres no great rush martin take it slower you must be tired after battling that big squirrel martin touched his stinging cheeks dont worry about me rose i can walk as fast as anybeast the mousemaid put on a stern face stumping ahead she imitated the wardens sticklike gait as she mimicked the grey heron i say you will walk slower i am the law they fell about laughing and sat in the ferns while grumm unpacked some of his invention cakes and a drink of water for each of them martin accidentally dozed off as pallum was singing a little ditty oh the hedgehog is a fine old beast all covered oer with needles not smooth oh no like some i know eels an fish an beetles some creatures calls us hedgepigs an others says hedgedogs but i do know that frogs is frogs an hedgehogs is hedge hogs rose held a paw to her lips hush now let him sleep awhile hell feel better for it it was getting towards late afternoon when martin was wakened by the sound of gawtrybe squirrels hooting and hallooing close by he rubbed his eyes and noted the position of the sun in the sky oh no have i been dozing the day away well never make it to the cave tonight now rose gave him water to drink and redressed his face wounds come on then grumpy perhaps youll be happier on the move shadows were lengthening as they emerged from the ferns on to the scree and rocks of the actual mountain face again they found their way barred by large numbers of the gawtrybe pallums bristles rose aggressively not you lot again what dyou want now in the absence of their deposed chieftain they seemed to have several leaders wanna play one squirrel called out rose eyed them frostily well were not stopping you play as much as you like heehee another squirrel sniggered no we want you t play martin drew his sword and took a pace towards them and supposing we dont want to play heeheehee then the gawtrybe kill you it was then that martin noticed many of the squirrels were holding axes made from a piece of shale tied in the notch of a heavy stick he held up a paw wait while i ask my friends the four travellers went into a huddle as martin explained wed last as long as a butterfly in a snowstorm trying to fight our way past that mob i think were going to have to play whatever stupid game theyve thought up he could see that rose was afraid but she nodded whatever you say martin were with you burr aye iffen tis ee only way outen yurr then so be el you lead on martin we trust you martin smiled and patted pallum carefully turning to face the waiting gawtrybe he addressed them all right well play your game what do we have to do heehee you run and we chase you that sounds like fun which way do we run up the mountain heehee good that was the way we were travelling up the mountain what happens next when we catch you heehee we throw you off hatred for the gawtrybe coursed through martins veins he gripped his sword tighter but continued to smile as he spoke i dont think were going to like this game my friends and i could be killed mass laughter greeted martins statement many voices calling out from the bunch in imitation of him we could be killed heehee what a nasty game heehee martin waited until the noise had subsided fair enough well play he continued in a reasonable voice but the gawtrybe are squirrels very strong fleet of paw very very fast cheers arose from the squirrels they obviously enjoyed flattery martin grinned cheerily waving his paws for silence we are slow and weary the game would not be much fun if you did not give us a start then it would be a really good game some of the squirrels started to chant really good game really good game really good game martin pointed to a high ledge protruding some distance above them let us climb to that ledge before you start chasing us when we reach the ledge i will shout gawtrybe that is your signal the squirrels changed their chant gawtrybe gawtrybe gawtrybe yes yes yes martin yelled aloud they took up his cry yes yes yes rose was trembling slightly as the horde of wild squirrels leaped and danced in front of them waving their stone axes and chanting fanatically grumm gazed up at the high ledge through the digging paws that were covering his eyes hoo urr oi baint a beast oo loiks igh places hurr no zurr holding his sword at the ready martin took roses paw pallum grumm stay close and tread carefully come on if we can make it up to that cave i think well have a good chance of holding them off martin led the way it was a tense situation howling squirrels waved axes in their faces grinning unpleasantly martin bared his teeth and growled if any tried to paw them or come too close step by step the four friends made their way through the mad throng martin brandishing his sword grumm wagging his ladle warningly pallum extending his spikes and rose swinging a foodpack in a businesslike manner it seemed like hours though it was only moments before they were clear walking with deliberate slowness martin spoke quietly to pallum who was bringing up the rear pallum take a slow glance behind and see if theyve made any move to follow us yet do it casually as pallum turned his head the gawtrybe stopped chanting theyre standing stock still the whole crowd of them not making a move or a sound just watching us pallums voice carried in it the tinge of fear rose could feel countless pairs of wild eyes focused on them the fur on her nape rose stiffly ive a feeling im not going to like this game martin the young mouse held her paw tighter blank it from your mind rose think of noonvale reaching the first ledges they helped one another up ready to run should the gawtrybe show any sign of pursuit sandy rock crumbled beneath their paws and slivering pieces of shale slid away down the mountainside two more small ledges to go martin dug his sword into a crack to aid his progress leaning over the ledge and helping rose to haul grumm up pallum pushed the mole from behind grumm scrabbled his way on to the ledge not daring to look down at the crowd far below still standing silent and waiting oi doant moind unnergrounds but oi baint too fond of oop yurr pallum nearly tripped and fell backwards on the final ledge he was windmilling his paws as he teetered perilously at its rim acting quickly rose swung the foodpack the hedgehog caught the shoulderstrap and she hauled him back to the safety of the ledge now the gawtrybe were beginning to chant and dance again eager to be on the chase the four friends stood on the ledge which martin had nominated watching them martin took the pack from rose and shouldered it are we ready they nodded pallum spat on his paws and rubbed them together right martin give them the signal the young mouse stared down at the dancing hordes below look at them mad cruel beasts playing games with the lives of other creatures i wouldnt waste my breath shouting signals to the scum let them guess whether or not the game has begun the four friends took off as fast as they could up the mountainside to the cave high above it took several seconds for the dancing yelling mob to realize they had been cheated martin had not shouted the signal for them to start chasing with a concerted howl of rage the masses of squirrels dashed for the mountain waving their axes from the heights the four friends paused to glance down martin had been right gawtrybe squirrels were strong and fleet of paw they were climbing at an amazing rate every one agile and swift the game for the lives of the travellers had really begun book three the battle of marshank brome and keyla together with felldoh and the rambling rosehip players were the heroes of the hour the thirty or so slaves who had escaped from marshank with their aid cheered wildly towing them round and round the camp on their cart being actors the rosehip company enjoyed applause in any form ballaw took outrageously leggy bows clapping his ears together comically thank you dear creatures thank you one and all rowanoak smiled benevolently waving a huge paw oh you shouldnt really it was nothing buckler with one paw bound up against his injured shoulder in a sling bobbed his furry head up and down thankee thankee oih be roight as rain in a few days the rest of the company took their adulation gracefully with the exception of celandine who fluttered her eyelashes constantly and blew outrageously sloppy kisses wasnt i marvellous dears yd like to thank the rest of the troupe and all the other little creatures who helped me brome was up on the cart with the rest but felldoh was unused to such admiration he wandered off alone from the camp enjoying the warm evening as he savored the heady feeling of freedom back at camp the liberated slaves were marvelling at the ample larder kept by the troupe a mouse called purslane led her husband groot and their baby fuffle through an inventory of the contents look groot dried fruits and maplecream how many seasons since we tasted maplecream i cant remember oh my will you smell these violet crystals and candied mintleaves groot opened a box shaking his head fondly nuts preserved in honey chestnuts beechnuts and acorns dyou recall when you used to do them in late autumn dear purslane brushed away a tear as she laughed do i you were the one who kept eating the nuts and licking the honey ladle you were like a great babe fuffle put those nuts down they dont belong to us the baby fuffle gurgled around a mouthful of nuts tasters nishe fuffle likesum purslane was prising the nuts loose from his little paws when rowanoak who had deserted the victory parade swept fuffle up in a huge paw she smiled fondly you eat as many as you like little un what is ours is yours purslane and her husband thanked the badger profusely but rowanoak would hear none of it now thats enough of that good creatures purslane did i hear groot saying that you could preserve nuts purslane gazed at the huge larder and its contents longingly preserve nuts i could cook bake stew make soups salads flans cakes tarts trifles rowanoak held up a paw trifles thats one thing the rosehip players cant do make a decent trifle my dear you dont know how many seasons i have dreamed of trifle but listen dont stand there telling me how good a cook you are why not get cracking and make a victory feast i imagine there are others from marshank whod love to try their kitchen skills again purslane geum ferndew and a hedgehog goodwife called burrwen washed their paws and went to work night fell over the rosehips camp the fires blazed merrily and old songs were brought forth to sing as everybeast helped with the preparation of a great liberation meal the young mouse hoopoe wearing a ridiculous hat woven from sedge grass led the singing conducting with a long onion shoot hey give me cake and bring me ale and pudding ripe with plums some cider dear so cool and clear to swill round teeth and gums some round and golden mellow cheese and light brown nutbread if you please with honey made by happy bees and i will be contented o fie the creature with long face who nibbles small and cant keep pace with tartlets filled full berryfruit and yellow meadowcream to boot or soup with pepper and hotroot and burdock ale to quench it oh eat up neighbour drink up friend may good fortune have no end success to all that you intend and leave the pots till morning the feast was one to remember particularly since the freed slaves had young ones who had never attended a banquet or even seen some of the dishes let alone tasted them old geum sniffed as she passed rowanoak a farl of hot barley bread filled with brown onion gravy and mashed turnip just look at that little un dipping strawberry tart into his soup its not right the baby fuffle was seated on rowanoaks lap enjoying himself immensely the badger chuckled as she stroked his ears if it tastes nice to him and he likes it then wheres the harm you eat up you little rogue the two mice yarrow and hoopoe had purple lips and noses from drinking blackberry cordial and yellow meadowcream tipped their ears from where they had both been eating the same pudding out of a basin without using spoons or paws celandine wiped her mouth daintily on a flimsy kerchief oh goodness me i dont think i can manage another bite ballaw eyed her plate heaped high with summer salad and cheese i was just saying to kastern and gauchee the other day that youre lookin a touch plump these days m gel wot the vain pretty squirrel pushed herself away from the food am i really tell the truth ballaw id hate to be plump ballaw pulled her plate across and emptied it reflectively speaking between bites well er chomp chomp a touch more exercise bit of firewood choppin munch munch and youll be back to your former lovely slim self m dear grumpff grumpff i wouldnt worry too much gauchee and kastern sat gazing sadly at a beautiful damson flan topped with crisp thin pastry covered in whiterose cream and decorated with candied mintleaves and nuts they were poised over it holding a wooden spoon apiece sighing regretfully golly gosh it does look lovely far too nice to eat hmm i agree with you itd be a shame to spoil it really but some other creature will if we dont true true i know lets do it gently brome sat next to buckler sharing a beetroot and mushroom pastie an enormous thing swimming in leek gravy burr oi cn feel et doen moi shoulder a power o gudd huh theres nothing wrong with your other shoulder its doing the work of two stop shovin me out of the way you great hungry beast trefoil had an apple baked in honey each rime she looked away a piece of it went missing rowanoak winked at the baby fuffle as he licked honey from his paws good eh mate fuffle winked back with both eyes good for fuffle old barkjon accepted a platter of summer fruits from geum he picked at them as he gazed at the other revellers i dont see my son have you served him with food geum he was hanging around at the edge of the camp before dark the gossipy old mousewife sniffed never sat down to eat with the rest i suppose were not good enough for him brome left his pastie to buckler and spoke up in defense of his friend dont you speak about felldoh like that old one if it werent for him and keyla youd still be a slave geum bustled off in a huff barkjon smiled at the young mouse well said brome you are a true friend to my son have you seen him brome gathered up some food a wedge of plumcake a hunk of brown nut cheese a small freshbaked wheat farl and a jug i havent seen him sir but i know where hell be doing a lone patrol and keeping watch for foebeasts while we sit here filling our bellies ill go and find him with this food he must be hungry wandering the cliffs by himself felldoh laid his javelins and thrower down he sat with his back to a rock at the cliffs edge staring out at the calm sea and the starstrewn sky though he was savoring freedom the sturdy young squirrel was fighting down a rage that burned deep inside against the seasons he and his father had spent in captivity hatred of badrang and all the tyrant stood for gnawed at him the sound of somebeast close by drew his paws swiftly to the weapons on the ground felldoh is that you mate the squirrel sighed as he relaxed his hold on the javelins brome what are you doing out here the young mouse sat beside him and laid out the food brought you a bite of supper are you hungry felldoh accepted the food gratefully well young brome he said thoughtfullythat was a reckless foolish thing you did but no one can deny that you showed great courage no one can deny that redcurrant and roseleaf cordial i hope you like it felldoh balanced the jug on his elbow like it does a fish like water they sat together watching the sea and the night sky brome sighed and voiced aloud the thought that tormented him constantly whenever he looked out over the deep waters of the main i often look at the sea these days and wonder if martin grumm and my sister made it to land id hate to think of them lying somewhere out there underneath the waves what a silly notion felldoh chuckled as he punched bromes paw lightly huh they probably made it to land while we were still floundering about thinking of the idea listen mate if your sister and grumm are with martin theyre safe as a deeprooted oak that mouse has more warrior spirit in his left ear than most creatures ive ever come across why i wouldnt be surprised to see them come marching across these cliffs right now with the noonvale army behind them brome looked out along the cliffs as if taking felldoh at his word suddenly he pointed north look there is somebeast coming about a dozen of em id say the two weasel trackers bugpaw and fhnk knelt to scan the ground in the moonlight hisk watched them impatiently whats the matter with you two surely the two wheel tracks of a loaded cart are clear enough to follow bugpaw looked up at the captain the cart has been along here moren once hisk were lookin for the freshest set of tracks flink traced the rutted outlines with his paw buggys right an its double ard in the night we could be follerin our own tails why dont yer knock off an rest up itd be a lot easier trackin in daylight hisk there was a concerted murmur of agreement from the others the weasel captain took a pace back and brought his spear up whats all this a mutiny dig the dirt out yer ears an listen to me im lord badrangs captain if you disobey me youre disobeyin him the orders is to follow the cart tracks an find out where they goes an thats what i intend doin right does anybeast want to argue it out with lord badrang when we get back to marshank there was a shuffling of paws and some sullen muttering all right hisk youve made yer point a voice from the group called out lets gerron with it hisk gave a humourless laugh im glad you see it my way oh and by the way only lord badrang calls me hisk its captain hisk to you lot remember that felldoh picked up his javelins theyre badrangs creatures i cant hear what theyre saying but anybeast with half an eye could see that theyre tracking the cart trying to find out where our camp is here take this javelin and follow me brome keep low and stay quiet the two companions headed back south along the clifftop in the direction of the camp scurrying on all fours as felldoh followed the imprint of the cart tracks judging that he had gone far enough felldoh halted do as i do brome cover the tracks until i tell you to stop brome did not question his friend he realized the urgency of the situation scuffing and brushing with their paws they obliterated the twin ruts of the wheelmarks from the loose sandy earth felldoh took a quick look around good that should do now take one of these javelins and hurry dashing back to the spot where the cart tracks ended felldoh set the blunt end of a lance in the ground and began a swerving furrow towards a low hill in an inland direction realization of the plan dawned on brome they were going to lead the trackers off on a false trail scoring the ground with his lance end he caught up with felldoh away the pair went over the low hill leaving in their wake two grooves bugpaw halted and stood upright look ere clear as daylight an fresh as a daisy these are good tracks looks like they took on extra weight flink sniffed the ground and nodded thats right captain hisk i cant smell badger anywheres near these ruts and i can sniff badger a mile off that means the big badger mustve hurt its paw and had to ride up on the cart the tracks are slightly deeper look hisk puffed out his narrow chest satisfied he was back in control good work you two keep it up come on lets go the tracks led west over the low hill and out across some furze land through a patch of damp sandy flats and into an expanse of reedgrass hisk and his soldiers followed diligently the weasel captain issuing whispered orders as they dogtrotted across the patchy moonlit landscape dont forget silence at all times when we find the camp we make a note of its position and head right back to marshank lord badrangll take care of the rest brome and felldoh dragged the javelins behind them as they scurried into a heavily bulrushed area the squirrels paw squelched deep he stopped checking brome as he did halt swampland lets hide over there where the rushes are thickest here take some more javelins ill cut you a throwing stick while were waiting on badrangs vermin hisk is their leader leave him to me ive got scores to settle with that scumnosed blaggard he bent many a rod over my back hisk shook his spear triumphantly the marshlands thats where theyre hiding no wonder they thought they were safe whod follow anybeast into marshes well their secret hiding place isnt a secret any more keep your eyes peeled for a campfire among these bulrushes as he was talking the trackers bypassed him and went ahead eager to complete their mission they raced along with the tracks clear in the soft heavy ground flink pawed at a broken rush noting the way grass had been trampled s funny the grounds pretty soft here they must have found a firm path to get a loaded cart into marshland eh buggy waah elp im sinkin elp me mates hisk hurried forward shuttup loudmouth dyou want them to know were here flink stared at the dark patch of smoothness beyond the rushes its buggy hes gone hisk grabbed flink and shook him i told you to keep your voice down idiot now what dyou mean bugpaws gone s s sw swamp flinks teeeth chattered with fright as he was speaking both he and the captain had started to sink hisk pushed flink away from him as the tracker grabbed wildly at his spear flink fell over backwards and the ooze gripped him and engulfed him the weasel captain pulled one footpaw free stabbing his spear deep into the firmer ground he hurriedly hauled himself out the others bumped into each other as they fought in the darkness to distance themselves from the swamp edge a rat called fraggun stood on tip paw peering into the patch where bugpaw and flink had been a moment before where did they goooooo oh the javelin had filled his mouth flashing out of nowhere like dark lightning brome had never seen a creature killed at close quarters before one moment the rat had been alive and shouting then in a flash he was slain the young mouse was no killer he stared in horror at felldoh who had just thrown the javelin the squirrels face showed little emotion as he fitted another javelin on to his throwing stick and whipped his arm back sighting on a shape in the darkness he flung the missile and was rewarded by a gurgling scream got him the javelins and throwing stick dropped from bromes paws you killed them felldoh slid another javelin along his throwing stick aye young un its called war youd best give me those javelins if you cant use em stay here and rattle these rushes but keep your head well down ill be back soon with a grim light in his eyes felldoh crawled off hisk threw his spear at the clump of bulrushes over there see the rushes moving thats where they are spears and arrows flew in the direction he had indicated brome was a brave and reckless young mouse but the idea of slaying another living creature appalled him now other beasts were trying to kill him suddenly he knew the meaning of fear he lay flat doing as felldoh had told him tugging at the rushes so they rattled fragments of bulrush showered down on him as missiles crashed by overhead his paws were shaking so much with fright that the long stems rattled furiously what had started out as an adventure had turned into the stark reality of life and death felldoh worked his way around to the other side of his foes silent as a shadow the powerful squirrel used a single javelin as a stabbing implement taking out a ferret and another rat felldoh had a javelin sighted on hisk when a rat stepped in the way and took it through his side the rat let out an earsplitting scream as he went down hisk turned catching a glimpse of his enemy as the squirrel dodged off into the cover of the rushes its a squirrel one of the slaves after him they crashed off into the marshes after him hisk took a swift head count as they went a tremor of shock ran through him only five left counting himself he had taken ten soldiers and two trackers when he left badrang the squirrel had slain five plus the two trackers who had been lost in the swamp enraged hisk picked up the spear of the rat who had fallen to felldohs last throw and followed the others brome stopped shaking the reeds and lay still wondering if badrangs soldiers had caught felldoh the young mouse was frightened at being left all alone in the hostile marshland but determined he should do something to rescue his friend gritting his teeth he grasped his throwing stick firmly he had no javelins but at least he could use the stick as a weapon there was a rustle in the vegetation nearby brome froze as a paw fell on his shoulder come on mate time to get out of here felldoh where did you come from the young mouses voice sounded squeaky in the night silence the strong squirrel pulled him upright explaining as he led the way to firmer ground i got about half of em maybe more missed that scummy hisk though ive been leading them a pretty dance around the edges of this quagmire theyll be lucky to find their way back to marshank let alone locate our camp they followed the false cart tracks back to the low hill and were soon in sight of the camp brome had to dogtrot to keep up with his friends strong pace felldoh back there i was i mean the squirrel winked and patted him kindly you dont have to explain anything to me youre my matey you were very brave tonight young un not every creature can slay or take life dont worry about it ive seen the time when i was like you wish i still was brome shook his head you wish you were like me felldoh threw a paw about the young mouses shoulder indeed i do its slavery that has made me this way id slaughter every one of badrangs horde if i had my way then id be sure that every honest creature was safe from the threat of slavery bending to the will and whim of a tyrant cold in winter hungry in summer watching old friends dying around you from hardship hoping and longing for freedom through all those lost and wasted seasons of my life youve never known that brome only a few days captivity with martin and me in the pit i wish that id had a happy life in noonvale like you never knowing the burning hate that drives you on to slay enemies the camp was still fires had guttered low and creatures were sleeping peacefully as they entered the camp only ballaw and the baby fuffle were still awake both munching steadily at the remains of the feast what ho you two the hare waved a halfeaten pastie at them come an help us mop this lot up wot they sat down and tucked in gratefully drinking deep from a bowl of cider with blossom petals floating on it felldoh glanced at fuffle over the rim of the bowl that little snip shouldve been snoring long ago ballaw chuckled as he demolished the rest of his pastie i know he should amazin little blighter really bit like me i spose cant rest while theres still tucker about aint that right me old fuffle the infant mouse halted his attack on a carrot and parsley turnover long enough to reply fuffle like foo plenny foo make y big it was still several hours to dawn when badrang and the horde halted within sight of marshank they rested waiting until fleabane and findo who were the advance scouts returned the two weasels came panting along the shore to where badrang sat and made their report cloggs taken over the fortress sire aye lord we could hear the noises of his crew singin and feastin sounded like they was avin a fine time badrang stared impassively at the fort in the distance i might have known something like this would happen has clogg posted wall sentries two sire both over the front gates no others that you noticed none but the two lord we circled the place to make sure the tyrant stoat stood upright slowly follow me ill gut anybeast who makes a sound clogg has got to learn that he is only an idiot corsair i am badrang master of all this coast hell soon find that out give me a bunk up martin im a bit short in the paw for this martin shoved his sword flat under pallums footpaws and heaved the hedgehog scrambled swiftly on to a higher ledge bringing up the rear martin hoisted himself alongside pallum halting a moment to note the progress of the gawtrybe the squirrels were catching up quickly far too quickly for martins liking he looked up to where the cave loomed like a black eye socket on the mountain in the night rose and grumm were in the lead assisting each other as they scrambled up the brown rocks which still radiated heat from the days sun hurry martin the mousemaid called down urgently with a bit of luck we might make it to the cave grumm peered down at the crowds of nimble screeching figures advancing upwards like the waves of a spring tide usns needen moren a bit o luck mizzy need a gurt eap dont stop keep going martin yelled up to them take pallum with you ill act as rearguard at least ill stand a bit of a chance being above them with a sword in my paw go on rose do as i say the mousemaid sat down firmly on an outcrop her footpaws dangling over the landscape far below oh no if you dont start climbing im stopping here either we go together or not at all martin now the squirrels wild faces could be picked out in the darkness illuminated in silvery moonlight as they chattered and shrieked good game good game catch em an throw em off throw em off martin put up his blade and began climbing fast all right im coming keep moving grumm slid back on the scree only the outcrop that rose had been seated on saved him martin arrived behind him with pallum and together they shoved grumm upwards the mole was trying hard not to show his fear of high places though every so often he clamped a digging paw across his eyes moaning softly oi carnt lukk up nor daown et makes oi vurry sick oo urr rose reached down to grasp his paw please grumm keep climbing its not far to the cave now martin found a loose rock and hurled it down at the leading squirrels they skipped aside with superb agility heehee good game well catch you mousey his paws aching from the strain martin pulled himself onward and upward grunting with exertion as he shoved pallum ahead suddenly martin felt his footpaw being grabbed one squirrel faster than the rest had sprinted up and caught him heeheehee gotcha with furious energy he kicked back with his free footpaw yeeeeeeeeee with a drawnout howl of despair the squirrel hurtled out into empty space and was lost in the night shaking himself martin clambered on with the shouts of the gawtrybe ringing in his ears heehee sillybeast fell yeeeeeeeeeee martin could hear the swift nimble patter of their paws on the rocks behind him glancing up he saw that rose had made it to the cave mouth she pushed grumm inside and reached her paws down to help pallum who was blowing and panting as he strove to gain the opening the gawtrybe were within a pawslength when martin arrived at the cave pushing rose inside he stood in the entrance and drew his sword chest heaving limbs trembling martin still managed a short laugh of triumph hahah come on you thickheaded rabble you can only come two at a time and im more than a match for any two of you inside the cave was like a huge rockfaced tunnel the first thing rose saw were two great luminous orbs she jumped back in fright whos there the voice was awesome harsh and thundering it echoed around the rock walls rose shrank back in terror please were only harmless travellers hiding in here from the squirrels theyre trying to kill us an enormous shorteared owl waddled out of the gloom rose cringed as it lifted a heavy taloned claw it smiled lowering its tone to a kindly whisper dont be feared mousemaid we must act with all haste tell your friends to heed me not when i put on my great voice come the gawtrybe leaped and chattered on the narrow escarpment at the cave mouth martin bared his teeth slashing the air menacingly with his small sword i am martin the warrior anybeast who is fool enough come and meet death the squirrels screeched and leaped pushing one another forward but for the moment it seemed that none were too keen to encounter the foemouse who stood defending the rocky entrance however martin knew that it was only a matter of time before the frenzied squirrels were pushed to attack him still facing his enemies he tried to communicate with pallum in a low murmur hurry get rocks to throw sticks to beat them off anything theyre getting ready for a charge ill be overwhelmed a mighty barkbrown wing enveloped martin sweeping him lightly aside the shorteared owl filled the cave mouth its legs thick as yew branches tipped with lethal talons a wail of fear arose from the gawtrybe they fell flat wherever they stood pressing their faces down on the mountainside eeeeee skyqueen eeeeee the massive feathered head swivelled back and forth huge golden pupils distending as its glittering black irises reflected the moon at their centres hunching over it glared murderously at the quaking squirrels boldred sees all i was many leagues from here yet i winged high and watched you torment these travellers brainless ones who live for pleasure without any thought of others did you not think i would return a moan arose from the prostrate squirrels the great owl repeated her question raising her voice to a maniacal shriek answer me did you not think boldred would return the mob remained silent where is your chieftain boldred screeched at them she turned a squirrel over with a swift flick of her beak its terrified tearstained face stared pleadingly at her as it pointed in martins direction the mouse defeated him skyqueen eeeeee boldred gave a short coughing noise as if reassessing the situation this i already knew do i not know all answer me truly why were the gawtrybe persecuting these travellers the squirrel boldred had elected spokesbeast hung his head like a naughty young one caught with his paw in the cream skyqueen it was a game we were only playing with a speed that the eye could scarce follow the shorteared owl pinned the nearest six squirrels by their tails with her flashing talons calling out over their cries shall i play my game she spread her wings and rose from the ground lining all six with ease as the outspread pinions beat slowly in the night speak shall i play my game or will you obey me rose clutched martins paw is she going to kill them oh i cant watch dont fret rose the young mouse whispered reassuringly to her the owl knows what shes doing leave it to her the gawtrybe cowered on the rocks sobbing piteously do not slay us skyqueen mercy eeeeee she dropped the six on to the heads of the others landing she resumed her stance accentuating her words with clacks of the dangerous hooked beak you are dull witless beasts with short memories but i will not slay you this time next time i will every one of you heed my warning as punishment you will all stay on the ledge below here until sunset on the morrow you will neither eat drink move or talk go now without a sound the entire gawtrybe vacated the space in front of the cave entrance dropping to the lower ledges where they sat in utter silence boldred flew out hovering low over their heads remember and obey or boldred will return the four friends stood back as the owl landed in the cave mouth she gestured them to keep quiet indicating that they should move further into the tunnel out of gawtrybe earshot boldred went ahead awhile before ushering them into a cunningly concealed side chamber they entered surprised to see that it was illuminated by a shaft of moonlight which came from somewhere up near the caves craggy ceiling a friendlylooking fullgrown male perched alongside a small fluffy owlet nodded to them boldred waddled up on to a moss covered ledge and blew a loud sigh that gawtrybe lack a day they must think everybeast as stupid as themselves dyou know what they said horty the big male chuckled dont tell me they were only playing a game game indeed boldred snorted the scatterbrained little savages she turned to the travellers forgive me but those squirrels do try my patience this is my husband hortwingle call him horty he hates his full title and this is our daughter emalet as you already know i am the famous boldred now who do we have the honor of meeting martin pallum rose and grumm introduced themselves boldred looked at martin nodding her head martin eh youve got the look of a warrior its a good job you defeated the gawtrybe chieftain or they would have slain you all on the spot using the excuse of a game of course martin felt the scratches on his face some game boldred nodded in agreement before turning to horty i sat the entire mob of them on the lower ledges no food or drink or talking until sunset tomorrow that might teach them a lesson horty stroked the downy back of emalet you dont really believe that do you by tomorrow noon theyll have forgotten and wandered down to play in the foothills martin inspected the cave it was a comfortable jumble of family living with brushes pens inks vegetable dyes and charcoal sticks scattered everywhere among large strips of bark parchment grumm produced food and drink from their pack as they ate boldred explained we are mapmakers and historians that is why we dont have a lot of time to control the squirrels one of us stays here with emalet while the other flies off to explore and hunt for food too as you see we are shorteared owls and as such are daytime hunters normally we would be sleeping now but the cries of the rabble wakened us rose bowed politely were extremely lucky they did thank you horty cocked his head at boldred and they both nodded he turned to rose are you rose daughter of urran voh and aryah yes do you know my mother and father oh yes youd be surprised just how much we both know though it must be many long seasons since we were at noonvale you wouldnt remember us you were only a tiny babe then always singing as i recall grumm scratched his head then held up a paw oi amembers youm zurr an youm marm tho oi wurr ony a liddle tyke two seasons eldern miz roser you uns wurr oft in noonvale that be whurr usns be travellen to boldred smiled with pleasure yes what a beautiful place we were mapping the area at the time id dearly love to go back there horty would you take care of emalet while i accompany our friends back there it would make their journey a lot less perilous if i were to guide them her kindly husband chuckled as he watched emalet playing around his talons i dont mind at all im a real homebird at heart we get on well together dont we my little eggchick emalet who never made any sound looked adoringly up at her father and snuggled under his wing the atmosphere in the owls cave was so safe and homely that the four friends slept deeply for the remainder of the night martin woke next morning and lay watching rose feeding one of grumms sweet flat invention cakes to emalet the owl chick waited respectfully for each fragment then wolfed it down with gusto enjoying the sticky sweetness greatly horty bustled in chuckling as usual those squirrels are still sitting silent and tight boldred you must have given them a really stern lecture last night hey come on you sleepyheads its two hours past dawn as they breakfasted the owls conversed pity we couldnt coax old warden up here hed straighten a few gawtrybe tails ill wager wouldnt he just thered only be tails left by now warden would have eaten the lot of them can you imagine i am the law you are lawbreakers glump there goes another one hahaha i suppose youre right maybe polleekin could keep them in order what dyou think maybe she could polleekin would probably feed them so much theyd be staggering around too fat to get in any mischief martin looked up from his food you know polleekin boldred preened her feathers we know her in fact we know lots of creatures that you do i didnt want to interrupt the tale you told us of your escape and journey last night or i would have mentioned some warden those prissy mirdop rabbits polleekin queen amballa and her tribe and badrang pallum interrupted horty shook his big feathered head we dont know that one nor do we want to he is evil a blight upon the good land it is certain death to know such creatures boldred spread her wings indicating that she was eager to travel come on now we cant wait around gossiping all season about who we know and dont want to know just take it for granted that we know many both sides of the mountain right young rose lets see what we can do about getting you back to your home from either side the tunnel looked as if it was only a cave on the mountainside but it ran clear through the rock from one end to the other twisting and turning with many offshoots and dead ends boldred went in front leading them out into brilliant morning sunlight on the other side of the mountain martin blinked after the dark tunnel taking his bearings the slope on this side was much gentler with areas of woodland and grassy glades dotting the warm stillness hardly a breeze swayed leaf or flower grumm breathed deeply hoo urr et do almost smell loik ome pallum took an experimental sniff i cant remember ever having a home what does it smell like rose patted the hedgehogs paw fondly youll know when we get to noonvale that will be your home they descended at a leisurely pace stopping to pick wild plum damsons pears and apples which grew in profusion on the sunny slopes sometimes boldred would fly off but she always returned after a short while ive been giving instructions to some birds i know theyre flying ahead to let the otters know youre coming martin wiped at the berry juice that was staining his chin why would otters want to know were coming boldred to save your paws theyll take us part of the way down the broadstream in their boat grumm looked slightly nervous only part o way do usns ave to swimee rest o way oi carnt swim marm water be bad as igh mountings you wont have to swim grumm the shorteared owl explained the otters will pass us on to the stream shrews and youll have to travel on their logboats not as comfortable as the otter boat but considerably faster rose found a clump of purple saxifrage she wove some into a wreath and placed it on her head then they came to a shallow stream weaving its way between the rocks and trees boldred perched in a rowan ash watching them as they skipped downhill splashing and laughing through the sunwarmed water she shook her head remembering the visit she had paid to polleekins tree house the day after the travellers had been there if polleekins visions are true its a long hard road ahead for you little warrior enjoy a happy day while you can capn tramun clogg woke feeling tremendously braced he drank a flagon of seaweed ale devoured a huge platter of pickled whelks and cockles then sat back rebraiding some plaits on his chest there was a gentle knock on the longhouse door is that you crosstooth clogg called out without looking up from his task any sign of badrang yet matey the door creaked open and badrang stood framed in the doorway sunlight pouring in around him get your braided behind off my chair clogg the corsair was so surprised that the chair fell over backwards as he tried to lurch up dust rose in a golden shower of motes around him as the tyrant of marshank strode across and placed a none too gentle footpaw firmly on his bloated stomach go on clogg ask me how i got here ow did you get ere the corsair spluttered from his position on the floor badrang smirked pressing down harder on cloggs stomach if you had as much brain in your head as you had fat in your gut youd know i came in through the tunnel that the slaves escaped from you can go both ways through it in or out obviously you didnt think of that swillhead with a sudden move that belied his bulk clogg wriggled free of badrangs paw and ran for the door shouting crosstooth gruzzle boggs arm the crew badrangs ere the tyrant stoat righted the fallen chair and sat in it smiling shout your thick head off bucko youll get no help clogg stood for a moment glaring at the horde soldiers surrounding the longhouse then he whirled to face badrang you foul earted blaggard youve murdered all me lovely crew badrang sniffed the empty seaweed ale flagon wrinkled his nose in distaste and pushed it away from him hardly but i could have its no trouble tying up a crowd of idiots whove drunk themselves to sleep on beetroot wine and seaweed ale as for those two dozy sentries you left posted on the walltop over the gate theyve got lumps on their heads the size of gull eggs did you actually think that you could take marshank from me cloggs attitude changed like a breeze at sea throwing his paws wide he grinned in what he hoped was a disarming manner matey who said anythin about takin yer fortress from ye why i was only mindin it until you returned after chasin those pesky slaves me an my crew was actin duty bound as caretakers ho by the bye you didnt catch the slaves did ye badrang shook his head coolly i didnt have to come with me and ill show you why the corsair crew sat in ranks at a corner of the courtyard tightly bound and closely guarded by the tyrants horde badrang led clogg to the center of the courtyard the pirate stoat was forced to stand silent and listen to badrangs announcement as he addressed the crew pay attention you corsairs you have three simple choices one is slavery i have no slaves to serve me at the moment two is death you can stay loyal to clogg and for that you will be executed the charges are attempting to steal marshank from me and siding with my enemy the third and final choice is that you swear allegiance to me and join my horde as soldiers well what is it to be the fox crosstooth struggled upright cut these ropes from me ill serve under lord badrangs colors it did not take long for the others to follow aye set me loose im with crosstooth me too matey ill be an ordebeast no point in bein a corsair without a ship bettern bein a slave or gettin executed clogg shook his head sadly harr twas an evil day when i landed up on this coast boggs gruzzle crosstooth was i ever a bad capn to ye no capn you was a good un we had some rare ol times together you just made too many mistakes tramun clogg aye when its sink or swim a creature has to look after hisself capn no ard feelins while the new horde members took the oath and signed articles with badrang clogg was led off to the prison pit by two soldiers he stared down into the hole miserably so its come to this bein slung in an ole like a worm they nudged clogg towards a barrow with a spade in it youre not goin in it lord badrangs orders are that you must fill it in think yerself lucky instead of execution hes givin you the chance to become an onest ardworking slave and dont fret therell be work aplenty for you felldoh was training an army to attack marshank the fur and freedom fighters their flag waved proudly over the camp on the cliffs a green banner with the representation of a flying javelin severing a chain rowanoak shook her aching paws i hope they dont want uniforms as well it took me hours to make that flag rummaging through our costume box and sewing this bit to that it does look rather good though ballaw broke off from drilling a marching column he swaggered jauntily across and threw rowanoak an elaborate salute all present an correct marm what time are you servin us stout creatures some jolly old luncheon wot an army marches on its stomach an all that yknow the badger turned her eyes skyward as if seeking help its a wonder you can do any marching at all with that stomach of yours you great flopeared feedbag dont ask me go and see the cooks ballaw marched off a blaze of military colour in the uniform he had designed for himself from the troupes wardrobe he sang to keep himself in step all the ladies smile at me lookit there lookit there hes a fine dashin figure of a hare of a hare hed fight off a horde alone hes a warrior to the bone feed him plenty an youll never have a care have a care felldoh laid a lance on his throwing stick the group he was training followed his actions laying lances on their sticks as he instructed them arm right back at shoulder level paw gripping stick firmly lean your head in take sight at the target along the javelin shaft weight on the back footpaw and throw the small hillock daubed with a likeness of badrang was pincushioned by eighteen lances keyla picked up a pebble demonstrating to his group see an ordinary stone but it can become a weapon in pawtopaw combat you can use it held tight as a club hit the foe with it as hard as you can or you can throw it watch he hurled the pebble and struck one of the lances on the hillock the mouse called juniper held up a sling look what old barkjon gave me what is it keyla the otter took the tough vine thong shaking his head in admiration as he fitted a pebble to the tongue at its middle he swung it experimentally testing its balance this is a fine sling give me a target to throw at juniper pointed to the hillock hit one of those lances like you did when you threw the pebble crack no sooner had the words left junipers mouth than keyla sent the pebble whistling from its whirling sling it struck a lance snapping it near the point with a cracking impact keyla wound the sling round his paw with a happy smile ill go and see if barkjon can make us more of these gauchee and kastern had a good number of long poles sometimes used by the rambling rosehip players when they were erecting an improvised tent trefoil had suggested that they would make good pikes using the pointed ends which had served as tentstakes buckler his injured shoulder still bandaged drilled a group in the uses of the pike poikes up poikes daown points forard charge celandine sat dabbing her paws in rosewater silly creatures youll either get hurt or have nasty rough paws from using those great long things she found herself looking down the point of gauchees pike off to the cookhouse and help out if you dont want to train as a fighter little missy fusstail ballaw waggled his ears at tullgrew purslane and geum in a very persuasive manner top o the mornin cooks when does a chap get some fodder round here the baby fuffle was dressed in an oversized apron tucked up twice at his middle he was spreading honey on scones with a wooden spoon tullgrew pointed in his direction dont ask us ballaw put in your request to quartermaster sergeant fuffle over there the tiny mouse waved the spoon sternly at the hare fuffle say back t work or i chop y tail off ballaw backed away from the sticky spoonwielding infant muff said old lad nods as good as a wink to a starved warrior i say purslane youve got a very violent offspring there lunch was a simple affair leek and cabbage soup summer salad followed by honeyed scones and strawberry cordial the midday sun was tempered by a gentle breeze from the sea as the newly formed fur and freedom fighters sat about eating and taking their ease rowanoak ballaw felldoh and barkjon held an open discussion on the merits and drawbacks of going into battle barkjon and rowanoak were not convinced that it was a good idea felldoh you havent got a tenth of the force that badrang commands the old squirrel cautioned his son were not strong enough yet lives could be lost needlessly in an attack on marshank the strong young squirrel put aside his food im not talking about pitched battle father lightning attacks are what i plan hit hard and fast then vanish whats the matter with you ive seen the days when we were slaves that you would vow vengeance on badrang and all his kind rowanoak intervened you both have valid points felldoh but i agree with your father we are not warriors nor have we been into battle before granted that badrang is evil and marshank needs destroying but you must realize that his horde are all seasoned killers and trained fighters all that you have at the moment is a small bunch of freed slaves and some strolling players ballaw finished off a scone licking honey from his paws but we freed the slaves didnt we brome walked right into old badbottoms fort and bluffed it out whos to say we cant become a firstrate fightin force and whack them for good what dyou say eh brome old feller brome avoided felldohs eyes i cant say much i may be good at bluffing but im not a warrior i know that now i dont want to see creatures killed particularly our own felldoh ruffled his young friends ears then you can become a healer one who cares for the wounded it takes a brave beast to dash about in battle doing that old geum dipped a scone in her cordial to soften it all this talk of fighting and killing why dont we just find another place far away from here where we can enjoy life leave badrang to his own devices and forget about the whole nasty thing marshank and these shores suddenly purslane was up her eyes blazing ill tell you why because if badrang is still there and marshank still stands then other creatures will be captured and taken as slaves i have a little one and i would fight with my life so that he could grow up a free creature keyla sprang up applauding her brave words well said marm we know what its like to live under the whips of a tyrant its not life its living death felldoh turned to his father and rowanoak these creatures have said it all i could not have spoken more strongly i will lead the first attack tonight barkjon looked up at his strong fearless son it has been in you to do this thing since you were a little one in the quarry helping me to haul rocks may the seasons and good fortune aid you felldoh and keep those under you safe rowanoak shrugged knowing protest would be useless what can i say except break a leg felldoh looked puzzled until ballaw explained in the actin game its our way of sayin good luck to a chap the baby fuffle waved his wooden spoon break bofe legs there was laughter and applause for the infants wisdom i travelling with boldred was a real delight for martin the owl chose the prettiest paths and was friendly with every creature who dwelt beside them they stopped often to eat the abundant fruits that grew everywhere at one place boldred showed them a tree laden with shiny dark red cherries the temptation was too great to resist they stood beneath the low hanging branches plucking the juicy cherries and gobbling them down wonder cudd oi make cherry zoop outn these yurr grumm ruminated boldred spread a wing theres lots of cherry trees round here take your time enjoy them ill be back in a short while she flew off to map new features and talk with other creatures they lay beneath the tree devouring cherries and seeing who could spit the stones furthest pallum plucked a cherry off one of his spikes and popped it into his mouth ah this is the life for us pals without warning an incredibly ancient hedgehog came crashing through the undergrowth towards them waving a knobbly blackthorn stick he was completely grey and quite shaky on his paws but it did not diminish his temper get ye gone ye rascals ye cherry thievin wastrels be off with ye or ill lay this stick across your robbin backs pallum stood upright holding out his paws in peace here now hold hard father were not robbers the ancient beast swung his stick at pallum but he did it so slowly that the young hedgehog had no trouble avoiding it dont call me father ye young brigand i wouldnt be thy father for a whole plum orchard the old hedgehog wore tiny square spectacles on his snout end and as he swung the stick they fell off he groped about still whacking out feebly rose dodged under the stick retrieving the spectacles she held the blackthorn tight as she resettled the glasses on the greysnouted creature there thats better were not thieves sir we didnt know the cherry trees belonged to you he tugged fitfully at the stick that rose was still holding let go of my stick damsel youre no better than ye should be martin sat up there was no danger from the old one but he was becoming very tiresome with his insults and rantings the young mouse spoke sternly to him keep a civil tongue in your head old one and stop waving that stick about or ill take it from you the hedgehog managed to get the stick loose from rose and adopted a fighting stance hoho ye boldfaced mouse so ye want to fight me now then so be it come on have at ye he raised the stick just in time for boldred to swoop in and pluck it from his paws she landed shaking her head aggril stop this how many times have you been told the cherry trees do not belong to you they are here for all creatures not just for you the old hedgehog aggril knocked the heads from some daisies with his footpaws muttering rebelliously young uns today have no respect for age yon mouse with the sword offered me combat twere no fault o mine grumm stood up indignantly oo ee gurt fibber marthen dood no such a thing youm a crafty ole beast zurr beggin yurr pardon iffen oi do say so immediately aggrils mood changed at the sight of grumm oh a moley creature do accept my umble apologies friends moleys are the nicest an wisest beasts alive do ye an thy companions have a liking for cherry cordial follow me the four travellers looked at each other nonplussed boldred shook with silent mirth go on follow him hes harmless really just a touch eccentric im mapping a stream course see you later she winged off high above the trees grumm started following aggril calling to the others coom on oi dearly wudd loik t taste cherry corjul the old hedgehog lived in a hollow oak long dead but still standing with a small door over a hole at its base they followed him in it was cool and dark stacked all around its walls were kegs flasks and gourds of cordial aggril was very proud of his stock he adjusted his glasses and peered closely at the labels on each receptacle mmm now here be a cordial fit for kings an queens a score of seasons old i lined the cask with honey myself to sweeten it there was pure white cheese and celery wafers to go with the drink they sat on upturned casks as he issued them with wonderfully carved cherrywood bowls to drink from cherrywood be the best of all trees to make bowls from taste this and see what thee think of my art it was absolutely delicious dark cool and sweet before they had finished he was opening a large gourd this was made by my mother or twas made by my grandmother im not sure twas so long ago notice tis a brighter red and a fizzy taste more suited to eat with salads gourds were opened casks unbunged and flasks broached martin and rose sat together in the cool dimness of the hollow oak eating cheese and celery wafers and sipping so many different cordials each with its own history that they lost count aggrils voice droned on like a bumblebee hovering round apple blossom while outside the sun made leaf patterns in the still woodlands martin had never known such peace and happiness in all his life he lay back and closed his eyes the heavy fragrance of wild cherries scenting the air about him it was night rose came slowly awake with the sensation that she was drifting floating under the soft dark canopy of the sky starpointed and centered with a waning moon the mousemaid lay at peace feeling the swirl of water against silent paddles hearing the gentle creak of timbers she was on a boat be still liddle shipmate an take yer ease the strong cheerful face of a big male otter appeared before her rose sat up slowly trying to shake off the feeling of unreality where am i aboard the good craft waterlily an travellin on the great broadstream lay back an sleep now yore in safe paws miss martin pallum and grumm were curled up nearby their contented snores blending with the slight noises of the boat the otter plied his oar with a hefty tattooed paw as he chuckled ole aggril certainly slipped you an yer pals a good measure of his special sleepin potion them three wont know nothin about it until way into mornin light rose felt helpless a pleasant inertia stealing over her as she slumped gently back you mean to tell me that aggril drugged us the otter grinned and winked at her sure as my names starwort that ole hedgepig dont like young uns noways he reckons the cherry trees are his an its good night to any beast that messes wi them lucky you was with boldred or aggril mightve sent you into a sleep youd never wake from as it was he just popped you off tempry sos boldred could get you out of the way we ad to sling you an yer pals into ammocks an carry you a fair way to get you aboard waterlily rose half tried to keep her eyes open murmuring drowsily where is boldred the shorteared owls voice came from somewhere above her perched nice and comfy up here on the masthead do as starwort says rose go back to sleep the mousemaid could hear her own voice as if from a distance back to slee p the sun was up and birds serenaded the new day from the thick foliage bordering broadstream the travellers sat with their paws through the midship rails letting the water run through them a crew of two dozen otters hauled the single square sail to catch the mild breeze singing lustily as they heaved on the ropes oh the broadstream comes from who knows where it flows to who knows whither and i sail with it here an there wandrin yon an hither the place of waters is my home for im a fearless rover through calm an storm im bound to roam until my days are over roll roll and flow and let the seasons gooooooooo as the last deep bass notes died a triangles discordant jangle rent the air grumm sniffed his homely face lit up hurr tis zoop small otters poured out of the forecastle cabin leaping somersaulting and banging ladles on wooden bowls starworts wife marigold issued the four friends with bowls and ladles were i you id urry those nippersll lick the pot dry theyre nought but stomachs on paws over a charcoal brazier on the afterdeck a fat otter called stewer was dishing out soup loaves of barleybread and a concoction the otters drank called scupperjuice stewer filled their bowls to brimming cautioning them cheerfully watershrimp bulrush n hotroot soup mates itll give you fur like velvet an put a sparkle in yer eye but drink plenty o that scupperjuice to cool yer gills pallums eyes watered he fanned his mouth with both paws and gulped scupperjuice greedily phwaw my poor mouths on fire i never knew soup could taste so hot oh my burning tongue martin and rose were suffering equally the soup was delicious but the hotroot pepper must have been ladled into it tossing aside his spoon grumm drank his soup with gusto the heat of it did not seem to bother him gurr this be wunnerful zoop ho aye furst clarss yurr you uns ave moi bread an moi drink give oi yurr zoop willingly they exchanged their soup for the moles bread and scupperjuice grumm slurped away merrily watched by the entire otter crew and their families starwort shook his head i aint never seen a creature enjoy our soup so much in all me born days we cant even take it without drinkin scupperjuice to quench the burnin grumm matey are you sure youve never ad this soup afore the mole wiped a bead of sweat from his snout tip no zurr never tho oi wisht oi ad think wot oi been amissen all these seasons hurr streamsailing was a novel experience for the travellers under the otter crews helpful paws they learned to reef and tack scull row and steer boldred had flown on ahead to contact the shrews the otters reckoned to meet up with them sometime in midevening grumm and pallum took instantly to the nautical life the waterlily was so large and flatbottomed that they forgot their fear of the water both the hedgehog and the mole adopted the otters rolling gait and streamslang ahoy grumm matey tis a fair day on an even keel ahurr pallum me earty coom an sit yurr midships an drop anchor longside oi youm ole streamdog martin and rose clapped paws to mouths stifling their giggles at the antics of the pair roach tench perch and the odd pike could be seen through the clear running stream following the waterlily for the scraps that were thrown overboard sometimes they would cruise where the bank was deepsided enjoying the shade of the trees other times they would ride out on the broad swell catching the breeze rose watched martin waving at a kingfisher which hung over an inlet whirring its wings in a ceaseless blur as it watched the water for small fry it was an idyllic day early evening passed coloring broadstreams banks a limpid green that gave way to goldflecked cerise in midstream they heard the chattering and squabbling of small gruff voices from around a sharp bend in the watercourse starwort shook his head despairingly as he manoeuvred the tiller them broadstream shrews never stops arguin an disputin they dont i once saw two of em jump in the water an climb out to argue over who was the wettest reef yer sail you two streamdogs were roundin the point pallum and grumm attempted an otters footpaw salute haye aye steady as she goes reefin an furlin wi all paws pulling smoothly into the bank they disembarked into a noisy chaos the broadstream shrews were odd little creatures raggledyhaired and clad in baggy pantaloons they all carried short rapiers which they constantly drew and jabbed the air with when making a point boldred perched by their campfire checking the charts and maps she had revised the travellers sat alongside her surrounded by a horde of curious shrews she squinted her large round eyes in exasperation shrews they dont even have a leader of this tribe but each one thinks that they are in charge of everything listen to them im not sailin tonight weve been on the stream all day i want to sail tonight its the best time for voyagin weve done enough i say we dont sail for the rest of the season who

shaking their heads sternly at the bad behavior of the little squabblers grumm had been nosing around the fire tasting the food from the various pans and cauldrons he pulled a wry face whispering to rose gurr no wonder they be illtempered ee food tastes tumble miz roser oi wouldnt feed et to a dead frog burr no the mousemaid took the foodpack from martins shoulder ive just had an idea here do as i do breaking one of grumms sweet invention cakes she gave them a portion each and began eating her own piece with huge enjoyment mmmm this tastes good the others followed her example boldred snaffled hers in one bite and began pecking crumbs from her talons delicious cant afford to waste a single crumb hoo aye tis vurry scrummy seedinly noice absolutely delightful best i ever tasted oh yes this is the stuff pals great gradually the shrews became silent turning their attention to the friends as they praised the cake to the skies a shrew stabbed the air with his sword gimme some i want to try that stuff martin eyed him disdainfully watch yourself shrew dont wave that sword in my face and make demands of me rose wagged a stern paw at the offender put that weapon away this instant and ask properly didnt your mother ever teach you to say please the shrew was dumbstruck for a moment then he put down his sword and lowered his voice can i try your cake please pallum took a reflective nibble and turned to grumm what dyou think is our cake too good for the likes of these the mole licked a crumb from his chin moight drive theym mad theym ony use to eatin drefful swill several of the shrews looked beseechingly to boldred the owl looked as if she were about to say yes then shook her head no i dont think so i would have given them all the cakes from our pack but theyve made up their minds not to sail tonight you cant make creatures go on the stream voyaging if theyre afraid of the dark the owls statement created uproar fights scuffles and arguments broke out all over the shrew camp star wort bounded through the melee giving the friends a huge wink he roared out ahoy you cant talk about river creatures like that my mates the stream shrewsll sail anywheres at anytime aint that right lads immediately the shrews stopped fighting and waved their swords aye well sail anywhere day or night rose put her head to one side and imitated a gruff shrew voice give us the cakes and its a bargain boldred tossed the foodpack into a long shrew logboat you shrews drive a hard bargain those are the last of our cakes but so be it youve won the argument lets go the shorteared owl had to take to the air to avoid being swept into the logboats with her four friends in a very short time they were out in midstream the shrews poling their canoeshaped treetrunks hard competing in a race between crews the travellers barely had time to turn and wave at the cheering otters before they were swept out of sight water rushed by the bows of the six logboats as night fell grumm and pallum gripped the sides tightly as the narrow craft shot along on the swift current shaking and rocking from side to side rose held martins paw her face shining were travelling downstream i recognize this part of the water if we take a turn off to a side channel on the right we can be in noonvale tomorrow afternoon as she spoke the shrews backed water wheeling their craft into an inlet and down a sidestream it was narrower than the main water but just as fastrunning rose laughed aloud with joy ha ha see those knotty old willows drooping into the water i sat under them when i was a little one i knew it were going home to noonvale r capn tramun clogg had finished filling in the prison pit his paws ached with weariness and his tawdry finery was coated in dust pushing the barrow to a corner of the courtyard he lowered himself gently into it and let the enormous wooden clogs slip from his footpaws as he heaved a melancholy sigh harr tis an ard life an no mistake but at least badrang aint got me stannin guard up on the wall like those fellers clogg lay in the barrow watching the guards on the walltop silhouetted against the early night sky ruminating to himself aye is igh v mighty lordship will be drinkin wine an dinin off fish an roasted fowl in that longouse while ive got to bide ere til mornin waitin fer a crust an some water the corsair heard the thwock of the slingstones as the two wall sentries fell in a heap he smiled wickedly in the darkness hah them slaves is learnin fast now iffen me an badrang was still partners id raise the alarm but we aint im only a slave an raisin alarms is nought to do with slaves a volley of flaming javelins whooshed in over the walls clogg was well out of their range he watched with great interest as they hit the longhouse two or three missing some falling flat on the roof but the majority thudded into the timber walls blazing merrily another wave of burning javelins streaked through the night sky like comets finding the wooden palisade fence of the slave compound a mighty roar rose from the shores outside marshank fur and freeeedooooom badrang came tearing out of the longhouse stood on a lighted javelin by accident and hopped about on one paw yelling attack attack stand to arms walltop stations he grabbed two scurrying halfasleep soldiers put that fire out quick they stood undecided but we aint got water sire the enraged tyrant knocked their heads sharply together addlepates use sand earth dust he dashed off to the walltop drawing his sword as he shouted orders to the horde milling in the courtyard archers slingthrowers follow me ballaw and felldoh doused the fire they had used to ignite the javelins they split up each taking half the force ballaw to the back of the fort felldoh to the left side felldohs attackers flattened themselves against the earth and lay quite still the squirrel passed the order along to his group after ballaws troops send their javelins off be ready badrang peered out across the deserted shore the archers and slingthrowers stood ready for his command crosstooth stood beside the tyrant watching theyll be hidin behind those rocks on the shore badrang could see what the fox said was true he raised a paw archers put a volley or two over the back of those rocks that should flush them out ready fire the shafts clattered harmlessly off the rocks leaving the beach still silent there was a hissing noise in the air instinctively badrang threw himself flat on the walltop down get down too late three hordebeasts fell to the javelins that sped in over the back walls propelled by the throwing sticks they smashed and splintered on the fort side of the walltop badrang was up and running around the rampart the slimy tricksters theyre round the back come on felldoh crouched low watching the walltop his javelins and slings ready here they come wait for it now let them get to the middle of the wall wait for it steady steady now the javelins and sling stones whirred off into the night wounding three and slaying a further two felldohs troops immediately fell flat blending with the landscape in the night as soon as they had launched their javelins ballaws command dashed off to the right side wall and lay low badrang had left half his archers to fire at felldohs fighters leading the other half around to the back only to find the rear landscape deserted he banged his sword handle hard against the wall the scum theyve probably backed off into the marshes cringing curs why dont they show themselves and fight boggs the ferret had served long in cloggs crowsnest he had the keenest eyes of any beast peering hard into the darkness he stood stock still straining his eyes theres creatures out there im sure of it sire where boggs can you see em badrangs voice was low and excited aye i can now sire theyre a good distance off but comin this way looks to be about six no five of em badrang took a bow from a nearby rat give me your arrows you there give boggs your bow and arrows the rest of you archers notch up your shafts and lie low dont fire until i give the word plastered with mud hungry and boneweary after trekking the country lost since emerging from the marshes hisk and four survivors staggered through the darkness the weasel captain rubbed dirt from his tired eyes peering at the shape that loomed ahead in the night he gasped in sheer relief its marshank the fortress were safe come on they broke into a shambling run cheering hoarsely to badrang it appeared that the five figures were charging mistaking them for enemies he drew back the shaft on his taut bowstring let em get a bit closer wait ballaw and his throwers released a salvo of javelins from over the right side of the fort the force on the left walltop had an idea where felldoh and his troop were lying they kept them well pinned down with arrows and slingstones ballaws javelins caused disarray among them and a weasel shrieked as he was struck in the side young juniper leaped up calling triumphantly haha that stopped em they aaaargh he fell with an arrow protruding from his chest his friend a young mouse named yarrow stood up completely in shock they got juniper look theres an arrow sti keyla tackled him low around the footpaws yarrow fell staring in amazement at the arrow that pierced his paw right through felldoh was grimfaced as he dragged junipers body to him keep your heads down keyla weve got to get out of here help yarrow ill carry juniper now all of you crawl fast and stay low follow me badrang crouched below the parapet straining the r arrow against his taut bowstring as he watched boggs scanning across the walltop the ferret dropped down by the tyrants side and nodded theyre very close now we can pick em off like daisies badrang glared along at the archers ranged in a crouching row were not taking any prisoners kill them now the five creatures went down like stones as the hail of barbed shafts hit them two more volleys followed thudding into the bodies to make sure they were truly slain badrang was shaking with exhilaration i only wish it had been day then i could have watched the looks of surprise on their stupid faces ballaw took his fighters around the front and along the beach meeting up with felldoh and the others at the foot of the cliffs the hare was in high good humor top hole wot i think i could get to like this soldierin life we gave them a bally good lesson an not one of us was harmed how did it go with you squirrel mlad felldoh nodded towards the limp form on the ground juniper was killed yarrow is wounded the exhilaration of victory left ballaw and his command poor little chap here ill carry him it was a sad procession that made its way along the clifftops back to camp in the dawn light a group of horde soldiers gathered round the five carcasses shot full of arrows clogg watched the venomous look on badrangs face and laughed humourlessly you did well last night matey slayed hisk an four of yer own still you could be forgiven fer the mistake theyre so covered in marshmud they couldve been anybeast the tyrants paw shot to his sword but then he thought better of it turning on his paw he barked out an order as he stalked off fleabane wulpp make that slave dig five separate graves and bury that lot dont spare the rod keep him busy rowanoak stood over the small grave that felldoh and ballaw had dug as near to the cliff edge as the rocky ground would permit brome put the finishing touches to a herbal dressing and bandage on yarrows paw there as good as new how does that feel yarrow lifted his paw up and down wincing slightly thank you brome it still hurts a bit but ill live with it not like poor juniper he wiped away the bitter tears that flowed afresh on the bandage brome threw a comforting paw around the young mouse come on lets go and say our farewells to him yarrow ballaw and felldoh made him a nice resting place that will always stand free to the sunshine and wind in sight of the sea the entire camp gathered round the grave after a short ceremony summer flowers were placed on the fresh filledin earth and barkjon said some words it is always sad when a young one who has not seen many seasons is taken from us juniper was such a mouse cheerful and well loved by all but he did not die in vain this young one gave his life fighting tyranny so that others in the seasons to come may live in peace and freedom that is all i have to say would anybeast like to add a word or two felldoh stepped forward he laid junipers sling and stones amid the flowers you were a brave fighter juniper we will never forget you badrang and his horde will pay tenfold for your death as the fur and freedom fighters drifted away from the grave yarrow sat alone by the flowers gazing numbly at the resting place of his friend brome caught up with felldoh and motioned him to one side that was not a goodbye to juniper it was an oath of vengeance how many more must die before youre satisfied felldohs eyes were like rainswept pebbles as he answered as many as fate decrees myself included i will not rest until badrang is dead and marshank brought down he strode off in search of fresh lancewood kastern watched them parting before going across to brome do not blame felldoh he feels for juniper as much as you brome the young mouse shook his head no he doesnt all he feels is that he must take revenge and carry on killing he was my hero once but now its like talking to a strange beast i dont know him any more kastern watched the lone figure of felldoh in the distance he is a warrior and that is the way of warriors just like the mouse martin you are always talking about brome shouldered his healing kit if martin is a warrior like felldoh then may the seasons help my sister rose if she is still with him it was as if the very air were enchanted martin grumm and pallum followed rose through serene woodlands quiet and high in the sunwarmed afternoon they had thankfully left the shrews in a backwater tributary of broadstream the creatures were arguing and squabbling over the remainder of the food and drink which rose had given them because she wanted to travel fast and light it was a forest as old as time with a special feel about it cool in the dark green shade carpeted with a many flowered floor shafted with golden rays casting their light on fern and bush velvety green moss was soft underpaw and melodious birdsong was the only sound to filter through the variegated canopy of emerald and viridian green rose halted by a conical timeworn rock rose what is it martin felt his own voice ringing strangely in the stillness she stroked the monolithic stone and pointed downwards noonvale through the trees martin saw the land dip down into a huge valley the blue smoke of cooking fires rose in a lazy spiral above the foliage and small thatched rooftops could be seen here and there an aura of time forgotten hung over the beautiful scene the softly colored patches of flower gardens mixed with the unmarked boundaries of brightly hued orchards while the light and sparkle of a stream cascaded into full bloom of a waterfall below high above them boldred circled and wheeled on the thermals casting her great wingshadow over them as she soared gracefully downward see you in noonvale friends they stood looking at one another for a moment happiness brimming between them grumm waved his ladle hurr wem made et cmon he broke into a run went head over paws through the loam and rolled down the valley side chortling happily his three companions paws thrumming the ground as they took off in a dash after him urran voh was not an old mouse though he was completely grey and wore a beard as the patriarch of noonvale he was an impressive figure dressed in a flowing green robe with a thick creamcolored cord at its middle his wife aryah stood beside him beautiful and motherly in a lilac gown embroidered with green leaves rose threw herself into their welcoming paws breathlessly both mice hugged their daughter affectionately aryans welcome for rose was interspersed with anxious enquiries about her son oh rose my rose youre home did you find your brother my youve grown taller slimmer too that rascal brome did you see him did he mention his mother and father noonvale has been quiet without your singing rose is brome following along will he be here soon roses heart sank brome and felldoh had not found their way to noonvale she could only hope that they were safe somewhere rose began gasping out her story but urran voh held up a paw later it is enough for now that you are safely home rose no doubt youve risked life and limb several times to help your brother you must realize that brome is a born wanderer never content and stubborn to the last word well that young mouse is getting big enough to look after himself but if youve agreed to meet up here i expect hell turn up sooner or later maybe someday hell have sense enough to stay in noonvale and not go dashing off every time the mood takes him ah grumm trencher you good mole greetings who are these two young creatures grumm introduced them yurr be pallum an marthen ee wurrier zurr theym wunnerful gudd friends to oi an miz roser roses mother aryah cut short the introductions busily we can talk later you must be starving rose dear show your friends where they can wash and find clean robes then bring them to the council lodge i must prepare a homecoming party for you sometime later pallum and martin stood at the entrance to council lodge it was an immense homely old thatched building its foursquare banquet tables dominating the centre beneath smokedarkened rafters rose and grumm led pallum and martin in bathed in blossom water and clad in a clean faded purple tunic martin held roses paw standing slightly behind the mousemaid the lodge was packed with the inhabitants of noonvale they stood cheering rose and grumm heartily rose tugged martins paw come on take a bow martin the young mouse bowed formally amid the applause urran voh waved him up with the other travellers to their places at table everybeast stood as the patriarch raised his goblet good food good friends and peace for ever in this place may the seasons always be kind to noonvale a multitude of voices answered as one they sat and the welcome party began throughout his life the memory of that happy day stayed locked secretly in martins heart he sat with rose between her parents speechless at the sight of the abundant tables flowers trailed everywhere from the rafters walls windows and table edges roses lilies vines and blossoms festooned the whole place twining around the urns of strawberry cordial dandelion and burdock cup mint and lavender water chestnut ale blackcurrant wine and cider platters and trays were heaped high with salads cheeses breads and pasties whose contents he could only guess at babies and little ones seated on their parents laps gazed longingly at the array of trifles flans puddings pies and tartlets each with its honeycovered contents peeking through mounds of cream grumm chose a deep slice of cherrycake glazed with candied nuts allowing the tiny mole sitting with him to take a huge bite he chuckled burr hurrhurr doant boite off moren youm can chew bungo it took a while for the infant to swallow it all he tugged at grumms snout hurr then get oi some stawbrry drink nuncle grumm youm wouldnt loik oi to purrish o thirst a friendly hedgehog maid sat next to pallum offering him various savoury delights try our leek and chestnut pastie here let me pour some thyme and radish sauce on it for you pallum dug in gratefully thank you marm most kind of you marm marm what do you think i am some old spikemaid she laughed my name is teaslepaw have you tasted our chestnut ale my family brews it pallum flushed beneath his spikes burying his snout in the beaker its very tasty marm er peasletaw pawseltea er marm martin and rose chose a damson and hazelnut flan topped with mintcream they attacked the plate from both sides meeting in the middle of the platter rose wiped cream from martins nose with a napkin whatll we try next cherrycake martin shook his head vigorously no thanks i dont want to go to sleep yet they both laughed remembering the sly aggril boldred was slightly too large for any seat she perched on a windowsill demolishing a wild plum and apple pudding watched by a group of admiring youngsters can you eat all of that by yourself missus boldred the owl raised a large talon i can eat three of these without stopping this is excellent the onlookers eyes grew even wider three plum n apple puddens great seasons the party went on until late into the night nothing was stinted there was an abundance of everything for every creature the guests sat back sipping mint and lavender water as a quartette of otters performed an acrobatic dance while a band of mice and moles accompanied them playing a lively slipjig on reed flutes and drums at a nod from rose martin excused himself quietly and followed the mousemaid and her parents to their cottage urran voh relaxed in his favorite chair aryah took out her embroidery she sewed slowly as they listened to rose tell of their adventures martin sat at a window seat letting rose do all the talking as rose described the evil and cruelty of the slaves lives at marshank her parents faces became more and more grave rose came to the end of the tale her father nodded you did well to return home rose while there is such evil you should be here with your family if only brome could see this too i am sorry that he and his friend felldoh are not here safe as you are let us hope he has the good sense to see that the outside world is not for him and he returns to us before the autumn martin took a deep breath sir he said i agree that noonvale is a haven of peace would that we could all live in such but outside there is evil and i cannot rest here knowing that those i lived with in slavery are still under the heel of badrang i came here for help will you allow me to ask for that help among the folk of noonvale there may be some here who would join me in a quest to free my friends from slavery urran vohs face was serious you ask a great deal our creatures have never seen war they are dedicated to our life of friendship and peace his wife said quietly but my dear where there is such pain and hardship for so many innocent creatures surely we could let martin speak to our folk any who wish to help can decide for themselves urran voh turned to martin my wife speaks wisely i do not wish for evil to become part of our lives here but maybe we can prevent the wickedness from spreading very well martin ask my creatures for help and good fortune go with you i see that you carry a blade we do not have such things here for the time you are with us you must not stay armed give me your sword martin the young mouse placed a defensive paw on his sword handle i am sorry sir i cannot do what you ask urran vohs eyes were stern in the awkward silence that followed aryan intervened between the patriarch and the warrior martin i know my husbands feelings but i think i also know yours too you have seen suffering and evil in your life there is none of that to be found at noonvale would you do something for me i am not asking you to give your sword to urran take it and hang it on the peg by the door do this yourself no one else will touch your blade without a word martin drew his sword going over to the door he hung the weapon upon a peg protruding from the wall balancing it by the hilt it hung there small and lonelylooking the young mouse could not help thinking of his fathers blade big and worn but a proper warriors weapon now in the paws of the tyrant he would take it back someday somehow rose smiled happily at him good come and ill show you to your room at a glance from urran voh aryan intervened once more no rose youll have martin up half the night talking ill do it follow me young mouse when they had gone roses father put his paw about her shoulders and sighed unhappily rose listen to me carefully daughter what i tell you is for your own good this martin he is a warrior and death walks alongside such creatures you must never let yourself grow too close to him the mousemaid smiled father youre not a warrior youre a worrier martin is my best friend in the whole world he would never hurt me or let me be hurt ill change him youll see one day he will be the most peaceful creature in noonvale urran voh rose from his chair slowly you and brome are alike both strongwilled i only hope that you are right rose though i think no good will ever come of your friendship because i can tell that martin has a will and determination far stronger than any i have ever come across good night my rose before you sleep think on what i have said rose ruffled her fathers grey beard good night you great fusspot theres nothing to think about except a much needed nights rest when you come to know martin the warrior as well as i do youll understand r felldoh had planted caches of javelins all around marshank in the halfshadowed world of twilight he was like a phantom two sentries hung over the wall slain by his accurate throwing inside the fortress another one had been slain and three lay wounded more pesky buryin fer me to do in the mornin tramun clogg snorted as he peered out from under his wheelbarrow stripe me iffen i waits long enough ill ave marshank alone to meself cos ill be the only beast left livin ere badrang paced the floor of his badly charred longhouse several prominent horde figures sat in silence as he ranted angrily were not dashing out into the night to get picked off like flies thats what those slaves want im not going to fight on their terms ill do it my way when the times right crosstooth played with a dagger twirling it deftly yore right sire ive told everybeast to keep under cover them that gets urt or slain tis their own fault slamming himself down in his chair the tyrant gulped wine the weasel lumpback unwisely voiced an opinion but if we dont fight back theyve got us pinned down theyll start thinkin were frightened of em an begin attackin arder badrang hurled the wine jug lumpback scarcely had time to duck as it smashed on the wall behind him covering the hapless weasel with pottery shards and damson wine badrangs teeth were bared as he hissed at lumpback who asked you dirtbrain i dont need the thoughts of idiots and halfwits to do my planning for me maybe youd like to get out there and face them yourself boggs felt sorry for lumpback he could see it would only take a sudden whim for badrang to send the weasel out on the shore alone go easy lord he was only sayin easy badrangs face flushed dark with rage as he stood and threw the chair over go easy you say while a stinking pawful of slaves are holding marshank and an entire horde under siege whipping out his sword he leaped at the group get out of here go on out of my sight you mindless mudcrawling morons youre about as much use as a onewinged gull yelling and shouting they scrambled over each other to avoid the flailing blade and get out of the door felldoh came out from behind a rock his keen ears twitching as he pinpointed the sounds of the scuffle with remarkable precision he quickly sent off two javelins one after the other lumpback was last to leave he had been dodging the swordplay as badrang chased him with a yell he dived out of the open door straight into felldohs first javelin badrang slammed the door shut quickly thruck felldohs second javelin pierced the halfburned timbers the weapon came right through stopping a hairsbreadth from the tyrants bloodshot eyes badrang slashed with his sword chopping the javelin in two pieces flinging back his head he roared out into the gathering night sneaks cowards ill chop you into nshbait if i catch you come on out then stoatface felldohs deep voice boomed back from the shore two can make fishbait scum badrang yelled back at his unseen foe ill fix you good and proper when the time is right felldohs harsh laughter rang out in reply hahahah scum yourself yellowbelly hide in your fort i know youre scared scared me badrangs voice went shrill with spleen i am badrang lord and tyrant of all these lands nobeast can stand against me i was killing and fighting while you were still clinging to your mothers tail felldoh had got a fix on the voice three javelins in swift succession burst through the longhouse door another one thudded into the roof badrang lay flat behind his upturned chair gripping the wood tightly to stop himself trembling hahaha missed me he managed to laugh back pity you cant throw those things straight felldohs reply came deep and confident dont worry ive got all night to practice dont go to sleep now gathering his javelins felldoh slid off into the night leaving behind a very worried stoat peering through a crack in the gate tramun clogg saw the shadowy figure hurry off south toward the cliffs harr twere as i reckoned only one beast well id best get me sleep no use tryin to tell is lordship hes safe to ave a bit o shuteye he wouldnt take the word of a slave away in the safety of the clifftops ballaw sat watching the gloomy little groups of creatures sitting around the campfire all day long the mood had been heavy among them the hare finished sipping cider from a scallop shell and made his way over to where the rambling rosehip players lounged about by the cart evenin chaps an chapesses wot my my you lot look like a pile of frogs thatve been to a rockswallowin party no wonder our chums are lookin glum if an

rowanoak braced her huge back as gauchee kastern trefoil and buckler formed a pyramid on it buckler stood highest on top of trefoils head ballaw swirled a floppy cloak as he placed a scrap of material on the ground and called to the audience pray silence please no tittering or throwing objects whilst this dangerous trick is in progress malcolm the magnificent mole will dive from a very great and perilous height on to this damp cloth ladies an gentlebeasts i present malcolm the magnificent diving mole there was a round of applause buckler dressed in a baggy costume and wearing a curly black

someone dont let poor malcolm drown before hes had his custard pie fear not fair maid i will save the poor lad for i can dive like a duck and swim like a rock ballaw ran to the rescue celandine tripped and fell beautifully the custard pie sailed through the air and kastern caught it just as ballaw whipped the damp cloth from bucklers nose he waved it dramatically saved saved from a fate worse than tummyache the flapping cloth hit kastern in the face she let go of the pie and it splattered all over bucklers head the audience fell about holding their sides and hooting with laughter

brome i couldnt help watching felldoh tonight myself hes being far too smug sort of secretive have you noticed anything tullgrew about felldoh well hes been going about patting backs and shaking paws grinning like a demented frog thats not like him hes usually a dour creature these days brome listened to the guttering fire crackle gently so it was not only he who had observed felldoh acting oddly listen you two i dont like it one little bit in fact ive been thinking im going to follow that squirrel tomorrow and see what hes up to fancy coming along keyla and tullgrew both nodded silently brome clas ped their paws good as soon as its light we stick to him like limpets the campfire burned down to a tiny glimmer of light on the clifftops ballaw and rowanoak snored gently in the cart and a soft summer wind rippled the grass the encampment slumbered peacefully in the calm night only felldoh was still awake he sat with his back against a rock planning dawn light crept over noonvale in a golden haze unused to sleeping in a bed under a roof martin was up and about feeling strangely light without the short sword tucked snugly at his side he wandered about the settlement marvelling at the beauty and proliferation of fruit and flower a tribute to the industrious inhabitants sitting beside the waterfall he enjoyed the cool atmosphere perch and trout could be seen gliding lazily in the crystal depths of a pool at the base of the falls the young mouse stared at his reflection in a shadowed inlet the marks of the deep scratches on his cheeks were still there and his face was thinner though the resolute jaw was firm and the eyes that stared back at him shone with the light of determination he was not surprised to see aryah appear beside him she placed her paws on his shoulders watching his image in the water you are an early riser martin i could not sleep but i see you are up early too yes i have spoken to boldred i have asked her to seek out brome what is the matter martin are you not happy here it is a beautiful spot but you must soon return to marshank the young mouse flicked a pebble into the pool and watched it sink aryah sat down beside him and patted his paw you and my husband urran voh are both alike in many ways warrior and peacemaker both walking different paths but both stubborn and immovable the world needs such creatures rose told me that the tyrant holds your fathers sword is that the reason you must go to take the sword back from him martin stood up he helped aryah on to her paws yes the sword belonged to my father luke the warrior i swore a warriors oath to him that i would never let another beast take it from me i was little more than an infant when badrang stole my sword but now the seasons have given my paws the strength to take it back you understand i must do this and i must free marshank of slavery martin thought he saw the glimmer of a tear in aryans eye i understand young warrior the thing that grieves me is that rose will go with you no matter what i or her father may say martin reached out wiping the teardew from aryans cheek i will take far greater care protecting her life than i will my own grumm ladled creamy pale batter on to a heated stone grunting eagerly as he watched it cook gurr pancakers oi dearly do luv pancakers wi brekkist his tiny nephew bungo stirred a cauldron furiously hurrhurr an zoop nuncle

sunsplashed shade and creatures bustled to and fro with breakfast items rose dashed by martin she was carrying a tray of hot pancakes spread with honey and decorated with pear slices and raspberries out of my way sir or you wont get breakfast today martin sprang nimbly aside and bowed low my apologies marm nothing should get in the way of good food then dont get in the way lend a paw over here pallum shouted across as he staggered under an immense beechwood bowl of fruit salad mice hedgehogs moles and squirrels called out their morning greetings to each other as they went about their chores every creature helped until the tables were ready little ones scrubbed from tail to eartip and freshly besmocked clambered up on to familiar laps young ones giggling and gossiping together sat next to their closest friends old ones and parents made sure their families were comfortable before perching in their timehonoured positions at table when every creature was settled urran voh recited the

and damsons hung red yellow and purple amid other trees bearing pears apples and cherries neat rows of raspberry blackcurrants bilberry and redcurrants provided a border between the orchard and the vegetable garden at the far end of the orchard a crew of moles was digging around a gaunt dead sycamore tree grumm was helping he greeted them with a wave of his huge digging paw hurr look at oi not ome a twoday an oim back at work he explained that they were digging to bring the dead sycamore down it would be cut up and used as stump seats around the waterfall pool martin immediately rolled up the sleeves of his smock and began to help rose watched for a while then tossing off her headband of woven flowers she jumped into the hole alongside martin all through the day they toiled six holes had been bored in and around the base of the dead forest giant and still the sycamore refused to budge a crowd of noonvale creatures who had finished their chores gathered round to watch grumm and several other moles shook soil from their digging claws and wiped perspiring snouts gurr that thurr old tree doant want to budge grumm hurr no gumbler nor wudd youm iffen thoi roots ad been thurr for all they long seasons hurr usns be yurr till winter shiften thisn wots olden et up wem digged deep all round et grumm vanished down a hole and reappeared spraying earth about taproot gurt fat un et ull ave to break afore she moves hurrr martin took a small mole axe and climbed into the hole im going to have a go at that taproot rose take all these spectators and find the longest thickest piece of wood you can bring it over here and give me a shout when you do rose and her party scoured noonvale the only thing they could come up with was a long thick rowan trunk forked at one end urran voh watched them rolling it away where are you taking that we were going to reinforce the ridgepole rafter of the council lodge with it rose tugged her fathers beard playfully martin wants it to move the old sycamore dont worry well bring it back urran voh snorted i should hope you will though how you plan to move that big sycamore with it is beyond me baby bungo took the patriarchs paw hurr then coom an watch youm never too seasoned to lurn zurr martin tossed aside the axe he had cut as deep into the taproot as the limited space in the hole allowed climbing out of the hole he directed the group rolling the rowan trunk into position push it over here thats it let the forked end down towards me grumm build up some earth and stones at the edge of the main hole here watch out let the rowan slide down good the rowan trunk stood at an angle down into the main hole its twin forks buried in two more holes at the sycamores roots martin climbed from the hole and inspected it urran voh nodded a lever dont you think its a bit big martin the young mouse shook his head the bigger the better sir right come on everybeast climb up it and perch on the high end you too bungo every little helps amid much merriment and whooping the crowd climbed up the rowan trunk they balanced precariously at its tilted top hanging on to each other urran voh looked up at them theres too few not enough room for all up there get some ropes it was not long before aryah and the otters who had sung in quartette came hurrying along carrying coils of stout vine rope this is all we could find dear will these do martin the young mouse threw a rope up to the creatures balanced on the end of the rowan perfect marm tie those ropes fast up there the rest of you swing on the ends for all your worth you on top when i give the word jump up and down ready every creature waited on martins word right jump up and down now swing hard on the ropes swing the rowan dipped and bent slightly then loud crack was heard from beneath the sycamore martin and urran voh threw themselves on the ropes yelling aloud to the others crowding above and below jump swing jump swing there was more rumbling and cracking from beneath the base of the sycamore it began to tipple as the rowan bent under the strain rose and her mother laughed aloud as they swung on the ropes its going see its starting to topple the sycamore could take no more with a groan of creaking and splitting wood it crashed slowly over krrrraaaaakkkkk the end of the rowan lever had dipped so low that it almost touched the ground loud cheers rang through the valley martin and urran voh pounded each others backs we did it hooray the moles were quite carried away and went into a wild stamping dance rose and her mother kicked up their paws happily at its center soon everybeast was dancing singing and cheering the great sycamore stood nearly as high as council lodge at its upturned base a forest of roots soil and rocks by evening a sprawling picnic had broken out along the fallen treetrunk and strawberry cordial and waterfallcooled gourds of cider flowed freely singing lustily in chorus the moles brought out ten of their deeper n ever turnip n tater

halffilled bowls and sipping their drinks contented after the long hard days work it was then that boldred dropped out of the sky like a thunderbolt with her news three pairs of eyes watched felldoh set off silently into the rosy dawn that tinged the clifftops brome nodded to his two otter companions there he goes laden with enough javelins to stock an army come on lets follow him felldohs mood was light and carefree now that he had set out to complete his lone mission with a bundle of javelins beneath each arm and his thrower strapped across his back he hummed a cheerful little tune what need of armies and hordes he could rid the world of badrang by himself once the tyrant was dead marshank would be a snake without a head whitecrested rollers boomed in over the shore the sun seemed to smile out of a cloudless sky of powder blue and a cooling breeze drove the thin layer of sunwarmed sand aimlessly around the foot of the cliffs for the first time in many seasons felldohs heart felt lightcautiously the gates of marshank creaked open and a phalanx of hordebeasts armed to the fangs filed outside crosstooth looked all around to reassure himself there was no immediate danger of attack badrang appeared on the walltop with scores of arch ers and slingers he shielded his eyes against the suns glare as he issued orders search every rock hollow dune and outcrop from here to the sea he stood enjoying the mornings warmth the light wind blowing his cloak playfully about as he watched his soldiers scouring the beach crosstooth was near the tideline he waved his spear from side to side calling aloud all clear down here lord no sign of anybeast badrang cupped paws about his mouth shouting a reply get those beasts dug in where they cant be seen crosstooth ran back and forth placing the soldiers in position some were behind rocks others lay flat on the seaward side of low dunes the rest dug shallow trenches above the tideline tramun clogg rested one clogged paw on his spade cackling as he called up to the tyrant haharrharr you got those beauties diggin their own graves thatll save me some work matey nipwort and frogbit the two rat guards who had been left in charge of the corsair prodded him with their spears theyre diggin slit trenches to keep themselves alive in case of attack you get on with buryin the dead clogg dug with ferocious energy muttering to himself haharr waitll ole tramuns diggin yer grave badrang ill dig it deep an andsome aye an put a great rock atop of it sos you wont be aclimbin out again ho thatll be a glorious day in the life of capn tramun josiah cuttlefish clogg to give me my full title ye wont be able to badmouth me when im throwin spadefuls o good earth in yer ugly gob badrang boggs stood atop the battlements peering southward he leaped down and ran to make his report onebeast comin along the cliffs in this direction lord badrang was slightly taken aback only one aye just a loner still a fair way off but i spotted im the tyrant pulled the closest two archers to him rotnose wetpaw get down there as quick as you can tell crosstooth to hide with the others you two do the same when i shout the word marshank aloud break cover and capture this one hurry now tell everybeast to be totally silent if he sniffs a trap hell be off once the two messengers had departed badrang turned to his archers down all of you be quiet and keep your heads low remember the word is marshank you wulpp go and shut the front gates as felldoh trotted along from the cliffs to the shore he hardly noticed the unusual silence that hung over the fortress had he been more vigilant he might have noticed the telltale signs that the foe were lying in concealment on the beach but the squirrels vengeful eyes were riveted on just one thing badrang standing out bold and alone on the walltop over the gates felldohs paws gripped the javelins like vices and his teeth made a grinding noise as his jaw muscles bulged the breath hissing fiercely from both his nostrils now he broke into a run his paws pounding rock and dry sand as he sped along oblivious to all else but the figure of his most hated enemy at the edge of the cliffs brome threw himself flat with keyla and tullgrew either side of him is he mad look at him they watched the javelincarrying squirrel skid to a halt within earshot of badrang tullgrew bit her clenched paw hes going to be killed i can feel it in my bones surely they wouldnt let a lone escaped slave run up to the place like that in broad daylight keyla watched in horrified fascination unable to tear his eyes away from the scene youre right ill bet my rudder hes walked into some sort of trap maybe we can shout a warning brome was doubtful i think were too far away but lets give it a try shout his name one two three shout felldoooooooooh the three voices rang out as one tullgrew struck the clifftop with her clenched paw i dont think he heard us or even if he did he isnt paying any heed to us what in the name of thunder is he doing down there keyla shook his head i dont know but something awful is going to happen id take my oath on that i think one of us should go back to camp and bring help quickly ill go brome cast off his healing bag and began wriggling backwards keyla went into a low crouch dashing past brome you stay here mate im the best runner in these parts leaping upright he took off with dust spurting from his heels wordlessly felldoh dropped his bundles of javelins taking the throwing stick he fitted one along it bending his whole body back he sighted along the shaft and hurled it with tremendous force at badrang the tyrant was a fair distance away he saw the javelin launched and leaped to one side watching it as it sped harmlessly by leaning on the wall he called out scornfully try another one squirrel felldoh did this time with a short run and skip to give his javelin impetus badrang had dropped below the wall as the missile was thrown he heard the thin whistle of wind as it passed overhead smiling he stood up and shouted at the squirrel who was just about within earshot best you can do slave i am not a slave of yours felldohs voice roared back at him my name is felldoh and ive come here to kill you badrang another javelin came hurtling through the air this time badrang jumped back to his former position shrug ging expressively as the pointed wood sailed off towards the back wall of the fortress tut tut missed again youll run out of those things soon quivering with rage felldoh held up a javelin in both paws he broke it as if it were a straw i could break you like that if you werent such a mudsucking coward come down and fight me paw to paw beast to beast badrang swept his paws wide no doubt you have laid a trap for me those cliffs will be swarming with your friends ready to leap up and come running to the attack at your signal the same group you had with you last night treacherously slaying my creatures in the darkness do you take me for a fool felldoh moved closer to the fortress as badrang hoped he would throwing caution to the winds as his temper got the better of him the squirrel curled his lip contemptuously you are both a fool and a coward last night there was only me out here i am as you see me now without any army or horde and without a fortress wall to hide behind like you have so come out and fight poltroon craven cur dithering idiot suddenly the positions were reversed badrang could hear his archers below the wall sniggering stung by felldohs insults the tyrant drew his sword nobeast uses words like that to me i am lord badrang get ready to die squirrel i am coming down even in his rage the tyrant was still playing the odds armed with a sword he was sure he could defeat the squirrel who had only some short wooden stakes to defend himself as a last resort he could always call in his soldiers they had his adversary surrounded as badrang pushed past the grinning archers he swore silently to himself that he would slay the bold squirrel wiping away any doubts in the minds of his horde that he badrang was a leader to be feared and respected brome gasped in amazement as the fortress gates swung open and badrang walked out alone to face felldoh tullgrew shook her head i dont believe it whatever felldohs been saying must have stung badrang into action look theyre going to fight brome stared at the lone figure and all his hostility to felldoh evaporated he remembered the squirrels words that he would die if it was necessary to bring down badrang and marshank the young mouse found himself wishing that he possessed the bravery to be a warrior and help his friend by standing alongside him badrang leaped at felldoh cleaving only empty air with his sword as his adversary skipped back nimbly gripping the sword tight in both paws the stoat rushed in swinging wildly hoping to overwhelm his foe with the ferocity of the attack felldoh was like a stinging hornet he weaved in under the flailing blade jabbing at the tyrants face with his javelin as he flashed by badrang turned drawing in his breath sharply as he felt blood trickle from a small wound on his jaw balanced lightly on his footpaws felldoh grinned insolently threw himself into a swift roll and whacked his adversary hard on the shin with the wooden shaft badrang yelped with pain spinning fast and chopping down with his sword he chopped only sand arching his back as the wicked javelin point raked a long scratch on it breathing heavily he held the sword point forward and low shuffling slowly towards the squirrel watching for a sudden move felldoh stood his ground eyeing the sword carefully as it rose fractionally guessing the exact moment badrang would choose to thrust the stoat lunged felldoh skipped sideways bringing the javelin down with numbing force on his opponents left paw tears sprang unbidden to the stoats eyes as he held on to the sword with his right paw the left stinging and throbbing as it hung limp at his side felldoh was still smiling adding insult to injury badrang feigned helplessness for a moment trying to move his deadened paw suddenly he dropped flat rolled over and swung out wildly felldoh was taken by surprise the blade cut deep into his footpaw badrang moved in for the kill swinging the sword in his good paw the butt of the javelin struck him hard in the stomach knocking his breath out in a sharp gasp he doubled over fighting for air thwack the wooden haft struck the sword into the air it curved in a shining arc landing point down in the sand as badrangs right paw fell numbly to his side holding the javelin in both paws like a quarterstave felldoh knocked his enemy flat on the shore ignoring his injured footpaw the squirrel raised the javelin he brought it down with punishing force tullgrew clapped a paw across her eyes has he killed him i cant look is badrang slain brome shook his head in astonishment no felldoh is beating him with the javelin as if it were a rod tullgrew uncovered her eyes smiling with grim satisfaction aye just as he used to have slaves beaten lay it on felldoh badrang tried to curl up into a ball yelping as he rolled about on the round the javelin rose and fell across his back each stroke punctuated by felldohs harsh shouts how does it feel to be beaten like a slave o mighty one feel this and this you had me beaten when i was little more than an infant my father was beaten with the rod because he was old and slow you never made me cry out why are you wailing cant you take your own medicine tullgrew covered her eyes again but brome watched in horrified fascination hes going to beat badrang to death i can hear him yelling from here but the tyrant was not crying out needlessly marshank marshank marshank boldred perched on the fallen sycamore as she related all she had seen the first place i stopped at was a camp on the southeast cliffs there were many creatures there a hare and a badger seemed to be in charge ballaw and rowanoak i have not heard of these creatures martin interrupted boldred held up a talon let me continue it will soon become clear i spoke to them of brome and they assured me that he was alive and well when i told them of you there were many there who knew the name of martin one an old squirrel named barkjon sends you a message martin leaped up unable to constrain himself barkjon old barkjon hes felldohs father what did he tell you boldred he told me that his son has gone alone to face badrang every ablebodied creature in the camp was armed and they are planning to go to felldohs rescue that is if he still lives either way they will attack the fortress called marshank where the evil one rules with his horde of vermin martins eyes shone with the desire to be in the midst of battle the creatures in this camp on the cliffs are they a great army alas no boldred shook her head i have seen the comings and goings at marshank before badrangs horde is far too vast to be opposed the creatures at the camp are brave but pitifully few compared to the horde i must go now martin jumped down from the sycamore trunk boldred nodded the old squirrel barkjon is a shrewd beast he said that you would act thus and here is his message to you tell martin if he is coming to travel with all speed and bring plenty of help aryah looked at boldred anxiously did you see my son brome did you speak to him boldred spread her wings wide there was no time i had many things to do the hare ballaw assured me that brome was lively as a grasshopper and fit as a flea the badger rowanoak confirmed this she seemed like a wise and sensible creature badgers usually are aryah climbed down from the sycamore and took martins paw bring my son back to me please martin i beg you rose leaped down to join martin and her mother we will mama dont worry rose how can you go urran voh gazed sternly at his daughter is it not enough that we have brome caught up in a war far from home rose faced her father resolutely i must go martin and i are the only ones who would stand a chance of bringing brome back to noonvale hurr youm not leavin usns yurr mizzy pallum and grumm joined paws with martin and rose another little paw sneaked in to clasp theirs hurr say ee wurd an bungos with youm grumm ruffled the dark velvety head of the infant gurr youm gotter stay yurr an chop upee gurt tree oi wants f see et chopped oop small when usns coom back martin looked at urran voh who nodded then he raised his voice so that all could hear is anybeast with us you heard boldred we need plenty of help the otter quartette several moles and a few hedgehogs stood forward martin counted sixteen in all including his three friends i am sorry martin urran voh said his tone more kindly but we are not warriors my creatures do not have any knowledge of battle many have families to care for those who have volunteered to go with you are few but brave none of them have ever used a weapon yet they are prepared to go and help you with their very lives martin bowed to his small army i thank you with all my heart boldred tuttutted slightly and shook her head ive always said that the trouble with young creatures is they never listen properly especially hotheaded warriors did you not hear me tell aryah that i never stopped to search for brome because i had things to do things what things martin looked nonplussed at the owl things that only a wise owl would think of like getting an army together for you but lets deal with first things first weve got to find the shortest route to marshank and get you there as quickly as possible now i dont wish to preen myself on this matter but i am the foremost pathfinder mapmaker and researcher of this whole country from beyond here to the eastern sea find me a clear space somebeast the moles patted a bare patch of soil flat as rose went off with aryah and urran voh to gather provisions for the journey boldred crooked a claw at martin come here warrior and pay attention martin sat and watched fascinated as the owls skilful talons marked out the route this is the broadstream here you came the long way round to noonvale probably because you were washed up down the far south coast marshank is further north facing the eastern sea there is a much simpler way back to the coast i know this and so does starwort at this moment he will probably have just arrived at a wide tributary two hours journey from here to the north of noonvale so the sooner you get going the quicker youll be able to join him and get under way martin stood upright what happens then boldred the owl blinked impatiently leave that to me im coming too rose and her parents had just finished putting together some food and drink in packs when martin strode into the cottage rose took the small shrew sword from its peg behind the door and held it out to martin you gave this up freely now i give it back to you the warrior thrust the sword into his belt im ready fur and freedoooooooommm the cart rattled and bumped leaping off the ground as it struck humps and clumps on the clifftop it roared forward with ballaw and keyla holding to its jolting bed as they waved the streaming banner aloft rowanoak pounded along sinew and muscle bunching and stretching she towed the careering cart the fur and freedom fighters pushed as they pelted madly alongside brome could not stop himself at the sight of felldoh going down fighting amid a welter of horde vermin he dashed forward down the cliffside sobbing and calling his friends name aloud felldoh oh felldoh im coming but felldoh did not hear his young companion he lay with a calm smile on his face surrounded by a score of slain hordebeasts who had died trying to defeat him badrang rushed back to the fort away from the carnage and the broken javelins the memory burned into his beaten skull of the roaring laughing squirrel who had died with a shattered piece of timber in each paw still taking ferrets rats and weasels with him as he went as marshanks gates slammed shut the cart sped by brome scattering the last few venturesome horde members it ground to a halt next to felldohs body rowanoak leaped from the shafts as the first wave of arrows flew from the walltops dig in turn the cart on its side get to cover quick ballaw assembled his throwers behind the cart take your range chaps and drop those javelins in just over the walltop you others pick up any weapons you find lyin about thats the ticket slingers get those stones from the cart look lively now lads brome staggered up tears streaming from him as he undid his healing bag and pulled out herbs and bandages barkjon sat with his sons head cradled in his lap dryeyed he wont be needing those young one save them for the living my son has gone to the silent forest where hell always be free brome sat with barkjon the old squirrel wiped away the young mouses tears it is good to grieve for a friend who has gone he looks so happy and peaceful brome shook his head placing a paw about barkjons shoulders he said ive never seen anything like it he was laughing aloud it took a score and a half to get him down and he still slew most of them it was as if he knew his fate barkjon nodded never afraid always a true warrior that was felldohs way the side of the cart was thick with quivering arrows ballaw barked out a sharp command up an at em javelins the line of throwers leapt up flung their weapons off and dropped back down immediately ballaw called to the slingers quick as y like one volley of stones go the slingers stood threw and dropped back down howls and screams greeted the wave of javelins that dropped in on the archers at the walltop they stood up to retaliate and met the volley of slingstones zinging up hard on the heels of the javelins crosstooth grabbed wetpaw and fleabane take fifty fighters apiece over the back wall an spread out left an right advance along the shore an dig in well have em cut off at both sides with the fort in front of em an the sea behind theyll have to surrender or die buckler saw the hordebeasts pouring out either side of marshank he found rowanoak lukkit usns all ave to proteck ee flanks kastern gauchee trefoil and celandine helped to shore up two long hillocks of sand either side of the cart the slingers were split up and detailed to both sides while the javelin throwers concentrated on the front facing the fortress inside the fortress badrang lay on the longhouse table while boggs and growch dressed his wounds the tyrant had been beaten black and blue before his soldiers got to the rescue and his head face shoulders and back were a welter of ugly lumps and long bruises he arched his back painfully as boggs treated the long javelin scratch haharr matey i thought youd run into an army but they tells me twere ony one ardnosed squirrel scorch me sails but e did a right good job on yer haharrharrharr badrang glared at clogg through puffy eyes get out of

an drink me fill seein as all the rest are too busy warrin an fightin fer glory ballaw gave a sharp gasp he plucked out the arrow sticking from his paw and snapped it ruined me best eatin and gesturin paw rotters brome sat down behind the cart cleaning the wound he applied a comfrey poultice and bound the paw with a clean linen strip good as new eh wot ballaw held it up admiring the dressing i say brome old lad youre gettin to be a bit of a dab paw at this healin lark wordlessly the young mouse crawled off to the next casualty noon brought a lull in the fighting the sun beat mercilessly down on the beach and there was not even a welcome breeze behind rowanoaks back the sea shimmered showing hardly a wave the badger dusted sand from her paws as she gratefully accepted food from keyla its only a mouthful of water and a scone we dont know how long well be stuck here trefoil nibbled at her scone stuck is the right word keyla were boxed off on three sides with the sea behind us if we fancy drowning ourselves celandine sipped daintily at a scallop shell of water drown ourselves ugh how horrible itd ruin my tail kastern was making a bow with some springy wood and a cord well its either that or carry on fighting a horde about thirty times greater than us i should think thatd ruin your tail in the long run miss fussbudget buckler came to sit by kastern hurr wot be youm amaken a bow furr well there are so many arrows lying about and sticking out of everywhere it seems a shame to waste them rowanoak shook her head in admiration what an efficient trouper hey groot see if you can make a few bows and help kastern to use all these arrows messing the place up yarrow looked at rowanoak strangely you rambling rosehip players you seem to make a joke of everything dont you realize were in the middle of a battle fighting for our lives ballaw patted his head with a bandaged paw what dyou want us to do then laddie buck break down an weep make the best of the situation m boy smile the cart shook under a rattle of arrows several piercing the wood by half a shaftlength ah well back to work wot wot yarrow yawned fitting a stone to his sling ballaw launched a javelin and ducked low cheeky blighter catches on fast though badrang was up and about looking much the worse for wear but still badtempered and active crosstooth tell the horde to hold back their weapons a bit i want to parley with that lot on the shore archers and slingers stopped badrangs jaws were aching from felldohs blows so he got a rat called nipwort who possessed a high squeaky voice to call out his message nipwort funnelled both paws around his mouth and shouted parley cease fire we want a parley then parley away pipsqueak what do you want rowanoaks readily identifiable roar came back at him my master lord badrang can keep you pinned down there and slay you at his leisure if you surrender you will not be killed this time it was ballaw who answered tell me my good chap what happens to us after we surrender that will be for lord badrang to decide ballaws head popped up over the cart blinkin nerve o the rascal listen rustyhinge you tell old badtrousers that the commanderinchief of the fur and freedom fighters said that he can go an boil his scurvy head wot the reply was accompanied by a healthy hail of slingstones one of which knocked nipwort senseless badrang crouched beneath the parapet massaging the numbness from his paws get a fire going use flaming arrows on that cart well burn them out into the open guided by boldred martin and his party made it in good time to the broadstream inlet they were greeted by starworts cheery cry as they came in sight of the water ahoy mates come on aboard the big otter boat waterlily was packed with toughlooking otters and in tow she had a flatbottomed barge also filled to the gunwales with more otters they made room for martin and his contingent starwort grinned and held up a thonged sling mainly uses these for sport an fishin but weve all got one miss rose good to see yer pretty face again still keepin this warrior of yours in check i ope pallum an grumm well shake me rudder yer lookin plump an fittern ever a flotilla of shrew canoes came racing round the bend and hit the bank with a loud damp thud starwort winked at boldred ho look out ere comes trouble on the tide boldred blinked at the teeming arguing masses of shrews yelling and waving their swords angrily what are they doing here starwort flexed his powerful paws i thought we might need extra elp so i told em they werent allowed to follow us an i forbid them to take part in any fight you know the shrews mate never do as theyre told the otter waved at his deck crew cast off forard cast off aft cast off midships away we go you shrews stop ere you aint comin see rose and pallum chuckled at starworts ruse as a veritable armada of craft pulled out into the stream with waterlily in the vanguard martin stood in the bows of the otter boat as if willing it to travel faster worry etched itself across his brow boldred perched on the forard rail rest martin nothing you can do will make the river flow swifter grimjawed the young mouse pawed his sword hilt as he paced back and forth heedless of the glorious sunset on the water ill never forgive myself if were too late travelling to noonvale was a mistake i should have stayed on the coast and sought brome out felldoh too things might have been different boldred folded her wings shifting from claw to claw aye you could have all been slain then what help would you be this way you are returning to marshank with an army at your back many more are coming to aid your cause i have made sure of that martin watched the stream slip by gurgling and eddying forgive me friend i must seem very ungrateful after all you have done to help it is natural to worry when friends are in danger martin dont think about what you could have done concentrate on what you plan to do it is more useful boldred spread her wings preparing for flight i must leave you for a while now there are more things that i have to do ill see you at marshank warrior mouse good seasons and fair winds go with us both martin watched his feathered friend winging off downstream into the evening treetops silhouetted against a sky of lilac and gold move yer stern a touch matey and let me get at the drum starworts wife marigold opened a locker and rolled out a big flat drum she placed it on a coil of rope and began whacking it slowly with her rudderlike tail the deep boom cut through the twilight stillness as rose came to join martin in the bows they both looked on perplexed until marigold explained just drummin up a little more elp my starwort always says that willin paws are welcome ones a rolling drum answered marigolds summons rose pointed upstream look waiting to join them was a sprawling flat raft with a rickety shed built at its centre lines of otters and burly hedgehogs stood by their long poles waiting to join the fleet starwort sprang to the bowsprit waving at the newcomers yoho gulba me ole mucker come to join in the fun the biggest of the hedgehogs was a female colored tassels hung from her headspikes and she brandished a formidable warclub studded with chunks of crystal yoho starwort yore gittin fat an sleek these days wots marigold bin feedin ye on starwort grinned mischievously as he ducked a swipe from his wife hard words an hotroot when shes not bullyin the babies gulbas husband trung was small and fat he emerged from the shack eating a watershrimp pastie and twirling a thong with two stones clacking on its split end who are we fightin an when do we get at em marigold martin came alert as he listened to the information the vermin in the big place by eastern sea with a followin breeze an no stream blockages we should get there by noon on the morrow are you game the raft pushed off as they passed bumping several shrew longboats and following the waterlilys wakeswirl gulba leaned on her warclub and scowled were with you tis only a matter o time afore that scummy stoat takes over the whole coast an starts foragin inland for slaves i say we put a stop to him smartlike throughout the night martins piecemeal slumbers were broken as the drums sounded and more woodland tribes joined the swelling ranks rose slept through it all waking at dawn light she was amazed and delighted to see the stream packed with boats and craft of all shapes each one low in the water with creatures ready to fight at their side along the banks she could see others squirrels and mice keeping pace with the vessels at a swift lope starwort dashed past her and leaped up on the rail steadying himself on a rope he put a paw to his brow scanning the mistwreathed waters ahead steady on backwater buckoes the outlets in sight martin left off opening a food pack whats the outlet suddenly the waterlily picked up speed as if she were being sucked along on the current and a rushing noise became audible starwort winked at martin and rose best old tight the outlets where we join the main broadstream again nothin t worry about its only rapids the whole craft gave a lurch and it began to buck and leap timbers groaned crazily as marigold shouted forward starwort get yer hide aft an do somethin useful i cant manage this tiller singlepawed there was no time for more talk rose hung grimly on to martin winding a rigging rope about his paws the young mouse took a deep breath as the otter boat tilted into the rapids a huge rainbow appeared through the mist of boiling spray as water engulfed everybeast aboard and the craft stood almost on its end as it flew helterskelter down the sickening drop ragged rocks rushed by grumm opened his mouth to yell but it was filled with water he clung to pallum ignoring his friends spikes the world seemed to turn upside down for several perilous moments the drum rattatting as rapid water beat at it starwort and marigold laughed with wild exuberance as they fought the swivelling tiller together they roared above the melee down weeeeeee goooooooo with a loud flat splash the waterlily landed in the broadstream starwort was immediately up on the stern bawling orders ship out ship out mates pull er clear make fast that raft an get er in midstream the otter crew worked furiously as other craft dropped in behind them two shrew longboats collided in midair and overturned gulba and her husband trung the two hedgehogs who steered the ramshackle craft together with their otter friends managed to make a perfect flat landing in an immense cascade of water the hut at the center of the big raft half disintegrated under the impact but gulba paid it no heed she was yelling sternly at the shrews hoi shrewheads dont ye know the meanin of the order to backwater yore mad as scorched frogs you lot as if to prove her point two shrew boats flew overhead packed with shouting and arguing creatures they sailed right over the raft gulba ducked as they flew by in midair splash crash both boats hit the water miraculously staying upright a shrew stood up waving his sword at the hedgehog tend to yer own raft spikedog we know what were doin as boats were righted and soaking creatures hauled from the water the fleet gradually got itself back on to an even keel rose shook starwort and his wife by their paws gratefully oh you were so skillful both of you the way you took command and knew just what to do steering this great boat right the way down those dangerous rapids only two creatures such as yourselves would know how to navigate that terrible drop in safety marigold bobbed a comical curtsy well thankee now pretty one that was the first time weve ever been down those rapids bump grumm fainted swifts darted and wheeled over the water in brilliant morning sunlight as it burned the mists away martin finished breakfasting and went to stand up in the bows next to starwort the sturdy otter leaned confidentially close listen matey while i tells yer three words youve wanted to ear next stop marshank a tremor ran through the warriors body he clasped the sword handle tight his eyes shining like flints in firelight im coming badrang the cart was a charred smoking thing but it still stood all night the fighting had been furious with no letup fur and freedom fighters had battled against flaming shafts with their bare paws and sand four lay dead and three wounded smokegrimed and blearyeyed they had plucked burning arrows from the wood strung them on their bows and returned them to stick blazing in the gates of marshank the javelin supply was depleted one shaft being retained for each creature in the event that pawtopaw combat would be their final stand there were still plenty of rocks to sling keyla and tullgrew taking charge of the slingers while ballaw managed a frugal breakfast the hare sat wearily against one of the sandbanks that had been shorn up either side of the cart rowanoak slumped beside him both were singed and smokegrimed rowanoak drank half her water passing the rest on to brome who distributed it among the wounded the badger wiped a sandy paw across her scorched muzzle well ballaw de quincewold whats to report the irrepressible hare wiped dust from his halfscone ration and looked up at the sky report er nothin much really except that it looks like being another nice sunny day wot a flaming arrow extinguished itself in the sand close by rowanoak she tossed it on to a pile of other shafts waiting to be shot a nice day indeed dyou think well be around to see the sunset without waiting for an answer she continued i wonder if that owl boldred wasnt it i wonder if she ever managed to get through to this martin the warrior creature ballaw picked dried blood from a wound on his narrow chest doesnt look like it does it no old rowan me badger oak i think the stage is all ours and itll be our duty to give the best performance we can before the curtain falls for the last time groot plucked a pawful of arrows from the sand tossing them behind the smouldering cart he took his bow from buckler together they notched up their shafts nodding to each other watch the cart its roasting hot right fire swiftly they stood and released the taut bowstrings throwing themselves flat immediately a hail of arrows hit the cart and the surrounding sand in reply groot scratched a mark in the sand next to a line of others got one big weasel type wearin a red jerkin buckler shook his head in disappointment oi been arfter that vurmint all noight moiself hurr they notched up another two arrows at least the little onesll be safe with geum and purslane groot sniffed maybe theyll take off south and find some place where they can live in peace pity i wouldve liked to see my little fuffle grow up and take care of his mother when shes an old un buckler wrinkled his homely face into a smile ho urr hem be a right liddle roguer that babe o thoin doant youm give oop ope groot wem baint finished yet burr no badrang sat in the courtyard shaded by the wall it was the only place where missiles could not fall he took a leisurely breakfast of smoked herrings and dandelion water boggs came down from the walltop and saluted with his bow that carts still there lord though it cant be much more than splinters an ash by now a good breezed blow it over the tyrant delicately plucked a fish scale from his upper lip keep those archers firing until i tell you to stop have we lost many through the night twelve maybe thirteen sire there was quite a few wounded tryin to put the fire out on the gates badrang nodded thoughtfully and beckoned to a passing ferret you there stumptooth get the rest of the horde on their paws issue the long pikes and spears have them stand by boggs brightened up a little are you goin to start the charge lord badrang poured a beaker of dandelion water and passed it to boggs not yet drink that its cool isnt it also weve got plenty of food solid walls around us and plenty of shade those wretches out there have only sun sand a few drops of water and hardly any food by now theyve not been able to sleep all night while weve had archers relieving each other to take a rest i think ill leave it a bit yet keep them in suspense make them suffer who knows we might yet save a good number of slaves go and ask them to surrender again tramun clogg was digging graves in the soft ground near the corner of the wall he leaned on his spade and eyed badrang you never could go fer the clean kill could yer matey ho no you likes pullin the wings off butterflies an watchin them crawl round elpless as i recall though maybe yore worried that if yer did charge now theyd put up a good fight badrang held the dandelion water out to clogg as the corsair reached for it he upended the jug pouring it out on the ground youre right of course clogg thats why i like to keep you as a slave it reminds me that once you tried to be my equal or even my better and now you have to take orders from the lowliest of my creatures you are lower than a worm tramun clogg the corsair dabbed his paw in the wet sand and sucked it haharr i never was igh an mighty like you badrang ill just go back to buryin yer dead an wait fer you to turn up as a customer with his head wound in a bandage nipwort shrilled the message across to the creatures barricaded behind the sandbanks on either side of the burnedout cart my lord badrang is still merciful he gives you a second chance to surrender and keep your lives what is your answer tell old badthingy it is beneath our dignity to surrender to scum ballaws voice came back insolently clear this time accompanied by many others stinky slimy scum gutless wetnosed crooktailed scum yurr gurt fatbottomed vurmint scummer nipworts highpitched squeak cut across the insults is that the answer i must take to my lord badrang a goodsized wellplaced slingstone from rowanoak knocked the rat backwards from the walltop to the courtyard tell him he can chew on that for free badrang had heard the exchange he rolled the stunned form of nipwort over with a kick boggs redouble the archers on the walltop and continue without halting ill make those fools think its raining arrows ballaw helped to shore up the banks and rowanoak piled sand against the flimsy burnt cart brome kept his head down as he bandaged keylas injured tail under a pelting hail of arrows the young otter gritted his teeth forcing a tight smile as he gasped through a wave of pain dyou think its somethin weve said thats offended him brome ducked an arrow and continued with keylas dressing brave words slingstones and arrows is all weve got left thats the last of my herbs and bandages at midday the arrows ceased there followed a lull ballaw went around doling out the last of the food and water groot nodded to the trenched ranks on the southside any chance we could charge them and break through we could make it to the cliffs if we could rowanoak patted his head lightly no chance at all see theyre all still standing ready on the walltop wed be cut down before we got halfway groot shrugged just a thought ballaw took rowanoak to one side out of the hearing of the others this silence i dont like it one bit rowanoak watched the still fortress and nodded theyre definitely planning something a charge dyou think ballaw picked up a javelin right thats exactly my thoughts old thing issue the javelins each creature took a javelin in silence knowing what it meant ballaw dusted himself down and stood to attention listen up now chaps im not given to makin jolly great speeches an all that oh you dreadful old scenestealer celandine tittered youve never made a short one in your life the hare glared at her as rowanoak took over from him all that can be said has been said im sure you know what i mean but let me add this for myself it has been a pleasure to know you all and to serve with you in this great battle may the seasons remember us kindly and what we tried to do here there was an embarrassed silence then brome held out his paw give me a javelin too i will try to be a warrior like felldoh a wild yell arose from the fortress as marshanks gates swung open and the horde poured forth fully armed racing across the sands towards the beleaguered little group standing behind the ruined cart martin drew his sword and leaped into the shallows splashing ashore he watched the other boats empty out as he called to starwort which way to marshank the draught from boldreds wings nearly knocked martin over as the owl landed at his side over that hill follow me rose saw martin stop at the hilltop she ran to catch up with him grumm and pallum following close behind her martin wait for us when they reached him the young mouse stood staring openmouthed at the scene below boldred ambled up smiling now you have a horde too queen amballa stood at the head of her mighty army of pigmy shrews and behind them the warden of marshwood hill could be seen stalking among the crowds of gawtrybe squirrels as they waved their axes eagerly wanting to play a new game otters hedgehogs mice squirrels moles and vast numbers of shrews stood surrounding the hill from his vantage point on the hilltop martin looked to his left there in the distance he could see the northside wall of marshank rose stared at martin it was as if she were looking at a strange creature he was still as a rock the blood rising behind his eyes as his paw whitened with the furious grip he had on his sword handle the blade rose above his head and fell in a straight line pointing at badrangs hated fortress the horde went silent staring up at the warrior mouse waiting on the word which rolled from his lips like steel striking stone chaaaarge they went in a rush like a giant tidal wave covering the land but none was more fleet of paw than the mouse martin he was out in front teeth bared sword still pointing as he tore through dune and foothill rose was swept along in the midst of the howling horde with pallum and grumm now and then through the forest of spears lances and swords she could see him a lone figure ahead of the rest her heart went out to him as she remembered her first sight of him bound between two posts left to die on marshanks walls and recalled the words he had shouted into the stormy night now she heard those words as in a dream i am a warrior martin son of luke i will live i will not give in and die up here do you hear me badrang i will live to take back my fathers sword and slay you one day badraaaaaang javelins stuck in the sand at their sides the archers knelt and drew back their bowstrings full stretch ballaw strode the line holding up his paw bowstrings trembled with the tension as the screaming horde dashed across the shore in a mass bound straight at them wait for it chaps steady on waitll you see the scum on their snouts now the hail of arrows struck hordebeasts fell and were trampled underpaw by those behind but the horde kept coming load and throw rowanoak cried to her line of slingers as the archers dropped back the stones hit true but not well enough to halt the relentless charge spears from the horde ranks cut down several of the fur and freedom fighters they backed up retreating towards the sea as the horde pressed forward badrang stood on the walltop unable to contain a thin smile of triumph as he watched the little army being battered remorselessly back to the eastern sea he turned to boggs wait and see well get a few slaves out of this yet those that arent drowned boggs looked up at the sky strange i thought i could hear thunder badrang also looked up fool how could you hear thunder when theres not a cloud in the sky boggs cupped paws around both his ears im sure its thunder sire comin from over there speechless with terror he pointed at the thundering horde breasting a low hill to the north heading directly for them even though he was practically numb with shock badrang found himself automatically giving out orders call the horde back nipwort boggs get the archers on to the north wall ill hold the gates open until theyre back in yarrow tripped and fell in the shallows the front runners were in the water grappling with fur and freedom fighters when crosstooth began shouting retreat retreat back to marshank on the double theres a horde headed to attack the fort hurry ballaw sat down hard in the shallows and blew water from his nose hold up where are they bally well goin great seasons reliefs arrived hurrah its a horde a flood a mob a bloomin tidal wave of warbeasts attackin the fort ballaws fighters let out a loud cheer of delight leaping about in the shallows like mad creatures the horde were streaming back to the fortress leaving a bare dozen fighting in the sea swift javelin thrusts and throws found their way around pikes and spears laying the hordebeasts low brome found himself standing javelin poised over a searat who lay wounded in the surf he was trying to force himself to stab and slay the foebeast when the rat whined out pleadingly its me matey wulpp dont kill me brome gasped it was wulpp the searat whose injured paw he had treated when disguised as a corsair he had gained entry to marshank brome thrust the javelin into the sea close to wulpps neck leaning down he muttered to the terrified rat lie still when weve gone take off south down the beach i never want to see you again good luck turning brome picked up a spear and followed the triumphantly shouting fighters who were running towards marshank now the battle was joined horde fought horde that day by the eastern sea martins army flooded around marshank surrounding its walls on all four sides slingstones javelins arrows and spears were loosed up at the walltops as roaring warcries rent the air fur and freeeedooooom broadstream for eveeeeer amballa amballa kill kill kill maaaartiiiiin badrang was everywhere at once waving his sword as he shouted encouragement to his fighters massed thick on the high walls crosstooth more archers at the front see the gates are defended boggs tell those spears to stand ready on the northside slash any ropes and grapnels dont let them over frogbit get boulders and rocks to the back wall crush them bluehide take the south wall use long spears and pikes throw fire down on them badrang was an experienced battler he found his confidence and shrewdness returning as the horde looked to him as their leader grabbing a passing ferret he rapped out more orders stumptooth take thirty wounded four groups of five to supply the walls with arrows spears and slingstones get the other ten to carry the big fishnets to the walltops and drop them over on any large groups thatll slow em up come on you fighters and hordebeasts this is our chance to rule the whole country slaves land plunder well have it all ignoring his sore and bandaged paws the tyrant snatched a spear from a searat hurled it coolly and slew a shrew who was trying to climb the gates see its easy they die like other creatures well make the sands run red before nightfall arrows zipped down from the walltops in dark clouds like angry wasps tearing into the packed ranks that charged marshank slingstones whirred like flights of small birds clanging on armour and blade alike in their upward flight rose found boldred and the warden on a hillock out of weapon range the two great birds stood waiting their chance boldred greeted the mousemaid wed be shot out of the air in the middle of that lot when it gets dark and the pace slackens my friend and i will be able to fly in rose looked out over the melee of battle wheres martin i lost sight of him in the charge the grey heron pointed his beak towards the front gates he is over there with otters and hedgehogs they have a piece of timber to barter the gates but it is not big enough ballaw came panting up with the remnants of his gallant force weary and battlescarred the brave hare slumped down in the sand phew what a day chaps rowanoak and mself pulled our little army out for a breather wot let those other creatures have a crack at the foe theyre a lot fresher than my gang rowanoak sat with the owl and the heron shaking her head you arrived just in time to save us from being slaughtered on the tideline thank you but your charge has been too furious i am not a warrior or a commander but i can see that they will never breach those walls by throwing themselves at them the owl blinked as she watched the assault on the fortress you are right rowanoak martin seems to be the only one who has any kind of plan but he is unaware of others when his warrior blood is roused we need a plan of attack badrang is not stupid he has the advantage of the walls and is using them well other creatures less shrewd might have been panicked by our charge not him though he is a cool one in a pinch ballaw brightened up thats it a plan capital what dyou suggest marm martin let go of the shattered remnants of the inadequate chunk of driftwood he and his allies had been using as a battering ram drawing his sword he attacked the gates in a wild rage starwort and gulba ducked into the shelter of the gates as missiles rained down from above they tried to restrain martin its no use mate the gates are too strong come away martin hacked and hammered at the stout timbers oblivious to everything about him rose pressed through the chaos sided by grumm and pallum they forced a way through to the gate martin halted at the sight of her deflecting a broken spear haft with his short sword rose get out of here its too dangerous she picked up the sharp pointed end of the spear boldly not without you martin come with us you are needed starwort gulba you too we need a proper battle plan too many creatures are being killed needlessly we wont get inside marshank by charging and milling about willynilly come it had turned noon when otter drums sounded over the fray the attackers broke off their charging and retreated back to the sands around the low dune crosstooth shook his spear in the air jubilantly yah theyve turned tail and run badrang knew better he had seen ballaws fighters contacting the leaders it was a calculated retreat however the tyrant said nothing of this imitating crosstooth he waved his sword see i told you it was easy look at them running like frightened babies now that theyve had a taste of real fighting from warriors like us eh lads gesturing and prancing on the walltops the horde took up his cry haha had enough have you cowards come back and fight me i only slew ten ten i slew two score and id have got more of em if they hadnt scurried off in a fright tramun clogg left off his grave digging and clambered to the walltop he sized the situation up immediately burn me clogs buckoes yore a bunch of strawheads iffen you think those fighters are runnin away id save me breath fer more action iffen i was you lot whock badrang dealt clogg a ferocious blow across his head with a long pike he had snatched from gruzzle the corsair fell senseless in a heap badrang kicked him from the walltop and cloggs unconscious form fell with a thump on to a heap of sand he had excavated the tyrant stoat leaned on the pike dismissing his former partner dont listen to that old fool his brains are all in his clogs crosstooth see that everybeast has extra rations stay awake lads maybe theyll get brave enough to give it another try i certainly hope so eh this announcement was greeted with raucous cheers while the wounded were treated by rose and brome food was divided up among the groups of creatures seated around the low hillock martin sat with the council of chieftains as they laid war plans rowanoak and boldred were rocks of good sense rejecting the wild schemes of hotheaded beasts considering the suggestions of cooler and wiser creatures queen amballa had several of her pigmy shrews drag a large square fishing net to the hill it was made of strong woven kelp see martinmouse wallbeast throwthis snarl us up plentygood a gawtrybe squirrel laughed scornfully hehee good game they dint catch squirrels gawtrybes too fast for nets heehee martin sat up alert the light of idea dawning in his eyes thats it we go in over the walls on two sides when night falls and use the nets one side say on the north while the squirrels take the south wall starworts wife marigold put down the pitcher she had been drinking from an whats badrangs crew goin to be doin while all this goes on cos they wont be sleepin or pickin their claws martin pointed across to where the old rambling rosehip troupes firecharred cart lay half buried in the sand will the wheels on that thing still turn ballaw shrugged what dyou think

the paw it wont have to go far friend only from here to those gates loaded with burning grass and wood just to create a diversion boldred blinked excitedly it could work hold back the attack until before dawn thats when theyll least expect it the warden and i will fly the net and drop it over the north wall wholl be going over there martin queen amballa with her warriors and the big hedgehogs trung thumped his loaded thong weapon gleefully into the sand grinning at his wife as she nursed her immense warclub yhear that me dearie well go over paw in paw the gawtrybe squirrels will help the

deep ole down down where its still an cold an ynever live to get old every fighter had been fed no fires glowed in the still summer night it was warm and heavy martin sat awake with rose as the camp lay in slumber the mousemaid stared up at the stars which twinkled with pale fires in the midnight heavens strange isnt it martin the same stars that shine on this terrible place with all its death and war those same stars are shining over noonvale where all is at peace and war has never been what are you thinking of warrior martin smiled nodding at the sight of grumm his small fat stomach rising and falling gently i wasnt thinking of anything rose i was just watching grumm flat out and snoozing with his ladle clutched in both paws the mousemaid relieved the sleeping mole of his ladle placing it close to his side where he would find it on waking hes the most friendly and loyal mole anybeast could wish to know grumm has always looked out for me ever since i was a tiny mousebabe in noonvale when we go back there youll make lots of friends among our moles youre a hero to them me a hero what for martin laughed softly for bringing down that great dead sycamore theyve been at it for seasons on and off without much success then you came along and in a single day it was uprooted and fallen the young mouse passed her a cloak trung had given him you look tired rose better get some rest go on im not sleepy ill sit here close by rose draped the cloak lightly about her and she was soon asleep martin sat up thinking of many things as he felt the night hours slip slowly by i ballaw was wakened by a shake from martin it was still dark though the night was on the wane come on its time the camp was stirring quietly into life grurrun had taken off with pallum and rose and a lot of others they travelled in a wide semicircle round to the back walls of marshank boldred and the warden stood ready the big kelp net clutched tight between them queen amballa and her pigmy shrews grouped with the big hedgehogs on one side while starwort and his otters mingled with the gawtrybe squirrels martin ballaw and rowanoak inspected the cart it was flimsy in the extreme and wobbly on its wheels piled high with grass driftwood and brush buckler patted it fondly hurr shell do a gurt last run oill stake moi name on et amballa raised her paw to gulba and their joint forces moved off starwort gave the squirrels a stern nod to set them on their way now there were only fifty archers under martins command left in camp at his signal buckler set flint to tinder and rowanoak braced herself in the fireblackened shafts nearly curtain time chaps ballaw whispered here we go gruzzle was dreaming in his dream he was back on board his old ship someone had lit a fire on the deck and creatures were dancing around it shouting the searat felt drowsily happy he wanted to join in with them and dance around the flickering flames he moaned luxuriously and shifted slipping off his spearhandle gruzzle cracked his chin hard on the battlement thrusting him into wakefulness and horrifying reality the blazing cart plunged madly over the shore towards the fortress gates owch wha er ey ycant do that fire fire elp in seconds all was chaos and mad confusion most of the soldiers on the walltops were sound asleep they came awake tripping and bumping into each other the longhouse door flew open and badrang dashed out with his captains stumbling behind hearing the shouts and seeing the bright glow against the darkness the tyrant drew his sword and yelled mightily front wall the gates hurry he raced up the wall ladder with cloggs voice ringing over the alarm shouts haharr tis the ghost of me burned ship come back to take revenge on ye evil one you should ave listened t me badrang the heat of the roaring conflagration scorched rowanoaks cheeks as she pushed the blazing cart along martin and the others ran after her having been driven from the sides of the cart by the searing flames at a sharp shout from rowanoak they halted notching arrows to their bows the badger continued running with the cart putting her every last ounce of strength into the act she gave one mighty final push and fell flat crackling and hissing with tails of flame like a massive comet the cart careered madly into the gates of marshank whoom crumph it struck the gates blossoming like a monstrous fiery flower as the whole thing burst on the timbers sending showers and cascades of angry red sparks upwards in a mushroom of smoke ballaw already had the archers in three lines he was in his element ears quivering as he rapped out smart commands first rank shoot and drop a volley of shafts hissed through the night first rank reload second rank shoot and drop another hail of death followed in the wake of the first second rank reload third rank shoot and drop ready first rank unable to see because of the bright light burning in their eyes the walltop troops were hit hard amid it all badrang was knocking the bows from fighters paws slopheads never mind shooting arrows the doors are burning get sand get water put that blaze out he grabbed hold of rotnose did you hear me muckears put the fi the weasel slumped forward with a barbed arrow in his skull boldred and the warden released the net it fell accurately draping one end over three battlements while the rest of it trailed down the wall queen amballa gave it a quick tug to make sure it was secure allbeast gonow upupupupup gulba and trung were alongside her as the net suddenly became alive with hedgehogs and pigmy shrews ten gawtrybe squirrels had made it to the top of the south wall six stood by on the narrow catwalk fighting off hordebeasts as the other four let down ropes with sticks tied across them ladder fashion starwort wound his sling about his waist and grabbed one of the ropes come on mates just like climbin up the riggin grumm and the moles waited until they heard the screams and shouts of combat on the other side of the wall roight molers showm ow to go atunellen powerful digging claws tore at rock sand earth and grass as the hole began to sink deep and wide pallum stood close to rose i never was in a war is it always this complicated rose shrugged as she twirled a sling your guess is as good as mine pallum i was never in one either standing on the darkened beach martin could see the confused figures in the light of the gates he fired off his arrow seeing a searat fall with it in his throat as ballaw bade his rank drop and reload their bows the firecart had done its work well despite copious doses of sand and inaccurately thrown water the flames licked hungrily up the woodwork eating into the timber until they were well established rowarxoak came crawling belly down across the sand to martin and ballaw joining them in time to see a ferret on the walltop beating wildly at his burning cloak one badger reporting back mission successful whats next martin cast aside the bow and drew his sword im going round to climb that net on the north wall ballaw and the others went with him rowanoak heaved a sigh and sat down with a bow and arrow ill stop here and practice my archery i couldve climbed that net though when i was younger and slimmer the burning gate was a lost cause badrang sent a platoon of long pikes to stand in the courtyard and repel anybeast that tried to gain entrance once the gates fell dividing his walltroops into two groups he gave charge of the north wall to crosstooth and the south to fleabane dashing down from the walls he ran into the longhouse for the first time in his life the tyrant felt the icy claws of terror grip him with an awful certainty he knew he was defeated marshank would fall he stifled a sob of fear in his throat as he looked around frantically what to do he was trapped inside his own fortress surrounded by a determined horde of fighters some of them had been slaves of his slaves that he had starved beaten and illtreated his paws began to shake suppose he was captured by those same slaves striving desperately not to think what they would do to him he climbed out of the back window of the longhouse he was facing the north wall and the sounds of fighting above him were loud and furious badrang looked up in the red glow from the blaze he saw his troops being pressed back by a growing multitude of small shrews and large fearsome hedgehogs bodies hurtled from the walltops amid wild battle shouts and war cries suddenly the tyrants blood chilled his mouth went dry with fright there illuminated in the light from the burning gates stood a warrior on the battlements badrang recalled him in a flash this was the one called martin the young mouse who had defied his authority the one he had tied over the gate and imprisoned in the pit the mouse warrior fought like ten beasts reckless of caution he was everywhere at once teeth bared eyes glittering as he threw himself into the fray hugging the wallshadows badrang whimpered and ran for his life before he was seen and identified by the fearless avenger starwort and marigold left the savage gawtrybe squirrels to deal with the troops on the south wall laughing crazily as they wielded their stoneheaded axes against sword spear and dagger heading their contingent of broadstream fighters the two otters descended the wall ladders to the courtyard they charged straight into the platoon of pikebeasts who had been left to defend the burning gateway with lightning agility the otters were in under the pikeshafts before the surprised foe had a chance to retaliate swinging stoneloaded slings the fighting otters battered their enemies to the ground with startling speed as the last one fell there was a sagging and creaking of timbers and the gates began caving slowly inwards gangway the doors are openin marigold yelled out urgently otters scattered left right and back as the gates buckled and groaned collapsing inwards with a crash of dust fire smoke and sparks starwort picked himself up from where the scorching air had bowled him over stan aside mates badger comin through rowanoak came at full tilt sand flying from her paws as she galloped straight at the inferno with an earsplitting roar the big badger leaped over the fallen gates it was an awesome sight sailing through the flames she landed square on all four paws inside the courtyard the otters crowded round her beating out the smouldering patches on her fur there now i wasnt as old as i thought rowanoak laughed shuffling her paws to cool them on the ground still life in the old stripes yet crosstooth fought his way along the north wall to the rear hoping to reach the back wall which offered quietness and a chance of escape the fox was a seasoned battler and cut his way through several pigmy shrews with the longbladed spear he carried thrusting hard he sent a shrew spinning from the walltop knocking another flat with his spearshaft as he did queen amballa wriggled away from the questing spearpoint as the fox sought to skewer her striking out valiantly with her small shrew sword martin came in with both footpaws first catching crosstooth in the lower back and sending him sprawling amballa was quick she dispatched the foebeast with a single thrust as he fell forward upon her pushing her way free of the body she leaped upright martinmouse save ballamum but martin was not listening he ran past her along the walltop to where he had caught sight of badrang down below scurrying from the wall shadow to the burntout slave compound lying low the tyrant peered through the ashblackened stakes of the compound to the base of the rear wall moles squirrels and mice were climbing out of a sizeable tunnel which had been dug through from the outside badrang saw his one chance of escape badraaaang i am here the tyrant heard the challenge over the melee of battle casting a swift glance over his shoulder he saw martin dashing along the walltop it was now or never badrang broke cover and ran for the tunnel slashing viciously with his sword at anybeast who barred his way brandishing a ladle a mole leaped growling at him badrang swung his sword it caught the side of the ladle sweeping grumm away as his own ladle was smashed against the side of his head a mousemaid threw herself on him battering at his face with a pebble loaded in her sling once twice thrice she struck taken aback by the ferocity of the attack badrang tasted blood from a mouthwound the loaded sling caught him hard in his left eye snarling with pain and rage he grabbed the mousemaid lifting her easily he flung her savagely from him roses head struck the wall heavily and she slid down like a broken doll roaring and screaming like a wounded wolf martin threw himself from the walltop badrang leaped into the hole only to find pallum in a needletight ball blocking his way the burned palisade of the slave compound saved martin breaking his fall as it exploded in a cloud of black ashdust to the dawnstreaked sky badrang had time to hack at pallum only once before the warrior was on him he was heaved bodily from the hole arching his back in agony as the flat of martins small sword whipped him get up you scum up on your paws and face me badrang scrambled up holding the long sword of luke the warrior before him with both paws he rushed martin the onlookers gave a cry of dismay as the sword raked martins chest heedless of it the warrior began striking back steel clashed upon steel as the young mouse with the short sword battered badrang round and round the ruins of the compound badrang flailed out in a panic catching his enemy on the shoulder arm and paw they locked blades and stood with their noses touching badrangs eyes wide with horror as he stared into the face of the snarling unstoppable warrior who was forcing him backwards as he gritted out i told you i would return someday and put an end to you wrenching his face away the stoat bit deep into his foes shoulder only to find himself lifted bodily and hurled hard against the wall martin flung the shrew sword from him locking both paws around badrangs grip on the sword the tyrant wailed as he felt the warriors inexorable power turning the weapon until its point was hovering close to his heart badrangs nerve deserted him dont kill me he sobbed you can have it all the fortress everythi the tyrant of marshanks mouth fell open and his head lolled to one side as he fell forward carrying martin to the ground underneath him with his last vestige of strength the young mouse pushed the slain foebeast from him and tugged his fathers sword loose lying on his side with sand crusting the blood of his warwounds martin saw dawns light beam across the face of rose where she lay close to him by the wall the merciful darkness closed in on him as he murmured to her rose we could have chopped the sycamore down with this v the sun rose in summer splendor as starworts drum beat out a victory roll unaware of certain events a large crowd stood cheering in the smouldering gateway that lay open to the sunwarmed shore and the sparkling sea rowanoak strode slowly up placing a restraining paw on the jubilant otter chieftain silence the drum friend our battle was won at a bitter price brome worked away dryeyed on the wounds of the unconscious mouse warrior binding and staunching as he applied herb poultices all the time talking to himself it was all my fault if i had stayed at noonvale and not gone wandering i would never have been captured by badrangs creatures and none of this would have happened i am to blame ballaw sniffed bending down one ear he wiped his syes there there old lad theres only one beast t lame for all this and thats badrang martin settled the core with him for good the evil has gone from this and for ever grumm stumbled up with a large dressing on the side f his face and neck deep rivulets carved their way iown his face where the tears flowed constantly and he nade several small gestures with his paws before buck ler sat him down with a large kerchief youm ave to scuse grumm maister brome himn losed is voice through agrieven wem puttin fallen uns t rest wot abowt miz roser brome left off ministering to martins senseless form he took a huge breath letting it out in a shuddering sigh thank you friends but im taking her home to noonvale with me reaching out he tucked in a corner of the simple white linen cloth that covered his sisters pitiful body rose would have been alive today but for me you know buckler shook his head youm not to blame maister nor marthen nor nobeast yurr rowanoak looked bleakly around at the ruined smokestained walls of marshank where not one foebeast had been left alive i dont know where were all bound but lets get away from this place boldred seconded the badgers wise words rowanoak is right theres been too much death and grief here it seems to be part of the very stones well leave whats left of marshank standing as a reminder to any bad ones of what free and peaceful creatures can do when theyre driven to it helped by marigold brome placed martin on a stretcher he stood upright and addressed the multitude some of you like the otters and the shrews of broadstream have homes to return to those of you who have no homes listen to me noonvale can be your home a place of peace to live happily in for all seasons put aside your weapons if you wish to go with me to noonvale a pile of javelins swords daggers bows and arrows lay at the center of the deserted compound that had once held badrangs slaves on the shore outside the fortress comrades who had fought together now took their leave of each other like a stern father the warden of marshwood hill shepherded the wild and wayward squirrel tribe back to their mountain foothills beyond the marshes boldred watched them go hell keep his eye on those rogues come on lets get martin away from here bound to the stretcher and still clasping his fathers sword tightly the unconscious young mouse was carried south along the beach by pallum grumm boldred and rowanoak ballaw turned to the remainder of the rambling rosehip players who stood alongside others bound for noonvale old rowanoakll join us once martins safe wot right ho starwort lead us to your vessel my good otter queen amballa stood with her pigmy shrews they were the last to leave one of the shrews had picked up the sword she had once given to martin waddling behind brome she called out waitmouse brome halted he watched as the queen of the pigmy shrews signalled the otters carrying roses bier to lower it placing the small sword beside the mousemaids still form amballa spoke in her curt vigorous manner rosemouse bravemouse we remember hername allseasons she waved to the pigmy shrews and they set off south along the shoreline for their own territory high noontide hung over marshank it lay open to the insects birds and seasons a breeze lingered there swirling the dust and sand into miniature spirals mingling it with ashes around the carcasses of badrangs horde which had been left for the gannets and scavenging sea birds to dispose of the once proud fortress of the tyrant now stood deserted and forsaken the first gannet to land was chased off by capn tramun clogg waving his spade as he trundled out of hiding from the grave surmounted by the upturned wheelbarrow garn

yer name carved all andsome like on one of em the sea birds wheeled and soared over the lone figure below sitting in the slave compound as he argued and gossiped with the dead stoat who made no reply as he stared through sightless eyes at the unclouded blue sky of the eastern coast days shortened and the flowers of summer died one by one as leaves began turning brown and gold it was on one such mistshrouded autumn morning that martin sat in the odd tree house with the molewife polleekin and his three friends boldred having long since departed for her mountain and her family all through the remainder of the summer polleekin grumm pallum and rowanoak had spent sleepless nights and restless days nursing the warrior back to health martin had come through it in silence never speaking a word he looked young still though healed in body and getting stronger by the day his eyes still had a faraway look in them grumm was about to speak when polleekin silenced him with a glance she nodded to the sword at martins side oi be aneeden more foirewood marthen will youm cut some wordlessly martin took up his sword and went off descending to the forest to cut wood pawing at the scar cut through his backspikes pallum got up as if to follow but the molewife forbade it youm set thurr edgepig they wurrier garn off to shed tears rowanoak shook her head wonderingly i heard him yesterday as i was walking through the forest it must be very hard for him he never mentions rose polleekin busied herself with breakfast no marm nor will himn oi doant think never that liddle mouseymaid be locked in marthens eart and thurr shem bound to stay grumm blinked and sniffed marthen be a gurt brave wurrier tho himn woant go back to noonvale too many memries furr im thurr polleekins breakfast was good homely fare oatmeal with honey nutbread spread thick with strawberry preserve and a steaming pot of mint and dandelion tea martin ate automatically neither tasting nor commenting on the food when he had finished he made a simple announcement i am leaving today it was the first time he had spoken since the battle at marshank his friend waited for him to say more but he sat silent staring at his empty plate face calm and resolute it was then that rowanoak knew martin had rejoined the land of the living will you come to noonvale with us we will be leaving to go there today the young mouse sat testing the swordblade against his paw pressing so hard that he almost drew blood i can never return to noonvale i will travel alone south grumm knew it was no use trying to change his friends mind whurr be youm agoen wot be youm agoen t do marthen they listened carefully knowing that this would be the last time he would speak to them at any length one day maybe i will hang up this sword and be a creature of peace until then i must follow the way of the warrior it is in my blood have no fear i will never mention noonvale or any of you noonvale is a secret place untouched by evil i could not forgive myself if i unknowingly sent trouble there nobeast will know from where i came pallum stared quizzically at his sterneyed friend but what will you say we had such adventures together maybe in another time and another place you will tell the tale never martin shook his head slowly i will only say that i guarded my fathers cave against searats while he was away when i felt that he would not return i began my wanderings how could anybeast understand what we went through together the freedom we won and the friends we lost the comrades sat in silence each with their own memories polleekin rose stiffly and cleared away the remnants of their final meal together soft autumn sunlight had cleared away twining wreaths of mist that hung over the still woodlands leaves were falling in a crisp brown carpet and a mild hoar frost melted to glistening dewdrops as the five companions took their leave of each other in the silent timeless morning martin carried his sword slung across his back over an old cloak polleekin had made packs of food for them all grumm held his ladle in front of his face to hide the tears he could not stop from flowing rowanoak embraced the warrior awkwardly standing back as pallum and grumm did likewise polleekin kissed them all on the cheeks rowanoak squared her broad shoulders and smiled we will never forget you martin the warrior come on lets see if we can make this place ring one last time with the old war cry birds flapped their startled wings as four voices yelled aloud fur and freedoooooom polleekin stood alone watching as martin was lost among the trees a solitary figure going south the ancient molewife slowly pawed her flowery apron eyes clouding over as the destiny of the lone traveller stole unbidden into her mind hurr oi told youm twould be bad fate iffen youm returned t marshank wi thoi mousemaiden naow thurr be ony youm left young un bo urr youm got some ard days to go yet awhoil tho appiness will be thoine in toime yet t come but furr all seasons everybeast shall amember thoi name marthen ee wurrier down in cavern hole at redwall abbey a night and a day had passed and the fire and wall torches had been replenished four times since the mousemaid aubretia had begun her story there was not a one who had fallen asleep throughout the whole epic tale nor was there a creature who had not shed a tear abbot saxtus took off his spectacles and sighed in the silence that had reigned since aubretia stopped talking polleekin was right of course martin did go on to find happiness he forsook the warriors way and dedicated himself to peace the founding of our order and the building of redwall but tell me how did you know all this who told the story to you aubretia the big hedgehog bultip put aside his tankard i can answer that father abbot aubretia comes from the ruling line of noonvale though she and i have not been back there in a full season the blood of urran voh runs in her veins her great ancestor was called brome the healer brother of rose my great ancestor far back in the mists of countless days was called pallum the peaceful i am a direct descendant of his line simeon passed his sensitive paws gently over aubretias face you have inherited the beauty of bromes sister the mousemaid undid a thong from about her neck on it was a brilliantly carved locket of scallop shell she opened it every creature who sees this says the same thing abbot saxtus took the locket carefully inside was a picture painted with plant and vegetable dyes on a small tablet of polished cherrywood it was a miniature portrait of martin and rose carried out in loving detail both their faces seemed to stare out at him across the dust and time of bygone seasons martin looks exactly like his picture on the tapestry though younger you are right aubretia you could have passed for roses twin sister this is a marvellous thing where did it come from it was given to the family of brome by an owl called emalet the mousemaid answered as she rummaged in her herb satchel boldred her mother was a great artist besides being a good mapmaker bultip and i left noonvale early last summer we had heard tales of martin and redwall from travellers since we were babes so we set out to see the abbey for ourselves here is something i brought with me for redwall the abbot took the gift donning his spectacles he looked at it curiously turning it this way and that thank you very much but please excuse my ignorance what is it aubretia explained about the sprig with its attached wet loam bag grumm planted a rose on the grave of rose it is a red rose sometimes it flowers later than others and we call it laterose this is a cutting from the original bush it is very sturdy simeon felt the little shoot tenderly this spring i will plant it in our abbey grounds it will bloom and flourish in memory of the mousemaid laterose what a pretty name that was roses full title as you told it laterose of noonvale daughter of urran voh and aryah abbot saxtus returned aubretias locket we thank you my child for everything laterose will remain pre cious to redwall abbey martin gave it strength now rose will give it beauty now i am tired and you must be too friends go and rest stop at our home for as long as you wish you are both welcome the entire company walked together up the stairs from cavern hole to their rooms aubretia
