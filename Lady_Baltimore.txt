lady baltimore to the reader you know the great text in burns i am sure where he wishes he could see himself as others see him well here lies the hitch in many a work of art if its maker poet painter or novelist could but have become its audience too for a single day before he launched it irrevocably upon the uncertain ocean of publicity how much better his boat would often sail how many little touches to the rigging he would give how many little drops of oil to the engines here and there the need of which he had never suspected but for that trial trip thats where the shipbuilders and dramatists have the advantage over us others they can dock their productions and tinker at them even to the musician comes this useful chance and schumann can reform the proclamation which opens his bflat symphony still to publish a story in weekly numbers previously to its appearance as a book does sometimes give to the watchful author an opportunity to learn before it is too late where he has failed in clearness and it brings him also through the mails some few questions that are pleasant and proper to answer when his story sets forth united upon its journey of adventure among gentle readers how came my hero by his name if you will open a book more valuable than any i dare hope to write and more entertaining too the life of paul jones by mr buell you will find the real ancestor of this imaginary boy and fall in love with john mayrant the first as did his immortal captain of the bon homme richard he came from south carolina and believing his seed and name were perished there today i gave him a descendant i have learned that the name until recently was in existence i trust it will not seem taken in vain in these pages whence came such a person as augustus our happier cities produce many augustuses and may they long continue to do so if augustus displeases any one so much the worse for that one not for augustus to be sure he doesnt admire over heartily the parvenus of steel or oil whose too sudden money takes them to the divorce court he calls them the yellow rich do you object to that nor does he think that those americans who prefer their pockets to their patriotism are good citizens he says of such people that eternal vigilance cannot watch liberty and the ticker at the same time do you object to that why the young man would be perfect did he but attend his primaries and vote more regularly and who wants a perfect young man what would john mayrant have done if hortense had not challenged him as she did i have never known and i fear we might have had a tragedy would the old ladies really have spoken to augustus about the love difficulties of john mayrant i must plead guilty the old ladies of kings port like american gentlefolk everywhere keep family matters sacredly inside the family circle but you see had they not told augustus how in the world could i have told however i plead guilty certain passages have been interpreted most surprisingly to signify a feeling against the colored race that is by no means mine my only wish regarding these people to whom we owe an immeasurable responsibility is to see the best that is in them prevail discord over this seems on the wane and sane views gaining the issue sits on all our shoulders but local variations call for a sliding scale of policy so admirably dispassionate a novel as the elder brother by mr jervey forwards the understanding of northerners unfamiliar with the south and also that friendliness between the two places which is retarded chiefly by tactless newspapers ah tact should have been one of the cardinal virtues and if i didnt possess a spice of it myself i should here thank by name certain two members of the st michael family of kings port for their patience with this comedy before ever it saw the light tact bids us away from many pleasures but it can never efface the memory of kindness lady baltimore i a word about my aunt like adam our first conspicuous ancestor i must begin and lay the blame upon a woman i am glad to recognize that i differ from the father of my sex in no important particular being as manlike as most of his sons therefore it is the woman my aunt carola who must bear the whole reproach of the folly which i shall forthwith confess to you since she it was who put it into my head and as it was only to make eve happy that her husband ever consented to eat the disastrous apple so i save to please my relative had never aspired to become a selected salic scion i rejoice now that i did so that i yielded to her temptation ours is a wide country and most of us know but our own corner of it while thanks to my aunt i have been able to add another corner this among many other enlightenments of navel and education do i owe her she stands on the threshold of all that is to come therefore i were lacking in deference did i pass her and her scions by without due mention employing no english but such as fits a theme so stately although she never left the threshold nor went to kings port with me nor saw the boy or the girl or any part of what befell them she knew quite well who the boy was when i wrote her about him she remembered one of his grandmothers whom she had visited during her own girlhood long before the war both in kings port and at the family plantation and this old memory led her to express a kindly interest in him how odd and far away that interest seems now that it has been turned to cold displeasure some other day perhaps i may try to tell you much more than i can tell you here about aunt carola and her colonial society that apple which eve in the form of my aunt held out to me never had i expected to feel rise in me the appetite for this particular fruit though i had known such hunger to exist in some of my neighbors once a worthy dame of my town at whose dinnertable young men and maidens of fashion sit constantly asked me with much sentiment if i was aware that she was descended from boadicea why had she never i asked her revealed this to me before and upon her informing me that she had learned it only that very day i exclaimed that it was a great distance to have descended so suddenly to this after a look at me she assented adding that she had the good news from the office of the american almanach de gotha union square new york and she recommended that publication to me there was but a slight fee to pay a matter of fifty dollars or upwards and for this trifling sum you were furnished with your rightful coatofarms and with papers clearly tracing your family to the druids the vestal virgins and all the best people in the world therefore i felicitated the boadicean lady upon the illustrious progenitrix with whom the almanach de gotha had provided her for so small a consideration and observed that for myself i supposed i should continue to rest content with the thought that in our enlightened republic every american was himself a sovereign but that said the lady after giving me another look is so different from boadicea and to this i perfectly agreed later i had the pleasure to hear in a roundabout way that she had pronounced me one of the most agreeable young men in society though sophisticated i have not cherished this against her my gift of humor puzzles many who can see only my refinement and my scrupulous attention to dress yes indeed i counted myself proof against all boadiceas but you have noticed have you not how whenever a few people gather together and style themselves something and choose a president and eight or nine vicepresidents and a secretary and a treasurer and a committee on elections and then let it be known that almost nobody else is qualified to belong to it that there springs up immediately in hundreds and thousands of breasts a fiery craving to get into that body you may try this experiment in science law medicine art letters society farming i care not what but you will set the same craving afire in doctors academicians and dog breeders all over the earth thus when my aunt the president herself mind you said to me one day that she thought if i proved my qualifications my name might be favorably considered by the selected salic scions i say no more i blush though you cannot see me when i am tempted i seem to be human after all at first to be sure i met aunt carolas suggestion in the way that i am too ready to meet many of her remarks for you must know she once with sincere simplicity and goodwill told my uncle andrew her husband she is only my aunt by marriage that she had married beneath her and she seemed unprepared for his reception of this candid statement uncle andrew was unaffectedly merry over it ever since then all of us wait hopefully every day for what she may do or say next she is from old new york oldest new york the family manor is still habitable near cold spring she was in her youth handsome i am assured by those whose word i have always trusted her appearance even today causes people to turn and look she is not tall in feet and inches i have to stoop considerably when she commands from me the familiarity of a kiss but in the quality which we call force in moral stature she must be full eight feet high when rebuking me she can pronounce a single word my name augustus in a tone that renders further remark needless and you should see her eye when she says of certain newcomers in our society i dont know them she can make her curtsy as appalling as a natural law she knows also how to take umbrage which is something that i never knew any one else to take outside of a book she is a highly pronounced christian holding all unitarians wicked and all methodists vulgar and once when she was talking as she does frequently about king james and the english religion and the english bible and i reminded her that the jews wrote it she said with displeasure that she made no doubt king james had well seen to it that all foreign matter was expunged i give you her own words unless you have moved in our best american society and by this i do not at all mean the lower classes with dollars and no grandfathers who live in palaces at newport and look forward to everything and back to nothing but those americans with grandfathers and no dollars who live in boardinghouses and look forward to nothing and back to everything unless you have known this haughty and improving milieu you have never seen anything like my aunt carola of course with uncle andrews money she does not live in a boardinghouse and i shall finish this brief attempt to place her before you by adding that she can be very kind very loyal very publicspirited and that i am truly attached to her upon your mothers side of the family she said of course me i did not have to feign amazement my aunt was silent me descended from a king my aunt nodded with an indulgent stateliness there seems to be the possibility of it royal blood in my veins aunt i have said so augustus why make me repeat it it was now i fear that i met aunt carola in that unfitting spirit that volatile mood which as i have said already her remarks often rouse in me and from what sovereign may i hope that i if you will consult a recent admirable compilation entitled the american almanach de gotha you will find that henry the seventh aunt i am so much relieved for i think that i might have hesitated to trace it back had you said well charles the second for example or elizabeth at this point i should have been wise to notice my aunts eye but i did not and i continued imprudently though why hesitate i have never heard that there was anybody present to marry adam and eve and so why should we all make such a todo about augustus she uttered my name in that quiet but prodigious tone to which i have alluded above it was i who was now silent augustus if you purpose trifling you may leave the room oh aunt i beg your pardon i never meant i cannot understand what impels you to adopt such a manner to me when i am trying to do something for you i hastened to strengthen my apologies with a manner becoming the possible descendant of a king toward a lady of distinction and my aunt was pleased to pass over my recent lapse from respect she now broached her favorite topic which i need scarcely tell you is genealogy beginning with her own if your title to royal blood she said were as plain as mine through admiral bombo you know you would not need any careful research she told me a great deal of genealogy which i spare you it was not one family tree it was a forest of them it gradually appeared that a grandmother of my mothers grandfather had been a fanning and there were sundry kinds of fannings right ones and wrong ones the point for me was what kind had mine been no family record showed this if it was fanning of the bon homme richard variety or fanning of the alamance then i was no kings descendant worthy new england people i understand said my aunt with her nod of indulgent stateliness referring to the bon homme richard species but of entirely bourgeois extraction paul jones himself you know was a mere gardeners son while the alamance fanning was one of those infamous regulators who opposed governor tryon not through any such cattle could you be one of us said my aunt but a dim distant hitherto uncharted henry tudor fanning had fought in some of the early indian wars and the last of his known blood was reported to have fallen while fighting bravely at the battle of cowpens in him my hope lay records of tarleton records of marions men these were what i must search and for these i had best go to kings port if i returned with kinship proven then i might be a selected salic scion a chosen vessel a royal seed one in the most exalted circle of men and women upon our coasts the other qualifications were already mine ancestors colonial and bellicose upon land and sea besides having acquired my aunt was so good as to say sufficient personal presentability since your life in paris of which i had rather not know too much augustus it is a pity she repeated that you will have so much research with my family it was all so satisfactorily clear through killdevil bombo admiral bombos spirited reckless son you will readily conceive that i did not venture to betray my ignorance of these bombos i worked my eyebrows to express a silent and timeworn familiarity go to kings port you need a holiday at any rate and i my aunt handsomely finished will make the journey a present to you this generosity made me at once and sincerely repentant for my flippancy concerning charles the second and elizabeth and so partly from being tempted by this apple of eve and partly because recent overwork had tired me but chiefly for her sake and not to thwart at the outset her kindlymeant ambitions for me i kissed the hand of my aunt carola and set forth to kings port come back one of us was her parting benediction ii i vary my lunch thus it was that i came to sojourn in the most appealing the most lovely the most wistful town in america whose visible sadness and distinction seem also to speak audibly speak in the sound of the quiet waves that ripple round her southern front speak in the churchbells on sunday morning and breathe not only in the soft salt air but in the perfume of every gentle oldfashioned rose that blooms behind the high garden walls of falling mellowtinted plaster kings port the retrospective kings port the belated who from her pensive porticoes looks over her two rivers to the marshes and the trees beyond the liveoaks veiled in gray moss brooding with memories were she my city how i should love her but though my city she cannot be the enchanting image of her is mine to keep to carry with me wheresoever i may go for who having seen her could forget her therefore i thank aunt carola for this gift and for what must always go with it in my mind the quiet and strange romance which i saw happen and came finally to share in why it is that my aunt no longer wishes to know either the boy or the girl or even to hear their names mentioned you shall learn at the end when i have finished with the wedding for this happy story of love ends with a wedding and begins in the womans exchange which the ladies of kings port have established and i trust lucratively conduct in royal street royal street theres a relevance in this name a fitness to my errand but that is pure accident the womans exchange happened to be there a decorous resort for those who became hungry as i did at the hour of noon each day in my very pleasant boardinghouse where to be sure there was one dreadful boarder a tall lady whom i soon secretly called juno but let unpleasant things wait in the very pleasant house where i boarded i had left my hotel after one night our breakfast was at eight and our dinner not until three sacred meal hours in kings port as inviolable i fancy as the declaration of independence but a gap quite beyond the stretch of my northern vitals therefore at twelve it was my habit to leave my fanning researches for a while and lunch at the exchange upon chocolate and sandwiches most delicate in savor as one day i was luxuriously biting one of these i heard his voice and what he was saying both the voice and the interesting order he was giving caused me at my small table in the dim back of the room to stop and watch him where he stood in the light at the counter to the right of the entrance door young he was very young twentytwo or three at the most and as he stood with hat in hand speaking to the pretty girl behind the counter his head and sideface were of a romantic and highstrung look it was a cake that he desired made a cake for a wedding and i directly found myself curious to know whose wedding even a dull wedding interests me more than other dull events because it can arouse so much surmise and so much prophecy but in this wedding i instantly because of his strange and winning embarrassment became quite absorbed how came it he was ordering the cake for it blushing like the boy that he was entirely he spoke in a most engaging voice no not charged and as you dont know me i had better pay for it now selfpossession in his speech he almost had but the blood in his cheeks and forehead was beyond his control a reply came from behind the counter we dont expect payment until delivery but a but on that morning i shall be rather particularly engaged his tones sank almost away on these words we should prefer to wait then you will leave your address in halfpound boxes i suppose boxes oh yes i hadnt thought no just a big round one like this you know his arms embraced a circular space of air with plenty of icing i do not think that there was any smile on the other side of the counter there was at any rate no hint of one in the voice and how many pounds he was again staggered why a i never ordered one before i want plenty and the very best the very best each person would eat a pound wouldnt they or would two be nearer i think i had better leave it all to you about like this you know once more his arms embraced a circular space of air before this i had never heard the young lady behind the counter enter into any conversation with a customer she would talk at length about all sorts of kings port affairs with the older ladies connected with the exchange who were frequently to be found there but with a customer never she always took my orders and my money and served me with a silence and a propriety that have become with ordinary shopkeepers a lost art they talk to one indeed but this slim girl was a lady and consequently did the right thing marking and keeping a distance between herself and the public today however she evidently felt it her official duty to guide the hapless young man amid his errors he now appeared to be committing a grave one are you quite sure you want that the girl was asking lady baltimore yes that is what i want because she began to explain then hesitated and looked at him perhaps it was in his face perhaps it was that she remembered at this point the serious difference between the price of lady baltimore by my small billoffare i was now made acquainted with its price and the cost of that rich article which convention has prescribed as the cake for weddings at any rate swift sudden delicacy of feeling prevented her explaining any more to him for she saw how it was his means were too humble for the approved kind of wedding cake she was too young too unskilled yet in the worlds ways to rise above her embarrassment and so she stood blushing at him behind the counter while he stood blushing at her in front of it at length he succeeded in speaking thats all i believe goodmorning at his hastily departing back she too murmured goodmorning before i knew it i had screamed out loudly from my table but he hasnt told you the day he wants it for before she knew it she had flown to the door my cry had set her going as if i had touched a spring and there he was at the door himself rushing back he too had remembered it was almost a collision and nothing but their good southern breeding the way they took it saved it from being like a rowdy farce i know he said simply and immediately i am sorry to be so careless its for the twentyseventh she was writing it down in the orderbook very well that is wednesday of next week you have given us more time than we need she put complete impersonal business into her tone and this time he marched off in good order leaving peace in the womans exchange no not peace quiet merely the girl at the counter now proceeded to grow indignant with me we were alone together we two no young man or any other business occupied her or protected me but if you suppose that she made war or expressed rage by speaking that is not it at all from her counter in front to my table at the back she made her displeasure felt she was inaudibly crushing she did not do it even with her eye she managed it well with her neck somehow and by the way she made her nose look in profile aunt carola would have embraced her and i should have liked to do so myself she could not stand the idea of my having after all these days of official reserve that she had placed between us startled her into that rush to the door annihilated her dignity at a blow so did i finish my sandwiches beneath her invisible but eloquent fire what affair of mine was the cake and what sort of impertinent meddlesome person was i shrieking out my suggestions to people with whom i had no acquaintance these were the things that her nose and her neck said to me the whole length of the exchange i had nothing but my own weakness to thank it was my interest in weddings that did it made me forget my decorum the public place myself everything and plunge in and i became more and more delighted over it as the girl continued to crush me my day had been dull my researches had not brought me a whit nearer royal blood i looked at my little billoffare and then i stepped forward to the counter adventurous but polite i should like a slice if you please of lady baltimore i said with extreme formality i thought she was going to burst but after an interesting second she replied certainly in her fit regular exchange tone only i thought it trembled a little i returned to the table and she brought me the cake and i had my first felicitous meeting with lady baltimore oh my goodness did you ever taste it its all soft and its in layers and it has nuts but i cant write any more about it my mouth waters too much delighted surprise caused me once more to speak aloud and with my mouth full but dear me this is delicious a choking ripple of laughter came from the counter its i who make them said the girl i thank you for the unintentional compliment then she walked straight back to my table i cant help it she said laughing still and her delightful insolent nose well up how can i behave myself when a man goes on as you do a nice white curly dog followed her and she stroked his ears your behavior is very agreeable to me i remarked youll allow me to say that youre not invited to criticise it i was decidedly put out with you for making me ridiculous but you have admired my cake with such enthusiasm that you are forgiven and may i hope that you are getting on famously with the battle of cowpens i stared im frankly very much astonished that you should know about that oh youre just known all about in kings port i wish that our miserable alphabet could in some way render the soft southern accent which she gave to her words but it cannot i could easily misspell if i chose but how even then could i for instance make you hear her way of saying about aboot would magnify it and besides i decline to make ugly to the eye her quite special english that was so charming to the ear kings port just knows all about you she repeated with a sweet and mocking laugh do you mind telling me how she explained at once this place is death to all incognitos the explanation however did not on the instant enlighten me this the womans exchange you mean why to be sure have you not heard ladies talking together here i blankly repealed her words ladies talking she nodded oh i cried how dull of me ladies talking of course she continued it was therefore widely known that you were consulting our south carolina archives at the library and then that notebook you bring marked you out the very first day why two hours after your first lunch we just knew all about you dear me said i kings port is ever ready to discuss strangers she further explained the exchange has been going on five years and the resident families have discussed each other so thoroughly here that everything is known therefore a stranger is a perfect boon her gayety for a moment interrupted her before she continued always mocking and always sweet kings port cannot boast intelligence offices for servants but if you want to know the character and occupation of your friends come to the exchange how i wish i could give you the raciness the contagion of her laughter who would have dreamed that behind her primness all this frolic lay in ambush why she said im only a plantation girl its my first week here and i know every wicked deed everybody as done since she went back to her counter it had been very merry and as i was settling the small debt for my lunch i asked since this is the proper place for information will you kindly tell me whose wedding that cake is for she was astonished you dont know and i thought you were quite a clever ya i beg your pardon northerner please tell me since i know youre quite a clever reb i beg your pardon southerner why its his own couldnt you see that from his bashfulness ordering his own wedding cake amazement held me but the door opened one of the elderly ladies entered the girl behind the counter stiffened to primness in a flash and i went out into royal street as the curly dogs tail wagged his greeting to the newcomer iii kings port talks of course i had at once left the letters of introduction which aunt carola had given me but in my ignorance of kings port hours i had found everybody at dinner when i made my first round of calls between halfpast three and five an experience particularly regrettable since i had hurried my own dinner on purpose not then aware that the hours at my boardinghouse were the custom of the whole town these hours even since my visit to kings port are beginning to change but such backsliding is much condemned upon an afternoon some days later having seen in the extra lookingglass which i had been obliged to provide for myself that the part in my back hair was perfect i set forth again better informed as i rang the first doorbell another visitor came up the steps a beautiful old lady in widows dress a cardcase in her hand have you rung sir said she in a manner at once gentle and voluminous yes madam nevertheless she pulled it again it doesnt always ring she explained unless one is accustomed to it which you are not she addressed me with authority exactly like aunt carola and with even greater precision in her good english and good enunciation unlike the girl at the exchange she had no accent her language was simply the perfection of educated utterance it also was racy with the free censoriousness which civilized people of consequence are apt to exercise the world over i was sorry to miss your visit she began she knew me you see perfectly you will please to come again soon and console me for my disappointment i am mrs gregory st michael and my house is in le maire street pronounced in kings port lammarree as you have been so civil as to find out and how does your aunt carola do in these contemptible times you can tell her from me that vulgarization is descending even upon kings port i cannot imagine that i exclaimed you cannot imagine it because you dont know anything about it young gentleman the manners of some of our own young people will soon be as dishevelled as those in new york have you seen our town yet or is it all books with you you should not leave without a look at what is still left of us i shall be happy if you will sit in my pew on sunday morning your northern shells did their best in the bombardment did you say that you rang i think you had better pull it again all the way out yes like that in the bombardment but we have our old church still in spite of you do you see the crack in that wall the earthquake did it youre spared earthquakes in the north as you seem to be spared pretty much everything disastrous except the prosperity thats going to ruin you all were better off with our poverty than you just ring the bell once more and then well go i fancy julia i fancy mrs weguelin st michael has run out to stare at the northern steam yacht in the harbor it would be just like her this house is historic itself shabby enough now to be sure the greataunt of my cousin john mayrant who is going to be married next wednesday to such a brute of a girl poor boy lived here in and made an answer to the earl of mainridge that put him in his place she was our famous kings port wit and at the reception which her father my mothers uncle gave the english visitor he conducted himself as so many englishmen seem to think they can in this country miss beaufain pronounced in kings port bowfayne as she was then asked the earl how he liked america and he replied very well except for the people who were so vulgar what can you expect said miss beaufain were descended from the english mrs st michael is out and the servant has gone home slide this card under the door with your own and come away she took me with her moving through the quiet south place with a leisurely grace and dignity at which my spirit rejoiced she was so beautiful and so easy and afraid of nothing and nobody this must be modified i came later to suspect that they all stood in some dread of their own immediate families in the north everybody is afraid of something afraid of the legislature afraid of the trusts afraid of the strikes afraid of what the papers will say of what the neighbors will say of what the cook will say and most of all and worst of all afraid to be different from the general pattern afraid to take a step or speak a syllable that shall cause them to be thought unlike the monotonous millions of their fellowcitizens the land of the free living in ceaseless fear well i was already afraid of mrs gregory st michael as we walked and she talked i made one or two attempts at conversation and speedily found that no such thing was the ladys intention i was there to listen and truly i could wish nothing more agreeable in spite of my desire to hear further about next wednesdays wedding and the brute of a girl but to this subject mrs st michael did not return we crossed worship street and chancel street and were nearing the east place where a cannon was being shown me a cannon with a history and an inscription concerning the war for southern independence which i presume your prejudice calls the rebellion said my guide theres mrs st michael now coming round the corner well julia could you read the yachts name with your naked eye and whats the name of the gambler who owns it hes a gambler or he couldnt own a yacht unless his wifes a gamblers daughter how well youre feeling today maria said the other lady with a gentle smile certainly i have been talking for twenty minutes i was now presented to mrs weguelin st michael also old also charming in widows dress no less in the bloom of age than mrs gregory but whiter and very diminutive she shyly welcomed me to kings port take him home with you julia we pulled your bell three times and its too damp for you to be out dont forget mrs gregory said to me that you havent told me a word about your aunt carola and that i shall expect you to come and do it she went slowly away from us up the east place tall graceful sweeping into the distance like a ship no haste about her dignified movement no swinging of elbows nothing of the present hour what a beautiful girl she must have been i murmured aloud unconsciously no she was not a beauty in her youth said my new guide in her shy voice but always fluent always a wit kings port has at times thought her tongue too downright we think that wit runs in her family for young john mayrant has it and her firstcousinonceremoved put the earl of mainridge in his place at her fathers ball in miss beaufain as she was then asked the earl how he liked america and he replied very well except for the people who were so vulgar what can you expect said miss beaufain were descended from the english i am very sorry for maria for mrs st michael just at present her young cousin john mayrant is making an alliance deeply vexatious to her do you happen to know miss hortense rieppe i had never heard of her no she has been north lately i thought you might have met her her father takes her north i believe whenever any one will invite them they have sometimes managed to make it extend through an unbroken year newport i am credibly informed greatly admires her we in kings port have never except john mayrant apparently seen anything in her beauty which northerners find so exceptional what is her type i inquired i consider that she looks like a steel wasp and she has the assurance to call herself a kings port girl her father calls himself a general and it is repeated that he ran away at the battle of chattanooga i hope you will come to see me another day when you can spare time from the battle of cowpens i am mrs weguelin st michael the other lady is mrs gregory st michael i wonder if you will keep us all straight and smiling the little lady whose shy manner and voice i had found to veil as much spirit as her predecessors dismissed me and went up her steps letting herself into her own house the boy in question the boy of the cake john mayrant was coming out of the gate at which i next rang the appearance of his boyish figure and wellcarried head struck me anew as it had at first from his whole person one got at once a strangely romantic impression he looked at me made as if he would speak but passed on probably he had been hearing as much about me as i had been hearing about him at this house the black servant had not gone home for the night and if the mistress had been out to take a look at the steam yacht she had returned my sister she said presenting me to a supremely finelooking old lady more chiselled more august than even herself i did not catch this ladys name and she confined herself to a distant though perhaps not unfriendly greeting she was sitting by a worktable and she resumed some embroidery of exquisite appearance while my hostess talked to me both wore their hair in a simple fashion to suit their years which must have been seventy or more both were dressed with the dignity that such years call for and i may mention here that so were all the ladies above a certain age in this town of admirable oldfashioned propriety in new york in boston in philadelphia ladies of seventy wont be old ladies any more theyre unwilling to wear their years avowedly in quiet dignity by their firesides they bare their bosoms and gallop egregiously to the ballrooms of the young and so we lose a particular graciousness that kings port retains a perspective of generations we happen all at once with no background in a swirl of haste and similarity one of the many things which came home to me during the conversation that now began so many more things came home than i can tell you was that mrs gregory st michaels tongue was assuredly downright for kings port this i had not at all taken in while she talked to me and her friends reference to it had left me somewhat at a loss that better precision and choice of words which i have mentioned and the manner in which she announced her opinions had put me in mind of several fine ladles whom i had known in other parts of the world but hers was an individual manner i was soon to find and by no means the kings port convention this convention permitted indeed condemnations of ones neighbor no less sweeping but it conveyed them in a phraseology far more restrained i cannot regret your coming to kings port said my hostess after we had talked for a little while and i had complimented the balmy march weather and the wealth of blooming flowers but i fear that fanning is not a name that you will find here it belongs to north carolina i smiled and explained that north carolina fannings were useless to me and if i may be so bold how well you are acquainted with my errand i cannot say that my hostess smiled that would be too definite but i can say that she did not permit herself to smile and that she let me see this repression yes she said we are acquainted with your errand though not with its motive i sat silent thinking of the exchange my hostess now gave me her own account of why all things were known to all people in this town the distances in your northern cities are greater and their population is much greater there are but few of us in kings port in these last words she plainly told me that those few desired no others she next added my nephew john mayrant has spoken of you at some length i bowed i had the pleasure to see and hear him order a wedding cake yes from eliza la heu pronounced layhew my niece he is my nephew she is my niece on the other side my niece is a beginner at the exchange we hope that she will fulfil her duties there in a worthy manner she comes from a family which is schooled to meet responsibilities i bowed again again it seemed fitting i had not until now known the charming girls name i murmured my hostess now bowed slightly i am glad that you find her charming indeed yes i exclaimed we also are pleased with her she is of good family for the upcountry once again our alphabet fails me the peculiar shade of kindness of recognition of patronage which my agreeable hostess and all kings port ladies i soon noticed imparted to the word upcountry cannot be conveyed except by the human voice and only a kings port voice at that it is a much lighter damnation than what they make of the phrase from georgia which i was soon to hear uttered by the lips of the lady and so you know about his wedding cake my dear madam i feel that i shall know about everything her gray eyes looked at me quietly for a moment that is possible but although we may talk of ourselves to you we scarcely expect you to talk of ourselves to us well my pertness had brought me this quite properly and i received it properly i should never dream i hastened to say even without your warning i find im expected to have seen the young lady of his choice i now threw out my accidental words proved as miraculous as the staff which once smote the rock it was a stream indeed which now broke forth from her stony discretion she began easily it is evident that you have not seen miss rieppe by the manner in which you allude to her although of course in comparison with my age she is a young girl i think that this caused me to open my mouth the disparity between her years and my nephews is variously stated continued the old lady but since johns engagement we have all of us realized that love is truly blind i did not open my mouth any more but my minds mouth was wide open my hostess kept it so since john mayrant was fifteen he has had many loves and for myself knowing him and believing in him as i do i feel confident that he will make no connection distasteful to the family when he really comes to marry this time i gasped outright but the cake next wednesday she made with her small white hand a slight and slighting gesture the cake is not baked yet and we shall see what we shall see from this onward until the end a pinkness mounted in her pale delicate cheeks and deep strong resentment burned beneath her discreetly expressed indiscretions the cake is not baked and i at least am not solicitous i tell my cousin mrs gregory st michael that she must not forget it was merely his phosphates that girl would never have looked at john mayrant had it not been for the rumor of his phosphates i suppose some one has explained to you her pretensions of birth away from kings port she may pass for a native of this place but they come from georgia it cannot be said that she has met with encouragement from us she however easily recovers from such things the present generation of young people in kings port has little enough to remind us of what we stood for in manners and customs but we are not accountable for her nor for her father i believe that he is called a general his conduct at chattanooga was conspicuous for personal prudence both of them are skillful in never knowing poor people but the northerners they consort with must really be at a loss how to bestow their money of course such northerners cannot realize the difference between kings port and georgia and consequently they make much of her her features do undoubtedly possess beauty a newport woman the new kind has even taken her to worth and yet after all she has remained for john we heard a great deal of her men too she took care of that of course john mayrant actually followed her to newport but i couldnt help crying out i thought he was so poor the phosphates my hostess explained they had been discovered on his land and none of her new york men had come forward so john rushed back happy at this point a very singular look came over the face of my hostess and she continued there have been many false reports and false hopes in consequence based upon the phosphate discoveries it was i who had to break it to him what further investigation had revealed poor john he has then nothing i inquired his position in the custom house and a penny or two from his mothers fortune but the cake i now once again reminded her my hostess lifted her delicate hand and let it fall her resentment at the wouldbe intruder by marriage still mounted not even from that pair would i have believed such a thing possible she exclaimed and she went into a long low contemplative laugh looking not at me but at the fire our silent companion continued to embroider that girl my hostess resumed and her discreditable father played on my nephews youth and chivalry to the tune of well you have heard the tune you mean you mean i couldnt quite take it in yes they rattled their poverty at him until he offered and they accepted i must have stared grotesquely now that that the cake and that sort of thing at his expense my dear sir i shall be glad if you can find me anything that they have ever done at their own expense i doubt if she would ever have permitted her speech such freedom had not the rieppes been from georgia i am sure that it was anger family anger race anger which had broken forth and i think that her silent severe sister scarcely approved of such breaking forth to me a stranger but indignation had worn her reticence thin and i had happened to press upon the weak place after my burst of exclamation i came back to it so you think miss rieppe will get out of it it is my nephew who will get out of it as you express it i totally misunderstood her oh i protested stupidly he doesnt look like that and it takes all meaning from the cake do not say cake to me again said the lady smiling at last and will you allow me to tell you that i do not need to have my nephew john mayrant explained to me by any one i merely meant to say that he and not she is the person who will make the lucky escape of course he is honorable a great deal too much so for his own good it is a misfortune nowadays to be born a gentleman in america but as i told you i am not solicitous what she is counting on because she thinks she understands true kings port honor and does not in the least is his renouncing her on account of the phosphates the bad news i mean they could live on what he has not at all in her way though and besides after once offering his genuine ardent foolish love for it was genuine enough at the time john would never she stopped but i took her up did i understand you to say that his love was genuine at the lime oh he thinks it is now insists it is now that is just precisely what would make him do you not see stick to his colors all the closer goodness i murmured what a predicament but my hostess nodded easily oh no you will see they will all see i rose to take my leave my visit indeed had been for very interest prolonged beyond the limits of formality my hostess had attended quite thoroughly to my being entertained and at this point the other the more severe and elderly lady made her contribution to my entertainment she had kept silence i now felt sure because gossip was neither her habit nor to her liking possibly she may have also felt that her displeasure had been too manifest at any rate she spoke out of her silence in cold yet rich symmetrical tones this i understand is your first visit to kings port i told her that it was she laid down her exquisite embroidery it has been thought a place worth seeing there is no town of such historic interest at the north standing by my chair i assured her that i did not think there could be i heard you allude to my halfsisterinlaw mrs weguelin st michael it was at the house where she now lives that the famous miss beaufain as she was then put the earl of mainridge in his place at the reception which her father gave the english visitor in the earl conducted himself as so many englishmen seem to think they can in this country and on her asking him how he liked america he replied very well except for the people who were so vulgar what can you expect said miss beaufain were descended from the english but i suppose you will tell me that your northern beauties can easily outmatch such wit i hastened to disclaim any such pretension and having expressed my appreciation of the anecdote i moved to the door as the stately lady resumed her embroidery my hostess had a last word for me do not let the cake worry you outside the handsome old iron gate i looked at my watch and found that for this day i could spend no more time upon visiting iv the girl behind the counter i i fear no to say one fears that one has stepped aside from the narrow path of duty when one knows perfectly well that one has done so is a ridiculous halfdodging of the truth let me dismiss from my service such a cowardly circumlocution and squarely say that i neglected the cowpens during certain days which now followed nay more i totally deserted them although i feel quite sure that to discover one is a real kings descendant must bring an exultation of no mean order to the heart theres no exultation whatever in failing to discover this day after day mine is a nature which demands results or at any rate signs of results coming sooner or later even the most abandoned fisherman requires a bite now and then but my fishing for fannings had not yet brought me one single nibble and i gave up the sad sport for a while the beautiful weather took me out of doors over the land and also over the water for i am a great lover of sailing and i found a little catboat and a little negro both of which suited me very well i spent many delightful hours in their company among the deeps and shallows of these fair southern waters and indoors also i made most agreeable use of my time in spite of one disappointment when on the day following my visit to the ladies i returned full of expectancy to lunch at the womans exchange the girl behind the counter was not there i found in her stead it is true a most polite lady who provided me with chocolate and sandwiches that were just as good as their predecessors but she was of advanced years and little inclined to light conversation beyond telling me that miss eliza la heu was indisposed but not gravely so and that she was not likely to be long away from her post of duty this lady furnished me with scant information now i desired a great deal of information to learn of an imminent wedding where the bridegroom attends to the cake and is suspected of diminished eagerness for the bride who is a steel wasp that is not enough to learn of such nuptials therefore i fear i mean i know that it was not wholly for the sake of telling mrs gregory st michael about aunt carola that i repaired again to le maire street and rang mrs st michaels doorbell she was at home to be sure but with her sat another visitor the tall severe lady who had embroidered and had not liked the freedom with which her sister had spoken to me about the wedding there was not a bit of freedom today the severe lady took care of that when after some utterly unprofitable conversation i managed to say in a casual voice which i thought very well tuned for the purpose what part of georgia did you say that general rieppe came from the severe lady responded i do not think that i mentioned him at all georgia said mrs gregory st michael i never heard that they came from georgia and this revived my hopes but the severe lady at once remarked to her i have received a most agreeable letter from my sister in paris this stopped mrs gregory st michael and dashed my hopes to earth the severe lady continued to me my sister writes of witnessing a performance of the lohengrin can you tell me if it is a composition of merit i assured her that it was a composition of the highest merit it is many years since i have heard an opera she pursued in my day the works of the italians were much applauded but i doubt if mozart will be surpassed i hope you admire the nozze you will not need me to tell you that i came out of mrs gregory st michaels house little wiser than i went in my experience did not lead me to abandon all hope i paid other visits to other ladies but these answered my inquiries in much the same sort of way as had the lady who admired mozart they spoke delightfully of travel books people and of the colonial renown of kings port and its leading families but it is scarce an exaggeration to say that mozart was as near the cake the wedding or the steel wasp as i came with any of them by patience however and mostly at our boardinghouse table i gathered a certain knowledge though small in amount if the health of john mayrants mother i learned had allowed that lady to bring him up herself many follies might have been saved the youth his aunt miss eliza st michael though a pattern of good intentions was not always a pattern of wisdom moreover how should a spinster bring up a boy fitly of the rieppes father and daughter i also learned a little more they did not most people believed come from georgia natchez and mobile seemed to divide the responsibility of giving them to the world it was quite certain the general had run away from chattanooga nobody disputed this or offered any other battle as the authentic one of late the rieppes were seldom to be seen in kings port their house if it had ever been their own property which i heard hotly argued both ways had been sold more than two years ago and their recent brief sojourns in the town were generally beneath the roof of hospitable friends people by the name of cornerly whom we do not know as i was carefully informed by more than one member of the st michael family the girl had disturbed a number of mothers whose sons were prone to slip out of the strict hereditary fold in directions where beauty or champagne was to be found and the cornerlys dined late and had champagne miss hortense had splurged it a good deal here and the measure of her success with the male youth was the measure of her condemnation by their female elders such were the facts which i gathered from women and from the few men whom i saw in kings port this town seemed to me almost as empty of men as if the pied piper had passed through here and lured them magically away to some distant country it was on the happy day that saw miss eliza la heu again providing me with sandwiches and chocolate that my knowledge of the wedding and the bride and groom began really to take some steps forward it was not i who at my sequestered lunch at the womans exchange began the conversation the next time that confection lady baltimore about which i was not to worry myself had as they say broken the ice between the girl behind the counter and myself he has put it off this without any preliminaries was her direct and stimulating news i never was more grateful for the solitude of the exchange where i had before this noted and blessed an absence of lunch customers as prevailing as the trade winds the people i saw there came to talk not to purchase well i was certainly henceforth coming for both i eagerly plunged in with the obvious question indefinitely oh no only wednesday week but will it keep my ignorance diverted her lady baltimore why the idea and she laughed at me from the immense distance that the south is from the north then hell have to pay for two oh no i wasnt going to make it till tuesday i didnt suppose that kind of thing would keep i muttered rather vaguely her young spirits bubbled over which kind of thing the wedding or the cake this produced a moment of laughter on the part of us both we giggled joyously together amid the silence and wares for sale the painted cups the embroidered souvenirs the new food and the old family pieces so this delightful girl was a verbal skirmisher now nothing is more to my liking than the verbal skirmish and therefore i began one immediately i see you quite know was the first light shot that i hazarded her retort to this was merely a very bland and inquiring stare i now aimed a trifle nearer the mark about him her it since you practically live in the exchange how can you exactly help yourself her laughter came back its all you know so much later than later why a lot of it is to happen yet she leaned over the counter tell me what you know about it she said with caressing insinuation oh well but probably they mean to have your education progress chronologically i think i can pick it up anywhere we had to at the plantation it was from my table in the distant dim back of the room where things stood lumpily under mosquito netting that i told her my history she made me go there to my lunch she seemed to desire that our talk over the counter should not longer continue and so back there over my chocolate and sandwiches i brought out my gleaned and arranged knowledge which rang out across the distance comically like a lecture she at her counter now and then busy with her ledger received it with the attentive solemnity of a lecture the ledger might have been notes that she was dutifully and improvingly taking after i had finished she wrote on for a little while in silence the curly white dog rose into sight looked amiably and vaguely about stretched himself and sank to sleep again out of sight thats all she asked abruptly so far i answered and what do you think of such a young man she inquired i know what i think of such a young woman she was still pensive yes yes but then that is so simple i had a short laugh oh if you come to the simplicity she nodded seeming to be doing sums with her pencil men are always simple when theyre in love i assented and women youll agree are always simple when theyre not she finished her sums well i think hes foolish she frankly stated didnt aunt josephine think so too aunt josephine miss josephine st michael my greetaunt the lady who embroidered she brought me here from the plantation no she wouldnt talk about it but dont you think it is your turn now ive taken my turn oh not much to say you think hes foolish isnt much youve seen him since seen him since when here since the postponement i take it he came himself about it yes he came you dont suppose we discussed the reasons do you my dear young lady i suppose nothing except that you certainly must have seen how he looked he can blush you know handsomely and that you may have some knowledge or some guess some guess why its not to be until wednesday week of course he said why her poor dear father the general isnt very well that indeed must be an anxiety for johnny i remarked this led her to indulge in some more merriment but he does she then said seem anxious about something ah i exclaimed then you admit it too she resorted again to the bland inquiring stare what he wont admit i explained even to his intimate aunt because hes so honorable he certainly is simple she commented in soft and pensive tones isnt there some one i asked who could not too directly of course suggest that to him i think i prefer men to be simple she returned somewhat quickly especially when theyre in love i reminded her somewhat slowly do you want some lady baltimore today she inquired in the official exchange tone i rose obediently youre quite right i should have gone back to the battle of cowpens long ago and ill just say this since you asked me what i thought of him that if hes descended from that john mayrant who fought the serapes under paul jones he is she broke in eagerly then theres not a name in south carolina that id rather have for my own i intended that thrust to strike home but she turned it off most competently oh you mustnt accept us because of our ancestors thats how weve been accepting ourselves and only look where we are in the race ah i said as a parting attempt dont pretend youre not perfectly satisfied all of you as to where you are in the race we dont pretend anything she flashed back v the boy of the cake one is unthankful i suppose to call a day so dreary when one has lunched under the circumstances that i have attempted to indicate the bright spot ought to shine over the whole but you havent an idea what a nightmare in the daytime cowpens was beginning to be i had thumbed and scanned hundreds of ancient pages some of them manuscript i had sat by ancient shelves upon hard chairs i had sneezed with the ancient dust and i had not put my finger upon a trace of the right fanning i should have given it up left unexplored the territory that remained staring at me through the backs of unread volumes had it not been for my aunt carola to her i owed constancy and diligence and so i kept at it and the hermit hours i spent at court and chancel streets grew worse as i knew better what rarely good company was ready to receive me this kings port this little city of oblivion held shut in with its lavender and pressedrose memories a handful of people who were like that great society of the world the high society of distinguished men and women who exist no more but who touched history with a light hand and left their mark upon it in a host of memoirs and letters that we read today with a starved and homesick longing in the midst of our sullen welter of democracy with its silent houses and gardens its silent streets its silent vistas of the blue water in the sunshine this beautiful sad place was winning my heart and making it ache nowhere else in america such charm such character such true elegance as here and nowhere else such an overwhelming sense of finality the doom of a civilization founded upon a crime and yet how much has the ballot done for that race or at least how much has the ballot done for the majority of that race and what way was it to meet this problem with the sudden sweeping folly of the fifteenth amendment to fling the door of hope wide open before those within had learned the first steps of how to walk sagely through it ah if it comes to blame who goes scatheless in this heritage of error i could have shaped we all could you know a better scheme for the universe a plan where we should not flourish at each others expense where the lion should be lying down with the lamb now where good and evil should not be husband and wife indissolubly married by a law of creation with such highly novel thoughts as these i descended the steps from my researches at the corner of court and chancel streets an hour earlier than my custom because well i couldnt that day stand cowpens for another minute up at the corner of court and worship the people were going decently into church it was a sweet gentle late friday in lent i had intended keeping outofdoors to smell the roses in the gardens to bask in the soft remnant of sunshine to loiter and peep in through the kings port garden gates up the silent walks to the silent verandas but the slow stream of people took me instead into church with the deeply veiled ladies of kings port hushed in their perpetual mourning for not only i think those husbands and brothers and sons whom the war had turned to dust forty years ago but also for the cause the lost cause that died with them i sat there among these christians suckled in a creed outworn envying them their wellregulated faith it too was part of the towns repose and sweetness together with the oldfashioned roses and the oldfashioned ladies men also were in the congregation not many to be sure but all unanimously wearing that expression of remarkable virtue which seems always to visit when he goes to church the average good fellow who is no better than he should be i became myself filled with this same decorous inconsistency and was singing the hymn when i caught sight of john mayrant what lady was he with it was just this that most annoyingly i couldnt make out because the unlucky disposition of things hid it i caught myself craning my neck and singing the hymn simultaneously and with no difficulty because all my childhood was in that hymn i couldnt tell when i hadnt known words and music by heart who was she i tried for a clear view when we sat down and also let me confess when we knelt down i saw even less of her so and my hope at the end of the service was dashed by her slow but entire disappearance amid the engulfing exits of the other ladies i followed where i imagined she had gone out by a side door into the beautiful graveyard but among the flowers and monuments she was not nor was he and next i saw through the iron gate john mayrant in the street walking with his intimate aunt and her more severe sister and miss la heu i somewhat superfluously hastened to the gate and greeted them to which they responded with polite masterly discouragement he however after taking off his hat to them turned back and i watched them pursuing their leisurely reticent course toward the south place why should the old ladies strike me as looking like a tremendously proper pair of conspirators i was wondering this as i turned back among the tombs when i perceived john mayrant coming along one of the churchyard paths his approach was made at right angles with that of another personage the respectful negro custodian of the place this dignitary was evidently hoping to lead me among the monuments recite to me their old histories and benefit by my consequent gratitude he had even got so far as smiling and removing his hat when john mayrant stopped him the young man hailed the negro by his first name with that particular and affectionate superiority which few northerners can understand and none can acquire and which resembles nothing so much as the way in which you speak to your old dog who has loved you and followed you because you have cared for him not this time john mayrant said i wish to show our relics to this gentleman myself if he will permit me this last was a question put to me with a courteous formality a formality which a few minutes more were to see smashed to smithereens i told him that i should consider myself undeservedly privileged some of these people are my people he said beginning to move the old custodian stood smiling familiar respectful disappointed some of em my people too mas john he cannily observed i put a little silver in his hand didnt i see a box somewhere i said with something on it about the restoration of the church something on it but nothing in it exclaimed mayrant at which moderate pleasantry the custodian broke into extreme african merriment and ambled away you neednt have done it protested the southerner and i naturally claimed my strangers right to pay my respects in this manner such was our introduction agreeable and unusual a silence then unexpectedly ensued and the formality fell colder than ever upon us the custodians departure had left us alone looking at each other across all the unexpressed knowledge that each knew the other had mayrant had come impulsively back to me from his aunts without stopping to think that we had never yet exchanged a word both of us were now brought up short and it was the cake that was speaking volubly in our selfconscious dumbness it was only after this brief deep gap of things unsaid that john mayrant came to the surface again and began a conversation of which on both our parts the first few steps were taken on the tiptoes of an archaic politeness we trod convention like a polished french floor you might have expected us after such deliberate and graceful preliminaries to dance a verbal minuet we however danced something quite different and that conversation lasted during many days and led us like a road up hill and down dale to a perfect acquaintance no not perfect but delightful to the end he never spoke to me of the matter most near him and i but honor him the more for his reticence of course his first remark had to be about kings port and me had he understood rightly that this was my first visit my answer was equally traditional it was next correct that he should allude to the weather and his reference was one of the two or three that it seems a strangers destiny always to hear in a place new to him he apologized for the weather so cold a season had not in his memory been experienced in kings port it was to the highest point exceptional i exclaimed that it had been to my northern notions delightfully mild for march indeed i continued i have always said that if march could be cut out of our northern climate as the core is cut out of an apple i should be quite satisfied with eleven months instead of twelve i think it might prolong ones youth the fire of that season lighted in his eyes but he still stepped upon polished convention he assured me that the southern september hurricane was more deplorable than any northern march could be our zone should be called the intemperate zone said he but never in kings port i protested with your roses outofdoors and your ladies indoors he bowed you pay us a high compliment i smiled urbanely if the truth is a compliment our young ladies are roses he now admitted with a delicate touch of pride dont forget your old ones i never shall there was pleasure in his face at this tribute which he could see came from the heart but thus pictured to him the old ladies brought a further idea quite plainly into his expression and he announced it some of them are not without thorns what would you give i quickly replied for anybody man or woman who could not on an occasion make themselves sharply felt to this he returned a full but somewhat absentminded assent he seemed to be reflecting that he himself didnt care to be the occasion upon which an old lady rose should try her thorns and i was inclined to suspect that his intimate aunt had been giving him a wigging anyhow i stood ready to keep it up this interchange of lofty civilities i too could wear the courtly redheels of eighteenthcentury procedure and for just as long as his southern upbringing inclined him to wear them i hadnt known aunt carola for nothing but we as i have said were not destined to dance any minuet we had been moving very gradually and without any attention to our surroundings to and fro in the beautiful sweet churchyard flowers were everywhere growing budding blooming color and perfume were parts of the very air and beneath these pretty and ancient tombs graven with old dates and honorable names slept the men and women who had given kings port her high place is in our history i have never in this country seen any churchyard comparable to this one happy serene dead to sleep amid such blossoms and consecration good taste prevailed here distinguished men lay beneath memorial stones that came no higher than your waist or shoulder there was a total absence of obscure grocers reposing under gigantic obelisks to earn a monument here you must win a battle or do at any rate something more than adulterate sugar and oil the particular monument by which young john mayrant and i found ourselves standing when we reached the point about the ladies and the thorns had a look of importance and it caught his eye bringing him back to where we were upon his pointing to it and before we had spoken or i had seen the name i inquired eagerly not the lieutenant of the bon homme richard and then saw that mayrant was not the name upon it my knowledge of his gallant seafighting namesake visibly gratified him i wish it were he said but i am descended from this man too he was a statesman and some of his brilliant powers were inherited by his children but they have not come so far down as me in his daughter miss beaufain i laid my hand right on his shoulder dont you do it john mayrant i cried dont you tell me that last night i caught myself saying that instead of my prayers well it killed the minuet dead he sat flat down on the low stone coping that bordered the path to which we had wandered back and i sat flat down opposite him the venerable custodian passing along a neighboring path turned his head and stared at our noise lawd see those chillun goin on he muttered mas john dont you get too scandalous tellin strangers bout the old famblies mayrant pointed to me hes responsible daddy ben im being just as good as gold honest injun the custodian marched slowly on his way shaking his head mas john he do go on he repeated his office was not alone the care and the showing off of the graveyard but another duty too as native and peculiar to the soil as the very cotton and the rice this loyal servitor cherished the honor of the old famblies and chide their young descendants whenever he considered that they needed it mayrant now sat revived after his collapse of mirth and he addressed me from his gravestone yes i ought to have foreseen it foreseen i didnt at once catch the inference all my aunts and cousins have been talking to you oh miss beaufain and the earl of mainridge well but its quite worth knowing by heart he broke in with new merriment i kept on why not they tell those things everywhere where theyre so lucky as to possess them its a flawless specimen of repartee he spoke with increasing pauses yes we do at least possess that and some wine of about the same date and even considerably older all the better for age i exclaimed but the blue eyes of mayrant were far away and full of shadow poor kings port he said very slowly and quietly then he looked at me with the steady look and the smile that one sometimes has when giving voice to a sorrowful conviction against which one has tried to struggle poor kings port he affectionately repeated his hand tapped lightly two or three times upon the gravestone upon which he was seated be honest and say that you think so too he demanded always with his smile but how was i to agree aloud with what his silent hand had expressed those inaudible taps on the stone spoke clearly enough they said here lies kings port here lives kings port outside of this is our true death on the vacant wharves in the empty streets all that we have left is the immortality which these historic names have won how could i tell him that i thought so too nor was i as sure of it then as he was and besides this was a young man whose spirit was almost surely in suffering ill fortune both material and of the heart i seemed to suspect had made him wounded and bitter in these immediate days and the very suppression he was exercising hurt him the more deeply so i replied honestly as he had asked i hope you are mistaken thats because you havent been here long enough he declared over us gently from somewhere across the gardens and the walls came a noiseless water breeze to which the roses moved and nodded among the tombs they gave him a fanciful thought look at them they belong to us and they know it theyre saying yes yes yes all day long i dont know why on earth im talking in this way to you he broke off with vivacity but you made me laugh so vi in the churchyard then it was a good laugh indeed i cried heartily oh dont lets go back to our fine manners he begged comically weve satisfied each other that we have them i feel so lonely and my aunt just now well never mind about that but you really must excuse us about miss beaufain and all that sort of thing i see it because im of the new generation since the war and well ive been to other places too but aunt eliza and all of them you know cant see it and i wouldnt have them either so i dont ever attempt to explain to them that the world has to go on theyd say we dont see the necessity when slavery stopped they stopped you see just like a clock their hand points to it has never moved a minute since and some day his voice grew suddenly tender theyll go one by one to join the still older ones and i shall miss them very much for a moment i did not speak but watched the roses nodding and moving then i said may i say that i shall miss them too he looked at me miss our old kings port people he didnt invite outsiders to do that dont you see how it is i murmured it was the same thing once with us the same thing in the north his tone still held me off the same sort of dear old people i mean charming peppery refined courageous people in salem in boston in new york in every place that has been colonial and has taken a hand in the game and as certain beloved memories of men and women rose in my mind i continued if you knew some of the boston elder people as i have known them you would warm with the same admiration that is filling me as i see your people of kings port but politics the young southerner slowly suggested oh hang slavery hang the war i exclaimed of course we had a family quarrel but we were a family once and a fine one too we knew each other we visited each other we wrote letters sent presents kept up relations we in short coherently joined hands from one generation to another the fibres of the sons tingled with the current from their fathers back and back to the old beginnings to plymouth and roanoke and rip van winkle its all gone all done all over you have to be a small wellknit country for that sort of exquisite personal unitedness theres nothing united about these states any more except standard oil and discontent were no longer a small people living and dying for a great idea were a big people living and dying for money and these ladies of yours well they have made me homesick for a national and a social past which i never saw but which my old people knew theyre like legends still living still warm and with us in their quiet cleancut faces i seem to see a reflection of the old serene candlelight we all once talked and danced in sconces tall mirrors candles burning inside glass globes to keep them from the moths and the draft that of a warm evening blew in through handsome mahogany doors the good bright silver the portraits by copley and gilbert stuart a young girl at a square piano singing moores melodies and mr pinckney or commodore perry perhaps dropping in for a hot supper john mayrant was smiling and looking at the graves yes thats it thats all it he mused you do understand but i had to finish my flight such quiet faces are gone now in the breathless competing north ground into oblivion between the clashing trades of the competing men and the clashing jewels and chandeliers of their competing wives while yours have lingered on spared by your very adversity and thats why i shall miss your old people when they follow mine because theyre the last of their kind the end of the chain the bold original stock the great race that made our glory grow and saw that it did grow through thick and thin the good old native blood of independence i spoke as a man can always speak when he means it and my listeners face showed that my words had gone where meant words always go home to the heart but he merely nodded at me his nod however telling as it did of a quickly established accord between us caused me to bring out to this new acquaintance still more of those thoughts which i condescend to expose to very few old ones havent you noticed i said or dont you feel it away down here in your untainted isolation the change the great change that has come over the american people he wasnt sure theyve lost their grip on patriotism he smiled we did that here in oh no you left the union but you loved what you considered was your country and you love it still thats just my point just my strange discovery in kings port you retain the thing weve lost our big men fifty years ago thought of the country and what they could make it our big men today think of the country and what they can make out of it rather different dont you see when i walk about in the north i merely meet members of trusts or unions according to the length of the individuals purse when i walk about in kings port i meet americans of course i added taking myself up thats too sweeping a statement the right sort of american isnt extinct in the north by any means but theres such a commercial deluge of the wrong sort that the others sometimes seem to me sadly like a drop in the bucket you certainly understand it all john mayrant repeated its amazing to find you saying things that i have thought were my own private notions i laughed oh i fancy there are more than two of us in the country even the square piano and mr pinckney he went on i didnt suppose anybody had thought things like that except myself oh i again said lightly any american any that is of the world who has a colonial background for his family has thought probably very much the same sort of things of course it would be all greek or gibberish to the new people he took me up with animation the new people my goodness sir yes have you seen them have you seen newport for instance his diction now and i was to learn it was always in him a sign of heightening intensity grew more and more like the formal speech of his ancestors you have seen newport he said yes now and then but lately sir i knew we were behind the times down here sir but i had not imagined how much not by any means kings port has a long road to go before she will consider marriage provincial and chastity obsolete dear me mr mayrant well i must tell you that its not all quite so so advanced as that you know thats not the whole of newport he hastened to explain certainly not sir i would not insult the honorable families whom i had the pleasure to meet there and to whom my name was known because they had retained their good position since the days when my greatuncle had a house and drove four horses there himself i noticed three kinds of newport sir three yes because i took letters and some of the letters were to people who who once had been you know it was sad to see the thing sir so plain against the glaring proximity of the other thing and so you can divide newport into those who leave to sell their old family pictures those who have to buy their old family pictures and the lucky few who need neither buy nor sell who are neither goin down nor bobbing up but who have kept their heads above the american tidal wave from the beginning and continue to do so and i dont believe that there are any nicer people in the world than those nowhere i exclaimed when near york does her best whats better if only those best set the pace if only he assented but its the others who get into the papers who dine the drunken dukes and make poor chambermaids envious a thousand miles inland there should be a high tariff on drunken dukes i said youll never get it he declared its the republican party whose daughters marry them i rocked with enjoyment where i sat he was so refreshing and i agreed with him so well youre every bit as good as miss beaufain i cried oh no oh no but i often think if we could only deport the negroes and newport together to one of our distant islands how happily our two chief problems would be solved i still rocked newport would indeed enjoy your plan for it do go on i entreated him but he had for the moment ceased and i rose to stretch my legs and saunter among the old headstones and the wafted fragrance his aunt or his cousin or whichever of them it had been was certainly right as to his inheriting a pleasant and pointed gift of speech and a responsive audience helps us all such an audience i certainly was for young john mayrant yet beneath the animation that our talk had filled his eyes with lay i seemed to see or feel that other mood all the time the mood which had caused the girl behind the counter to say to me that he was anxious about something the unhappy youth i was gradually to learn was much more than that he was in a tangle of anxieties he talked to me as a sick man turns in bed from pain the pain goes on but the pillow for a while is cool here there broke upon us a little interruption so diverting so utterly like the whole quaint tininess of kings port that i should tell it to you even if it did not bear directly upon the matter which was beginning so actively to concern me the love difficulties of john mayrant it was the lettercarrier we had come from our secluded seats round a corner and so by the vestry door and down the walk beside the church and as i read to myself the initials upon the stones wherewith the walk was paved i drew near the halfopen gateway upon worship street the postman was descending the steps of the postoffice opposite he saw me through the gate and paused he knew me too my face easily marked out amid the resident faces he was familiar with had at once caught his attention very likely he too had by now learned that i was interested in the battle of cowpens but i did not ask him this he crossed over and handed me a letter no use he said most politely takin it away down to mistress trevises when youre right here sir northern mail eight hours late today he added and bowing was gone upon his route my home letter from a man an intimate running mate of mine soon had my full attention for on the second page it said i have just got back from accompanying her to baltimore one of us went as far as washington with her on the train we gave her a dinner yesterday at the march hare by way of farewell she tried our new toboggan fireescape on a bet clean from the attic my boy i imagine our native girls will rejoice at her departure however nobodys engaged to her at least nobody here how many may fancy themselves so elsewhere i cant say her name is hortense rieppe i suppose i must have been silent after finishing this letter no bad news i trust john mayrant inquired i told him no and presently we had resumed our seats in the quiet charm of the flowers i now spoke with an intention what a lot you seem to have seen and suffered of the advanced newport the intention wrought its due and immediate effect yes there was no choice i had gone to newport upon upon an urgent matter which took me among those people he dwelt upon the pictures that came up in his mind but he took me away again from the urgent matter i saw he resumed more briskly fifteen or twenty most amazing sir young men some of them not any older than i am who had so many millions that they could easily he paused casting about for some expression adequate could buy kings port and put it under a glass case in a museum my aunts and all and never know it he livened with disrespectful mirth over his own picture of his aunts purchased by millionaire steel or coal for the purposes of public edification and a very good thing if they could be i declared he wondered a moment my aunts under a glass case yes indeed and with all deference be it said theyd be more invaluable more instructive than the classics of a thousand libraries he was prepared not to be pleased may i ask to whom and for what why you ought to see youve just been saying it yourself they would teach our bulging automobilists our unlicked boy cubs our alcoholic girls who shout to waiters for highballs on country club porches they would teach these wallowing creatures whose money has merely gilded their bristles what american refinement once was the manners weve lost the decencies weve banished the standards weve lowered their light is still flickering in this passing generation of yours its the last torch thats why i wish it could somehow pass on the sacred fire he shook his head they dont want the sacred fire they want the highballs and they have money enough to be drunk straight through the next world he was thoughtful they are the classics he added i didnt see that he had gone back to my word roman empire you mean no the others the old people were bidding goodby to roman republic simple lives gallant deeds and one great uniting inspiration liberty winning her spurs they were moulded under that and they are our true american classics nothing like them will happen again perhaps i suggested our generation is uneasily living in a bad quarterofanhour good old childhood gone good new manhood not yet come and a state of chickenpox between whiles and on this i made to him a muchused and consoling quotation about the old order changing who says that he inquired and upon my telling him i hope so he said i hope so but just now uncle sam aspires to descend i laughed at his counterquotation you know your classics if you dont know tennyson he too laughed dont tell aunt eliza tell her what that i didnt recognize tennyson my aunt eliza educated me and she thinks tennyson about the only poet worth reading since well since byron and sir walter at the very latest neither she nor sir walter come down to modern poetry or to alcoholic girls his tone on these last words changed again as when he had said an urgent matter i seemed to feel hovering above us what must be his ceaseless preoccupation and i wondered if he had found upon visiting newport miss hortense sitting and calling for highballs i gave him a lead the worst of it is that a girl who would like to behave herself decently finds that propriety puts her out of the running the men flock off to the other kind he was following me with watching eyes and you know i continued what an anxious newport parent does on finding her girl on the brink of being a failure i can imagine he answered that she scolds her like the dickens oh nothing so ineffectual she makes her keep up with the others you know makes her do things shed rather not do highballs you mean anything my friend anything to keep up he had a comic suggestion driven to drink by her mother well its at any rate a new cause for old effects he paused it seemed strangely to bring to him some sort of relief that would explain a great deal he said was he thus explaining to himself his ladylove or rather certain newport aspects of her which had so to speak jarred upon his kings port notions of what a lady might properly do i sat on my gravestone with my wonder and my nowdawning desire to help him if improbably i could to get him out of it if he were really in it and he sat on his gravestone opposite with the path between us and the little noiseless breeze rustling the white irises and bearing hither and thither the soft perfume of the roses his boy face lean highstrung brooding was full of suppressed contentions i made myself during our silence state his possible problem he doesnt love her any more he wont admit this to himself he intends to go through with it and hes catching at any justification of what he has seen in her that has chilled him so that he may poor wretch coax back his lost illusion well if that was it what in the world could i or anybody do about it his next remark was transparent enough do you approve of young ladies smoking i met his question with another what reasons can be urged against it he was quick then you dont mind it there was actual hope in the way he rushed at this i laughed i didnt say i didnt mind it as a matter of fact i do mind it but it seemed best not to say so to him he fell off again i certainly saw very nice people doing it up there i filled this out youll see very nice people doing it everywhere not in kings port at least not my sort of people he stiffly proclaimed this i tried to draw him out but is there after all any valid objection to it but he was off on a preceding speculation a mother or any parent he said might encourage the daughter to smoke too and the girl might take it up so as not to be thought peculiar where she was and then she might drop it very gladly i became specific drop it you mean when she came to a place where doing it would be thought well in bad style or for the better reason he answered that she didnt really like it herself how much you dont really like it yourself i remarked this time he was slow well well why need they are not their lips more innocent than ours is not the association somewhat my dear fellow i interrupted the association is i think youll have to agree scarcely of my making thats true enough he laughed and as you say very nice people do it everywhere but not here have you ever noticed he now inquired with continued transparency how much harder they are on each other than we are on them oh yes ive noticed that i surmised it was this sort of thing he had earlier choked himself off from telling me in his unfinished complaint about his aunt but i was to learn later that on this occasion it was upon the poor boy himself and not on the smoking habits of miss rieppe that his aunt had heavily descended i also reflected that if cigarettes were the only thing he deprecated in the lady of his choice the lost illusion might be coaxed back the trouble was that deprecated something fairly distant from cigarettes the cake was my quite sufficient trouble it stuck in my throat worse than the probably magnified gossip i had heard this for the present i could manage to swallow he came out now with a personal note i suppose you think im a ninny never in the wildest dream well but too innocent for a man anyhow that would be an insult i declared laughingly for im not innocent in the least youll find were all men here just as much as any men in the north you could pick out south carolina has never lacked sporting blood sir but in newport well sir we gentlemen down here when we wish a certain atmosphere and all that have always been accustomed to seek the demimonde so it was with us until the women changed it the women sir he was innocent the ladies as you southerners so chivalrously continue to style them the rich new fashionable ladies became so desperate in their competition for mens allegiance that they well some of them would in the point of conversation greatly scandalize the smart demimonde he nodded yes i heard men say things in drawingrooms to ladies that a gentleman here would have been taken out and shot for and dont you agree with me sir that good taste itself should be a sort of religion i dont mean to say anything sacrilegious but it seems to me that even if one has ceased to believe some parts of the bible even if one does not always obey the ten commandments one is bound not as a believer but as a gentleman to remember the difference between grossness and refinement between excess and restraint that one can have and keep just as the pagan greeks did a moral elegance he astonished me this ardent ideal troubled boy so innocent regarding the glaring facts of our new prosperity so finely penetrating as to some of the mysteries of the soul but he was of old huguenot blood and of careful and gentle upbringing and it was delightful to find such a young man left upon our american soil untainted by the present fashionable idolatries i bow to your creed of moral elegance i cried it never dies it has outlasted all the mobs and all the religions they seemed to think he continued pursuing his newport train of thought that to prove you were a dead game sport you must behave like behave like like a herd of swine i suggested he was merry ah if they only would completely completely what behave so rush over a steep place into the sea we sat in the quiet relish of his scriptural idea and the western crimson and the twilight began to come and mingle with the perfumes john mayrants face changed from its vivacity to a sort of pensive wistfulness which for all the dash and spirit in his delicate features was somehow the final thing one got from the boys expression it was as though the noble memories of his race looked out of his eyes seeking new chances for distinction and found instead a soil laid waste an empty fatherland a people benumbed past rousing had he not said poor kings port as he tapped the gravestone moral elegance could scarcely permit a sigh more direct i am glad that you believe it never dies he resumed and i am glad to find somebody to talk to you know my friends here are everything friends and gentlemen should be but they dont i suppose its because they have not had my special experiences i sat waiting for the boy to go on with it how plainly he was telling me of his special experiences he and his creed were not merely in revolt against the herd of swine there would be nothing special in that i had met people before who were that but he was tied by honor and soon to be tied by the formidable nuptial knot to a specimen devotee of the cult he shouldnt marry her if he really did not want to and i could stop it but how was i to begin spinning the first faint web of plan how i might stop it unless he came right out with the whole thing i didnt believe he was the man to do that ever even under the loosening inspiration of drink in wine lies truth no doubt but within him was not moral elegance the bottom truth that would even in his cups keep him a gentleman and control all such revelations he might smash the glasses but he would not speak of his misgivings as to hortense rieppe he began again nor do i believe that a really nice girl would continue to think as those few do if she once got safe away from them why my dear sir he stretched out his hand in emphasis you do not have to do anything untimely and extreme if you are in good earnest a dead game sport the time comes and you meet the occasion as the duck swims there was one of them the right kind where i asked why youre leaning against her headstone the little incongruity made us both laugh but it was only for the instant the tender mood of the evening and all that we had said sustained the quiet and almost grave undertone of our conference my own quite unconscious act of rising from the grave and standing before him on the path to listen brought back to us our harmonious pensiveness she was born in kings port but educated in europe i dont suppose until the time came that she ever did anything harder than speak french or play the piano or ride a horse she had wealth and so had her husband he was killed in the war and so were two of her sons the third was too young to go their fortune was swept away but the plantation was there and the negroes were proud to remain faithful to the family she took hold of the plantation she walked the ricebanks in high boots she had an overseer who it was told her would possibly take her life by poison or by violence she nevertheless lived in that lonely spot with no protector except her pistol and some directions about antidotes she dismissed him when she had proved he was cheating her she made the planting pay as well as any man did after the war she educated her last son got him into the navy and then one evening walking the riverbanks too late she caught the fever and died you will understand she went with one step from cherished ease to singlehanded battle with life a delicately nurtured lady with no preparation for her trials except moral elegance i murmured ah that was the point sir to see her you would never have guessed it she kept her burdens from the sight of all she wore tribulation as if it were a flower in her bosom we children always looked forward to her coming because she was so gay and delightful to us telling us stories of the old times old rides when the country was wild old journeys with the family and servants to the hot springs before the steam cars were invented old adventures with the battle of new orleans or a famous duel in them the sort of stories that begin with for you seem to know something of it yourself sir your grandfather my dear john the year that he was twenty got himself into serious embarrassments through paying his attentions to two reigning beauties at once she was full of stories which began in that sort of pleasant way i said when a person like that dies an impoverishment falls upon us the texture of life seems thinner oh yes indeed i know what you mean to lose the people one has always seen from the cradle well she has gone away she has taken her memories out of the world the old times the old stories nobody except a little nutshell of people here knows or cares anything about her any more and soon even the nutshell will be empty he paused and then as if brushing aside his churchyard mood he translated into his changed thought another classic quotation but we cant dawdle over the tears of things its natures law only when i think of the ricebanks and the boots and the pistol i wonder if the newport ladies for all their highballs could do any better the crimson had faded the twilight was altogether come but the little noiseless breeze was blowing still and as we left the quiet tombs behind us and gained worship street i could not help looking back where slept that older kings port about which i had heard and had said so much over the graves i saw the roses nodding and moving as if in acquiescent revery vii the girl behind the counter ii which of them is idealizing this was the question that i asked myself next morning in my boardinghouse as i dressed for breakfast the next morning is at least i have always found it so an excellent time for searching questions and today i had waked up no longer beneath the strong gentle spell of the churchyard a bright sun was shining over the eastern waters of the town i could see from my upper veranda the thousand flashes of the waves the steam yacht rode placidly and competently among them while a coastwise steamer was sailing by her out to sea to savannah or new york the general world was going on and which of them was idealizing it mightnt be so bad after all hadnt i perhaps oversentimentalized to myself the case of john mayrant hadnt i imagined for him ever so much more anxiety than the boy actually felt for people can idealize down just as readily as they can idealize up of miss hortense rieppe i had now two partial portraits one by the displeased aunts the other by their chivalric nephew in both she held between her experienced lips a cigarette there the similarity ceased and then there was the toboggan fireescape well i must meet the living original before i could decide whether for me at any rate she was the brute as seen by the eyes of mrs gregory st michael or the really nice girl who was going to marry john mayrant on wednesday week just at this point my thoughts brought up hard again at the cake no i couldnt swallow that any better this morning than yesterday afternoon allow the gentleman to pay for the feast better to have omitted all feast nothing simpler and it would have been at least dignified even if arid but then there was the lady a cousin or an aunt i couldnt remember which this morning who had told me she wasnt solicitous what did she mean by that and she had looked quite queer when she spoke about the phosphates oh yes to be sure she was his intimate aunt where by the way was miss rieppe by the time i had eaten my breakfast and walked up worship street to the postoffice i was full of it all again my searching thoughts hadnt simplified a single point i always called for my mail at the postoffice because i got it sooner it didnt come to the boardinghouse before i had departed on my quest for royal blood whereas this way i simply got my letters at the corner of court and worship streets and walked diagonally across and down court a few steps to my researches which i could vary and alleviate by reading and answering news from home it was from aunt carola that i heard today only a little of what she said will interest you there had been a delightful meeting of the selected salic scions the baltimore chapter had paid her chapter a visit three ladies and one very highly connected young gentleman had come an encouragingly full and enthusiastic meeting they had lunched upon cocoa sherry and croquettes after which all had been more than glad to listen to a paper read by a descendant of edward the third and the young gentleman a descendant of catherne of aragon had recited a beautiful original poem entitled my queen grandmother aunt carola regretted that i could not have had the pleasure and the benefit of this meeting the young gentleman had turned out to be also a refined and tasteful musician playing upon the piano a favorite gavotte of louis the thirteenth and while you are in kings port my aunt said i expect you to profit by associating with the survivors of our good american society people such as one could once meet everywhere when i was young but who have been destroyed by the invasion of the proletariat you are in the last citadel of goodbreeding by the way find out if you can if any of the bombo connection are extant as through them i should like if possible to establish a chapter of the scions in south carolina have you met a miss rieppe a decidedly striking young woman who says she is from kings port and who recently passed through here with a very common man dancing attendance on her he owns the hermana and she is said to be engaged to him this wasnt as good as meeting miss rieppe myself but the new angle at which i got her from my aunt was distinctly a contribution toward the young womans likeness i felt that i should know her at sight if ever she came within seeing distance and it would be entertaining to find that she was a bombo but that could wait what couldnt wait was the hermana i postponed the fannings hurried by the door where they waited for me and coming to the end of court street turned to the right and sought among the wharves the nearest vista that could give me a view of the harbor between the silent walls of commerce desolated and by the empty windows from which prosperity once looked out i threaded my way to a point upon the towns eastern edge yes that was the steam yachts name the hermana i didnt make it out myself she lay a trifle too far from shore but i could read from a little fluttering pennant that her owner was not on board and from the second loafer whom i questioned i learned besides her name that she had come from new york here to meet her owner whose name he did not know and whose arrival was still indefinite this was not very much to find out but it was so much more than i had found out about the fannings that although i now faithfully returned to my researches and sat over open books until noon i couldnt tell you a word of what i read where was miss rieppe and where was the owner of the hermana also precisely how ill was the hero of chattanooga her poor dear father at the exchange i opened the door upon a conversation which in consequence broke off abruptly but this much i came in for nothing but the slightest bruise above his eye the other one is in bed it was the severe lady who said this i mean that lady who among all the severe ones i had met seemed capable of the highest exercise of this quality although she had not exercised it in my presence she looked in her veil and her black street dress as aloof and as coldly scornful of the present day as she had seemed when sitting over her embroidery but it was not of or even that she had been talking just now it was this morning that somebody was bruised somebody was in bed the handsome lady acknowledged my salutation completely but not encouragingly and then on the threshold exchanged these parting sentences with the girl behind the counter they will have to shake hands he was not very willing but he listened to me of course the chastisement was right but it does not affect my opinion of his keeping on with the position no indeed aunt josephine the girl agreed i wish he wouldnt did you say it was his right eye his left miss josephine st michael inclined her head once more to me and went out of the exchange i retired to my usual table and the girl read in my manner quite correctly the feelings which i had not supposed i had allowed to be evident she said aunt josephine always makes strangers think shes displeased with them i replied like the young ass which i constantly tell myself i have ceased to be oh displeasure is as much notice as one is entitled to from miss st michael the girl laughed with her delightful sweet mockery i declare youre huffed now dont tell me youre not but you mustnt be when you know her youll know that that awful manner means aunt josephine is just being shy why even im not afraid of her george washington glances any more very well i laughed ill try to have your courage over my chocolate and sandwiches i sat in curiosity discreditable but natural who was in bed who would have to shake hands and why had they stopped talking when i came in of course i found myself hoping that john mayrant had put the owner of the hermana in bed at the slight cost of a bruise above his left eye i wondered if the cake was again countermanded and i started upon that line i think ill have today if you please another slice of that lady baltimore and i made ready for another verbal skirmish im so sorry its a little stale today you can have the last slice if you wish thank you i will she brought it its not so very stale i said how long since it has been made oh its the same youve been having youre its only patron just now well no theres mr mayrant not for a week yet you remember so the wedding was on yet still john might have smashed the owner of the hermana have you seen him lately i asked there was something special in the way she looked not today have you never in the forenoon he has his duties and i have mine she made a little pause and then what do you think of the president the president i was at a loss but im afraid you would take his view the northern view she mused it gave me suddenly her meaning oh the president of the united states how you do change the subject her eyes were upon me burning with sectional indignation but she seemed to be thinking too much to speak now here was a topic that i had avoided and she had plumped it at me very well she should have my view if you mean that a gentleman cannot invite any respectable member of any race he pleases to dine privately in his house his house she was glowing now with it i think he is i think he is to have one of them and even if he likes it not to remember cannot speak about him she wound up i should say unbecoming things she had walked out during these words from behind the counter and as she stood there in the middle of the long room you might have thought she was about to lead a cavalry charge then admirably she put it all under and spoke on with perfect selfcontrol why cant somebody explain it to him if i knew him i would go to him myself and i would say mr president we need not discuss our different tastes as to dinner company nor need we discuss how much you benefit the colored race by an act which makes every member of it immediately think that he is fit to dine with any king in the world but you are staying in a house which is partly our house ours the souths for we too pay taxes you know and since you also know our deep feeling you may even call it a prejudice if it so pleases you do you not think that so long as you are residing in that house you should not gratuitously shock our deep feeling she swept a magnificent low curtsy at the air by jove miss la heu i exclaimed you put it so that its rather hard to answer im glad it strikes you so but did it make them all think they were going to dine hundreds of thousands it was proof to them that they were as good as anybody just as good without reading or writing or anything the very next day some of the laziest and dirtiest where we live had a new strut like the monkey when you put a red flannel cap on him only the monkey doesnt push ladies off the sidewalk and that state of mind you know said miss la heu softening down from wrath to her roguish laugh isnt the right state of mind for racial progress but i wasnt thinking of this you know he has appointed one of them to office here a light entered my brain john mayrant had a position at the custom house john mayrant was subordinate to the presidents appointee she hadnt changed the subject so violently after all i came squarely at it and so you wish him to resign his position but i was ahead of her this time the chief of customs she wonderingly murmured i brought her up with me now did miss josephine st michael say it was over his left eye the girl instantly looked everything she thought i believe you were present this was her highly comprehensive exclamation accompanied also by a blush as splendidly young as john mayrant had been while he so stammeringly brought out his wishes concerning the cake i at once decided to deceive her utterly and therefore i spoke the exact truth no i wasnt present they did their work my true words the false impression flowed out of them as smoothly as california claret from a french bottle i wonder who told you my victim remarked but it doesnt really matter everybody is bound to know it you surely were the last person with him in the churchyard gracious i admitted again with splendidly mendacious veracity how we do find each other out in kings port it was not by any means the least of the delights which i took in the company of this charming girl that sometimes she was too much for me and sometimes i was too much for her it was of course just the accident of our ages in a very few years she would catch up would pass would always be too much for me well today it was happily my turn i wasnt going to finish lunch without knowing all she at any rate could tell me about the left eye and the man in bed forty years ago i now with ingenuity remarked i suppose it would have been pistols she assented and i like that better dont you for gentlemen well you mean that fists are yes she finished for me all the same i maintained dont you think that there ought to be some correspondence some proportion between the gravity of the cause and the gravity of let the coalheavers take to their fists she scornfully cried people of our class cant descend well but i interrupted then you give the coalheavers the palm for discrimination hows that why perfectly your coalheaver kills for some offenses while for lighter ones he gets a bruise over the left eye you dont meet it you dont meet it what is an insult ever but an insult oh we in the north notice certain degrees insolence impudence impertinence liberties rudeness all different she took up my phrase with a sudden odd quietness you in the north why yes we have alas to expect and allow for rudeness sometimes even in our chosen few and for liberties in their chosen few its only the hotel clerk and the head waiter from whom we usually get impudence while insolence is the chronic condition of the wall street rich you in the north she repeated and so your northern eyes cant see it after all at these words my intelligence sailed into a great blank while she continued frankly and forgive me for saying it i was hoping that you were one northerner who would see it but see what i barked in my despair she did not help me if i had been a man nothing could have insulted me more than that and thats what you dont see she regretfully finished it seems so strange i sat in the midst of my great blank while her handsome eyes rested upon me in them was that look of a certain inquiry and a certain remoteness with which one pauses in a museum before some specimen of the cavedwelling man you comprehend so much she meditated slowly aloud youve been such an agreeable disappointment because your point of view is so often the same as ours she was still surveying me with the specimen expression when it suddenly left her do you mean to sit there and tell me she broke out that you wouldnt have resented it yourself o dear my mind lamentably said to itself inside of what may have been the exterior that i presented to her sitting over my slice of lady baltimore i can form no impression put yourself in his place the girl continued ah i gasped that is always so easy to say and so hard to do my remark proved not a happy one she made a brief cold pause over it and then as she wheeled round from me back to the counter no southerner would let pass such an affront it was final she regained her usual place she resumed her ledger the curly dog who had come out to hear our conversation went in again i was disgraced not only with the profile of her short belligerent nose but with the chilly way in which she made her pencil move over the ledger she told me plainly that my selfrespect had failed to meet her tests this was what my remarkable ingenuity had achieved for me i swallowed the last crumbs of lady baltimore and went forward to settle the account i suppose im scarcely entitled to ask for a fresh one tomorrow i ventured i am so fond of this cake her officialness met me adequately certainly the public is entitled to whatever we print upon our billoffare now this was going to be too bad henceforth i was to rank merely as the public no matter how much lady baltimore i should lunch upon a happy thought seized me and i spoke out instantly on the strength of it miss la heu ive a confession to make but upon this beginning of mine the inauspicious door opened and young john mayrant came in it was all right about his left eye anybody could see that bruise oh he exclaimed hearty but somewhat disconcerted to think of finding you here youre going but ill see you later i hope so i said you know where i work yes yes ill come weve all sorts of things more to say havent we we goodby did i hear as i gained the street something being said about the general and the state of his health viii midsummernights dream you may imagine in what state of wondering i went out of that place and how little i could now do away with my curiosity by the droll looks and headturnings which followed me from strangers that passed me by in the street i was made aware that i must be talking aloud to myself and the words which i had evidently uttered were these but who in the world can he have smashed up of course beneath the public stare and smile i kept the rest of my thoughts to myself yet they so possessed and took me from my surroundings that presently while crossing royal street i was nearly run down by an electric car nor did even this serve to disperse my preoccupation my walk back to court and chancel streets is as if it had not been i can remember nothing about it and the first account that i took of external objects was to find myself sitting in my accustomed chair in the library with the accustomed row of books about the battle of cowpens waiting on the table in front of me how long we had thus been facing each other the books and i ive not a notion and with such mysterious machinery are we human beings filled machinery that is in motion all the while whether we are aware of it or not that now with some part of my mind and with my pencil assisting i composed several stanzas to my kingly ancestor the goal of my fruitless search and yet during the whole process of my metrical exercise i was really thinking and wondering about john mayrant his battles and his loves ode on intimations of royalty i sing to thee thou great unknown who canst connect me with a throne through uncle cousin aunt or sister but not i trust through bar sinister chorus gules gules and a cuckoo peccant such was the frivolous opening of my poem which as it progressed grew even less edifying i have quoted this fragment merely to show you how little reverence for the selected salic scions was by this time left in my spirit and not because the verses themselves are in the least meritorious they should serve as a model for no seriousminded singer and they afford a striking instance of that volatile mood not to say that inclination to ribaldry which will at seasons crop out in me do what i will it is my hope that age may help me to subdue this although i have observed it in some very old men i did not send my poem to aunt carola but i wrote her a letter even there and then couched in terms which i believe were altogether respectful i deplored my lack of success in discovering the link that was missing between me and kings blood i intimated my conviction that further effort on my part would still be met with failure and i renounced with fitting expressions of disappointment my candidateship for the scions thanking aunt carola for her generosity by which i must now no longer profit i added that i should remain in kings port for the present as i was finding the climate of decided benefit to my health and the courtesy of the people an education in itself whatever pain at missing the glory of becoming a scion may have lingered with me after this was much assuaged in a few days by my reading an article in a new york paper which gave an account of a meeting of my aunts society held in that city my attention was attracted to this article by the prominent heading given to it they wore their crowns this in very conspicuous roman capitals caused me to sit up there must have been truth in some of it because the food eaten by the scions was mentioned as consisting of sandwiches sherry and croquettes yet i think that the statement that the members present addressed each other according to the royal families from which they severally traced descent as for example brother guelph and sister plantagenet can scarce have beers aught but an exaggeration nevertheless the article brought me undeniable consolation for my disappointment after finishing my letter to aunt carola i should have hastened out to post it and escape from cowpens had i not remembered that john mayrant had more or less promised to meet me here now there was but a slender chance that he boy would speak to me on the subject of his late encounter this i must learn from other sources but he might speak to me about something that would open a way for my hostile preparations against miss rieppe so far he had not touched upon his impending marriage in any way but this reserve concerning a fact generally known among the people whom i was seeing could hardly go on long without becoming ridiculous if he should shun mention of it today i would take this as a plain sign that he did not look forward to it with the enthusiasm which a lover ought to feel for his approaching bliss and on such silence from him i would begin if i could to undermine his intention of keeping an engagement of the heart when the heart no longer entered into it while my thoughts continued to be busied over this lover and his concerns i noticed the works of william shakespeare close beside me upon a shelf and although it was with no special purpose in mind that i took out one of the volumes and sat down with it to wait for john mayrant in a little while an inspiration came to me from its pages so that i was more anxious than ever the boy should not fail to meet me here in the library was it the bruise on his forehead that had perturbed his manner just now when he entered the exchange no this was not likely to be the reason since he had been full as much embarrassed that first day of my seeing him there when he had given his order for lady baltimore so lamely that the girl behind the counter had come to his aid and what could it have been that he had begun to tell her today as i was leaving the place was the making of that cake again to be postponed on account of the generals precarious health and what had been the nature of the insult which young john mayrant had punished and was now commanded to shake hands over could it in truth be the owner of the hermana whom he had thrashed so well as to lay him up in bed that incident had damaged two people at least the unknown vanquished combatant in his bodily welfare and me in my character as an upstanding man in the fierce feminine estimation of miss la heu but this injury it was my intention to set right my confession to the girl behind the counter was merely delayed as i sat with shakespeare open in my lap i added to my store of reasoning one little new straw of argument in favor of my opinion that john mayrant was no longer at ease or happy about his love affair i had never before met any young man in whose manner nature was so finely tempered with good bringingup forwardness and shyness were alike absent from him and his bearing had a sort of polished unconsciousness as far removed from raw diffidence as it was from raw conceit it was altogether a rare and charming address in a youth of such true youthfulness but it had failed him upon two occasions which i have already mentioned both times that he had come to the exchange he had stumbled in his usually prompt speech lost his habitual ease and betrayed in short all the signs of being disconcerted the matter seemed suddenly quite plain to me it was the nature of his errands to the exchange the first time he had been ordering the cake for his own wedding and today it was something about the wedding again evidently the high mettle of his delicacy and breeding made him painfully conscious of the view which others must take of the part that miss rieppe was playing in all this a view from which it was out of his power to shield her and it was this consciousness that destroyed his composure from what i was soon to learn of his fine and unmoved disregard for unfavorable opinion when he felt his course to be the right one i know that it was no thought at all of his own scarcely heroic role during these days but only the perception that outsiders must detect in his affianced lady some of those very same qualities which had chilled his too precipitate passion for her and left him alone without romance without family sympathy without social acclamations with nothing indeed save his highstrung notion of honor to help him bravely face the wedding march how appalling must the wedding march sound to a waiting bridegroom who sees the bride that he no longer looks at except with distaste and estrangement coming nearer and nearer to him up the aisle a funeral march would be gayer than that music i should think the thought came to me to break out bluntly and say to him countermand the cake shes only playing with you while that yachtsman is making up his mind but there could be but one outcome of such advice to john mayrant two people instead of one would be in bed suffering from contusions as i mused on the boy and his attractive and appealing character i became more rejoiced than ever that he had thrashed somebody i cared not very much who nor yet very much why so long as such thrashing had been thorough which seemed quite evidently and happily the case he stood now in my eyes in some way that is too obscure for me to be able to explain to you saved from some reproach whose subtlety likewise eludes my powers of analysis it was already five minutes after three oclock my dinner hour when he at length appeared in the library and possibly i put some reproach into my greeting wont you walk along with me to mrs trevises that was my boarding house i could not get away from the custom house sooner he explained and into his eyes there came for a moment that look of unrest and preoccupation which i had observed at times while we had discussed newport and alcoholic girls the two subjects seemed certainly far enough apart but he immediately began upon a conversation briskly enough so briskly that i suspected at once he had got his subject ready in advance he didnt want me to speak first lest i turn the talk into channels embarrassing such as bruised foreheads or wedding cake well this should not prevent me from dropping in his cup the wholesome bitters which i had prepared well sir well sir such was his hearty preface i wonder if youre feeling ashamed of yourself never when i read shakespeare i answered restoring the plume to its place he looked at the title which one one of the unsuitable love affairs that was prevented in time romeo and juliet no bottom and titania and romeo and juliet were not prevented in time they had their bliss once and to the full and died before they caused each other anything but ecstasy no weariness of routine no tears of disenchantment complete love completely realized and finis its the happiest ending of all the plays he looked at me hard sometimes i believe youre ironic i smiled at him a sign of the highest civilization then but please to think of juliet after ten years of romeo and his pinheaded intelligence and his preordained infidelities do you imagine that her predecessor rosamond would have had no successors juliet would have been compelled to divorce romeo if only for the childrens sake the children cried john mayrant why its for their sake deserted women abstain from divorce juliet would see deeper than such mothers she could not have her little sons and daughters grow up and comprehend their fathers absences and see their mothers submission to his returns for such discovery would scorch the marrow of any hearts they had at this as we came out of the library he made an astonishing rejoinder and one which i cannot in the least account for south carolina does not allow divorce then i should think i said to him that all you people here would be doubly careful as to what manner of husbands and wives you chose for yourselves such a remark was sailing you may say almost within three points of the wind and his own accidental allusion to romeo had brought it about with an aptness and a celerity which were better for my purpose than anything i had privately developed from the text of bottom and titania none the less however did i intend to press into my service that fond couple also as basis for a moral in spite of the sharp turn which those last words of mine now caused him at once to give to our conversation his quick reversion to the beginning of the talk seemed like a dodging of remarks that hit too near home for him to relish hearing pursued well sir he resumed with the same initial briskness i was ashamed if you were not i still dont make out what impropriety we have jointly committed what do you think of the views you expressed about our country oh when we sat on the gravestones what do you think about it today i turned to him as we slowly walked toward worship street did you say anything then that you would take back now he pondered wrinkling his forehead well but all the same didnt we give the present hour a pretty black eye the present hour deserves a black eye and two of them he surveyed me squarely i believe youre a pessimist that is the first trashy thing ive heard you say thank you at least admit youre scarcely an optimist optimist pessimist why youre talking just like a newspaper he laughed oh dont compare a gentleman to a newspaper then keep your vocabulary clean of bargaincounter words a while ago the journalists had a furious run upon the adjective unamerican anybody or anything that displeased them was unamerican they ran it into the ground and in its place they have lately set up pessimist which certainly has a threatening appearance they dont know its meaning and in their mouths it merely signifies that what a man says snakes them feel personally uncomfortable the word has become a dusty rag of slang the arrested burglar very likely calls the policeman a pessimist and speaking reverently and with no intention to shock you the scribes and pharisees would undoubtedly have called christ a pessimist when he called them hypocrites had they been acquainted with the word once more my remarks drew from the boy an unexpected rejoinder we had turned into worship street and as we passed the churchyard he stopped and laid his hand upon the railing of the pate you dont shock me he said and then but you would shock my aunts he paused gazing into the churchyard before he continued more slowly and so should i if they knew it shock them if they knew what i asked his hand indicated a sculptured crucifix near by do you believe everything still he answered can you as he looked at me i suppose that he read negation in my eyes no more can i he murmured again he looked in among the tombstones and flowers where the old custodian saw us and took off his hat howdy daddy ben john mayrant returned pleasantly and then resuming to me no more can i believe everything then he gave a brief comical laugh and i hope my aunts wont find that out they would think me gone to perdition indeed but i always go to church here he pointed to the quiet building which for all its modest size and simplicity had a stately and inexpressible charm because i like to kneel where my mother said her prayers you know he flushed a little over this confidence into which he had fallen but he continued i like the words of the service too and i dont ask myself overcuriously what i do believe but theres a permanent something within us a greater self dont you think a permanent something i assented which has created all the religions all over the earth from the beginning and of which christianity itself is merely one of the present temples he made an exclamation at my word present do you think anything in this world is final i asked him but he began somewhat at a loss havent you found out yet that human nature is the one indestructible reality that we know but he began again dont we have the latest thing all the time and never the ultimate thing never never the latest thing in womens hats is that hugebrimmed affair with the veil as voluminous as a doublebed mosquito netting that hat will look improbable next spring the latest thing in science is radium radium has exploded the conservation of energy theory turned it into a last years hat answer me if christianity is the same as when it wore among its savage ornaments a devil with horns and a flaming hell forever and forever the human race reaches out its hand and shapes some system some creed some government and declares this is at length the final thing the cureall and lo and behold something flowing and eternal in the race itself presently splits the creed and the government to pieces truth is a very marvelous thing we feel it it can fill our eyes with tears our hearts with joy it can make us die for it but once our human lips attempt to formulate and thus imprison it it becomes a lie you cannot shut truth up in any words but it shall prevail the boy exclaimed with a sort of passion everything prevails i answered him i dont like that he said neither do i i returned but jacob got esaus inheritance by a mean trick jacob was punished for it did that help esau much you are a pessimist just because i see jacob and esau today alive and kicking in wall street washington newport everywhere youre no optimist anyhow i hope im blind in neither eye you dont give us credit for what for what weve accomplished since jacob printing steam and electricity for instance they spread the bible and the yellow journal with equal velocity i dont mean science take our institutions well weve accomplished hospitals and the stock market a pretty even setoff between god and the devil he laughed you dont take a high view of us nor a low one i dont play ostrich with any of the staring permanences of human nature were just as noble today as david was sometimes and just as bestial today as david was sometimes and weve every possibility inside us all the time whether we paint our naked skins or wear steel armor or starched shirts well i believe good is the guiding power in the world oh john mayrant good and evil draw us on like a span of horses sometimes like a tandem taking turns in the lead order has melted into disorder and disorder into new order how many times but better each time how can you know who never lived in any age but your own i know we have a higher ideal have we the greek was taught to love his neighbor as himself he gave his great teacher a cup of poison we gave ours the cross again he looked away from me into the sweet old churchyard i cant answer you but i dont believe it this brought me to gayety thats unanswerable anyhow he still stared at the graves those people in there didnt think all these uncomfortable things ah no they belonged in the first volume of the history of our national soul before the bloom was off us thats an odd notion and pray what volume are we in now only the second since when since that momentous picnic the spanish war i dont see how that took the bloom off us it didnt it merely waked europe up to the facts our battleships you mean our steel rails our gold coffers our roaring affluence and our very accurate shooting he insisted for he was a southerner and mans gallantry appealed to him more than mans industry i laughed yes indeed we may say that the spanish war closed our first volume with a bang and now in the second we bid goodby to the virgin wilderness for its explored to the indian for hes conquered to the pioneer for hes dead weve finished our wild romantic adolescence and we find ourselves a recognized world power of eighty million people and of general commercial endlessness and playtime over i think john mayrant now asserted that it is going too far to say the bloom is off us oh youll find snow in the woods away into april and may the freedomloving american the embattled farmer is not yet extinct in the far recesses but the great cities grow like a creeping paralysis over freedom and the man from the country is walking into them all the time because the poor restless fellow believes wealth awaits him on their pavements and when he doesnt go to them they come to him the wall street bucketshop goes fishing in the woods with wires a thousand miles long and so we exchange the solid trailblazing enterprise of volume one for volume twos electric unrest in volume one our wagon was hitched to the star of liberty capital and labor have cut the traces the labor union forbids the workingman to labor as his own virile energy and skill prompt him if he disobeys he is expelled and called a scab dont let us call ourselves the land of the free while such things go on were all thinking a deal too much about our pockets nowadays eternal vigilance cannot watch liberty and the ticker at the same time well said john mayrant were not thinking about our pockets in kings port because and here there came into his voice and face that sudden humor which made him so delightful because we havent got any pockets to think of this brought me down to cheerfulness from my flight among the cold clouds he continued any more lamentations mr jeremiah those who begin to call names john mayrant but never mind i could lament you sick if i chose to go on about our corporations and corruption that i see with my pessimistic eye but the other eye sees the american man himself the type that our eighty millions on the whole melt into and to which my heart warms each time i land again from more polished and colder shores my optimistic eye sees that american dealing adequately with these political diseases for stronger even than his kindness his ability and his dishonesty is his selfpreservation hes going to stand up for the open shop and sit down on the trust and i assure you that i dont in the least resemble the evening post a look of inquiry was in john mayrants features the new york evening post i repeated with surprise still the inquiry of his face remained oh fortunate youth i cried to have escaped the new york evening post is it so heinous well well how exactly describe it make you see it its partially tonguetied a sad victim of its own excesses habitual overindulgence in blaming has given it a painful stutter when attempting praise its the sprucely written sheet of the supercilious its the afterdinner pill of the american who prefers europe its our republics common scold the xantippe of journalism the paper without a country the paper without a country thats very good oh no ill tell you something much better but it is not mine a clever new yorker said that what with the sun i know that paper what with the sun making vice so attractive in the morning and the post making virtue so odious in the evening it was very hard for a man to be good in new york i fear i should subscribe to the sun said john mayrant he took his hand from the churchgate railing and we had turned to stroll down worship street when he was unexpectedly addressed for some minutes while john mayrant and i had been talking i had grown aware without taking any definite note of it that the old custodian of the churchyard daddy ben had come slowly near us from the distant corner of his demesne where he had been to all appearances engaged in some trifling activity among the flowers perhaps picking off the faded blossoms it now came home to me that the venerable negro had really been in a surreptitious way watching john mayrant and waiting for something either for the right moment to utter what he now uttered or his own delayed decision to utter it at all mas john he called quite softly his tone was fairly padded with caution and i saw that in the pause which followed his eye shot a swift look at the bruise on mayrants forehead and another look equally swift at me well daddy ben what is it the custodian shunted close to the gate which separated him from us mas john i speck de president he dun know de cullud people like we knows um else he nebber bin pint dat ar boss in de cussum house no sah after this effort he wiped his forehead and breathed hard to my astonishment the effort brought immediately a stern change over john mayrants face then he answered in the kindest tones thank you daddy ben this answer interpreted for me the whole thing which otherwise would have been obscure enough the old man held it to be an indignity that his young mas john should by the presidents act find himself the subordinate of a member of the black race and he had just now in his perspiring effort expressed his sympathy why he had chosen this particular moment after quite obvious debate with himself i did not see until somewhat later he now left us standing at the gate and it was not for some moments that john mayrant spoke again evidently closing for our two selves this delicate subject i wish we had not got into that second volume of yours thats not progressive i hate progress whats the use better grow old gracefully qui no pas iesprif de son age de son age a tout le malheur well im personally not growing old just yet neither is the united states well i dont know its too easy for sick or worthless people to survive nowadays they are clotting up our square miles very fast philanthropists dont seem to remember that you can beget children a great deal faster than you can educate them and at this rate i believe universal suffrage will kill us off before our time do not believe it we are going to find out that universal suffrage is like the appendix useful at an early stage of the races evolution but today merely a threat to life he thought this over but a surgical operation is pretty serious you know itll be done by absorption why youve begun it yourselves and so has massachusetts the appendix will be removed black and white and i shouldnt much fear surgery were not nearly civilized enough yet to have lost the power of recuperation and in spite of our expresstrain speed i doubt if we shall travel from crudity to rottenness without a pause at maturity that is the old old story he said yes is there anything new under the sun he was gloomy nothing i suppose then the gloom lightened nothing new under the sun except the fashionable families of newport this again brought us from the clouds of speculation down to worship street where we were walking toward south place it also unexpectedly furnished me with the means to lead back our talk so gently without a jolt or a jerk to my moral and the delicate topic of matrimony from which he had dodged away that he never awoke to what was coming until it had come he began pointing out as we passed them certain houses which were now or had at some period been the dwellings of his many relatives my cousin julia soandso lives there he would say or my greatuncle known as regent tom owned that before the war and once the rev joseph priedieu my greatgrandfather built that house to marry his fifth wife in but the grave claimed him first so i asked him a riddle what is the difference between kings port and newport this he of course gave up here you are all connected by marriage and there they are all connected by divorce thats true he cried thats very true i met the most embarrassingly catercornered families oh they werent embarrassed i interjected no but i was said john and you told me you werent innocent i exclaimed they are going to institute a divorce march i continued lohengrin or midsummernights dream played backward they have not settled which it is to be taught in the nursery with the other kindergarten melodies he was still unsuspectingly diverted and we walked along until we turned in the direction of my boardinghouse did you ever notice i now said what a perpetual allegory midsummernights dream contains i thought it was just a fairy sort of thing yes but when a great poet sets his hand to a fairy sort of thing you get well you get poor titania she fell in love with a jackass he remarked puck bewitched her precisely a lovely woman with her arms around a jackass does that never happen in kings port he began smiling to himself im afraid puck isnt all dead yet i was now in a position to begin dropping my bitters shakespeare was probably too gallant to put it the other way and make oberon fall in love with a female jackass but what an allegory yes he muttered yes i followed with another drop titania got out of it it is not always solved so easily no he muttered no it was quite evident that the flavor of my bitters reached him he was walking slowly with his head down and frowning hard we had now come to the steps of my boardinghouse and i dropped my last drop but a disenchanted woman has the best of it before marriage at least he looked up quickly how i evinced surprise why she can always break off honorably and we never can i suppose for the third time this day he made me an astonishing rejoinder would you like to take orders from a negro it reduced me to stammering i have never such a juncture has never of course you wouldnt even a northerner his face as he said this was a single glittering piece of fierceness i was still so much taken aback that i said rather flatly but who has to i have to with this he abruptly turned on his heel and left me standing on the steps for a moment i stared after him and then as i rang the bell he was back again and with that formality which at times overtook him he began i will ask you to excuse my hasty oh john mayrant what a notion but he was by no means to be put off and he proceeded with stiffer formality i feel that i have not acted politely just now and i beg to assure you that i intended no slight my first impulse was to lay a hand upon his shoulder and say to him my dear fellow stuff and nonsense thus i should have treated any northern friend but here was no northerner i am glad that i had the sense to feel that any careless goodnatured putting away of his deliberate and definitely tendered apology would seem to him a slight on my part his punctilious value for certain observances between man and man reached me suddenly and deeply and took me far from the familiarity which breeds contempt why john mayrant i said you could never offend me unless i thought that you wished to and how should i possibly think that thank you he replied very simply i rang the bell a second time if we can get into the house i suggested wont you stop and dine with me he was going to accept i shall be he had begun in tones of gratification when in one instant his face was stricken with complete dismay i had forgotten he said and this time he was gone indeed and in a hurry most apparent it resembled a flight what was the matter now you will naturally think that it was an appointment with his ladylove which he had forgotten this was certainly my supposition as i turned again to the front door there stood one of the waitresses glaring with her white eyes half out of her black face at the already distant back of john mayrant oh i thought but before i could think any more the tall dreadful boarder the lady whom i secretly called juno swept up the steps and by me into the house with a dignity that one might term deafening the waitress now muttered or rather sang a series of pious apostrophes oh lawd de rampages and de ructions oh lawd sinner is in my way daniel she was strongly but i think pleasurably excited and she next turned to me with a most natural grin and saying chickns mos gone sah she went back to the dining room this admonition sent me upstairs to make as hasty a toilet as i could ix juno each recent remarkable occurrence had obliterated its predecessor and it was with difficulty that i made a straight parting in my hair had it been miss rieppe that john so suddenly ran away to it seemed now more as if the boy had been running away from somebody the waitress had stared at him with extraordinary interest she had seen his bruise perhaps she knew how he had got it her excitement had he smashed up his official superior at the custom house that would be an impossible thing i told myself instantly as well might a nobleman cross swords with a peasant perhaps the stare of the waitress had reminded him of his bruise and he might have felt disinclined to show himself with it in a company of gossiping strangers still that would scarcely account for it the dismay with which he had so suddenly left me was juno the cause she had come up behind me he must have seen her and her portentous manner approaching had the boy fled from her and then his fierce outbreak about taking orders from a negro when i was moralizing over the misfortune of marrying a jackass i got a sort of parting in my hair and went down to the dining room juno was there before me with her bonnet or rather her headdress still on and i heard her making apologies to mrs trevise for being so late mrs trevise of course sat at the head of her table and juno sat at her right hand i was very glad not to have a seat near juno because this lady was as i have already hinted an intolerable person to me either her southern social position or her rent she took the whole second floor except mrs trevises own rooms was of importance to mrs trevise but i assure you that her ways kept our landladys cold impervious tact watchful from the beginning to the end of almost every meal juno was one of those persons who possess so many and such strong feelings themselves that they think they have all the feelings there are at least they certainly consider no ones feelings but their own she possessed an inexhaustible store of anecdote but it was exclusively about our civil war you would have supposed that nothing else had ever happened in the world when conversation among the rest of us became general she preserved a cold and acrid inattention when the fancy took her to open her own mouth it was always to begin some reminiscence and the reminiscence always began in september when the northern vandals etc etc or when the northern vandals were repulsed by my husbands cousin general braxton bragg etc etc now it was not that i was personally wounded by the term because at the time of the vandals i was not even born and also because i know that vandals cannot be kept out of any army deeply as i believed the march to the sea to have been imperative of shermans bummers and their excesses i had a fair historic knowledge and a very poor opinion and this i should have been glad to tell juno had she ever given me the chance but her immodest sympathy for herself froze all sympathy for her why could she not preserve a wellbred silence upon her sufferings as did the other old ladies i had met in kings port why did she drag them in thrust them poke them shove them at you thus it was that for her insulting disregard of those whom her words might wound i detested juno and as she was a woman and nearly old enough to be my grandmother it was of course out of the question that i should retaliate when she got very bad indeed it was calm mrs trevises last but effective resort to tinkle a little handbell and scold one of the waitresses whom its sound would then summon from the kitchen this bell was tinkled not always by any means for my sake other travellers from the north there were who came and went pausing at kings port between florida and their habitual abodes at present our company consisted of juno a middleclass englishman employed in some business capacity in town a pair of very young honeymooners from the upcountry a louisiana poetess who wore the long cylindrical ringlets of and who was attending a convention the daughters of dixie two or three males and females best described as et ceteras and myself i shall only take a mouthful for the sake of nourishment juno was announcing and then i shall return to his bedside is he very suffering inquired the poetess in melodious accent it was an infamous onslaught juno replied the poetess threw up her eyes and crooned noble doughty champion you may say so indeed madam said juno raw beefsteaks jolly good for your eye observed the briton this suggestion did not appear to be heard by juno i had a row with a chap the briton continued hes my best friend now he made me put raw beefsteak i thank you interrupted juno he requires no beefsteak raw or cooked the face of the briton reddened too groggy to eat is he mrs trevise tinkled her bell daphne i have said to you twice to hand those yams i done handed em twice maam hand them right away daphne and dont be so forgetful it was not easy to disturb the composure of mrs trevise the poetess now took up the broken thread had i a son she declared i would sooner witness him starve than hear him take orders from a menial race but mightnt starving be harder for him to experience than for you to witness y know asked the briton at this one of the et ceteras made a sort of snuffing noise and ate his dinner hard it was the male honeymooner who next spoke must have been quite a tussle maam it was an infamous onslaught repeated juno wish id seen it sighed the honeymooner his bride smiled at him beamingly youd have felt right lonesome to be out of it david no apology has yet been offered continued juno but must your nephew apologize besides taking a licking inquired the briton juno turned an awful face upon hint it is from his brutal assailant that apologies are due mr mayrants family she paused here for blighting emphasis are wellbred people and he will be coerced into behaving like a gentleman for once i checked an impulse here to speak out and express my doubts as to the family coercion being founded upon any dissatisfaction with johns conduct i wonder if reading or recitation might not soothe your nephew said the poetess now i should doubt it answered juno i have just come from his bedside i should so like to soothe him if i could the poetess murmured if he were well enough to hear my convention ode he is not nearly well enough said juno the et cetera here coughed and blew his nose so remarkably that we all started a short silence followed which juno relieved i will give the young ruffians family the credit they deserve she stated the whole connection despises his keeping the position another et cetera now came into it is it known what exactly precipitated the occurrence juno turned to him my nephew is a gentleman from whose lips no unworthy word could ever fall oh said the et cetera mildly he said something then he conveyed a wellmerited rebuke in fitting terms what were the terms inquired the briton juno again did not hear him it was after a friendly game of cards my nephew protested against any gentleman remaining at the custom house since the recent insulting appointment i was now almost the only member of the party who had preserved strict silence throughout this very interesting conversation because having no wish to converse with juno at any time i especially did not desire it now just after her seeing me i thought she must have seen me in amicable conference with the object of her formidable displeasure every mayrant is ferocious that i ever heard of she continued you cannot trust that seemingly delicate and human exterior his father had it too deceiving exterior and raging interior though i will say for that one that he would never have stooped to humiliate the family name as his son is doing his regiment was near by when the northern vandals burned our courthouse and he made them run i can tell you its a mercy for that poor girl that the scales have dropped from her eyes and she has broken her engagement with him with the father asked a third et cetera juno stared at the intruder mrs trevise drawled a calm contribution the father died before this boy was born oh i see murmured the et cetera gratefully juno proceeded no womans life would be safe with him but mightnt he be safer for a persons niece than for their nephew said the briton mrs trevises hand moved toward the bell but juno answered the question mournfully with such hereditary bloodthirstiness who can tell and so mrs trevise moved her hand away again excuse me but do you know if the other gentleman is laid up too inquired the male honeymooner hopefully i am happy to understand that he is replied juno in sheer amazement i burst out oh and abruptly stopped but it was too late i had instantly become the centre of interest the et ceteras and honeymooners craned their necks the briton leaned toward me from opposite the poetess who had worn an absent expression since being told that the injured champion was not nearly well enough to listen to her ode now put on her glasses and gazed at me kindly while juno reared her headdress and spoke not to me but to the air in my general neighborhood has any one later intelligence than what i bring from my nephews bedside so she hadnt perceived who my companion at the step had been well she should be enlightened they all should be enlightened and vengeance was mine i spoke with gentleness your nephews impressions i fear are still confused by his deplorable misadventure may i ask what you know about his impressions out of the corner of my eye i saw the hand of mrs trevise move toward her bell but she wished to hear all about it more than she wished concord at her harmonious table and the hand stopped juno spoke again who pray has later news than what i bring my enemy was in my hand and an enemy in the hand is worth i dont know how many in the bush i answered most gently i do not come from mr mayrants bedside because i have just left him at the front door in sound health saving a bruise over his left eye during a second we all sat in a highstrung silence and then juno became truly superb who sees the scars he brazenly conceals it took away my breath my battle would have been lost when the briton suggested but maynt he have shown those to his aunt we sat in no silence now the first et cetera made extraordinary sounds on his plate mrs trevise tinkled her handbell with more unction than i had ever yet seen in her and while she and daphne interchanged streams of severe words which i was too disconcerted to follow the other et ceteras and the honeymooners hectically effervesced into small talk i presently found myself eating our last course amid a reestablished calm when with a rustle juno swept out from among us to return i suppose to the bedside as she passed behind the britons chair that invaluable person kicked me under the table and on my raising my eyes to him he gave me a large robust wink x high walk and the ladies i now burned to put many questions to the rest of the company if through my foolish and outreaching slyness with the girl behind the counter the door of my comprehension had been shut juno had now opened it sufficiently wide for a number of facts to come crowding in so to speak abreast indeed their simultaneous arrival was not a little confusing as if several visitors had burst in upon me and at once begun speaking loudly each shouting a separate and important matter which demanded my intelligent consideration john mayrant worked in the custom house and kings port frowned upon this not merely kings port in general which counted little with the boy if indeed he noticed general opinion at all but the boys particular kings port his severe old aunts and his cousins and the pretty girl at the exchange and the men he played cards with all these frowned upon it too yet even this condemnation one could disregard if some lofty personal principle some pledge to ones own sacred honor were at stake but here was no such thing john mayrant hated the position himself the salary no the salary would count for nothing in the face of such a prejudice as i had seen glitter from his eye a strong clever youth of twentythree with the world before him and no one to support stop hortense rieppe there was the lofty personal principle the sacred pledge to honor he was engaged presently to endow her with all his worldly goods and to perform this faithfully a bridegroom must not no matter how little he liked taking orders from a negro fling away his worldly goods some few days before he was to pronounce his bridegrooms vow so here at mrs trevises dinnertable i caught for one moment to the full a vision of the unhappy boys plight he was sticking to a task which he loathed that he might support a wife whom he no longer desired such as he saw it was his duty and nobody not even a soul of his kin or his kind gave him a word or a thought of understanding gave him anything except the cold shoulder yes from one soul he had got a sign from aged daddy ben at the churchyard gate and amid my jostling surmises and conclusions that quaint speech of the old negro that little act of fidelity and affection from the heart of a black man took on a strange pathos in its isolation amid the general harshness of his white superiors over this it was that i was pausing when all in a second perplexity again ruled my meditations juno had said that the engagement was broken well if that were the case but was it likely to be the case junos agreeable habit a habit grown familiar to all of us in the house was to sprinkle about along with her vitriol liberal quantities of the byproduct of inaccuracy mingled with her latest illustrations she had poured out for us one good dose of falsehood the antidote for which it had been my happy office to administer on the spot if john mayrant wasnt in bed from the wounds of combat as she had given us to suppose perhaps hortense rieppe hadnt released him from his plighted troth as juno had also announced and distinct relief filled me when i reasoned this out i leave others to reason out why it was relief and why a dull disappointment had come over me at the news that the match was off this for me should have been good news when you consider that i had been so lately telling myself such a marriage must not be that i must myself somehow since no one else would step in and arrest the calamity and it seems odd that i should have felt this blankness and regret upon learning that the parties had happily settled it for themselves and hence my difficult and delicate assistance was never to be needed by them did any one else now sitting at our table know of miss rieppes reported act what particulars concerning johns fight had been given by juno before my entrance it didnt surprise me that her nephew was in bed from master mayrants lusty blows one could readily guess the manner in which young john with his pentup fury over the custom house would land his chastisement all over the person of any rash critic and what a talking about it must be going on everywhere today if kings port tongues had been set in motion over me and my small notebook in a library the whole town must be buzzing over every bruise given and taken in this evidently emphatic battle i had hoped to glean some more precise information from my fellowboarders after juno had disembarrassed us of her sonorous presence but even if they were possessed of all the facts which i lacked mrs trevise in some masterly fashion of her own banished the subject from further discussion she held us off from it chiefly i think by adopting a certain upright posture in her chair and a certain tone when she inquired if we wished a second help of the pudding after thirtyfive years of boarders and butchers life held no secrets or surprises for her she was a mature lone disenchanted able lady and even her silence was like an arm of the law an all too brief conversation nipped by mrs trevise at a stage even earlier than the bud revealed to me that perhaps my fellowboarders would have been glad to ask me questions too it was the male honeymooner who addressed me did i understand you to say sir that mr mayrant had received a bruise over his left eye daphne called out mrs trevise mr henderson will take an orange and so we finished our meal without further reference to eyes or noses or anything of the sort it was just as well i reflected when i reached my room that i on my side had been asked no questions since i most likely knew less than the others who had heard all that juno had to say and it would have been humiliating after my superb appearance of knowing more to explain that john mayrant had walked with me all the way from the library and never told me a word about the affair this reflection increased my esteem for the boys admirable reticence what private matter of his own had i ever learned from him it was other people invariably who told me of his troubles there had been that single quickly controlled outbreak about his position in the custom house and also he had let fall that touching word concerning his faith and his liking to say his prayers in the place where his mother had said them beyond this there had never yet been anything of all that must at the present moment be intimately stirring in his heart should i like to take orders from a negro put personally it came to me now as a new idea came as something which had never entered my mind before not even as an abstract hypothesis i didnt have to think before reaching the answer though something within me which you ma call what you please convention prejudice instinct something answered most prompt and emphatically in the negative i revolved in my mind as i tried to pack into a box a number of objects that i had bought in one or to antique shops they wouldnt go in the objects they were of defeating and recalcitrant shapes and of hostile materials glass and brass and i must have a larger box made and in that case i would buy this afternoon the other kettlesupporter i forget its right name and have the whole lot decently packed take orders from a colored man have him give you directions dictate you letters discipline you if you were unpunctual no indeed and if such were my feeling how must this young southerner feel with this in my mind i made sure that the part in my back hair was right and after that precaution soon found myself on my way in a way somewhat roundabout to the kettlesupporter sauntering northward along high walk and stopping often the town and the water and the distant shores all were so lovely so belonged to one another so melted into one gentle impression of wistfulness and tenderness i leaned upon the stone parapet and enjoyed the quiet which every surrounding detail brought to my senses how could john mayrant endure such a situation i continued to wonder and i also continued to assure myself it was absurd to suppose that the engagement was broken the shutting of a front door across the street almost directly behind me attracted my attention because of its being the first sound that had happened in noiseless empty high walk since i had been strolling there and i turned from the parapet to see that i was no longer the solitary person in the street two ladies one tall and one diminutive both in black and with long black veils which they had put back from their faces were evidently coming from a visit as the tall one bowed to me i recognized mrs gregory st michael and took off my hat it was not until they had crossed the street and come up the stone steps near where i stood on high walk that the little lady also bowed to me she was mrs weguelin st michael and from something in her prim yet charming manner i gathered that she held it to be not perfectly wellbred in a lady to greet a gentleman across the width of a public highway and that she could have wished that her tall companion had not thus greeted me a stranger likely to comment upon kings port manners in her eyes such free deportment evidently went with her tall companions method of speech hadnt the little lady informed me during our first brief meeting that kings port at times thought mrs gregory st michaels tongue too downright the two ladies having graciously granted me permission to join them while they took the air mrs gregory must surely have shocked mrs weguelin by saying to me i havent a penny for your thoughts but ill exchange would you thus bargain in the dark madam oh ill risk that and to say truth even your back as we came out of that house was a back of thought well i confess to some thinking shall i begin it was mrs weguelin who quickly replied smiling ladies first you know at least we still keep it so in kings port would we did everywhere i exclaimed devoutly and i was quite aware that beneath the little ladys gentle smile a setting down had lurked a setting down of the most delicate nature administered to me not in the least because i had deserved one but because she did not like mrs gregorys downright tongue and could not stop her mrs gregory now took the prerogative of ladies and began i was thinking of what we had all just been saying during our visit across the way and with which you are not going to agree that our young people would do much better to let us old people arrange their marriages for them as it is done in europe o dear i said that you would not agree but that is because you are so young i dont know that twentyeight is so young you will know it when you are seventythree this observation again came from mrs weguelin st michael and again with a gentle and attractive smile it was only the second time that she had spoken and throughout the talk into which we now fell as we slowly walked up and down high walk she never took the lead she left that to the downright tongue but i noticed however that she chose her moments to follow the lead very aptly i also perceived plainly that what we were really going to discuss was not at all the european principle of marriagemaking but just simply young john and his hortense they were the true kernel of the nut with whose concealing shell mrs gregory was presenting me and in proposing an exchange of thoughts she would get back only more thoughts upon the same subject it was pretty evident how much kings port was buzzing over all this they fondly believed they did not like it but what would they have done without it what indeed were they going to do when it was all over and done with one way or another as a matter of fact they ought to be grateful to hortense for contributing illustriously to the excitement of their lives of course i am well aware mrs gregory pursued that the young people of today believe they can all teach their grandmothers to suck eggs as we say in kings port we say it elsewhere too i mildly put in indeed i didnt know that the north with its pest of hebrew and other low immigrants had retained any of the good old homely saws which we brought from england but do you imagine that if the control of marriage rested in the hands of parents and grandparents where it properly belongs you would be witnessing in the north this disgusting spectacle of divorce but mrs st michael we didnt invite you to argue when we invited you to walk cried the lady laughing we should like you to answer the question said mrs weguelin st michael and tell us mrs gregory continued if its your opinion that a boy who has never been married is a better judge of matrimonys pitfalls than his father or than any older person who has bravely and worthily gone through with the experience mrs weguelin added ladies ive no mind to argue but were ahead of europe we dont need their clumsy old plan mrs gregory gave a gallant incredulous snort i shall be interested to learn of anything that is done better here than in europe oh many things surely but especially the mating of the fashionable young they dont need any parents to arrange for them its much better managed through precocity through precocity i scarcely follow you and mrs weguelin softly added you must excuse us if we do not follow you but her softness nevertheless indicated that if there were any one present needing leniency it was myself why yes i told them its through precocity the newrich american no longer commits the blunder of keeping his children innocent youll see it beginning in the dancingclass where i heard an exquisite little girl of six say to a little boy go away i cant dance with you because my mamma says your mamma only keeps a maid to answer the doorbell when they get home from the dancingclass tutors in poker and bridge are waiting to teach them how to gamble for each others little dimes i saw a little boy in knickerbockers and a wide collar throw down the evening paper at that age they read the papers interrupted mrs gregory they read nothing else at any age he threw it down and said well i guess theres not much behind this raid on steel preferred what need has such a boy for parents or grandparents presently he is travelling to a fashionable boardingschool in his fathers private car at college all his adolescent curiosities are lavishly gratified his sister at home reads the french romances and by eighteen she too knows in her head at least the whole of life so that she can be perfectly trusted she would no more marry a mere halfmillionaire just because she loved him than she would appear twice in the same balldress she and her balldresses are described in the papers precisely as if she were an animal at a show which indeed is what she has become and shes eager to be thus described because she and her mother even if her mother was once a lady and knew better are haunted by one perpetual sickening fear the fear of being left out and if you desire to pay correct ballroom compliments you no longer go to her mother and tell her shes looking every bit as young as her daughter you go to the daughter and tell her shes looking every bit as old as her mother for thats what she wishes to do thats what she tries for what she talks dresses eats drinks goes to indecent plays and laughs for yes we manage it through precocity and the newrich american parent has achieved at least one new thing under the sun namely the corruption of the child my ladies silently consulted each others expressions after which in equal silence their gaze returned to me but their equally intent scrutiny was expressive of quite different things it was with expectancy that mrs gregory looked at me she wanted more not so mrs weguelin she gave me disapproval it was shadowed in her beautiful lustrous eyes that burned dark in her white face with as much fire as that of youth yet it was not of youth being deeply charged with retrospection in what then had i sinned for the little ladys next words coldly murmured increased in me an uneasiness as of sin you have told us much that we are not accustomed to hear in kings port oh i havent begun to tell you i exclaimed cheerily you certainly have not told us said mrs gregory how your precocity escapes this divorce degradation escape it those people think it is well provincial not to have been divorced at least once mrs gregory opened her eyes but mrs weguelin shut her lips i continued even the children for their own little reasons like it only last summer in newport a young boy was asked how he enjoyed having a father and an exfather exfather said mrs gregory vicefather is what i should call him maria murmured mrs weguelin how can you jest upon such topics i am far from jesting julia well young gentleman and what answer did this precious newport child make he said if you will pardon my giving you his little sentiment in his own quite expressive idiom me for two fathers double money birthdays and christmases see that was how he saw divorce once again my ladies consulted each others expressions we moved along high walk in such silence that i heard the stiff little rustle which the palmettos were making across the street even these trees you might have supposed were whispering together over the horrors that i had recited in their decorous presence it was mrs gregory who next spoke i can translate that last boys language but what did the other boy mean about a raid on steel preferred if ive got the jargon right while i translated this for her i felt again the disapproval in mrs weguelins dark eyes and my sins for they were twofold were presently made clear to me by this lady are such subjects as as stocks she softly cloaked this word in scorn immeasurable are such subjects mentioned in your good society at the north i laughed heartily everythings mentioned the lady paused over my reply i am afraid you must feel us to be very oldfashioned in kings port she then said but i rejoice in it she ignored my not wholly dexterous compliment and some subjects she pursued seem to us so grave that if we permit ourselves to speak of them at all we cannot speak of them lightly no they couldnt speak of them lightly here then stood my two sins revealed everything i had imparted and also my tone of imparting it had displeased mrs weguelin st michael not with the thing but with me i had transgressed her sound old american code of good manners a code slightly pompous no doubt but one in which no familiarity was allowed to breed contempt to her good taste there were things in the world which had apparently to exist but which one banished from drawingroom discussion as one conceals from sight the kitchen and outhouses one dealt with them only when necessity compelled and never in smalltalk and here had i been so to speak smalltalking them in that glib modern irresponsible cadence with which our brazen age rings and clatters like the beating of triangles and gongs not triangles and gongs but rather strings and flutes had been the music to which kings port society had attuned its measured voice i saw it all and even saw that my own dramatic sense of mrs weguelins dignity had perversely moved me to be more flippant than i actually felt and i promised myself that a more chastened tone should forthwith redeem me from the false position i had got into my dear said mrs gregory to mrs weguelin we must ask him to excuse our provincialism for the second time i was not wholly dexterous but i like it so much i exclaimed and both ladies laughed frankly mrs gregory brought in a fable youll find us all country mice here this time i was happy at least then therell be no cat and this caused us all to make little bows but the word cat fell into our talk as does a drop of some acid into a chemical solution instantly changing the whole to an unexpected new color the unexpected new color was in this instance merely what had been latently lurking in the fluid of our consciousness all through and now it suddenly came out mrs gregory stared over the parapet at the harbor i wonder if anybody has visited that steam yacht the hermana i said shes waiting i believe for her owner who is enjoying himself very much on land it was a strong temptation to add enjoying himself with the cat but i resisted it oh said mrs gregory possibly a friend of yours even his name is unknown to me but i gather that he may be coming to kings port to attend mr john mayrants wedding next wednesday week i hadnt gathered this but one is at times driven to improvising i wished so much to know if juno was right about the engagement being broken and i looked hard at the ladies as my words fairly grazed the cat this time i expected them to consult each others expressions and such indeed was their immediate proceeding the wednesday following you mean mrs weguelin corrected postponed again dear me mrs gregory spoke this time general rieppe less well again it seems it would be like juno to magnify a delay into a rupture then i had a hilarious thought which i instantly put to the ladies if the poor general were to die completely would the wedding be postponed completely there would not be the slightest chance of that mrs gregory declared and then she pronounced a sentence that was truly oracular shes coming at once to see for herself to which mrs weguelin added with deeper condemnation than she had so far employed at all there is a rumor that she is actually coming in an automobile my silence upon these two remarks was the silence of great and sudden interest but it led mrs weguelin st michael to do my perceptions a slight injustice and she had no intention that i should miss the quality of her opinion regarding the vehicle in which hortense was reported to be travelling miss rieppe has the extraordinary taste to come here in an automobile said mrs weguelin st michael with deepened severity though i understood quite well without this emphasizing that the little lady would with her unbending traditions probably think it more respectable to approach kings port in a wheelbarrow i was absorbed by the vague but copious import of mrs gregorys announcement the oracles moreover continued but she is undoubtedly very clever to come and see for herself was mrs weguelins next comment mrs gregorys face as she replied to her companion took on a censorious and superior expression youll remember julia that i told josephine st michael it was what they had to expect but it was not josephine my dear who at any time approved of taking such a course it was elizas whole doing it was fairly raining oracles round me and they quite resembled for all the help and light they contained their delphic predecessors and yet eliza said mrs gregory in the face of it this very morning repeated her eternal assertion that we shall all see the marriage will not take place eliza murmured mrs weguelin rates few things more highly than her own judgment mrs gregory mused yet she is often right when she has no right to be right i could not bear it any longer and i said i heard today that miss rieppe had broken her engagement and where did you hear that nonsense asked mrs gregory my heart leaped and i told her where oh well you will hear anything in a boardinghouse indeed that would be a great deal too good to be true may i ask where miss rieppe is all this while the last news was from palm beach where the air was said to be necessary for the general but mrs weguelin repeated we have every reason to believe that she is coming here in an automobile we shall have to call of course added mrs gregory to her not to me they were leaving me out of it yes these ladies were forgetting about me in their using preoccupation over whatever crisis it was that now hung over john mayrants love affairs a preoccupation which was evidently part of kings ports universal buzz today and which my joining them in the street had merely mitigated for a moment i did not wish to be left out of it i cannot tell you why perhaps it was contagious in the local air but a veritable madness of craving to know about it seized upon me of course i saw that miss rieppe was almost too grossly and obviously playing for time the health of peoples fathers did not cause weekly extensions of this sort but what was it that the young lady expected time to effect for her her release formally by her young man on the ground of his worldly ill fortune or was it for an offer from the owner of the hermana that she was waiting before she should take the step of formally releasing john mayrant no neither of these conjectures seemed to furnish a key to the tactics of miss rieppe and the theory that each of these affianced parties was strategizing to cause the other to assume the odium of breaking their engagement with no result save that of repeatedly countermanding a weddingcake struck me as belonging admirably to a stagecomedy in three acts but scarcely to life as we find it besides poor john mayrant was all too plainly not strategizing he was playing as straight a game as the honest heart of a gentleman could inspire and so baffled at all points i said for i simply had to try something which might lead to my sharing in kings ports vibrating secret i cant make out whether she wants to marry him or not mrs gregory answered that is just what she is coming to see for herself but since her love was for his phosphates only was my natural exclamation it caused and this time i did not expect it my inveterate ladies to consult each others expressions they prolonged their silence so much that i spoke again and backing out of this sort of thing can be done i should think quite as cleverly and much more simply from a distance it was mrs weguelin who answered now or rather who headed me off have you been able to make out whether he wants to marry her or not oh he never comes near any of that with me certainly not but we all understand that he has taken a fancy to you and that you have talked much with him so they all understood this did they this too had played its little special part in the buzz very well then nothing of my private impressions should drop from my lips here to be quoted and misquoted and battledored and shuttlecocked until it reached the boy himself as it would inevitably in fantastic disarrangement i laughed oh yes i have talked much with him shakespeare i think was our latest subject mrs weguelin was plainly watching for something to drop shakespeare her tone was of surprise i then indulged myself in that most delightful sort of impertinence which consists in the other persons not seeing it you wouldnt be likely to have heard of that yet it occurred only before dinner today but we have also talked optimism pessimism sociology evolution mr mayrant would soon become quite i stopped myself on the edge of something very clumsy but sharp mrs gregory finished for me yes you mean that if he didnt live in kings port where we still have reverence at any rate he fit would imbibe all the shallow quackeries of the hour and resemble all the clever young donkeys of the minute maria mrs weguelin murmurously expostulated mrs gregory immediately made me a handsome but equivocal apology i wasnt thinking of you at all she declared gayly and it set me doubting if perhaps she hadnt after all comprehended my impertinence and thank heaven she continued john is one of us in spite of his present stubborn course but mrs weguelins beautiful eyes were resting upon me with that disapproval i had come to know to her sociology and evolution and all isms were newfangled inventions and murky with offense to touch them was defilement and in disclosing them to john mayrant i was a corrupter of youth she gathered it all up into a word that was radiant with a kind of lovely maternal gentleness we should not wish john to become radical in her voice the whole of old kings port was enshrined hereditary faith and hereditary standards mellow with the adherence of generations past and solicitous for the boy of the young generation i saw her eyes soften at the thought of him and throughout the rest of our talk to its end her gaze would now and then return to me shadowed with disapproval i addressed mrs gregory by his present stubborn course i suppose you mean the custom house all of us deplore his obstinacy his aunt eliza has strongly but vainly expostulated with him and after that miss josephine felt obliged to tell him that he need not come to see her again until he resigned a position which reflects ignominy upon us all i suppressed a whistle i thought as i have said earlier that i had caught a full vision of john mayrants present plight but my imagination had not soared to the height of miss josephine st michaels act of discipline this it must have been that the boy had checked himself from telling me in the churchyard what a character of sterner times was miss josephine i thought of aunt carola but even she was not quite of this iron and i said so to mrs gregory i doubt if there be any old lady left in the north i said capable of such antique severity but mrs gregory opened my eyes still further oh youd have them if you had the negro to deal with as we have him miss josephine she added has today removed her sentence of banishment i felt on the verge of new discoveries what i exclaimed and did she relent new circumstances intervened mrs gregory loftily explained there was an occurrence an encounter in fact in which john mayrant fittingly punished one who had presumed upon hearing of it this morning miss josephine sent a message to john that he might resume visiting her but that is perfectly grand i cried in my delight over miss josephine as a character it is perfectly natural returned mrs gregory quietly john has behaved with credit throughout he was at length made to see that circumstances forbade any breach between his family and that of the other young man john held back who would not after such an insult but miss josephine was firm and he has promised to call and shake hands my cousin doctor beaugarcon assures me that the young mans injuries are trifling a week will see him restored and presentable again a week a mere nothing i answered do you know i now suggested that you have forgotten to ask me what i was thinking about when we met bless me young gentleman and was it so remarkable not at all but it partly answers what mrs weguelin st michael asked me if a young man does not really wish to marry a young woman there are ways well known by which she can be brought to break the engagement ah said mrs gregory of course gayeties and irregularities that is if hes not above them i hastily subjoined not always by any means mrs gregory returned kings port has been treated to some episodes mrs weguelin put in a word of defence it is to be said maria that johns irregularities have invariably been conducted with perfect propriety oh said mrs gregory no mayrant was ever known to be gross but this particular young lady said mrs weguelin would not be estranged by an masculine irregularities and gayeties not many how about infidelities i suggested if he should flagrantly lose his heart to another mrs weguelin replied quickly that answers very well where hearts are in question but said i since phosphates are no longer there was a pause it would be a new dilemma mrs gregory then said slowly if she turned out to care for him after all throughout all this i was getting more and more the sense of how a total circle of people a wellfilled wide circle of interested people surrounded and cherished john mayrant made itself the setting of which he was the jewel i felt in it even stronger than the manifestation of personal affection which certainly was strong enough a collective sense of possession in him a clan value a pride and a guardianship concentrated and jealous as of an heir to some princely estate who must be worthy for the sake of a community even before he was worthy for his own sake thus he might amuse himself it was in the code that princely heirs so should pour se deniaiser as they neatly put it in paris thus might he and must he fight when his dignity was assailed but thus might he not marry outside certain lines prescribed or depart from his circles established creeds divine and social especially to hold any position which to borrow mrs gregorys phrase reflected ignominy upon them all when he transgressed their very value for him turned them bitter against him i know that all of us are more or less chained to our community which is pleased to expect us to walk its way and mightily displeased when we please ourselves instead by breaking the chain and walking our own way and i know that we are forgiven very slowly but i had not dreamed what a prisoner to communal criticism a young american could be until i beheld kings port over john mayrant and to what estate was this prince heir alas his inheritance was all of it the past and none of it the future was the full churchyard and the empty wharves he was paying dear for his princedom and then there was yet another sense of this beautiful town that i got here completely suddenly crystallized though slowly gathering ever since my arrival all these old people were clustered about one young one that was it that was the towns ultimate tragic note the old timber of the forest dying and the too sparse new growth appearing scantily amid the tall fine venerable decaying trunks it had been by no razing to the ground and sowing with salt that the city had perished a process less violent but more sad had done away with it youth in the wake of commerce had ebbed from kings port had flowed out from the silent mourning houses and sought life north and west and wherever else life was to be found into my revery floated a phrase from a melodious and once favorite song o tempo passato perche non ritorni and john mayrant why then had he tarried here himself that is a hard saying about crabbed age and youth but are not most of the sayings hard that are true what was this young man doing in kings port with his brains and his pride and his energetic adolescence if the custom house galled him the whole country was open to him why not have tried his fortune out and away over the hills where the new cities lie all full of future and empty of past was it much to the credit of such a young man to find himself at the age of twentythree or twentyfour sound and lithe of limb yet tied to the apron strings of miss josephine and miss eliza and some thirty or forty other elderly female relatives with these thoughts i looked at the ladies and wondered how i might lead them to answer me about john mayrant without asking questions which might imply something derogatory to him or painful to them i could not ever say to them a word which might mean however indirectly that i thought their beautiful cherished town no place for a young man to go to seed in this cut so close to the quick of truth that discourse must keep wide away from it what then could i ask them as i pondered mrs weguelin solved it for me by what she was saying to mrs gregory of which in my preoccupation i had evidently missed a part if he should share the family bad taste in wives eliza says she has no fear of that were i eliza hughs performance would make me very uneasy julia john does not resemble hugh very decidedly in coloring maria and hugh found that girl in minneapolis julia where there was doubtless no pick for the poor fellow and remember that george chose a lady at any rate mrs weguelin gave to this a short assent yes it portended something more behind which her next words duly revealed a lady but do any ladies ever seem quite like our own certainly not julia you see they were forgetting me again but they had furnished me with a clue mr john mayrant has married brothers two mrs gregory responded john is the youngest of three children i hadnt heard of the brothers before they seldom come here they saw fit to leave their home and their delicate mother oh but john said mrs gregory met his responsibility like a mayrant whatever temptations he has yielded to said mrs weguelin his filial piety has stood proof he refused added mrs gregory when george and i have never understood how george could be so forgetful of their mother wrote twice offering him a lucrative and rising position in the railroad company at roanoke that was hard i exclaimed she totally misapplied my sympathy oh anna mayrant she corrected herself johns mother mrs hector mayrant had harder things than forgetful sons to bear ive not laid eyes on those boys since the funeral nearly two years murmured mrs weguelin and then to me with something that was almost like a strange severity beneath her gentle tone therefore we are proud of john because the better traits in his nature remind us of his forefathers whom we knew in kings port said mrs gregory we prize those who ring true to the blood by way of response to this sentiment i quoted some french to her bon chien chasse de race it pleased mrs weguelin her guarded attitude toward me relented john mentioned your cultivation to us she said in these tumbledown days it is rare to meet with one who still lives mentally on the gentlefolks plane the piano nobile of intelligence i realized how high a compliment she was paying me and i repaid it with a joke take care those who dont live there would call it the piano snobile ah cried the delighted lady theyd never have the wit did you ever hear i continued the bostonians remark the mission of america is to vulgarize the world i never expected to agree so totally with a bostonian declared mrs gregory nothing so hopeful i pursued has ever been said of us for refinement and thoroughness and tradition delay progress and we are sweeping them out of the road as fast as we can come away julia said mrs gregory the young gentleman is getting flippant again and we leave him the ladies after gracious expressions concerning the pleasure of their stroll descended the steps at the north end of high walk where the parapet stops and turned inland from the water through a little street i watched them until they went out of my sight round a corner but the two silent leisurely figures moving in their black and their veils along an empty highway come back to me often in the pictures of my thoughts come back most often indeed as the human part of what my memory sees when it turns to look at kings port for first it sees the blue frame of quiet sunny water and the white town within its frame beneath the clear untainted air and then it sees the highslanted roofs red with their old corrugated tiles and the tops of leafy enclosures dipping below sight among quaint and huddled quadrangles and next the quiet houses standing in their separate grounds their narrow ends to the street and their long twostoried galleries open to the south but their hushed windows closed as if against the prying restless present that must not look in and disturb the motionless memories which sit brooding behind these shutters and between all these silent mansions lie the narrow streets the quiet empty streets along which as my memory watches them pass the two ladies silently in their black and their veils moving between high mellowcolored garden walls over whose tops look the oleanders the climbing roses and all the taller flowers of the gardens and if mrs gregory and mrs weguelin seemed to me at moments as narrow as those streets they also seemed to me as lovely as those serene gardens and if i had smiled at their prejudices i had loved their innocence their deep innocence of the poisoned age which has succeeded their own and if i had wondered this day at their powers for cruelty i wondered the next day at the glimpse i had of their kindness for during a pelting cold rainstorm as i sat and shivered in a royal street car waiting for it to start upon its northbound course the housedoor opposite which we stood at the end of the track opened and mrs weguelins head appeared nodding to the conductor as she sent her black servant out with hot coffee for him he took off his hat and smiled and thanked her and when we had started and i the sole passenger in the chilly car asked him about this he said with native pride the ladies always watches out for us conductors in stormy weather sir thats mistress weguelin st michael one of our finest and then he gave me careful directions how to find a shop that i was seeking think of this happening in new york think of the aristocracy of that metropolis warming up with coffee the but why think of it or of a new york conductor answering your questions with careful directions it is not new yorks fault it is merely new yorks misfortune new york is in a hurry and a world of haste cannot be a world either of courtesy or of kindness but we have progress progress instead and that is a tremendous consolation xi daddy ben and his seed but what was hortense rieppe coming to see for herself many dark things had been made plain to me by my talk with the two ladies yet while disclosing so much they had still left this important matter in shadow i was very glad however for what they had revealed they had showed me more of john mayrants character and more also of the destiny which had shaped his ends so that my esteem for him had increased for some of the words that they had exchanged shone like bright lanterns down into his nature upon strength and beauty lying quietly there young strength and beauty yet already tempered by manly sacrifice i saw how it came to pass through this through renunciation of his own desires through performance of duties which had fallen upon him not quite fairly that the eye of his spirit had been turned away from self thus had it grown strongsighted and able to look far and deep as his speech sometimes revealed while still his flesh was of his youthful age and no saints flesh either this had the ladies taught me during the fluttered interchange of their reminders and opinions and by their eager agreements and disagreements i was also grateful to them in that i could once more correct juno the pleasure should be mine to tell them in the public hearing of our table that miss rieppe was still engaged to john mayrant but what was this interesting girl coming to see for herself this little hole in my knowledge gave me discomfort as i walked along toward the antiquity shop where i was to buy the other kettlesupporter the ladies with all their freedom of comment and censure had kept something from me i reviewed i pieced together their various remarks those oracles especially which they had let fall but it all came back to the same thing i did not know and they did what hortense rieppe was coming to see for herself at all events the engagement was not broken the chance to be instrumental in having it broken was still mine i might still save john mayrant from his deplorable quixotism and as this reflection grew with me i took increasing comfort in it and i stepped onward toward my kettlesupporter filled with that sense of moral wellbeing which will steal over even the humblest of us when we feel that we are beneficently minding somebody elses business whenever the arrangement did not take me too widely from my course i so mapped out my walks and errands in kings port that i might pass by the churchyard and church at the corner of court and worship streets even if i did not indulge myself by turning in to stroll and loiter among the flowers it was enough pleasure to walk by that brickwall if you are willing to wander curiously in our old towns you may still find in many of them good brick walls standing undisturbed and equal in their color and simple excellence to those of kings port but fashion has pushed these others out of its sight among back streets and all sorts of forgotten purlieus and abandoned dignity and takes its walks today amid cold expensive ugliness while the old brick walls of kings port continually frame your steps with charm no one workman famous for his skill built them so well proportioned so true to comeliness it was the general hand of their age that could shape nothing wrong as the hand of today can shape nothing right save by a rigid following of the old i gave myself the pleasure this afternoon of walking by the churchyard wall and when i reached the iron gate there was daddy ben so full was i of my thoughts concerning john mayrant and the vicissitudes of his heart and the custom house that i was moved to have words with the old man upon the general topic well i said and so mr john is going to be married no attempt to start a chat ever failed more signally he assented with a manner of mingled civility and reserve that was perfection and after the two syllables of which his answer consisted he remained as impenetrably respectful as before i felt rather high and dry but i tried it again and im sure daddy ben that you feel as sorry as any of the family that the phosphates failed again he replied with his two syllables of assent and again he stood mute respectful a little bent with his great age but now his good manners and better manners were never seen impelled him to break silence upon some subject since he would not permit himself to speak concerning the one which i had introduced it was the phosphates which inspired him dey is mighty fine prostrate wukks heah sah yes ive been told so daddy ben on dis side up de ribber an tudder side down de ribber cross de new bridge wuth visitin fo strangers sah i now felt entirely high and dry i had attempted to enter into conversation with him about the intimate affairs of a family to which he felt that he belonged and with perfect tact he had not only declined to discuss them with me but had delicately informed me that i was a stranger and as such had better visit the phosphate works among the other sights of kings port no diplomat could have done it better and as i walled away from him i knew that he regarded me as an outsider a northerner belonging to a race hostile to his people he had seen mas john friendly with me but that was mas johns affair and so it was that if the ladies had kept something from me this cunning old polite coalblack african had kept everything from me if all the negroes in kings port were like daddy ben mrs gregory st michael would not have spoken of having them to deal with and the girl behind the counter would not have been thrown into such indignation when she alluded to their conceit and ignorance daddy ben had so far from being puffed up by the appointment in the custom house disapproved of this i had heard enough about the difference between the old and new generations of the negro of kings port to believe it to be true and i had come to discern how evidently it lay at the bottom of many things here john mayrant and his kind were a band united by a number of strong ties but by nothing so much as by their hatred of the modern negro in their town yes i was obliged to believe that the young kings port african left to freedom and the ballot was a worse african than his slave parents but this afternoon brought me a taste of it more pungent than all the assurances in the world i bought my kettlesupporter and learned from the robber who sold it to me kings port prices for old things are the most exorbitant that i know anywhere that a carpenter lived not far from mrs trevises boardinghouse and that he would make for me the box in which i could pack my various purchases that is if hes working this week added the robber what else would he be doing it may be his week for getting drunk on what he earned the week before and upon this he announced with as much bitterness as if he had been john mayrant or any of his aunts thats what boston philanthropy has done for him i dared up at this i suppose thats a southern argument for reestablishing slavery i am not southern breslau is my native town and i came from new york here to live five years ago ive seen what your emancipation has done for the black and i say to you my friend honest i dont know a fool from a philanthropist any longer he had much right upon his side and it can be seen daily that philanthropy does not always walk handinhand with wisdom does anything or anybody always walk so moreover i am a friend to not many superlatives and have perceived no saying to be more true than the one that extremes meet they meet indeed and folly is their meetingplace nor could i say in the case of the negro which folly were the more ridiculous that which expects a race which has lived no one knows how many thousand years in mental nakedness while confucius moses and napoleon were flowering upon adjacent human stems should put on suddenly the white mans intelligence or that other folly which declares we can do nothing for the african as if hampton had not already wrought excellent things for him i had no mind to enter into all the inextricable error with this teuton and it was he who continued oh these boston philanthropists oh these knowitalls why dont they stay home why do they come down here to worry us with their ignorance see here my friend let me show you he rushed about his shop in a search of distraught eagerness and with a multitude of small exclamations until screeching jubilantly once he pounced upon a shabby and learnedlooking volume this he brought me thrusting it with his trembling fingers between my own and shuffling the open pages but when the apparently right one was found he exclaimed no i have better and dashed away to a pile of pamphlets on the floor where he began to plough and harrow wondering if i was closeted with a maniac i looked at the book in my passive hand and saw diagrams of various bones to me unknown and mens names of which i was equally ignorant mivart topinard and more but at last that of huxley but this agreeable sight was spoiled at once by the quite horrible words nycticebidoe platyrrhine catarrhine from which i raised my eyes to see him coming at me with two pamphlets and scolding as he came are you educated yes have been to college yes then perhaps you will understand certainly i understood immediately that he and his pamphlets were as bad as the book or worse in their use of a vocabulary designed to cause almost any listener the gravest inconvenience common eocene ancestors occurred at the beginning of his lecture and i believed that if it got no stronger than this i could at least preserve the appearance of comprehending him but it got stronger and at sacroiliac notch i may say without using any grossly exaggerated expression that i became unconscious at least all intelligence left me when it returned he was saying but this is only the beginning come in here to my crania and jaws evidently he held me hypnotized for he now hurried me unresisting through a back door into a dark little where he turned up the gas and i saw shelves as in a museum to one of which he led me i suppose that it was curiosity that rendered me thus sheeplike upon the shelf were a number of skulls and jaws in admirable condition and graded arrangement beginning to the left with that flat kind of skull which one associates with gorillas he resumed his scolding harangue and for a few brief moments i understood him here told by themselves was as much of the story of the skulls as we know from manlike apes through glacial man to the modern senator or railroad president but my intelligence was destined soon to die away again that is the caucasian skull your skull he said touching a specimen at the right interesting i murmured im afraid i know nothing about skulls but you shall know someding before you leave he retorted wagging his head at me and this time it was not the book but a specimen that he pushed into my grasp he gave it a name not as bad as platyrrhine but i feared worse was coming then he took it away from me gave me another skull and while i obediently held it pronounced something quite beyond me and what is the translation of that he demanded excitedly tell me i feebly answered he shouted with overweening triumph the translation of that is south carolina nigger notice well this so egcellent specimen prognathous megadont platyrrhine ha platyrrhine i saluted the one word i recognized as i drowned you have said it yourself was his extraordinary answer for what had i said almost as if he were going to break into a dance for joy he took the caucasian skull and the other two and set the three together by themselves away from the rest of the collection the picture which they thus made spoke more than all the measurements and statistics which he now chattered out upon me reading from his book as i contemplated the skulls there was a similarity of shape a kinship there between the three which stared you in the face but in the contours of vaulted skull the projecting jaws and the great molar teeth what was to be seen why in every respect that the african departed from the caucasian he departed in the direction of the ape here was zoology mutely but eloquently telling us why there had blossomed no confucius no moses no napoleon upon that black stem why no iliad no parthenon no sistine madonna had ever risen from that tropic mud the collector touched my sleeve have you now learned someding about skulls my friend will you invite those boston philanthropists to stay home they will get better results in civilization by giving votes to monkeys than teaching henry wadsworth longfellow to riggers retaliation rose in me havent you learned to call them negroes i remarked but this was lost upon the teuton i was tempted to tell him that i was no philanthropist and no bostonian and that he need not shout so loud but my more dignified instincts restrained me i withdrew my sleeve from his touch it was this act of his i think that had most to do with my displeasure and merely bidding him observe that the enormous price of the kettlesupporter had been reduced for me by his exhibition to a bagatelle i left the shop of the screaming anatomist or afropath or whatever it may seem most fitting that he should be called i bore the kettlesupporter with me tied up objectionably in newspaper and knotted with ungainly string and it was this bundle which prevented my joining the girl behind the counter and ending by a walk with a young lady the afternoon that had begun by a walk with two old ones i should have liked to make my confession to her she was evidently out for the sake of taking the air and had with her no companion save the big curly white dog confession would have been very agreeable but i looked again at my ugly newspaper bundle and turned in a direction that she was not herself pursuing twice as i went i broke into laughter over my interview in the shop which i fear has lost its comical quality in the relating to enter a door and come serenely in among dingy mahogany and glass objects to bargain haughtily for a brass bauble with the shopkeeper and to have a few exchanged remarks suddenly turn the whole place into a sort of bedlam with a gibbering scientist dashing skulls at me to prove his fixed idea and myself quite furious i laughed more than twice but by the time i had approached the neighborhood of the carpenters shop another side of it had brought reflection to my mind here was a foreigner to whom slavery and the lost cause were nothing whose whole association with the south had begun but five years ago and the race question had brought his feelings to this pitch he had seen the kings port negro with the eyes of the flesh and not with the eyes of theory and as a result the reddest rag for him was pale beside a boston philanthropist nevertheless i have said already that i am no lover of superlatives and in doctrine especially is this true we need not expect a confucius from the negro nor yet a chesterfield but i am an enemy also of that blind and base hate against him which conducts nowhere save to the decivilizing of white and black alike who brought him here did he invite himself then let us make the best of it and teach him lead him compel him to live selfrespecting not as statesman poet or financier but by the honorable toil of his hand and sweat of his brow because the door of hope was once opened too suddenly for him is no reason for slamming it now forever in his face thus mentally i lectured back at the teuton as i went through the streets of kings port and after a while i turned a corner which took me abruptly as with one magic step out of the white mans world into the blackest congo even the wellinhabited quarter of kings port and i had now come within this limited domain holds narrow lanes and recesses which teem and swarm with negroes as cracks will run through fine porcelain so do these black rifts of africa lurk almost invisible among the gardens and the houses the picture that these places offered tropic squalid and fecund often caused me to walk through them and watch the basking population the intricate broken wooden galleries the rickety outside stair cases the red and yellow splashes of color on the clothes lines the agglomerate rags that stuffed holes in decaying roofs or hung nakedly on human frames the small choked dwellings bursting open at doors and windows with black roundeyed babies as an overripe melon bursts with seeds the children playing marbles in the court the parents playing cards in the room the grandparents smoking pipes on the porch and the greatgrandparents stairs gazing out at you like creatures from the old testament or the jungle from the jungle we had stolen them north and south had stolen them together long ago to be slaves not to be citizens and now here they were the fruits of our theft and for some reason possibly the teuton was the reason that passage from the book of exodus came into my head for i the lord thy god am a jealous god visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children these thoughts were interrupted by sounds as of altercation i had nearly reached the end of the lane where i should again emerge into the white mans world and where i was now walking the lane spread into a broader space with ells and angles and rotting steps and habitations mostly too ruinous to be inhabited it was from a sashless window in one of these that the angry voices came the first words which were distinct aroused my interest quite beyond the scale of an ordinary altercation calls youself a reconstuckted niggah this was said sharply and with prodigious scorn the answer which it brought was lengthy and of such a general sullen incoherence that i could make out only a frequent repetition of custom house and that somebody was going to take care of somebody hereafter into this the first voice broke with tones of highest contempt and rapidity president gwine to gib brekfus an dinnah an suppah to de likes ob you fo de whole remaindah oh youh wuthless natral life get out ob my sight you reconstuckted niggah i come out oh de st michael there came through the window immediately upon this sounds of scuffling and of a fall and then cries for help which took me running into the dilapidated building daddy ben lay on the floor and a thick young savage was kicking him in some remarkable way i thought of the solidity of their heads and before the assailant even knew that he had a witness i sped forward aiming my kettlesupporter and with its sharp brass edge i dealt him a crack over his shin with astonishing accuracy it was a dismal howl that he gave and as he turned he got from me another crack upon the other shin i had no time to be alarmed at my deed or i think that i should have been very much so i am a man above all of peace and physical encounters are peculiarly abhorrent to me but so far from assailing me the thick young savage with the single muttered remark he hit me fuss got himself out of the house with the most agreeable rapidity daddy ben sat up and his first inquiry greatly reassured me as to his state he stared at my paper bundle you done make him hollah wid dat sah i showed him the kettlesupporter through a rent in its wrapping and i assisted him to stand upright his injuries proved fortunately to be slight although i may say here that the shock to his ancient body kept him away for a few days from the churchyard and when i began to talk to him about the incident he seemed unwilling to say much in answer to my questions and when i offered to accompany him to where he lived he declined altogether assuring me that it was close and that he could walk there as well as if nothing had happened to him but upon my asking him if i was on the right way to the carpenters shop he looked at me curiously no use you gwine dab sah dat shop close up he not wukkin dis week and dat why fo i jaw him jus now when you come in an stop him he de cahpentah my granson chas coteswuth xii from the bedside next morning when i saw the weltering sky i resigned myself to a day of dullness yet before its end i had caught a bright new glimpse of john mayrants abilities and also had come through tribulation to a further understanding of the south so that i do not today regret the tribulation as the rain disappointed me of two outdoor expeditions to which i had been for some little while looking forward i dedicated most of my long morning to a sadly neglected correspondence and trusted that the expeditions as soon as the next fine weather visited kings port would still be in store for me not only everybody in town here but aunt carola up in the north also had assured me that to miss the sight of live oaks when the azaleas in the gardens of that country seat were in flower would be to lose one of the rarest and most beautiful things which could be seen anywhere and so i looked out of my window at the furious storm hoping that it might not strip the bushes at live oaks of their bloom which recent tourists at mrs trevises had described as drawing near the zenith of its luxuriance the other excursion to udolpho with john mayrant was not so likely to fall through udolpho was a sort of hunting lodge or country club near tern creek and an old colonial church so old that it bore the royal arms upon a shield still preserved as a sign of its colonial origin a note from mayrant received at breakfast informed me that the rain would take all pleasure from such an excursion and that he should seize the earliest opportunity the weather might afford to hold me to my promise the wet gale even as i sat writing was beating down some of the fullblown flowers in the garden next mrs trevises house and as the morning wore on i watched the paths grow more strewn with broken twigs and leaves i filled my correspondence with accounts of daddy ben and his grandson the carpenter doubtless from some pride in my part in that but also because it had become through thinking it over even more interesting today than it had been at the moment of its occurrence and in replying to a sort of postscript of aunt carolas in which she hurriedly wrote that she had forgotten to say she had heard the la heu family in south carolina was related to the bombos and should be obliged to me if i would make inquiries about this i told her that it would be easy and then described to her the teuton plying his antiquity trade externally while internally cherishing his collected skulls and nursing his scientific rage all my letters were the more abundant concerning these adventures of mine from my having kept entirely silent upon them at mrs trevises teatable i dreaded juno when let loose upon the negro question and the fact that i was beginning to understand her feelings did not at all make me wish to be deafened by them neither juno therefore nor any of them learned a word from me about the kettlesupporter incident what i did take pains to inform the assembled company was my gratification that the report of mr mayrants engagement being broken was unfounded and this caused juno to observe that in that case miss rieppe must have the most imperative reasons for uniting herself to such a young man unintimidated by the rain this formidable creature had taken herself off to her nephews bedside almost immediately after breakfast and later in the day i too risked a drenching for the sake of ordering the packingbox that i needed when i returned it was close on teatime i had seen mrs weguelin st michael send out the hot coffee to the conductor and i had found a negro carpenter whose week it happily was to stay sober and now i learned that when tea should be finished the poetess had in store for us as a treat her ode our evening meal was not plain sailing even for the veteran navigation of mrs trevise juno had returned from the bedside very plainly displeased she was always candid even when silent by something which had happened there and before the joyful moment came when we all learned what this was a very gouty boston lady who had arrived with her husband from florida on her way north and whose nature you will readily grasp when i tell you that we found ourselves speaking of the man as mrs braintrees husband and never as mr braintree this crippled lady who was of a candor equal to junos embarked upon a conversation with juno that compelled mrs trevise to tinkle her bell for daphne after only two remarks had been exchanged i had been sorry at first that here in this southern boardinghouse boston should be represented only by a lady who appeared to unite in herself all the stony products of that city and none of the others for she was as convivial as a statue and as wellinformed as a spellingbook she stood no more for the whole of boston than did juno for the whole of kings port but my sorrow grew less when i found that in mrs braintree we had indeed a capable match for her southern counterpart juno according to her custom had remembered something objectionable that had been perpetrated in by the northern vandals edward said mrs braintree to her husband in a frightfully clear voice it was at chambersburg was it not that the southern vandals burned the house in which were your fathers titledeeds edward who it appeared had fought through the whole civil war and was in consequence perfectly goodhumored and peaceable in his feelings upon that subject replied hastily and amiably oh yes yes why i believe it was but this availed nothing juno bent her great height forward and addressed mrs braintree this is the first time i have been told southerners were vandals you will never be able to say that again replied mrs braintree after the bell and daphne had stopped the invaluable briton addressed a genial generalization to us all i often think how truly awful your war would have been if the women had fought it yknow instead of the men quite so said the easygoing edward squaws mutilation yes and he laughed at his little joke but he laughed alone i turned to juno speaking of mutilation i trust your nephew is better this evening i was rejoiced by receiving a glare in response but still more joy was to come an apology ought to help cure him a lot observed the briton juno employed her policy of not hearing him indeed i trust that your nephew is in less pain said the poetess juno was willing to answer this the injuries thank you are the merest trifles all that such a lightweight could inflict and she shrugged her shoulders to indicate the futility of young johns pugilism but the surprised briton interposed i thought you said your nephew was too feeble to eat steak or hear poetry juno could always stem the eddy of her own contradictions but she did raise her voice a little i fancy sir that doctor beaugarcon knows what he is talking about have they apologized yet inquired the male honeymooner from the upcountry my nephew sir nobly consented to shake hands this afternoon he did it entirely out of respect for mr mayrants family who coerced him into this tardy reparation and who feel unable to recognize him since his treasonable attitude in the custom house must be fairly hard to coerce a chap you cant recognize said the briton an et cetera now spoke to the honeymoon bride from the upcountry i heard doctor beaugarcon say he was coming to visit you this evening yais assented the bride doctor beaugarcon is my mothers fourth cousin juno now took most unwisely as it proved a vindictive turn at me i knew that your friend mr mayrant was intemperate she began i dont think that mrs trevise had any intention to ring for daphne at this point her curiosity was too lively but juno was going to risk no such intervention and i saw her lay a precautionary hand heavily down over the bell but she continued i did not know that mr mayrant was a gambler have you ever seen him intemperate i asked that would be quite needless juno returned and of the gambling i have ocular proof since i found him cards counters and money with my sick nephew he had actually brought cards in his pocket i suppose said the briton your nephew was too sick to resist him the male honeymooner with two of the et ceteras made such unsteady demonstrations at this that mrs trevise protracted our sitting no longer she rose and this meant rising for us all a sense of regret and incompleteness filled me and finding the briton at my elbow as our company proceeded toward the sitting room i said too bad his whisper was confident well get the rest of it out of her yet but the rest of it came without our connivance in the sitting room doctor beaugarcon sat waiting and at sight of juno entering the door she headed our irregular procession he sprang up and lifted admiring hands oh why didnt i have an aunt like you he exclaimed and to mrs trevise as she followed she pays her nephews poker debts how much cousin tom asked the upcountry bride and the gay old doctor chuckled as he kissed her thirty dollars this afternoon my darling at this the briton dragged me behind a door in the hall and there we danced together that mayrant chap will do he declared and we composed ourselves for a proper entrance into the sitting room where the introductions had been made and where doctor beaugarcon and mrs braintrees husband had already fallen into war reminiscences and were discovering with mutual amiability that they had fought against each other in a number of battles and you generally licked us smiled the union soldier ah dont i know myself how it feels to run laughed the confederate are you down at the club but upon learning from the poetess that her ode was now to be read aloud doctor beaugarcon paid his fourth cousins daughter a brief though affectionate visit lamenting that a very ill patient should compel him to take himself away so immediately but promising her presently in his stead two visitors much more interesting miss josephine st michael desires to call upon you he said and i fancy that her nephew will escort her in all this rain said the bride oh its letting up letting up good night mistress trevise good night sir i am glad to have met you he shook hands with mrs braintrees husband we fellows he whispered who fought in the war have had war enough and bidding the general company good night and kissing the bride again he left us even as the poetess returned from her room with the manuscript i soon wished that i had escaped with him because i feared what mrs braintree might say when the verses should be finished and so i think did her husband we should have taken the hint which tactful doctor beaugarcon had meant i began to believe to give us in that whispered remark of his but it had been given too lightly and so we sat and heard the ode out i am sure that the poetess wrapped in the thoughts of her own composition had lost sight of all but the phrasing of her poem and the strong feelings which it not unmusically voiced there is no other way to account for her being willing to read it in mrs braintrees presence whatever gayety had filled me when the boston lady had clashed with juno was now changed to deprecation and concern indeed i myself felt almost as if i were being physically struck by the words until mere bewilderment took possession of me and after bewilderment a little a very little light which however rapidly increased we were the victors we the north and we had gone upon our way with songs and rejoicing able to forget because we were the victors we had our victory let the vanquished have their memory but here was the cry of the vanquished coming after forty years it was the time which at first bewildered me juno had seen the war junos bitterness i could comprehend even if i could not comprehend her freedom in expressing it but the poetess could not be more than a year or two older than i was she had come after it was all over why should she prolong such memories and feelings but my light increased as i remembered she had not written this for us and that if she had not seen the flames of war she had seen the ashes for the ashes i had seen myself here in kings port and had been overwhelmed by the sight forty years later more overwhelmed than i could possibly say to mrs gregory st michael or mrs weguelin or anybody the strain of sitting and waiting for the end made my hands cold and my head hot but nevertheless the light which had come enabled me to bend instantly to mrs braintree and murmur a great and abused quotation to her tout comprendre cest tout pardonner but my petition could not move her she was too old she had seen the flames of war and so she said to her husband edward will you please help me upstairs and thus the lame irreconcilable lady left the room with the assistance of her unhappy warrior who must have suffered far more keenly than i did this departure left us all in a constraint which was becoming unbearable when the blessed doorbell rang and delivered us and miss josephine st michael entered with john mayrant he wore a most curious expression his eyes went searching about the room and at length settled upon juno with a light in them as impish as that which had flickered in my own mood before the ode to my surprise miss josephine advanced and gave me a special and marked greeting before this she had always merely bowed to me tonight she held out her hand of course my visit is not to you but i am very glad to find you here and express the appreciation of several of us for your timely aid to daddy ben he feels much shame in having said nothing to you himself and while i muttered those inevitable modest nothings which fit such occasions miss st michael recounted to the bride whom she was ostensibly calling upon and to the rest of our now once more harmonious circle my adventures in the alleys of africa these loomed even with miss st michaels perfectly quiet and simple rendering of them almost of heroic size thanks doubtless to daddy bens tropical imagery when he first told the tale and before they were over miss st michaels marked recognition of me actually brought from juno some reflected recognition only this resembled in its graciousness the original about as correctly as a hollow spoon reflects the human countenance divine still it was at junos own request that i brought down from my chamber and displayed to them the kettlesupporter i have said that miss st michaels visit was ostensibly to the bride and that is because for some magnetic reason or other i felt diplomacy like an undercurrent passing among our chairs young johns expression deepened whenever he watched juno to a devilishness which his polite manners veiled no better than a mosquito netting and i believe that his aunt on account of the battle between their respective nephews had for family reasons deemed it advisable to pay indirectly under cover of the bride a state visit to juno and i think that i saw juno accepting it as a state visit and that the two together without using a word of spoken language gave each other to understand that the recent deplorable circumstances were a closed incident i think that his aunt josephine had desired young john to pay a visit likewise and to make sure of his speedy compliance had brought him along with her coerced him as juno would have said he wore somewhat the look of having been coerced and he contributed remarkably few observations to the talk it was all harmonious and decorous and properly conducted this state visit yet even so juno and john exchanged at parting some verbal sweetmeats which rather stuck out from the smooth meringue of diplomacy she contemplated his bruise you are feeling stronger i hope than you have been lately a bridegrooms health should be good he thanked her i am feeling better tonight than for many weeks the rascal had the thirty dollars visibly bulging that moment in his pocket i doubt if he had acquainted his aunt with this episode but she was certain to hear it soon and when she did hear it i rather fancy that she wished to smile as i completely smiled alone in my bed that night thinking young john over but i did not go to sleep smiling listening to the ode for the daughters of dixie had been an ordeal too truly painful because it disclosed live feelings which i had thought were dead or rather it disclosed that those feelings smouldered in the young as well as in the old doctor beaugarcon didnt have them he had fought them out just as mr braintree had fought them out and mrs braintree like juno retained them because she hadnt fought them out and john mayrant didnt have them because he had been to other places and i didnt have them never had had them in my life because i came into the world when it was all over why then stop i told myself growing very wakeful and seeing in the darkness the light which had come to me you have beheld the ashes and even the sight has overwhelmed you these others were born in the ashes and have had ashes to sleep in and ashes to eat this i said to myself and i remembered that war hadnt been all that reconstruction came in due season and i thought of the reconstructed negro as daddy ben had so ingeniously styled him these white people my race had been set beneath the reconstructed negro still still this did not justify the whole of it to me my perfectly innocent generation seemed to be included in the unforgiving unforgetting ode i must have it out with somebody i said and in time i fell asleep xiii the girl behind the counter iii i was still thinking the ode over as i dressed for breakfast for which i was late owing to my hair which the changes in the weather had rendered somewhat recalcitrant yes decidedly i must have it out with somebody the weather was once more superb and in the garden beneath my window men were already sweeping away the broken twigs and debris of the storm i say already because it had not seemed to me to be the kings port custom to remove debris or anything with speed i also had it in my mind to perform at lunch aunt carolas commission and learn if the family of la heu were indeed of royal descent through the bombos i intended to find this out from the girl behind the counter but the course which our conversation took led me completely to forget about it as soon as i entered the exchange i planted myself in front of the counter in spite of the discouragement which i too plainly perceived in her countenance the unfavorable impression which i had made upon her at our last interview was still in force i plunged into it at once i have a confession to make you do me surprising honor oh now dont begin like that i suppose you never told a lie im telling the truth now when i say that i do not see why an entire stranger should confess anything to me oh my goodness well i told you a lie anyhow a great successful deplorable lie she opened her mouth under the shock of it and i recited to her unsparingly my deception during this recital her mouth gradually closed well i declare declare declare she slowly and deliciously breathed over the sum total and she considered me at length silently before her words came again like a soft soliloquy i could never have believed it in one who here gayety flashed in her eyes suddenly parts his back hair so rigidly oh i beg your pardon for being personal and her gayety broke in ripples some habitual instinct moved me to turn to the lookingglass useless she cried you cant see it in that but its perfectly splendid today nature has been kind to me in many ways nay prodigal it is not every man who can perceive the humor in a jest of which he is himself the subject i laughed with her i trust that i am forgiven i said oh yes you are forgiven come out general and give the gentleman your right paw and tell him that he is forgiven if only for the sake of daddy ben with these latter words she gave me a gracious nod of understanding they were all thanking me for the kettlesupporter she probably knew also the tale of john mayrant the cards and the bedside the curly dog came out and went through his part very graciously i can guess his last name i remarked generals how oh youve heard it i dont believe in you any more thats not a bit handsome after my confession no im getting to understand south carolina a little you came from the upcountry you call your dog general his name is general hampton her laughter assented tell me some more about south carolina she added with her caressing insinuation well to begin with go sit down at your lunchtable first aunt josephine would never tolerate my encouraging gentlemen to talk to me over the counter i went back obediently and then resumed well what sort of people are those who own the handsome garden behind mrs trevises i dont know them thank you thats all i wanted what do you mean theyre new people i could tell it from the way you stuck your nose in the air sir oh if you talk about my hair i can talk about your nose i think i suspected that they were new people because they cleaned up their garden immediately after the storm this morning now ill tell you something else the whole south looks down on the whole north she made her voice kind do you mind it very much i joined in her latent mirth it makes life not worth living but more than this south carolina looks down on the whole south not virginia not an entire stranger you know sometimes notices things which escape the family eye family likenesses in the children for instance never virginia she persisted very well very well somehow youve admitted the rest however she began to smile and next kings port looks down on all the rest of south carolina she now laughed outright an upcountry girl will not deny that anyhow and finally your aunts my aunts are kings port the whole of it if you mean the thirty thousand negroes no there are other white people here there goes your nose again i will not have you so impudent sir a thousand pardons im on my knees but your aunts there was such a flash of war in her eye that i stopped may i not even mention them i asked her and suddenly upon this she became serious and gentle i thought that you understood them would you take them from their seclusion too it is all they have left since you burned the rest in i had made her say what i wanted that you was what i wanted now i should presently have it out with her but for the moment i did not disclaim the you i said the burning in was horrible but it was war it was outrage yes the same kind as englands who burned washington in and whom you all so deeply admire she had it seemed no answer to this but we trembled on the verge of a real quarrel it was in her voice when she said i think i interrupted you i pushed the risk one step nearer the verge because of the words i wished finally to reach in when england burned our white house down we did not sit in the ashes we set about rebuilding and now she burst out thats not fair thats perfectly inexcusable did england then set loose on us a pack of black savages and politicians to help us rebuild why this very day i cannot walk on the other side of the river i dare not venture off the new bridge and you who first beat us and then unleashed the blacks to riot in a new equality that they were no more fit for than so many apes you sat back at ease in your victory and your progress having handed the vote to the negro as you might have handed a kerosene lamp to a child of three and let us crushed breathless people cope with the chaos and destruction that never came near you why how can you dare once again admirably she pulled herself up as she had done when she spoke of the president i mustnt she declared half whispering and then more clearly and calmly i mustnt and she shook her head as if shaking something off nor must you she finished charmingly and quietly with a smile i will not i assured her she was truly noble but i did think that you understood us she said pensively miss la heu when you talked to me about the president and the white house i said that you were hard to answer do you remember perfectly i said i was glad you found me so you helped me to understand you then and now i want to be helped to further understanding last night i heard the ode for the daughters of dixie i had a bad time listening to that do you presume to criticise it do we criticise your grand army reunions and your marching through georgia and your john browns body and your arlington museum can we not be allowed to celebrate our heroes and our glories and sing our songs she had helped me already still still the something i was groping for the something which had given me such pain during the ode remained undissolved remained unanalyzed between us i still had to have it out with her and the point was that it had to be with her and not simply with myself alone we must thrash out together the way to an understanding an agreement was not in the least necessary we could agree to differ for that matter with perfect cordiality but an understanding we must reach and as i was thinking this my light increased and i saw clearly the ultimate thing which lay at the bottom of my own feeling and which had been strangely confusing me all along this discovery was the key to the whole remainder of my talk i never let go of it the first thing it opened for me was that eliza la heu didnt understand me which was quite natural since i had only just this moment become clear to myself many of us i began who have watched the soiling touch of politics make dirty one clean thing after another would not be wholly desolated to learn that the grand army of the republic had gone to another world to sing its songs and draw its pensions she looked astonished and then she laughed down in the south here she was too far away to feel the vile uses to which present politics had turned past heroism but i continued we havent any daughters of the union banded together and handing it down it she echoed well if the deeds of your heroes are not a sacred trust to you dont invite us please to resemble you i waited for more and a little more came we consider northerners foreigners you know again i felt that hurt which hearing the ode had given me but i now knew how i was going to take it and where we were presently coming out and i knew she didnt mean quite all that didnt mean it every day at least and that my speech had driven her to saying it no miss la heu you dont consider northerners who understand you to be foreigners we have never met any of that sort yes i thought but you really want to didnt you say you hoped i was one away down deep theres a cry of kinship in you and that you dont hear it and that we dont hear it has been as much our fault as yours i see that very well now but im afraid to tell you so yet what i said was were handing the sacred trust down i hope i understood you to say you werent i said we were not handing it down i didnt wonder that irritation again moulded her reply you must excuse a daughter of dixie if she finds the words of a son of the union beyond her we havent had so many advantages there she touched what i had thought over during my wakeful hours the tale of the ashes the desolate ashes the war had not prevented my parents from sending me to school and college but here the old had seen the young grow up starved of what their fathers had given them and the young had looked to the old and known their stripped heritage miss la heu i said i could not tell you you would not wish me to tell you what the sight of kings port has made me feel but you will let me say this i have understood for a long while about your old people your old ladies whose faces are so fine and sad i paused but she merely looked at me and her eyes were hard and i may say this too i thank you very sincerely for bringing completely home to me what i had begun to make out for myself i hope the daughters of dixie will go on singing of their heroes i paused again and now she looked away out of the window into royal street perhaps i still continued you will hardly believe me when i say that i have looked at your monuments here with an emotion more poignant even than that which northern monuments raise in me why oh i exclaimed need you have asked that the north won you are quite dispassionate her eyes were always toward the window thats my sacred trust it made her look at me yours not yours yet it would be yours if you had won i thought a slight change came in her steady scrutiny and miss la heu it was awful about the negro it is awful the young north thinks so just as much as you do oh we shock our old people we dont expect them to change but they mustnt expect us not to and even some of them have begun to whisper a little doubtfully but never mind them heres the negro we cant kick him out that plan is childish so its like two men having to live in one house the white man would keep the house in repair the black would let it rot well the black must take orders from the white and it will end so she was eager slavery again you think oh never it was too injurious to ourselves but something between slavery and equality and i ended with a quotation patience cousin and shuffle the cards you may call me cousin this once because you have been really quite nice for a northerner now we had come to the place where she must understand me not a northerner miss la heu she became mocking scarcely a southerner i presume but i kept my smile and my directness no more a southerner than a northerner pray what then an american she was silent its the sacred trust for me she was still silent if my state seceded from the union tomorrow i should side with the union against her she was frankly astonished now would you really and i think some light about me began to reach her a northerner willing to side against a northern state i was very glad that i had found that phrase to make clear to her my american creed i proceeded i shall help to hand down all the glories and all the sadnesses lees lincolns everybodys but i shall not hand it down this checked her its easy for me you know i hastily explained nothing noble about it at all but from noble people and i looked hard at her one expects sooner or later noble things she repressed something she had been going to reply if ever i have children i finished they shall know dixie and yankee doodle by heart and never know the difference by that time i should think they might have a chance of hearing yankee doodle in kings port again she checked a rapid retort well she after a pause repeated you have been really quite nice may i tell you what you have been certainly not have you seen mr mayrant today we have an engagement to walk this afternoon may i go walking with you sometime may he general a wagging tail knocked on the floor behind the counter general says that he will think about it what makes you like mr mayrant so much this question struck me as an odd one nor could i make out the import of the peculiar tone in which she put it why i should think everybody would like him except perhaps his double victim double yes first of his fist and then of of his hand but she didnt respond of his hand his poker hand i explained poker hand she remained honestly vague it rejoiced me to be the first to tell her you havent heard of master johns last performance well finding himself forced by that immeasurable old aunt josephine of yours to shake hands he shook em all right but he took thirty dollars away as a little setoff for his pious docility oh she murmured overwhelmed with astonishment then she broke into one of her delicious peals of laughter anybody i said likes a boy who plays a hand and a fist to that tune i continued to say a number of commendatory words about young john while her sparkling eyes rested upon me but even as i talked i grew aware that these eyes were not sparkling were starry rather and distant and that she was not hearing what i said so i stopped abruptly and at the stopping she spoke like a person waking up oh yes certainly he can take care of himself why not rather creditable dont you think creditable considering his aunts and everything she became haughty on the instant upon my word and do you suppose the women of south carolina dont wish their men to be men why she returned to mirth and that arch mockery which was her special charm we south carolina women consider virtue our business and we dont expect the men to meddle with it primal perpetual necessary i cried when that division gets blurred society is doomed are you sure john can take care of himself every way i have other things than mr mayrant to think about she said this quite sharply it surprised me to be sure i assented but didnt you once tell me that you thought he was simple she opened her ledger its a great honor to have ones words so well remembered i was still at a loss anyhow the wedding is postponed i continued and the cake of course one cant help wondering how its all coming out she was now working at her ledger bending her head over it have you ever met miss rieppe she inquired this with a sort of wonderful softness which i was to hear again upon a still more memorable occasion never i answered but theres nobody at present living whom i long to see so much she wrote on for a little while before saying with her pencil steadily busy why why dont you after all this fuss oh certainly she drawled she is so much admired by northerners i do hope john is able to take care of himself i purposely repeated take care of yourself she laughed angrily over her ledger me why i understand you less and less very likely why i want to help him i protested i dont want him to marry her oh by the way do you happen to know what it is that she is coming here to see for herself in a moment her ledger was left and she was looking at me straight coming when soon in an automobile to see something for herself she pondered for quite a long moment then her eyes returned searchingly to me you didnt make that up i laughed and explained some of them at any rate i finished know what shes coming for they were rather queer about it i thought she pondered again i noticed that she had deeply flushed and that the flush was leaving her then she fixed her eyes on me once more they wouldnt tell you i think that they came inadvertently near it once or twice and remembered just in time that i didnt know about it but since you do know pretty much about it she laughed i shook my head theres something else something thats turned up the sort of thing that upsets calculations and i merely hoped that youd know on those last words of mine she gave me quite an extraordinary look and then as if satisfied with what she saw in my face they dont talk to me it was an assurance it was true it had the ring of truth that evident genuineness which a piece of real confidence always possesses she meant me to know that we were in the same boat of ignorance today and yet as i rose from my lunch and came forward to settle for it i was aware of some sense of defeat of having been held off just as the ladies on high walk had held me off well i sighed i pin my faith to the aunt who says hell never marry her miss la heu had no more to say upon the subject havent you forgotten something she inquired gayly and as i turned to see what i had left behind i mean you had no lady baltimore today i clean forgot it no loss it is very stale and tomorrow i shall have a fresh supply ready as i departed through the door i was conscious of her eyes following me and that she had spoken of lady baltimore precisely because she was thinking of something else xiv the replacers she had been strange perceptibly strange had eliza la heu that was the most which i could make out of it i had angered her in some manner wholly beyond my intention or understanding and not all at one fixed point in our talk her irritation had come out and gone in again in spots all along the colloquy and it had been a displeasure wholly apart from that indignation which had flashed up in her over the negro question this indeed i understood well enough and admired her for and admired still more her gallant control of it as for the other i gave it up a sense of guilt a very slight one to be sure dispersed my speculations when i was preparing for dinner and aunt carolas postscript open upon my writingtable reminded me that i had never asked miss la heu about the bombos well the bombos could keep and i descended to dinner a little late as too often to feel instantly in the air that they had been talking about me i doubt if any company in the world from the greeks down through machiavelli to the present moment has ever been of a subtlety adequate to conceal from an observant person entering a room the fact that he has been the subject of their conversation this company at any rate did not conceal it from me not even when the upcountry bride astutely greeted me with why we were just speaking of you we were lust saying it would be a perfect shame if you missed those flowers at live oaks and at this various of the guests assured me that another storm would finish them upon which i assured every one that tomorrow should see me embark upon the live oaks excursion boat knowing quite well in my heart that some decidedly different question concerning me had been hastily dropped upon my appearance at the door it poked up its little concealed head did this question when the bride said later to me with immense archness how any gentleman can help falling just daid in love with that lovely young girl at the exchange i dont see but i havent helped it i immediately exclaimed oh declared the bride with unerring perception that just shows he hasnt been smitten at all well id be ashamed if i was a single gentleman and while i brought forth additional phrases concerning the distracted state of my heart she looked at me with large limpid eyes anybody could tell youre not afraid of a rival was her resulting comment upon which several of the et ceteras laughed more than seemed to me appropriate i left them all free again to say what they pleased for john mayrant called for me to go upon our walk while we were still seated at table and at table they remained after i had excused myself the bruise over johns left eye was fading out but traces of his spiritual battle were deepening during the visit which he had paid under compulsion i am sure to juno at our boardinghouse in company with miss josephine st michael his recent financial triumph at the bedside had filled his face with diabolic elation as he confronted his victims enraged but checkmated aunt when to the thinly veiled venom of her inquiry as to a bridegrooms health he had retorted with venom as thinly veiled that he was feeling better that night than for many weeks he had looked better too the ladies had exclaimed after his departure what a handsome young man he was and juno had remarked how fervently she trusted that marriage might cure him of his deplorable tendencies but today his vitality had sagged off beneath the weight of his preoccupation it looked to me as if by a day or two more the boys face might be grown haggard whether by intention or as is more likely by the perfectly natural and spontaneous working of his nature he speedily made it plain to me that our relation our acquaintance had progressed to a stage more friendly and confidential he did not reveal this by imparting any confidence to me far from it it was his silence that indicated the ease he had come to feel in my company upon our last memorable interview he had embarked at once upon a hasty yet evidently predetermined course of talk because he feared that i might touch upon subjects which he wished excluded from all discussion between us today he embarked upon nothing made no conventional effort of any sort but walked beside me content with my mere society if it should happen that either of us found a thought worth expressing aloud good and if this should not happen why good also and so we walked mutely and agreeably together for a long while the thought which was growing clear in my mind and which was decidedly worthy of expression was also unluckily one which his new reliance upon my discretion completely forbade my uttering in even the most shadowy manner but it was a conviction which miss josephine st michael should have been quick to force upon him for his good quite apart from selfish reasons he had no right to marry a girl whom he had ceased to care for the code which held a gentleman to his plighted troth in such a case did more injury to the lady than any jilting could possibly do never until now had i thought this out so lucidly and i was determined that time and my own tact should assuredly help me find a way to say it to him if he continued in his present course daddy ben says you cant be a real northerner this was his first observation and i think that we must have walked a mile before he made it because i pounded a negro of course he retains your southern antebellum mythical notion of northerners all of us willing to have them marry our sisters well theres a lady at our boardinghouse who says you are a real gambler the impish look came curling round his lips but for a moment only and it was gone that shook daddy ben up a good deal having his grandson do it do you mean oh hes used to his grandson grandsons in that race might just as well be dogs for all they know or care about their progenitors yet daddy ben spent his savings on educating charles cotesworth and two more but not one of them will give the old man a house today if ever i have a home john stopped himself and our silence was no longer easy our unspoken thoughts looked out of our eyes so that they could not meet yet no one unless directly invited by him had the right to say to hint what i was thinking except some near relative therefore to relieve this silence which had ceased to be agreeable i talked about daddy ben and his grandsons and negro voting and the huge lie of equality which our lips vociferate and our lives daily disprove this took us comfortably away from weddings and cakes into the subject of lynching my violent condemnation of which surprised him for our discussion had led us over a wide field and one fertile in wellknown disputes of the evergreen sort conducted by the north mostly with more theory than experience and by the south mostly with more heat than light whereas between john and me i may say that our amiability was surpassed only by our intelligence each allowed for the others standpoint and both met in many views he would have voted against the last national democratic ticket but for the republican upholding of negro equality while i assured him that such stupid and criminal upholding was on the wane he informed me that he did not believe the pure blooded african would ever be capable of taking the intellectual side of the white mans civilization and i informed him that we must patiently face this probability and teach the african whatever he could profitably learn and no more and each of us agreed with the other i think that we were at one save for the fact that i was after all a northerner and that is a blemish which nobody in kings port can quite get over john therefore was unprepared for my wholesale denunciation of lynching with your clear view of the negro he explained my dear man its my clear view of the white its the white the american citizen the hope of humanity as he enjoys being called who after our englishspeaking race has abolished public executions degenerates back to the stone age its upon him that lynching works the true injury theyre nothing but animals he muttered would you treat an animal in that way i inquired he persisted youd do it yourself if you had to suffer from them very probably is that an answer what id never do would be to make a show an entertainment a circus out of it run excursion trains to see it come should you like your sister to buy tickets for a lynching this brought him up rather short i should never take part myself he presently stated unless it were immediate personal vengeance few brothers or husbands would blame you i returned it would be hard to wait for the law but let no community which treats it as a public spectacle presume to call itself civilized he gave a perplexed smile shaking his head over it sometimes i think civilization costs civilization costs all youve got i cried more than ive got he declared im mortal tired of civilization ah yes what male creature is not and neither of us will live quite long enough to see the smashup of our own arent you sometimes inconsistent he inquired laughing i hope so i returned consistency is a form of death the dead are the only perfectly consistent people and sometimes you sound like a socialist he pursued still laughing never i shouted dont class me with those untrained puppies of thought and youll generally observe i added that the more nobly a socialist vaporizes about the rights of humanity the more wives and children he has abandoned penniless along the trail of his life he was livelier than ever at this what date have you fixed for the smashup of our present civilization why fix dates is it not diversion enough to watch and step handsomely through ones own part with always a good sleeve to laugh in pensiveness returned upon him i shall be able to step through my own part i think he paused and i was wondering secretly does that include the wedding when he continued whats there to laugh at why our imperishable selves for instance we swear by universal suffrage well sows ears are an invaluable thing in their place on the head of the animal but send them to make your laws and what happens bribery naturally the silk purse buys the sows ear we swear by christianity but dishonesty is our present religion that little phrase in god we trust is about as true as the silver dollar its stamped on worth some thirtynine cents we get awfully serious about whether or no good can come of evil when every skyscraping thief of finance is helping hospitals with one hand while the others in my pocket and good and evil attend each other lead to each other are such siamese twins that if separated they would both die we make phrases about peace pity and brotherhood while every nation stands prepared for shipwreck and for the sinking plank to which two are clinging and the stronger pushes the weaker into the flood and thus floats safe why the old apple of wisdom which adam and eve swallowed and thus lost their innocence was a gentle nursery drug compared with the new apple of competition which as soon as chewed instantly transforms the heart into a second brain but why worry when nothing is final havent you and i for instance lamented the present rottenness of smart society why when kings by the name of george sat on the throne of england society was just as drunken just as dissolute then a decent queen came and society behaved itself and now here we come round again to the georges only with the name changed theres nothing final so when things are as you dont like them remember that and bear them and when theyre as you do like them remember it and make the most of them and keep a good sleeve handy have you got any creed at all he demanded certanly but i dont live up to it thats not expected may i ask what it is its in latin well i can probably bear it aunt eliza had a classical tutor for me i always relish a chance to recite my favorite poet and i began accordingly laetus in praesens animus quod ultra est oderit curare et i know that one he exclaimed interrupting me the tutor made me put it into english verse i had the severest sort of a time i ran away from it twice to a deerhunt and he in his turn recited who hails each present hour with zest hates fretting what may be the rest makes bitter sweet with lazy jest naught is in every portion blest i complimented him in spite of my slight annoyance at being deprived by him of the chance to declaim latin poetry which is an exercise that i approve and enjoy but of course to go on with it after he had intervened with his translation would have been flat you have written good english and very close to the latin too i told him particularly in the last line and i picked up from the bridge which we were crossing an oystershell and sent it skimming over the smooth water that stretched between the low shores wide blue and vacant i suppose you wonder why we call this the new bridge he remarked i did wonder when i first came i replied he smiled youre getting used to us this long structure wore in truth no appearance of yesterday it was newer than the new bridge which it had replaced some fifteen years ago and which for forty years had borne the same title spanning the broad river upon a legion of piles this wooden causeway lies low against the face of the water joining the town with a serene and pensive country of pines and live oaks and level opens where glimpses of cabin and plantation serve to increase the silence and the soft mysterious loneliness into this the road from the bridge goes straight and among the purple vagueness gently dissolves away we watched a slow deepladen boat sliding down toward the draw across which we made our way and drew near the further end of the bridge the straight avenue of the road in front of us took my eyes down its quiet vista until they were fixed suddenly by an alien object a growing dot accompanied by dust whence came the small distorted honks of an automobile these fat importunate sounds redoubled as the machine rushed toward the bridge growing up to its full staring brazen dimensions six or seven figures sat in it all of the same dusty shrouded likeness their big glass eyes and their masked mouths suggesting some fabled unearthly race a family of replete and bilious ogres so that as they flew honking by us i called out to john behold the yellow rich and then remembered that his hortense probably sat among them the honks redoubled and we turned to see that the drawbridge had no thought of waiting for them we also saw a bewildered curly white dog and a young girl who called despairingly to him as he disappeared beneath the automobile the engine of murder could not as is usual proceed upon its way honking for the drawbridge was visibly swinging open to admit the passage of the boat when john and i had run back near enough to become ourselves a part of the incident the white dog lay still behind the stationary automobile whose passengers were craning their muffled necks and glass eyes to see what they had done while one of their number had got out and was stooping to examine if the machine had sustained any injuries the young girl with a face of anguish was calling the dogs name as she hastened toward him and her voice aroused him he lifted his head got on his legs and walked over to her which action on his part brought from the automobile a penetrating female voice well hes in better luck than that savannah dog but general was not in luck he lay quietly down at the feet of his mistress and we soon knew that life had passed from his faithful body the first stroke of grief dealt her in such cruel and sudden form overbore the poor girls pride and reserve she made no attempt to remember or heed surroundings but kneeling and placing her arms about the neck of her dead servant she spoke piteously aloud and i raised him i raised him from a puppy the female voice at this addressed the traveller who was examining the automobile charley a five or a ten spot is what her feelings need the obedient and munificent charley straightened up from his stooping among the mechanical entrails dexterously produced money and advanced with the selected bill held out politely in his hand while the glass eyes and the masks peered down at the performance eliza la heu had perceived none of this for she was intent upon general nor had john mayrant who had approached her with the purpose of coming to her aid but when charley quite at hand began to speak words which were instantly obliterated from my memory by what happened the young girl realized his intention and straightened stiffly while john with the rapidity of light snatched the extended bill from charleys hand and tearing it in four pieces threw it in his face a foreign voice cackled from the automobile oh la la il a du panache but charley now disclosed himself to be a true man of the world the financial world by picking the pieces out of the mud and while he wiped them and enclosed them in his handkerchief and with perfect dignity returned them to his pocket he remarked simply with a shrug as you please his accent also was ever so little foreign that new york downtown foreign of the second generation which stamps so many of our bankers the female now leaned from her seat and with the tone of setting the whole thing right explained we had no idea it was a lady doubtless youre not accustomed to their appearance said john to charley i dont know what charley would have done about this for while the completely foreign voice was delightedly whispering toujours le panache a new deep and altogether different female voice exclaimed why john its you so that was hortense then that rich and quiet utterance was hers a schooled and studied management of speech i found myself surprised and i knew directly why that word of one of the old ladles i consider that she looks like a steel wasp had implanted in me some definite anticipations to which the voice certainly did not correspond how fervently i desired that she would lift her thick veil while john with hat in hand was greeting her and being presented to her companions why she had not spoken to john sooner was of course a recondite question and beyond my power to determine with merely the given situation to guide me hadnt she recognized him before had her thick veil and his position and the general slight flurry of the misadventure intercepted recognition until she heard his voice when he addressed charley or had she known her lover at once and rapidly decided that the moment was an unpropitious one for a first meeting after absence and that she would pass on to kings port unrevealed but then had found this plan become impossible through the collision between charley and john it was not until certain incidents of the days following brought miss rieppes nature a good deal further home to me that a third interpretation of her delay in speaking to john dawned upon my mind that i was also made aware how a womans understanding of the words steel wasp when applied by her to one of her own sex may differ widely from a mans understanding of them and that miss rieppe through her thick veil saw from her seat in the automobile something which my own unencumbered vision had by no means detected but now here on the bridge even her outward appearance was as shrouded as her inward qualities save such as might be audible in that voice as her skilful wellplaced speeches to one and the other of the company tided over and carried off into ease this uneasy moment all men at such a voice have pricked up their ears since the beginning there was much woman in it each slow schooled syllable called its challenge to questing man but i got no chance to look in the eye that went with that voice she took all the advantages which her veil gave her and how well she used them i was to learn later in the general smoothingout process which she was so capably effecting her attention was about to reach me when my name was suddenly called out from behind her it was beverly rodgers that accomplished and inveterate bachelor of fashion ten years before when i had seen much of him he had been more particular in his company frequently declaring in his genial irresponsible way that new york society was going to the devil but many tempting dances on the land and cruises on the water had taken him deep among our lower classes that have boiled up from the bottom with their millions and besides there would be nothing to marvel at in beverlys presence in any company that should include hortense rieppe if she carried out the promise of her voice beverly was his customary charming effusive self coming out of the automobile to me with his by jove old man and his whod have thought it old fellow and sprinkling urbane little drops of jocosity over us collectively as the garden waterturning apparatus sprinkles a lawn his knowing me and the way he brought it out and even the tumbling into the road of a few wraps and chattels of travel as he descended from the automobile and the necessity of picking these up and handing them back with delightful little jocular apologies such as by jove what a lout i am all this helped the meeting on prodigiously and got us gratefully away from the disconcerting incident of the torn money charley was helpful too you would never have supposed from the polite smalltalk which he was now offering to john mayrant that he had within some three minutes received the equivalent of a slap across the eyes from that youth and carried the soiled consequences m his pocket and such a thing is it to be a true man of the world of finance that upon the arrival now of a second automobile also his property and containing a set of maids and valets and also some live dogs sitting up covered with glass eyes and wrappings like their owners munificent charley at once offered the dead dog and his mistress a place in it and begged she would let it take her wherever she wished to go everybody exclaimed copiously and condolingly over the unfortunate occurrence what a fine animal he was to be sure what breed was he of course he wasnt used to automobiles was it quite certain that he was dead quel dommage and charley would be so happy to replace him and how was eliza la heu bearing herself amid these murmurously chattered infelicities she was listening with composure to the murmurs of hortense rieppe more felicitous no doubt miss rieppe through her veil was particularly devoting herself to miss la lieu i could not hear what she said the little chorus of condolence and suggestion intercepted all save her tone and that indeed coherently sustained its measured cadence through the texture of fragments uttered by charley and the others eliza la heu had now got herself altogether in hand and saving her pale cheeks no sign betrayed that the young girls feelings had been so recently too strong for her to these strangers ignorant of her usual manner her present strange quietness may very well have been accepted as her habit thank you she replied to munificent charleys offer that she would use his second automobile she managed to make her polite words cut like a scythe i should crowd it but they shall get out and walk it will be good for them said charley indicating the valets and maids and possibly the dogs too beverly rodgers did much better than charley with a charming gesture and bow he offered his own seat in the first automobile i am going to walk in any case he assured her one gentleman among them i heard john mayrant mutter behind me miss la heu declined the chorus urged but beverly who was indeed a gentleman every inch of him shook his head imperceptibly at charley and while the little exclamations do come so much more comfortable so nice to see more of you dropped away miss la heu had settled her problem quite simply for herself a little procession of vehicles townward bound had gathered on the bridge waiting until the closing of the draw should allow them to continue upon their way from these most of the occupants had descended and were staring with avidity at us all the great glass eyes and the great refulgent cars held them in timidity and fascination and the poor lifeless white body of general stretched beside the way heightened the hypnotic mystery one or two of the boldest had touched him and found no outward injury upon him and this had sent their eyes back to the automobile with increased awe eliza la heu summoned one of the onlookers an old negro at some word she said to him he hurried back and returned leading his horse and empty cart and general was lifted into this the girl took her seat beside the old driver no she said to john mayrant certainly not i wondered at the needless severity with which she declined his offer to accompany her and help her he stood by the wheel of the cart looking up at her and protesting and i joined him thank you she returned i need no one you will both oblige me by saying no more about it john it was the slow wellcalculated utterance of hortense rieppe did i hear in it the caressing note of love john turned the draw had swung to the mast and sail of the vessel were separating away from the bridge with a stealthy motion men with iron bars were at work fastening the draw secure and horses hoofs knocked nervously upon the wooden flooring as the internal churning of the automobiles burst upon their innocent ears john if mr rodgers is really not going with us thus hortense and at that miss la heu why do you keep them waiting there was no caress in that note it was polished granite he looked up at her on her high seat by the extremely dilapidated negro and then he walked forward and took his place beside his veiled fiancee among the glass eyes a hiss of sharp noise spurted from the automobiles horses danced and then smoothly the two huge engines were gone with their cargo of large distorted shapes leaving behind them quite as our present epoch will leave behind it a trail of power of ingenuity of ruthlessness and a bad smell hold hard old boy chuckled beverly to whom i communicated this sentiment how do you know the stink of one generation does not become the perfume of the next beverly when he troubled to put a thing at all which was seldom for he kept his quite good brains wellnigh perpetually turned out to grass or rather to grass widows always put it well and with a bracing vocabulary hullo he now exclaimed and walked out into the middle of the roadway where he picked up a parasol kitty will be in a jolly old stew none of its expensive bones broken however and then he hailed me by a name of our youth what are you doing down here you old sourbelly watching you sun yourself on the fat cushions of the yellow rich oh shucks old man theyre not so yellow charley strikes me as yellower than his own gold charleys not a bad little sort of course he needs coaching a bit here and there just now for instance when he didnt see that that girl wouldnt think of riding in the machine that had just killed her dog by jove give that girl a year in civilization and shed do who was the young fireeater fireeater hes a lot more decent than you or i but thats saying so little dear boy seriously beverly oh hang it with your seriously well then seriously melodrama was the correct ticket and all that in but weve outgrown it its devilish demode to chuck things in peoples faces im not sorry john mayrant did it i brought out his name with due emphasis all the same beverly was beginning when the automobile returned rapidly upon us and guessing the cause of this he waved the parasol charley descended to get it an unnecessary act prompted i suppose by the sudden relief of finding that it was not lost he made his thanks marked it is my sisters he concluded to me by way of explanation in his slightly foreign accent it is not much but it has got some stones and things in the handle we were favored with a bow from the veiled hortense shrill thanks from kitty and the car turning again left us in a moment youve got a frenchman along i said little gazza beverly returned italian though from his morals youd never guess he wasnt parisian great people in rome hereditary right to do something in the presence of the pope or not to do it i forget which not a bit of a bad little sort gazza he has just sold a lot of old furniture renaissance lorenzo du borgia that sort of jolly old truck to bohm you know i didnt know oh yes you do old boy harry bohm of bohm cohn everybody knows bohm and well all be knowing cohn by next year gazza has sold him a lot of furniture too bohms from pittsfield or south lee or east canaan or west stockbridge or some of those other backcountry cider presses that squirt some of the hardest propositions into wall street hes just back from buying a railroad and four or five mines in mexico bohm represents christianity in the firm at newport they call him the military attache to jerusalem hes the big chap that sat behind me in the car hell marry kitty as soon as she can get her divorce bohms a jolly old sort and i tell you you old sourbelly youre letting this southern moss grow over you a bit hey what yellow rich isnt half bad and ill say it myself and pretend its mine but hang it old man their children wont be worse than lemoncolored and the grandchildren will be white just in time i exclaimed to take a back seat with their evaporated fortunes beverly chuckled well if they do evaporate there will be new ones now dont walk along making mayflower eyes at me im no puritan and my people have had a front seat since pretty early in the game which im holding on to you know and by jove old man i tell you if you wish to hold on nowadays you cant be drawing lines if you dont want to see yourself jolly well replaced you must fall in with the replacers our blooming old republic is merely the quickest process of endless replacing yet discovered and you take my tip and back the replacers thats where miss rieppe for all her kings port traditions shows sense i turned square on him then she has broken it broken what her engagement to john mayrant you mean to say that you didnt see here old man seriously the fireeater i was so very much bewildered that i merely stared at beverly rodgers of course i might have known that miss rieppe would not feel the need of announcing to her rich northern friends an engagement which she had fallen into the habit of postponing but beverly had a better right to be taken aback i suppose you must have some reason for your remark he said you dont mean that youre engaged to her i shot out me with my poor little fifteen thousand a year consider dear boy oh no were merely playing at it she and i shes a good player but charley he is i shouted i dont know old man and i dont think he knows yet beverly said i let me tell you and i told him after he had got himself adjusted to the novelty of it he began to take it with a series of thoughtful chuckles into these i dropped with wheres her father anyhow i began to feel fantastically that she mightnt have a father he stopped in savannah beverly answered hes coming over by the train kitty charleys sister mrs bleecker did the chaperoning for us very expertly i should guess i said perfectly invisibly said beverly and he returned to his thoughts and his chuckles after all its simple he presently remarked doesnt that depend on what shes here for oh to break it why come for that he took another turn among his cogitations i took a number of turns among my own but it was merely walking round and round in a circle when will she announce it then he demanded ah i murmured you said she was a good player but a fireeater he resumed for her oh hang it shell let him go then why hasnt she he hesitated well of course her game could be spoiled by his speech died away into more cogitation and i had to ask him what he meant by love getting into it somewhere we walked on through worship street which we had reached some while since and the chief features of which i mechanically pointed out to him jolly old church that said beverly as we reached my favorite corner and brick wall well ill not announce it he murmured gallantly my dear man i said kings port will do all the announcing for you tomorrow xv what she came to see but in this matter my prognostication was thoroughly at fault yet surely knowing kings ports sovereign habit as i had had good cause to know it i was scarce beyond reasonable bounds in supposing that the arrival of miss rieppe would heat up some very general and very audible talk about this approaching marriage against which the prejudices of the town were set in such compact array i have several times mentioned that kings port to my sense was buzzing over john mayrants affairs buzzing in the open where one could hear it and buzzing behind closed doors where one could somehow feel it i can only say that henceforth this buzzing ceased dropped wholly away as if gossip were watching so hard that she forgot to talk giving place to a great stillness in her kingdom such occasional words as were uttered sounded oddly and egregiously clear in the newestablished void the first of these words sounded indeed quite enormous issuing as it did from junos lips at our breakfasttable when yesterdays meeting on the new bridge was investing my mind with many thoughts she addressed me in one of her favorite tones i have met it thank god but in two or three other cases during my whole experience which always somehow conveyed to you that you were personally to blame for what she was going to tell you i suppose you know that your friend mr mayrant has resigned from the custom house i was of course careful not to give juno the pleasure of seeing that she had surprised me i bowed and continued in silence to sip a little coffee then setting my coffee down i observed that it would be some few days yet before the resignation could take effect and noticing that juno was getting ready some new remark i branched off and spoke to her of my excursion up the river this morning to see the azaleas in the gardens at live oaks how lucky the weather is so magnificent i exclaimed i shall be interested to hear said juno what explanation he finds to give miss josephine for his disrespectful holding out against her and his immediate yielding to miss rieppe here i deemed it safe to ask her was she quite sure it had been at the instance of miss rieppe that john had resigned it follows suspiciously close upon her arrival stated juno she might have been speaking of a murder and how he expects to support a wife now well that is no affair of mine juno concluded with a washingherhandsofit air as if up to this point she had always done her best for the wilful boy she had blamed him savagely for not resigning and now she was blaming him because he had resigned and i ate my breakfast in much entertainment over this female acrobat in censure no more was said i think that my manner of taking junos news had been perfectly successful in disappointing her johns resignation if it had really occurred did certainly follow very close upon the arrival of hortense but i had spoken one true thought in intimating that i doubted if it was due to the influence of miss rieppe it seemed to me to the highest degree unlikely that the boy in his present state of feeling would do anything he did not wish to do because his ladylove happened to wish it except marry her there was apparently no doubt that he would do that did she want him poverty and all was she even now with eyes open deliberately taking her last farewell days of automobiles and of steam yachts that voice of hers that rich summons with its quiet certainty of power sounded in my memory john she had called to him from the automobile and thus john had gone away in it wedged in among charley and the fat cushions and all the money and glass eyes and now he had resigned from the custom house yes that was whatever it signified truly amazing if true so i continued to ponder quite uselessly until the upcountry bride aroused me she it appeared had been greatly carried away by the beauty of live oaks and was making her david take her there again this morning and she was asking me didnt i hope we shouldnt get stuck the people had got stuck yesterday three whole hours right on a bank in the river and wasnt it a sin and a shame to run a boat with ever so many passengers aground by the doctrine of chances i informed her we had every right to hope for better luck today and with the assurance of how much my felicity was increased by the prospect of having her and david as company during the expedition i betook myself meanwhile to my own affairs which meant chiefly a call at the exchange to inquire for eliza la heu and a visit to the postoffice before starting upon a several hours absence a few steps from our front door i came upon john mayrant and saw at once too plainly that no ease had come to his spirit during the hours since the bridge he was just emerging from an adjacent house and have you resigned i asked him yes thats done you havent seen miss rieppe this morning why shes surely not boarding with mrs trevise no stopping here with her old friend mrs cornerly he indicated the door he had come from of course you wouldnt be likely to see her pass and with that he was gone that he was greatly stirred up by something there could be no doubt never before had i seen him so abrupt it seemed clear that anger had taken the place of despondency or whatever had been his previous mood and by the time i reached the postoffice i had already imagined and dismissed the absurd theory that john was jealous of charley had resigned from the custom house as a first step toward breaking his engagement and had rung mrs cornerlys bell at this early hour with the purpose of informing his ladylove that all was over between them jealousy would not be likely to produce this set of manifestations in young foolish john and i may say here at once what i somewhat later learned that the boy had come with precisely the opposite purpose namely to repeat and reenforce his steadfast constancy and that it was something far removed from jealousy which had spurred him to this i found the girl behind the counter at her post grateful to me for coming to ask how she was after the shock of yesterday but unwilling to speak of it at all all which she expressed by her charming manner and by the other subjects she chose for conversation and especially by the way in which she held out her hand when i took my leave near the postoffice i was hailed by beverly rodgers who proclaimed to me at once a comic but genuine distress he had already walked he said and it was but halfpast nine oclock as he bitterly bade me observe on the church dial more miles in search of a drink than his unarithmetical brain had the skill to compute and he confounded such a town heartily he should return as soon as possible to charleys yacht where there was civilization and where he had spent the night during his search he had at length come to a door of promising appearance and gone in there and they had explained to him that it was a dispensary a beastly arrangement what was the name of the razorback hog they said had invented it and what did you do for a drink in this confounded waterhole he would find it no waterhole i told him but there were methods which a stranger upon his first morning could scarce be expected to grasp i could direct you to a dutchman i said but youre too well dressed to win his confidence at once well old man began beverly i dont speak dutch but give me a crack at the confidence however he renounced the project upon learning what a dutchman was since my hours were no longer dedicated to establishing the presence of royal blood in my veins i had spent them upon various local investigations of a character far more entertaining and akin to my taste it was in truth quite likely that beverly could in a very few moments with his smile and his manner find his way to any dutchmans heart he had that divine gift of winning over to him quickly all sorts and conditions of men and my account of the ingenious and lawbaffling contrivances which you found at these little grocery shops at once roused his curiosity to make a trial but he decided that the club was better if less picturesque and he told me that all the men of the automobile party had received from john mayrant cards of invitation to the club your fireeater is a civil chap said beverly and by the way do you happen to know here he pulled from his pocket a letter and consulted its address mrs weguelin st michael i was delighted that he brought an introduction to this lady hortense rieppe could not open for him any of those haughty doors and i wished not only that beverly since he was just the man to appreciate it and understand it should see the fine flower of kings port but also that the fine flower of kings port should see him the best blood of the south could not possibly turn out anything better than beverly rodgers and it was horrible and humiliating to think of the other northern specimens of men whom hortense had imported with her i was here suddenly reminded that the young woman was a guest of the cornerlys the people who swept their garden the people whom eliza la heu at the exchange did not know and at this the remark of mrs gregory st michael when i had walked with her and mrs weguelin took on an added lustre of significance we shall have to call call on the cornerlys would they do that were they ready to stand by their john to that tune a hotel would be nothing you could call on anybody at a hotel if you had to but here would be a demarche indeed yet nevertheless i felt quite certain that if hortense though the cornerlys guest was also the guaranteed fiancee of john mayrant the old ladies would come up to the scratch hate and loathe it as they might and undoubtedly would they could be trusted to do the right thing i told beverly how glad i was that he would meet mrs weguelin st michael the rest of your party my friend i said are not very likely to and i generalized to him briefly upon the town of kings port supposing i take you to call upon mrs st michael when i come back this afternoon i suggested beverly thought it over and then shook his head wouldnt do old man if these people are particular and know as you say they do hadnt i better leave the letter with my card and then wait till she sends some word he was right as he always was unerringly consorting with all the charleys and the bohms and the cohns and the kitties hadnt taken the fine edge from beverlys good inheritance and good bringing up his instinct had survived his scruples making of him an agile and charming cynic whom you could trust to see the right thing always and never do it unless it was absolutely necessary he would marry any amount of kitties for their money and always know that beside his mother and sisters they were as dirt and he would see to it that his children took after their father went to school in england for a good accent and enunciation as he had done went to college in america for the sake of belonging in their own country as he had done and married as many fortunes and had as few divorces as possible who was that girl on the bridge he now inquired as we reached the steps of the postoffice and when i had told him again because he had asked me about eliza la heu at the time shes the real thing he commented quite extraordinary you know her dignity when poor old awful charley was messing everything hes so used to mere money you know that half the time he forgets people are not dollars and you have to kick him to remind him yes quite perfect dignity gad it took a lady to climb up and sit by that ragged old darky and take her dead dog away in the cart the cart and the darky only made her look what she was all the more poor kitty couldnt do that shed look like a chambermaid well old man see you again i stood on the postoffice steps looking after beverly rodgers as he crossed court street his admirably good clothes the easy finish of his whole appearance even his walk and his back and the slope of his shoulders were unmistakable the southern men going to their business in court street looked at him alas in his outward man he was as a rose among weeds and certainly no wellborn american could unite with an art more hedonistic than beverlys the old school and the nouveau jeu over at the other corner he turned and stood admiring the church and gazing at the other buildings and so perceived me still on the steps with a gesture of remembering something he crossed back again youve not seen miss rieppe why of course i havent i exclaimed was everybody going to ask me that well somethings up old boy charley has got the launch away with him and ill bet hes got her away with him too charley lied this morning is lying then so rare with him why it rather is you know but ive come to be able to spot him when he does it those little bulgy eyes of his look at you particularly straight and childlike he said he had to hunt up a man on business vc chemical company he called it there is such a thing here i said oh charleyd never make up a thing and get found out in that way but he was lying all the same old man do you mean theyve run off and got married what do you take them for much more like them to run off and not get married but they havent done that either and speaking of that i believe ive gone a bit adrift your fireeater you know she is an extraordinary woman and beverly gave his mellow little humorous chuckle hanged if i dont begin to think she does fancy him well i cried that would explain no it wouldnt whence comes your theory saw her look at him at dinner once last night we dined with some people cornerly she looked at him just once well if she intends by gad it upsets ones whole notion of her isnt just one look rather slight basis for now old man you know better than that beverly paused to chuckle my grandmother livingston he resumed knew aaron burr and she used to say that he had an eye which no honest woman could meet without a blush i dont know whether your fireeater is a launcelot or a galahad but that girls eye at dinner did he blush i laughed not that i saw but really old man confound it you know hes no sort of husband for her how can he make her happy and how can she make him happy and how can either of them hit it off with the other the least little bit shes expensive hes not shes uptodate hes not shes of the great world hes provincial shes all derision hes all faith why hang it old boy what does she want him for beverlys handsome brow was actually furrowed with his problem and as i certainly could furnish him no solution for it we stood in silence on the postoffice steps what can she want him for he repeated then he threw it off lightly with one of his chuckles so glad ive no daughters to marry well i must go draw some money he took himself off with a certain alacrity giving an impatient cut with his stick at a sparrow in the middle of worship street nor did i see him again this day although after hurriedly getting my letters for the starting hour of the boat had now drawn near i followed where he had gone down court street and his cosmopolitan figure would have been easy to descry at any distance along that scantily peopled pavement he had evidently found the bank and was getting his money david of the yellow heir and his limpidlooking bride were on the horrible little excursion boat watching for me and keeping with some difficulty a chair next themselves that i might not have to stand up all the way and as i came aboard the bride called out to me her relief she had made sure that i would be late david said you wouldnt she announced in her clear upcountry accent across the parasols and heads of huddled tourists but i told him a gentleman thats late to three meals aivry day like as not would forget boats cant be kept hot in the kitchen for you i took my place in the chair beside her as hastily as possible for there is nothing that i so much dislike as being made conspicuous for any reason whatever and my thanks to her were i fear less gracious in their manner than should have been the case nor did she find me i must suppose as companionable during this excursion during the first part of it at any rate as a limpidlooking bride who has kept at some pains a seat beside her for a single gentleman has the right to expect the brief hours of this morning had fed my preoccupation too richly and i must often have fallen silent the horrible little tug or ferry or wherry or whatever its contemptible inconvenience makes it fitting that this unclean and snaillike craft should be styled cast off and began to lumber along the edges of the town with its dense cargo of hats and parasols and lunch parcels we were a most extraordinary litter of man and womankind there was the severe new england type improving each shining hour and doing it in bleak costume and with a thoroughly northeast expression there were pink sunbonnets from i should imagine spartanburg or charlotte or greenville there were masculine boots which yet bore incrusted upon their heels the red mud of aiken or of camden there was one fat jewelled exhalation who spoke of palm beach with the true stockyard twang and looked as if she swallowed a million every morning for breakfast and god knows how many more for the ensuing repasts she was the only detestable specimen among us sunbonnets boots and even ungenial new england proved on acquaintance kindly simple enterprising americans yet who knows if sunbonnets and boots and all of us wouldnt have become just as detestable had we but been as she was swollen and puffy with the acute indigestion of sudden wealth this reflection made me charitable which i always like to be and i imparted it to the bride my she said and i really dont know what that meant but presently i understood well why people endured the discomfort of this journey i forgot the cinders which now and then showered upon us and the heat of the sun and the crowded chairs i forgot the boat and myself in looking at the passing shores our course took us round kings port on three sides the calm white town spread out its width and length beneath a blue sky softer than the tenderest dream the white steeples shone through the enveloping brightness taking to each other and to the distant roofs beneath them successive and changing relations while the dwindling mass of streets and edifices followed more slowly the veering of the steeples folded upon itself and refolded opened into new shapes and closed again dwindling always and always white and beautiful and as the faroff vision of it held the eye the few masts along the wharves grew thin and went out into invisibility the spires became as masts the distant drawbridge through which we had passed sank down into a mere stretching line and shining kings port was dissolved in the blue of water and of air the curving and the narrowing of the river took it at last from view and after it disappeared the spindling chimneys and their smoke which were along the bank above the town and bridge leaving us to progress through the solitude of marsh and wood and shore the green levels of stiff salt grass closed in upon the breadth of water and we wound among them looking across their silence to the deeper silence of the woods that bordered them the brooding woods the pines and the liveoaks misty with the motionless hanging moss and misty also in that southern air that deepened when it came among their trunks to a caressing mysterious purple veil every line of this landscape the straight forest top the feathery breaks in it of taller trees the curving marsh every line and every hue and every sound inscrutably spoke sadness i heard a mockingbird once in some blossoming wild fruit tree that we gradually reached and left gradually behind and more than once i saw other blossoms and the yellow of the trailing jessamine but the bird could not sing the silence away and spring with all her abundance could not hide this spiritual autumn dreams a land of dreams where even the high noon itself was dreamy a melting together of earth and air and water in one eternal gentleness of revery whence came the melancholy of this i had seen woods as solitary and streams as silent i had felt nature breathing upon me a greater awe but never before such penetrating and quiet sadness i only know that this is the perpetual mood of those southern shores those rivers that wind in from the ocean among their narrowing marshes and their hushed forests and that it does not come from any memory of human hopes and disasters but from the elements themselves so did we move onward passing in due time another bridge and a few dwellings and some excavations until the river grew quite narrow and there ahead was the landing at live oaks with negroes idly watching for us and a launch beside the bank and charley and hortense rieppe about to step into it another man stood up in the launch and talked to them where they were on the landing platform and pointed down the river as we approached but evidently he did not point at us i looked hastily to see what he was indicating to them but i could see nothing save the solitary river winding away between the empty woods and marshes so this was hortense rieppe it was not wonderful that she had caused young john to lose his heart or at any rate his head and his senses nor was it wonderful that charley with his little bulging eyes should take her in his launch whenever she would go the wonderful thing was that john at his age and with his nature should have got over it if he had got over it i felt it tingling in me any man would steel wasp indeed she was slender and oh how well dressed she watched the passengers get off the boat and i could not tell you from that first sight of her what her face was like but only her hair the sunburnt amber of its masses making one think of tokay or chateauyquem she was watching me i felt and then saw and as soon as i was near she spoke to me without moving keeping one gloved hand lightly posed upon the railing of the platform so that her long arm was bent with perfect ease and grace i swear that none but a female eye could have detected any toboggan fireescape her words dropped with the same calculated deliberation the same composed and rich indifference these gardens are so beautiful such was her first remark chosen with some purpose i knew quite well and i observed that i hoped i was not too late for their full perfection if too late to visit them in her company she turned her head slightly toward charley we have been enjoying them so much it was of absorbing interest to feel simultaneously in these brief speeches he vouchsafed speeches consummate in their inexpressive flatness the intentional coldness and the latent heat of the creature since natchez and mobile or whichever of them it had been that had witnessed her beginnings she had encountered many men and women those who could be of use to her and those who could not and in dealing with them she had tempered and chiselled her insolence to a perfect instrument to strike or to shield and of her greatest gift also she was entirely aware how could she help being with her evident experience she knew that round her whole form swam a delicious invisible sphere a distillation that her veriest self sent forth as gardenias do their perfume moving where she moved and staying where she stayed and compared with which wine was a feeble vapor for a man to get drunk on flowers are always so delightful that was her third speech pronounced just like the others in a low clear voice simplicity arrived at by much wellpracticed complexity and she still looked at charley charley now responded in his little banker accent it is a magnificent collection this he said looking at me and moving a highly polished fingernail along a very slender mustache the eyes of hortense now for a moment glanced at the mixed company of boatpassengers who were beginning to be led off in pilgrim groups by the appointed guides we were warned it would be too crowded she remarked charley was looking at her foot i cant say whether or not the two light taps that the foot now gave upon the floor of the landing brought out for me a certain impatience which i might otherwise have missed in those last words of hers from charley it brought out i feel quite sure the speech which in some form she had been expecting from him as her confederate in this unwelcome and inopportune interview with me and which his less highly schooled perceptions had not suggested to him until prompted by her i should have been very glad to include you in our launch party if i had known you were coming here today lied little charley thank you so much i murmured and i fancy that after this hortense hated me worse than ever well why should i play her game if anybody had any claim upon me was it she i would get as much diversion as i could from this encounter hortense had looked at charley when she spoke for my benefit and it now pleased me very much to look at him when i spoke for hers i could almost give up the gardens for the sake of returning with you i said to him this was most successful in producing a perceptible silence before hortense said do come i wanted to say to her you are quite splendid as splendid as you look through and through you wouldnt have run away from any battle of chattanooga but what i did say was these flowers here will fade but may i not hope to see you again in kings port she was looking at me with eyes half closed half closed for the sake of insolence and better observation when eyes like that take on drowsiness you will be wise to leave all your secrets behind you locked up in the bank or else toss them right down on the open table well i tossed mine down thereto precipitated by a warning from the stranger in the launch we shall need all the tide we can get im sure youd be glad to know i then said immediately to charley of course that miss la heu whose dog you killed is back at her work as usual this morning thank you returned charley if there could be any chance for me to replace miss la heu is her name inquired hortense i did not catch it yesterday she works you say at the womans exchange she bakes cakes for weddings among her other activities so interesting said hortense and bowing to me she allowed the spellbound charley to help her down into the launch each step of the few that she had to take was upon unsteady footing and each was taken with slow security and grace and with a mastery of her skirts so complete that they seemed to do it of themselves falling and folding in the soft delicate curves of discretion for the sake of not seeming too curious about this party i turned from watching it before the launch had begun to move and it was immediately hidden from me by the bank so that i did not see it get away as i crossed an open space toward the gardens i found myself far behind the other pilgrims whose wandering bands i could half discern among winding walks and bordering bushes i was soon taken into somewhat reprimanding charge by an admirable if important negro who sighted me from a door beneath the porch of the house and advanced upon me speedily from him i learned at once the rule of the place that strangers were not allowed to go loose as he expressed it and recognizing the perfect propriety of this restriction i was humble and even went so far as to put myself right with him by quite ample purchases of the beautiful flowers that he had for sale some of these would be excellent for the upcountry bride who certainly ought to have repentance from me in some form for my silence as we had come up the river the scenery had caused me most ungallantly to forget her my rulebreaking turned out all to my advantage the admirable and important negro was so pacified by my liberal amends that he not only placed the flowers which i had bought in a bucket of water to wait in freshness until my tour of the gardens should be finished and the moment for me to return upon the boat should arrive but he also honored me with his own special company and instead of depositing me in one of the groups of other travellers he took me to see the sights alone as if i were somebody too distinguished to receive my impressions with the common herd thus i was able to linger here and there and even to return to certain points for another look i shall not attempt to describe the azaleas at live oaks you will understand me quite well i am sure when i say that i had heard the people at mrs trevises house talk so much about them and praise them so superlatively that i was not prepared for much my experience of life had already included quite a number of azaleas moreover my meeting with hortense and charley had taken me far away from flowers but when that marvelous place burst upon me i forgot hortense i have seen gardens many gardens in england in france in italy i have seen what can be done in great hothouses and on great terraces what can be done under a roof and what can be done in the open air with the aid of architecture and sculpture and ornamental land and water but no horticulture that i have seen devised by mortal man approaches the unearthly enchantment of the azaleas at live oaks it was not like seeing flowers at all it was as if there in the heart of the wild and mystic wood in the gray gloom of those trees veiled and muffled in their long webs and skeins of hanging moss a great magic flame of rose and red and white burned steadily you looked to see it vanish you could not imagine such a thing would stay all idea of individual petals or species was swept away in this glowing maze of splendor this transparent labyrinth of rose and red and white through which you looked beyond into the gray gloom of the hanging moss and the depths of the wild forest trees i turned back as often as i could and to the last i caught glimpses of it burning glowing and shining like some miracle some rainbow exorcism with its flooding fumes of orangerose and red and white merging magically it was not until i reached the landing and made my way on board again that hortense returned to my thoughts she hadnt come to see the miracle not she i knew that better than ever and who was the other man in the launch wasnt it perfectly elegant exclaimed the upcountry bride and upon my assenting she made a further declaration to david its just aivry bit as good as the isle of champagne this i discovered to be a comic opera mounted with spendthrift brilliance which david had taken her to see at the town of gonzales just before they were married as we made our way down the bending river she continued to make many observations to me in that upcountry accent of hers which is a fashion of speech that may be said to differ as widely from the speech of the lowcountry as cotton differs from rice i began to fear that in spite of my truly good intentions i was again failing to be as attentive as the occasion demanded and so i presented her with my floral tribute she was immediately arch id surely be depriving somebody and on this i got to the full her limpid look i assured her that this would not be so and pointed to the other flowers i had accordingly after a little more archness she took them as she had of course fully meant to do from the first she also took a womans revenge ill not be any more lonesome going down than i was coming up she said davids enough and this led me definitely to conclude that david had secured a helpmate who could take care of herself in spite of the limpidity of her eyes a steel wasp again that misleading description of mrs weguelin st michaels to which since my early days in kings port my imagination may be said to have been harnessed came back into my mind i turned its injustice over and over beneath the light which the total hortense now shed upon it or rather not the total hortense but my whole impression of her as far as i had got i got a good deal further before we had finished to the slow soft accompaniment of these gliding river shores where all the shadows had changed since morning so that new loveliness stood revealed at every turn my thoughts dwelt upon this perfected specimen of the latest american moment so late that she contained nothing of the past and a great deal of tomorrow i basked myself in the memory of her achieved beauty her achieved dress her achieved insolence her luxurious complexity she was even later than those quite late athletic girls the amazons of the links whose big hard football faces stare at one from public windows and from public punts whose giant manly strides take them over leagues of country and square miles of dancefloor and whose bursting blatant immodest health glares upon seabeaches and round supper tables hortense knew that even now the hour of such is striking and that the american boy will presently turn with relief to a creature who will more clearly remind him that he is a man and that she is a woman but why was the insolence of hortense offensive when the insolence of eliza la heu was not both these extremely feminine beings could exercise that quality in profusion whenever they so wished wherein did the difference lie perhaps i thought in the spirit of its exercise eliza was merely insolent when she happened to feel like it and man has always been able to forgive woman for that whether the angels do or not but hortense the worldwise was insolent to all people who could not be of use to her and all i have to say is that if the angels can forgive them theyre welcome i cant had i made sure of anything at the landing yes hortense didnt care for charley in the least and never would a woman can stamp her foot at a man and love him simultaneously but those two light taps and the measure that her eyes took of charley meant that she must love his possessions very much to be able to bear him at all then what was her feeling about john mayrant as beverly had said what could she want him for he hadnt a thing that she valued or needed his oldtime notions of decency the clean simplicity of his make his good southern position and his collection of nice old relatives what did these assets look like from an automobile or on board the launch of a modern steam yacht and wouldnt it be amusing if john should grow needlessly jealous and have a difficulty with charley not a mere flinging of torn paper money in the bankers face but some more decided punishment for the bankers presuming to rest his predatory eyes upon johns affianced lady i stared at the now broadening river where the reappearance of the bridge and of kings port and the nearer chimneys pouring out their smoke a few miles above the town betokened that our excursion was drawing to its end and then from the chimneys neighborhood from the waterside where their factories stood there shot out into the smoothness of the stream a launch it crossed into our course ahead of us preceded us quickly growing soon into a dot went through the bridge and so was seen no longer and its occupants must have reached town a good half hour before we did and now suddenly i was stunned with a great discovery the brides voice sounded in my ear well ill always say youre a prophet anyhow i looked at her dull and dazed by the internal commotion the discovery had raised in me you said we wouldnt get stuck in the mud and we didnt said the bride i pointed to the chimneys are those the phosphate works yais didnt you know the vc phosphate works why yais havent you been to see them yet he ought to oughtnt he david specially now theyve found those deposits up the river were just as rich as they hoped after all whose mr mayrants i asked with such sharpness that the bride was surprised david hadnt attended to the name it was some trust estate he thought regent tom or some such thing and they thought it was no good said the bride and its aivry bit as good as the coosaw used to be better than florida or tennessee my eyes instinctively turned to where they had last seen the launch of course it wasnt there any more then i spoke to david do you know what a phosphate bed looks like can one see it this kind you can he answered but its not worth your trouble just a kind of a square hole you dig along the river till you strike the stuff what you want to see is the works no i didnt want to see even the works they smelt atrociously and i do not care for vats and acids and processes and besides had i not seen enough my eyes went down the river again where that launch had gone and i wondered if the weddingcake would be postponed any more regent tom oh yes to be sure john mayrant had pointed out to me the house where he had lived he had been johns uncle so the old gentleman had left his estate in trust and now but certainly hortense would have won the battle of chattanooga dont be too sure about all this i told myself cautiously but there are times when cautioning ones self is quite as useless as if somebody else had cautioned one my reason leaped with the rapidity of intuition i merely sat and looked on at what it was doing all sorts of odds and ends words i hadnt understood looks and silences i hadnt interpreted little signs that i had thought nothing of at first but which i had gradually through their multiplicity come to know meant something all these broken pieces fitted into each other now fell together and made a clear pattern of the truth without a crack in it hortense had never believed in that story about the phosphates having failed pinched out as they say of ore deposits there she had stood between her two suitors between her affianced john and the besieging charley and before she would be off with the old love and on with the new she must personally look into those phosphates therefore she had been obliged to have a sick father and postpone the wedding two or three times because her affairs very likely the necessity of making certain of charley had prevented her from coming sooner to kings port and having now come hither and having beheld her northern and her southern lovers side by side had the comparison done something to her highly controlled heart was love taking some hitherto unknown liberties with that wellbalanced organ but what an outrage had been perpetrated upon john at that my deductions staggered in their rapid course how could his aunts but then it had only been one of them miss josephine had never approved of miss elizas course it was of that that mrs weguelin st michael had so emphatically reminded mrs gregory in my presence when we had strolled together upon high walk and those two ladies had talked oracles in my presence well they were oracles no longer when the boat brought us back to the wharf there were the rest of my flowers unbestowed and upon whom should i bestow them i thought first of eliza la heu but she wouldnt be at the exchange so late as this then it seemed well to carry them to mrs weguelin something however prompted me to pass her door and continue vaguely walking on until i came to the house where miss josephine and miss eliza lived and here i rang the bell and was admitted they were sitting as i had seen them first the one with her embroidery and the other on the further side of a table whereon lay an open letter which in a few moments i knew must have been the subject of the discussion which they finished even as i came forward it was only prolonging an honest mistake that was miss eliza and it has merely resulted in clinching what you meant it to finish that was miss josephine i laid my flowers upon the table and saw that the letter was in john mayrants hand of course i avoided looking at it again but what had he written and why had he written his daily steps turned to this house unless miss josephine had banished him again the ladies accepted my offering with gracious expressions and while i told them of my visit to live oaks and poured out my enthusiasm the servant was sent for and brought water and two beautiful old china bowls in which miss eliza proceeded to arrange the flowers with her delicate white hands she made them look exquisite with an old ladys art and this little occupation went on as we talked of indifferent subjects but the atmosphere of that room was charged with the subject of which we did not speak the letter lay on the table and even as i struggled to sustain polite conversation i began to know what was in it though i never looked at it again it spoke out as clearly to me as the launch had done i had thought when i first entered to tell the ladies something of my meeting with hortense rieppe i can only say that i found this impossible neither of them referred to her or to john or to anything that approached what we were all thinking of for me to do so would have assumed the dimensions of a liberty and in consequence of this state of things constraint sat upon us all growing worse and so pervading our smalltalk with discomfort that i made my visit a very short one of course they were civil about this when i rose and begged me not to go so soon but i knew better and even as i was getting my hat and gloves in the hall i could tell by their tones that they had returned to the subject of that letter but in truth they had never left it as the front door shut behind me i felt as if they had read it aloud to me xvi the steel wasp certainly hortense rieppe would have won the battle of chattanooga i know not from which parent that young woman inherited her gift of strategy but she was a master to use the resources of one lover in order to ascertain if another lover had any to lay tribute on everything that charley possessed on his influence in the business world which enabled him to walk into the vc chemical companys office and borrow an expert in the phosphate line on his launch in which to pop the expert and take him up the river and see in his company and learn from his lips just what resources of worldly wealth were likely to be instore for john mayrant and finally which was the key to all the rest on his inveterate passion for her on his bankerlike determination through all the thick and thin of discouragement and worse than discouragement of contemptuous coquetry to possess her at any cost he could afford to use all this that charley had in order that she might judiciously arrive at the decision whether she would take him or his rival left one lost in admiration and then not to waste a moment to reach town one evening and next morning by ten oclock to have that expert safe in the launch on his way up the river to the phosphate diggings the very audacity of such unscrupulousness commanded my respect successful dishonor generally wins louder applause than successful virtue but to be married to her oh not for worlds charley might meet such emergency but poor john never i nearly walked into mrs weguelin and mrs gregory taking their customary air slowly in south place but why a steel wasp i said at once to mrs weguelin it was a more familiar way of beginning with the little dignified lady than would have been at all possible or suitable if we had not had that little joke about the piano snobile between us as it was she was not wholly displeased these kings port old ladies grew i suspect very slowly and guardedly accustomed to any outsider they allowed themselves very seldom to suffer any form of abruptness from him or from any one for that matter but once they were reassured as to him then they might sometimes allow the privileged person certain departures from their own rule of deportment because his conventions were recognized to be different from theirs moreover in reminding mrs weguelin of the steel wasp i had put my abruptness in quotations so to speak by the tone i gave it just as people who are particular in speech can often interpolate a word of current slang elegantly by means of the shade of emphasis which they lay upon it so mrs weguelin smiled and her dark eyes danced a little you remember i said that then i remember everything that you said how much have you seen of the creature demanded mrs gregory with her head pretty high well im seeing more and more and more every minute shes rather endless mrs weguelin looked reproachful you surely cannot admire her too mrs gregory hadnt understood me oh if you really can keep her away youre welcome i only meant i explained to the ladies that you dont really begin to see her till you have seen her its afterward when youre out of reach of the spell and i told them of the interview which i had not been able to tell to miss josephine and miss eliza i doubt if it lasted more than four minutes i assured them up the river repeated mrs gregory at the landing i repeated and the ladies consulted each others expressions but that didnt bother me any more and you can admire her mrs weguelin persisted may i tell you exactly precisely oh do they both exclaimed well i think many wise men would find her immensely desirable as somebody elses wife at this remark mrs weguelin dropped her eyes but i knew they were dancing beneath their lids i should not have permitted myself to say that but i am glad that it has been said mrs gregory turned to her companion shall we call tomorrow dont you feel it must be done returned mrs weguelin and then she addressed me do you know a mr beverly rodgers i gave him a golden recommendation and took my leave of the ladies so they were going to do the handsome thing they would ring the cornerlys bell they would cross the interloping threshold they would recognize the interloping girl and this meant that they had given it up it meant that miss eliza had given it up too had at last abandoned her position that the marriage would never take place and her own act had probably drawn this down upon her when the trustee of that estate had told her of the apparent failure of the phosphates she had hailed it as an escape for her beloved john and for all of them because she made sure that hortense would never marry a virtually penniless man and when the work went on and the rich fortune was unearthed after all her influence had caused that revelation to be delayed because she was so confident that the engagement would be broken but she had reckoned without hortense worse than that she had reckoned without john mayrant in her meddling attempt to guide his affairs in the way that she believed would be best for him she forgot that the boy whom she had brought up was no longer a child and thus she unpardonably ignored his rights as a man and now miss josephines disapproval was vindicated and her own casuistry was doubly punished miss rieppes astute journey of investigation for her purpose had evidently become suspected by some of them beforehand had forced miss eliza to disclose the truth about the phosphates to her nephew before it should be told him by the girl herself and the intolerable position of apparent duplicity precipitated two wholly inevitable actions on his part he had bound himself more than ever to marry hortense and he had made a furious breach with his aunt eliza that was what his letter had contained this time he had banished himself from that house what was his aunt eliza going to do about it i wondered she was a stiff if indiscreet old lady and it certainly did not fall within her view of the proprieties that young people should take their elders to task in furious letters but she had been totally in the wrong and her fault was irreparable because important things had happened in consequence of it she might repent the fault in sackcloth and ashes but she couldnt stop the things would she then honorably wear the sackcloth or would she dishonestly shirk it under the false issue of her nephews improper tone to her women can justify themselves with more appalling skill than men one drop there was in all this bitter bucket which must have tasted sweet to john he had resigned from the custom house juno had got it right this time though she hadnt a notion of the real reason for johns act this act had been since morning lost for me so to speak in the shuffle of more absorbing events and it now rose to view again in my mind as a telling stroke in the fulllength portrait that all his acts had been painting of the boy during the last twentyfour hours notwithstanding a meddlesome aunt and an arriving sweetheart and imminent wedlock he hadnt forgotten to stop taking orders from a negro at the very first opportunity which came to him his phosphates had done this for him at least and i should have the pleasure of correcting juno at tea but i did not have this pleasure they were all in an excitement over something else and my own different excitement hadnt a chance against this greater one for people seldom wish to hear what you have to say even under the most favorable circumstances and never when they have anything to say themselves with an audience so hotly preoccupied i couldnt have sat on juno effectively at all and therefore i kept it to myself and attended very slightly to what they were telling me about the daughters of dixie i bowed absently to the poetess and your poem i said a great success i am sure why didnt you hear me say so said the upcountry bride and then after a smile at the others im sure your flowers were graciously accepted ask miss josephine st michael i replied oh oh oh went the bride how would she know i gave myself no pains to improve or arrest this tiresome joke and they went back to their daughters of dixie but it is rather singular how sometimes an utterly absurd notion will be the cause of our taking a step which we had not contemplated i did carry some flowers to miss la heu the next day i was at some trouble to find any for in kings port shops of this kind are by no means plentiful and it was not until i had paid a visit to a quite distant garden at the extreme northwestern edge of the town that i lighted upon anything worthy of the girl behind the counter the exchange itself was apt to have flowers for sale but i hardly saw my way to buying them there and then immediately offering them to the fair person who had sold them to me as it was i did much better for what i brought her were decidedly superior to any that were at the exchange when i entered it at lunch time they were as the upcountry bride would have put it graciously accepted miss la heu stood them in water on the counter beside her ledger she was looking lovely i expected you yesterday she said the new lady baltimore was ready well if it is not all eaten yet oh no not a slice gone ah nobody does your art justice here go and sit down at your table please it was really quite difficult to say to her from that distance the sort of things that i wished to say but there seemed to be no help for it and i did my best i shall miss my lunches here very much when im gone did you say coffee today chocolate i shall miss and the lettuce sandwiches yes you dont realize how much these lunches have cost you she seemed determined to keep laughing you have said it they have cost me my i can give you the receipt you know the receipt for lady baltimore to take with you youll have to give me a receipt for a lost heart oh his heart general listen to from habit she had turned to where her dog used to lie and sudden pain swept over her face and was mastered never mind she quickly resumed please dont speak about it and you have a heart somewhere for it was very nice in you to come in yesterday morning after after the bridge i hope i have a heart i began rising for really i could not go on in this way sitting down away back at the lunch table but the door opened and hortense rieppe came into the womans exchange it was at me that she first looked and she gave me the slightest bow possible the least sign of conventional recognition that a movement of the head could make and be visible at all she didnt bend her head down she tilted it ever so little up it wasnt new to me this form of greeting and i knew that she had acquired it at newport and that it denoted all too accurately the size of my importance in her eyes she did it as she did everything with perfection then she turned to eliza la heu whose face had become miraculously sweet good morning said hortense it sounded from a quiet well of reserve music just a cupful of melodious tone dipped lightly out of the surface her face hadnt become anything but it was equally miraculous in its total void of all expression relating to this moment or to any moment just her beauty her permanent stationary beauty was there glowing in it and through it not skin deep but going back and back into her lazy eyes and shining from within the modulated bloom of her color and the depths of her amber hair she was choosing for this occasion to be as impersonal as some radiant hour in nature some mellow motionless day when the leaves have turned but have not fallen and it is drowsily warm but it wasnt so much of nature that she in her harmonious lustre reminded me as of some beautiful silkenshaded lamp from which color rather than light came with subdued ampleness i saw her eyes settle upon the flowers that i had brought eliza la heu how beautiful those are she remarked is there something that you wish inquired miss la heu always miraculously sweet some of your good things for lunch a very little if you will be so kind i had gone back to my table while the very little was being selected and i felt in spite of how slightly she counted me that it would be inadequate in me to remain completely dumb mr mayrant is still at the custom house i observed for a few days yes happily we shall soon break that connection and she smelt my flowers we i thought to myself is rather tremendous it grew more tremendous in the silence as eliza la heu brought me my orders miss rieppe did not seat herself to take the light refreshment which she found enough for lunch her plate and cup were set for her but she walked about now with one and now with the other taking her time over it and pausing here and there at some article of the exchange stock of course she hadnt come there for any lunch the cornerlys had midday lunch and dined late these innovated hours were a part of kings ports deep suspicion of the cornerlys but what now became interesting was her evident indifference to our perceiving that lunch was merely a pretext with her in fact i think she wished it to be perceived and i also think that those turns which she took about the exchange her apparent inspection of an old mahogany table her examination of a pewter set were a symbol and meant to be a symbol of how she had all the time there was and the possession of everything she wished including the situation and that she enjoyed having this sink in while she was rearranging whatever she had arranged to say in consequence of finding that i should also hear it and how well she was worth looking at no matter whether she stood or moved or what she did her age lay beyond the reach of the human eye if she was twentyfive she was marvelous in her mastery of her appearance if she was thirtyfour she was marvelous in her mastery of perpetuating it and by no other means than perfect dress personal to herself for she had taken the fashion and welded it into her own plasticity and perfect health for without a trace of the athletic her graceful shape teemed with elasticity there was a touch of sport in the parasol she had laid down and with all her blended serenity there was a touch of sport in her experience could teach her beauty nothing more it wore the look of having been made love to by many married men quite suddenly the true light flashed upon me i had been slowsighted indeed so that was what she had come here for today miss hortense was going to pay her compliments to miss la heu i believe that my sight might still have been slow but for that miraculous sweetness upon the face of eliza she was ready for the compliments well i sat expectant and disappointment was by no means my lot hortense finished her lunch and so this interesting place is where you work eliza thus addressed assented and you furnish wedding cakes also eliza was continuously and miraculously sweet the exchange includes that i shall hope you will be present to taste some of yours on the day it is mine i shall accept the invitation if my friends send me one no blood flowed from hortense at this and she continued with the same smooth deliberation the list is of necessity very small but i shall see that it includes you you are not going to postpone it any more then no blood flowed at this either i doubt if john if mr mayrant would brook further delay and my father seems stronger at last how much do i owe you for your very good food it is a pity that a larger audience could not have been there to enjoy this skilful duet for it held me hanging on every musical word of it there at the far back end of the long room i sat alone at my table pretending to be engaged over a sandwich that was no more in existence external i mean and a totally empty cup of chocolate i lifted the cup and bowed over the plate and used the paper japanese napkin and generally went through the various discreet paces of eating quite breathless all the while to know which of them was coming out ahead there was no fairness in their positions hortense had eliza in a cage penned in by every fact but it doesnt do to go too near some birds even when theyre caged and while these two birds had been giving their sweet manifestations of song eliza had driven a peck or two home through the bars which though they did not draw visible blood as i have said probably taught hortense that a newport education is not the only instruction which fits you for drawingroom war to the knife her small reckoning was paid and she had drawn on one long tawny glove even this act was a luxury to watch so full it was of the feminine of the stretching indolent ease that the flesh and the spirit of this creature invariably seemed to move with but why didnt she go this became my wonder now while she slowly drew on the second glove she was taking more time than it needed your flowers are for sale too this after her silence struck me as being something planned out after her original plan the original plan had finished with that second assertion of her ownership of john or i had better say of his ownership in her that doubt she had expressed as to his being willing to consent to any further postponement of their marriage of course she had expected and got herself ready for some thrust on the postponement subject eliza crossed from behind her counter to where the exchange flowers stood on the opposite side of the room and took some of them up but those are inferior said hortense these and she touched rightly the bowl in which my roses stood close beside elizas ledger eliza paused for one second those are not for sale hortense paused too then she hung to it they are so much the best she was holding her purse i think so too said eliza but i cannot let any one have them hortense put her purse away you know best shall you furnish us flowers as well as cake elizas sweetness rose an octave softer and softer why they have flowers there didnt you know and to this last and frightful peck through the bars hortense found no retaliation with a bow to eliza and a total oblivion of me she went out of the exchange she had flaunted her john in elizas face she had as they say rubbed it in that he was her john but was it such a neat tidy victory after all she had given away the last word to eliza presented her with that poisonous speech which when translated meant yes hes your john and youre climbing up him into houses where youd otherwise be arrested for trespass for it was in one of the various st michael houses that the marriage would be held owing to the nomadic state of the rieppes yes hortense had gone altogether too close to the cage at the end and in that repetition of her taunt about furnishing supplies for the wedding she had at length betrayed something which her skill and the intricate enamel of her experience had hitherto and with entire success concealed namely the latent vulgarity of the woman she was wearing for the sake of kings port her best behavior her most knowing form and indeed it was a welldone imitation of the real thing it would last through most occasions and it would deceive most people but here was the trouble she was wearing it while through the whole encounter eliza la heu had worn nothing but her natural and perfect dignity yet with that disadvantage for good breeding alas is at times a sort of disadvantage and can be battered down and covered with mud so that its own fine grain is invisible eliza had after a somewhat undecisive battle got in that last frightful peck but what had led hortense after she had come through pretty well to lose her temper and thus at the finish expose to eliza her weakest position that her clothes were paid for by a newport lady who had taken her to worth that her wedding feast was to be paid for by the bridegroom these were not facts which eliza would deign to use as weapons but she was marrying inside the doors of elizas kings port that had never opened to admit her before and she had slipped into putting this chance into elizas hand and how had she come to do this to be sure my vision had been slow hortense had seen through her thick veil elizas interest in john in the first minute of her arrival on the bridge that minute when john had run up to eliza after the automobile had passed over poor general and hortense had not revealed herself at once because she wanted a longer look at them well she had got it and she had got also a look at her affianced john when he was in the fireeating mood and had displayed the conduct appropriate to while charleys display had been so much more modern and so first she had prudently settled that awkward phosphate difficulty and next she had paid this little visit to eliza in order to have the pleasure of telling her in four or five different ways and driving it in deep and turning it round dont you wish you may get him thats all clear as day i said to myself but what does her loss of temper mean eliza was writing at her ledger the sweetness hadnt entirely gone it was too soon for that and besides she knew i must be looking at her couldnt you have told her they were my flowers i asked her at the counter as i prepared to depart eliza did not look up from her ledger do you think she would have believed me and why shouldnt go out she interrupted imperiously and with a stamp of her foot youve been here long enough you may imagine my amazement at this it was not until i had reached mrs trevises and was sitting down to answer a note which had been left for me that light again came hortense rieppe had thought those flowers were from john mayrant and eliza had let her think so yes that was light a good bright light shed on the matter but a still more brilliant beam was cast by the upcountry bride when i came into the diningroom i told her myself at once that i had taken flowers to miss la heu i preferred she should hear this from me before she learned it from the smiling lips of gossip it surprised me that she should immediately inquire what kind of flowers why roses i answered and she went into peals of laughter pray share the jest i begged her with some dignity didnt you know she replied the language that roses from a single gentleman to a young lady speak in kings port i stood staring and stiff taking it in taking myself and eliza and hortense and the implicated john all in why aivrybody in kings port knows that said the bride and now my mirth rose even above hers xvii doing the handsome thing it by no means lessened my pleasure to discern that hortense must feel herself to be in a predicament and as i sat writing my answer to the note which was from mrs weguelin st michael and contained an invitation to me for the next afternoon i thought of those pilots whose dangers have come down to us from distant times through the songs of ancient poets the narrow and tempestuous channel between scylla and charybdis bristled unquestionably with violent problems but with none i should suppose that called for a nicer hand upon the wheel or an eye more alert than this steering of your little trireme to a successful marriage between one man who believed himself to be your destined bridegroom and another who expected to be so meanwhile keeping each in ignorance of how close you were sailing to the other in hortenses place i should have wished to hasten the wedding now have it safely performed this afternoon say or tomorrow morning thus precipitated by some invaluable turn in the health of her poor dear father but she had worn it out his health by playing it for decidedly as much as it could bear it couldnt be used again without risk the date must stand fixed and uneasy as she might have begun to be about john hortense must with no shortening of the course get her boat in safe without smashing it against either john or charley i wondered a little that she should feel any uncertainty about her affianced lover she must know how much his word was to him and she had had his word twice given her the second time to put his own honor right with her on the score of the phosphates but perhaps hortenses rich experiences of life had taught her that a mans word to a woman should not be subjected to the test of another womans advent on the whole i suppose it was quite natural those flowers should annoy her and equally natural that eliza the minx should allow them to do so theres a joy to the marrow in watching your enemy harried and discomfited by his own gratuitous contrivances you look on serenely at a show which hasnt cost you a groat however poor eliza had not been so serene at the very end when she stormed out at me for this i did not have to forgive her of course little as i had merited such treatment had she not accepted my flowers but it was a gratification to reflect that in my sentimental passages with her i had not gone to any great length nothing do i ever find is so irksome as the sense of having unwittingly been in a false position was john on his side in love with her was it possible he would fail in his word so with these thoughts while answering and accepting mrs weguelin st michaels invitation to make one of a party of strangers to whom she was going to show another old kings port church where many of my ancestors lie as her note informed me i added one sentence which had nothing to do with the subject she is a steel wasp i ventured to say and when on the next afternoon i met the party at the church i received from the little lady a look of highly spiced comprehension as she gently remarked i was glad to get your acceptance when i went down to the dinnertable juno sat in her best clothes still discussing the daughters of dixie i cant say that i took much more heed of this at dinner than i had done at tea but i was interested to hear juno mention that she too intended to call upon hortense rieppe kings port she said must take a consistent position and for her part so far as behavior went she didnt see much to choose between the couple as to whether mr mayrant had really concealed the discovery of his fortune she continued i asked miss josephine in a perfectly nice way of course but old mr st michael beaugarcon who has always had the estate in charge did that it is only a life estate unless mr mayrant has lawful issue well he will have that now and all that money will be his to squander aunt carola had written me again this morning but i had been in no haste to open her letter my neglect of the bombos did not weigh too heavily upon me i fear but i certainly did put off reading what i expected to be a reprimand and concerning this i was right her first words betokened reprimand at once my dear nephew augustus she began in her fine elegant handwriting that was always her mode of address to me when something was coming while at other times it would be less portentously my dear augustus or my dear nephew but whenever my name and my relationship to her occurred conjointly i took the communication away with me to some corner and opened it in solitude it wasnt about the bombos though and for what she took me to task i was able to defend myself i think quite adequately she found fault with me for liking the south too much and this she based upon the enthusiastic accounts of kings port and its people that i had written to her nor had she at all approved of my remarks on the subject of the negro called forth by daddy ben and his grandson charles cotesworth when i sent you wrote aunt carola to admire kings port goodbreeding i did not send you to forget your country remember that those people were its mortal enemies that besides their treatment of our prisoners in libby and andersonville which killed my brother alexander they displayed in their dealings both social and political an arrogance in success and a childish petulance at opposition which we who saw and suffered can never forget any more than we can forget our loved ones who laid down their lives for this cause these were not the only words with which aunt carola reproved what she termed my disloyalty but they will serve to indicate her feeling about the civil war it was on her side precisely the feeling of all the kings port old ladies on heir side but why should it be mine and so after much thinking how i might best reply respectfully yet say to aunt carola what my feeling was i sat down upstairs at my window and after some preliminary sentences wrote there are dead brothers here also who like your brother laid down their lives for what they believed was their country and whom their sisters never can forget as you can never forget him i read their names upon sad church tablets and their boy faces look out at me from cherished miniatures and dim daguerreotypes upon their graves the women who mourn them leave flowers as you leave flowers upon the grave of your young soldier you will tell me perhaps that since the bereavement is equal i have not justified my sympathy for these people but the bereavement was not equal more homes here were robbed by death of their light and promise than with us and to this you must add the material desolation of the homes themselves our roofs were not laid in ashes and today we sit in affluence while they sit in privation you will say to this perhaps that they brought it upon themselves but even granting that they did so surely to suffer and to lose is more bitter than to suffer and to win my dear aunt you could not see what i have seen here and write to me as you do and if those years have left upon your heart a scar which will not vanish do not ask me who came afterward to wear the scar also i should then resemble certain of the younger ones here with less excuse than is theirs as for the negro forgive me if i assure you that you retain an abolitionist exaltation for a creature who does not exist or whose existence is an ineffectual drop in the bucket a creature on grateful knees raising faithful eyes to one who has struck off his chains of slavery whereas the creature who does exist is i paused here in my letter to aunt carola and sought for some fitting expression that should characterize for her with sufficient severity the new type of deliberately worthless negro and as i sought my eyes wandered to the garden next door the garden of the cornerlys on a bench near a shady arrangement of vines over bars sat hortense rieppe she was alone and from her attitude seemed to be thinking deeply the high walls of the garden shut her into a privacy that her position near the shady vines still more increased it was evident that she had come here for the sake of being alone and i regretted that she was so turned from me that i could not see her face but her solitude did not long continue there came into view a gentleman of wouldbe venerable appearance who approached her with a walk carefully constructed for public admiration and who upon reaching her bent over with the same sort of footlight elaboration and gave her a paternal kiss i did not need to hear her call him father he was so obviously general rieppe the prudent hero of chattanooga that words would have been perfectly superfluous in his identification i was destined upon another day to hear the tones of his voice and thereupon may as well state now that they belonged altogether with the rest of him there is a familiar type of northern fraud and a southern type equally familiar but totally different in appearance the northern type has the straight flat earnest hair the shaven upper lip the chinbeard and the benevolent religious expression he will be the president of several charities and the head of one great business he plays no cards drinks no wine and warns young men to beware of temptation he is as genial as a hairsofa and he is seldom found out by the public unless some financial crash in general affairs uncovers his cheating which lies most often beyond the laws reach and because he cannot be put in jail he quite honestly believes heaven is his destination we see less of him since we have ceased to be a religious country religion no longer being an essential disguise for him the southern type with his unction and his juleps is better company unless he is the hero of too many of his own anecdotes he is commonly the possessor of a poetic gaze a mane of silvery hair and a noble neck as war days and cottonfactor days recede into a past more and more filmed over with romance he too grows rare among us and i regret it for he was in truth a picturesque figure general rieppe was perfect at first i was sorry that the distance they were from me rendered hearing what they were saying impossible very soon however the frame of my open window provided me with a living picture which would have been actually spoiled had the human voice disturbed its eloquent pantomime general rieppes daughter responded to her fathers caress but languidly turning to him her face with its luminous stationary beauty he pointed to the house and then waved his hand toward the bench where she sat and she in response to this nodded slightly upon which the general after another kiss of histrionic paternity administered to her forehead left her sitting and proceeded along the garden walk at a stately pace until i could no longer see him hortense left alone upon the bench looked down at the folds of her dress extended a hand and slowly rearranged one of them and then with the same hand felt her hair from front to back this had scarce been accomplished when the general reappeared ushering juno along the walk and bearing a chair with him when they turned the corner at the arbor hortense rose and greetings ensued few objects could be straighter than was junos back her cardcase was in her hand but her pocket was not quite large enough for the whole of her pride which stuck out so that it could have been seen from a greater distance than my window the general would have departed placing his chair for the visitor when hortense waved for him an inviting hand toward the bench beside her he waved a similarly inviting hand looking at juno who thereupon sat firmly down upon the chair at this the general hovered heavily looking at his daughter who gave him no look in return as she engaged in conversation with juno and presently the general left them junos back and hortenses front both entirely motionless as they interviewed each other presented a stiff appearance with juno half turned in her seat and hortenses glance following her slight movement the two then rose as the general came down the walk with two chairs and mrs gregory and mrs weguelin st michael juno with a bow to them approached hortense by a step or two a brief touch of their fingers was to be seen and junos departure took place attended by the heavy hovering of general rieppe thats why i said to myself aloud suddenly at my open window immediately however i added but can it be and in my mind a whole little edifice of reasons for hortenses apparent determination to marry john instantly fabricated itself and then fell down through john she was triumphantly bringing stiff kings port to her was forcing them to accept her but this was scarce enough temptation for hortense to marry she could do very well without kings port indeed she was not very likely to show herself in it save to remind them now and then that she was there and that they could not keep her out any more this might amuse her a little but the society itself would not amuse her in the least what place had it for her to smoke her cigarettes in eliza la heu then spite the pleasure of taking something that somebody else wanted the pleasure of spoiling somebody elses pleasure or more accurately the pleasure of power well yes that might be it if hortense rieppe were younger in years and younger especially in soul but her museum was too richly furnished with specimens of the chase she had collected too many bits and bibelots from lifes hotel druot and the great bazaar of female competition to pay so great a price as marriage for merely john particularly when a lady even in newport can have but one husband at a time in her collection if she did actually love john as beverly rodgers had reluctantly come to believe it was most inappropriate in her had i followed out the train of reasoning which lay coiled up inside the word inappropriate i might have reached the solution which eventually hortense herself gave me and the jewelled recesses of her nature would have blazed still more brilliantly to my eyes today but in truth my soul wasnt old enough yet to work hortense out by itself unaided while mrs gregory and mrs weguelin sat on their chairs and hortense sat on her bench tea was brought and a table laid behind whose whiteness and silver hortense began slight offices with cups and sugar tongs she looked inquiry at her visitors in answer to which mrs gregory indicated acceptance and mrs weguelin refusal the beauty of hortenses face had strangely increased since the arrival of these two visitors it shone resplendent behind the silver and the white cloth and her movement as she gave the cup to mrs gregory st michael was one of complete grace and admirable propriety but once she looked away from them in the direction of the path her two visitors rose and left her mrs gregory setting her teacup down with a gesture that said she would take no more and after their bows of farewell hortense sat alone again pulling about the tea things i saw that by the table lay a cardcase on the ground evidently dropped by mrs gregory but hortense could not see it where she sat her quick look along the path heralded more company and the general with more chairs young people now began to appear the various motions of whom were more animated than the approaches and greetings and farewells of their elders chairs were moved and exchanged the general was useful in handling cups and a number of faces unknown to me came and went some of them elderly ones whom i had seen in church or passed while walking the black dresses of age mingled with the brighter colors of youth and on her bench behind the cups sat hortense or rose up at right moments radiant restrained and adequate receiving with deferential attention the remarks of some darkclothed elder or with sufficiently interested countenance inquiring something from a brighter one of her own generation but twice i saw her look up the garden path none of them stayed long although when they were all gone the shadow of the garden wall had come as far as the arbor and once again hortense sat alone behind the table leaning back with arms folded and looking straight in front of her at last she stirred and rose slowly and then with a movement which was the perfection of timidity began to advance as john with his aunt eliza came along the path to john hortense with familiar yet discreet brightness gave a left hand as she waited for the old lady and then the old lady went through with it what that embrace of acknowledgment cost her cannot be measured and during its process john stood like a sentinel possibly this was the price of his forgiveness to his aunt eliza the visitors accepted tea and the beauty in hortenses face was now supreme the old lady sat forgetting to drink her tea but very still in outward attitude as she talked with hortense and the sight of one hand in its glove lying motionless upon her best dress suddenly almost drew unexpected tears to my eyes john was nearly as quiet as she but the glove that he held was twisted between his fingers i expected that he would stay with his hortense when his aunt took her leave he however was evidently expected by the old lady to accompany her out and back i suppose to her house as was proper but johns departure from hortense differed from his meeting her she gave no left hand to him now she gazed at him and then as the old lady began to go toward the house she moved a step toward him and then she cast herself into his arms it was no acting this no skilful simulation her head sank upon his shoulder and true passion spoke in every line of that beautiful surrendered form as it leaned against her lovers so thats why i exclaimed once more aloud it was but a moment and john released followed miss eliza the old lady walked slowly with that halffailing step that betokens the bodys weariness after great mental or moral strain indeed as john regained her side she put her arm in his as if her feebleness needed his support thus they went away together the aunt and her beloved boy who had so sorely grieved and disappointed her but if this sight touched me this glimpse of the vanquished leaving the field after supreme acknowledgment of defeat upon hortense it wrought another effect altogether she stood looking after them and as she looked the whole woman from head to foot motionless as she was seemed to harden yet still she looked until at length slowly turning her eyes chanced to fall upon mrs gregory st michaels cardcase there it lay the symbol of kings ports capitulation she swooped down and up with a flying curve of grace holding her prey caught and then catching also her handsome skirts on either side she danced like a whirling fan among the empty chairs xviii again the replacers but a little while and all that i had just witnessed in such vivid dumbshow might have seemed to me in truth some masque so smooth had it been and voiceless coming and going like a devised fancy and after the last of the players was gone from the stage leaving the white cloth and the silver and the cups and the groups of chairs near the pleasant arbor i watched the deserted garden whence the sunlight was slowly departing and it seemed to me more than ever like some empty and charming scene in a playhouse to which the comedians would in due time return to repeat their delicate pantomime but these were mental indulgences with which i sat playing until the sight of my interrupted letter to aunt carola on the table before me brought the reality of everything back into my thoughts and i shook my head over miss eliza i remembered that hand of hers lying in despondent acquiescence upon her lap as the old lady sat in her best dress formally and faithfully accepting the woman whom her nephew john had brought upon them as his brideelect formally and faithfully accepting this distasteful person and thus atoning as best she could to her beloved nephew for the wrong that her affection had led her to do him in that illstarred and inexcusable tampering with his affairs but there was my letter waiting i took my pen and finished what i had to say about the negro and the injustice we had done to him as well as to our own race by the fifteenth amendment i wrote i think northerners must often seem to these people strangely obtuse in their attitude and they deserve such opinion since all they need to do is come here and see for themselves what the war did to the south you may have a perfectly just fight with a man and beat him rightly but if you are able to go on with your work next day while his health is so damaged that for a long while he limps about as a cripple you must not look up from your busy thriving and reproach him with his helplessness and remind him of its cause nor must you be surprised that he remembers the fight longer than you have time for i know that the north meant to be magnanimous that the north was magnanimous that the spirit of grant at appomattox filled many breasts and i know that the magnanimity was not met by those who led the south after lees retirement and before reconstruction set in and that the fifteenth amendment was brought on by their own doings when have two wrongs made a right and to place the negro above these people was an atrocity you cannot expect them to inquire very industriously how magnanimous this north meant to be when they have suffered at her hands worse far worse than france suffered from germanys after i do think there should be a different spirit among some of the laterborn but i have come to understand even the slights and suspicions from which i here and there suffer since to their minds shut in by circumstance im always a yankee we are prosperous and prosperity does not bind it merely assembles people at dinners and dances it is adversity that binds beside the gravestone beneath the desolated roof could you come here and see what i have seen the retrospect of suffering the long lingering convalescence the small outlook of vigor to come and the steadfast sodality of affliction and affection and fortitude your kind but unenlightened heart would be wrung as mine has been and is being at every turn after i had posted this reply to aunt carola i had some fears that my pen had run away with me and that she might now descend upon me with that reproof which she knew so well how to exercise in cases of disrespect but there was actually a certain pathos in her mildness when it came she felt it her duty to go over a good deal of history first but i do not understand the present generation she finished and i suppose that i was not meant to the little sigh in these words did great credit to aunt carola this vindication off my mind and relieved by it of the more general thoughts about kings port and the south which the pantomime of kings ports forced capitulation to hortense had raised in me i returned to the personal matters between that young woman and john and charley how much did charley know how much would charley stand how much would john stand if he came to know well the scene in the garden now helped me to answer these questions much better than i could have answered them before its occurrence with one fact the great fact of love established it was not difficult to account for at least one or two of the several things that puzzled me there could be no doubt that hortense loved john mayrant loved him beyond her own control when this love had begun made no matter perhaps it began on the bridge when the money was torn and eliza la heu had appeared the kings port version of hortenses indifference to john before the event of the phosphates might well enough be true it might even well enough be true that she had taken him and his phosphates at newport for lack of anything better at hand and because she was sick of disappointed hopes in this case charleys subsequent appearance as something very much better if the phosphates were to fail would perfectly explain the various postponements of the wedding so i was able to answer my questions to myself thus how much did charley know just what he could see for himself and what he had most likely heard from newport gossip he could have heard of an old engagement made purely for moneys sake and of recent delays created by the lady and he could see the gentleman an impossible husband from a wall street standpoint to whom hortense was evidently tempering her final refusal by indulgently taking an interest in helping along his phosphate fortune charley would not refuse to lend her his aid in this estimable benevolence nor would it occur to charleys sensibilities how such benevolence would be taken by john if john were not taken himself yes charley was plainly fooled and fooled the more readily because he had the old version of the truth how should he suspect there was a revised version how should he discover that passion had now changed sides that it was now john who allowed himself to be loved the signs of this did not occur before his eyes of course charley would not stay fooled forever the hours of that were numbered but their number was quite beyond my guessing how much would charley stand he would stand a good deal because the measure of his toleration was the measure of his desire for hortense and it was plain that he wanted her very much indeed but how much would john stand how soon would his fireeating traditions produce a difficulty why had they not done this already well the garden had in some way helped me to frame a fairly reasonable answer for this also poor hortense had become as powerless to woo john to warmth as poor venus had been with adonis and passion in changing sides had advanced the boys knowledge he knew now the difference between the embraces of his lady when she had merely wanted his phosphates and these other caresses now that she wanted him in his ceaseless search for some possible loophole of escape his eye could not have overlooked the chance that lay in charley and he was far too canny to blast his forlorn hope he had probably wondered what had changed the nature of hortenses caresses and the adventure of the torn money could scarce have failed to suggest itself to the mind of a youth who little as he had trodden the ways of the world evidently possessed some lively instincts regarding the nature of women to batter charley as he had battered junos nephew might result in winding the arms of hortense around his own neck more tightly than ever why hortense should keep charley on any longer was what i could least fathom but i trusted her to have excellent reasons for anything that she did its sure to be quite simple once you know it i told myself and the near future proved me to be right thus i laid most of my enigmas to rest there was but one which now and then awakened still were hortense a raw girl of eighteen i could easily grant that the fireeater in john would be sure to move her but hortense had travelled many miles away from the green forests of romance her present fields were carpeted not with grass and flowers but with oriental mats and rugs and it was electric lights not the moon and stars that shone upon her highly seasoned nights no torn money and all it was not appropriate in a woman of her experience and so i still found myself inquiring in the words of beverly rodgers but what can she want him for the next time that i met mrs gregory st michael it was on my way to join the party at the old church which mrs weguelin was going to show them the cardcase was in her hand and the sight of it prompted me to allude to hortense rieppe i find her beauty growing upon me i declared mrs gregory did not deny the beauty although she spoke with reserve at first it is to be said that she knows how to write a suitable note the lady also admitted she didnt tell me what the note was about naturally but i could imagine with what joy in the exercise of her art hortense had constructed that communication which must have accompanied the prompt return of the cardcase then mrs gregorys tongue became downright since youre able to see so much of her why dont you tell her to marry that little steamyacht gambler im sure hes dying to and hes just the thing for her ah i returned love so seldom knows whats just the thing for marriage then your precocity theory falls declared mrs st michael and as she went away from me along the street i watched her beautiful stately walk for who could help watching a sight so good charley then was no secret to johns people was john still a secret to charley could hortense possibly have managed this i hoped for a chance to observe the two men with her during the visit of mrs weguelin st michael and her party to the church this party was already assembled when i arrived upon the spot appointed in the street a few paces from the church stood bohm and charley and kitty and gazza with beverly rodgers who as i came near left them and joined me oh shes somewhere off with her fireeater responded beverly to my immediate inquiry for hortense do you think she was asked old man probably not i thought but she goes so well with the rest i suggested beverly gave his chuckle she goes where she likes shell meet us here when were finished im pretty sure why such certainty well she has to attend to charley you know mrs weguelin it appeared had met the party here by the church but had now gone somewhere in the immediate neighborhood to find out why the gate was not opened to admit us and to hasten the unpunctual custodian of the keys i had not looked for precisely such a party as mrs weguelins invitation had gathered nor could i imagine that she had fully understood herself what she was gathering and this i intimated to beverly rodgers saying do you suppose my friend that she suspected the feather of the birds you flock with beverly took it lightly hang it old boy of course everybody cant be as nice as i am but he took it less lightly before it was over we stood chatting apart he and i while bohm and charley and kitty and gazza walked across the street to the window of a shop where old furniture was for sale at a high price and it grew clearer to me what beverly had innocently brought upon mrs weguelin and how he had brought it the little quiet particular lady had been pleased with his visit and pleased with him his good manners his good appearance his good englishtrained voice all these things must have been extremely to her taste and then more important than they did she not know about his people she had inquired he told me with interest about two of his uncles whom she had last seen in shes awfully the right sort said beverly yes i saw well how that visit must have gone the gentle old lady reviving in beverlys presence and for the sake of being civil to him some memories of her girlhood some meetings with those uncles some dances with them and generally shedding from her talk and manner the charm of some sweet old melody and beverly the facile the appreciative sitting there with her at a correct deferential angle on his chair admirably sympathetic and in good form and playing the old school he had no thought to deceive her the old school was his by right and genuinely in his blood he took to it like a duck to the water how should mrs weguelin divine that he also took to the nouveau jeu to the tune of bohm and charley and kitty and gazza and so to show him some attention and because she couldnt ask him to a meal why she would take him over the old church her colonial forefathers she would tell him the little legends about them he was precisely the young man to appreciate such things and she would be pleased if he would also bring the friends with whom he was travelling i looked across the street at bohm and charley and kitty and gazza they were now staring about them in all their perfection of stare small charley in a sleek slatecolored suit as neat as any little barber bohm massive portentous his strong shoes and gloves the chief note in his dress and about his whole firm frame a heavy mechanical strength a look as of something that did something rapidly and accurately when set going cut or cracked or ground or smashed something better and faster than it had ever been cut or cracked or ground or smashed before and would take your arms and legs off if you didnt stand well back from it it was only in bohms eye and lips that you saw he wasnt made entirely of brass and iron that champagne and shoulders decolletes received a punctual share of his valuable time and there was kitty too just the wife for bohm so soon as she could divorce her husband to whom she had united herself before discovering that all she married him for his old knickerbocker name was no longer in the slightest degree necessary for social acceptance while she could feed people her trough would be well thronged kitty was neat kitty was trig kitty was what beverly would call swagger her skilful tailormade clothes sheathed her closely and gave her the excellent appearance of a wellfolded english umbrella it was in her hat that she had gone wrong a beautiful hat in itself one which would have wholly become hortense but for poor kitty it didnt do at all yes she was a well folded english umbrella only the umbrella had for its handle the head of a bulldog or the leg of a balletdancer and these were the replacers whom beverlys clearsighted eyes saw swarming round the temple of his civilization pushing down the aisles climbing over the backs of the benches walking over each others bodies and seizing those front seats which his family had sat in since new york had been new york and so the wise fellow very prudently took every step that would insure the replacers inviting him to occupy one of his own chairs i had almost forgotten little gazza the italian nobleman who sold old furniture to new americans gazza was not looking at the old furniture of kings port which must have filled his vatican soul with contempt he was strolling back and forth in the street with his head in the air humming now loudly now softly lala lala e quando a la predica in chiesa siederia lalalala and i thought to myself that were i the pope i should kick him into the tiber when mrs weguelin st michael came back with the keys and their custodian bohm was listening to the slow clear words of charley in which he evidently found something that at length interested him a little bohm it seemed did not often speak himself possibly once a week his way was to let other people speak to him when there were signs in his face that he was hearing anything which they said it was a high compliment to them and of course charley could command bohms ear for charley although he was as neat as any barber and let hortense walk on him because he looked beyond that and purposed to get her was just as potent in the financial world as bohm could bring a borrowing empire to his own terms just as skillfully as could bohm was in short a man after bohms own i had almost said heart the expression is so obstinately embedded in our language bohm listening and charley talking had neither of them noticed mrs weguelins arrival they stood ignoring her while she waited casting a timid eye upon them but beverly suddenly perceiving this and begging her pardon for them brought the party together and we moved in among the old graves ah said gazza bending to read the quaint words cut upon one of them as we stopped while the door at the rear of the church was being opened french it was the mothertongue of these colonists mrs weguelin explained to him ah like canada cried gazza but what a pretty bit is that and he stood back to admire a little glimpse across a street between tiled roofs and rusty balconies of another church steeple almost one would say the old world gazza declared our world is not new said mrs weguelin and she passed into the church kings port holds many sacred nooks many corners many vistas that should deeply stir the spirit and the heart of all americans who know and love their country the passing traveller may gaze up at certain windows there and see history herself looking out at him even as she looks out of the windows of independence hall in philadelphia there are also other ancient buildings in kings port where history is shut up as in a strongbox such as that stubborn old octagon the powdermagazine of revolutionary times which is a chest holding proud memories of blood and war and then there are the three churches not strongboxes these but shrines where burn the venerable lamps of faith and of these three houses of god that one holds the most precious flame the purest light which treasures the holy fire that came from france the english colonists who sat in the other two congregations came to carolinas soil to better their estate but it was for liberty of soul to lift their ardent and exalted prayer to god as their own conscience bade them and not as any man dictated that those french colonists sought the new world no puritan splendor of independence and indomitable courage outshines theirs they preached a word as burning as any that plymouth or salem ever heard they were but a handful yet so fecund was their marvelous zeal that they became the spiritual leaven of their whole community they are less known than plymouth and salem because men of action rather than men of letters have sprung from the loins of the south but there they stand a beautiful beacon shining upon the coasts of our early history into their church then into the shrine where their small lamp still burns their devout descendant mrs weguelin st michael led our party because in her eyes kings port could show nothing more precious and significant there had been nothing to warn her that bohm and charley were americans who neither knew nor loved their country but merely americans who knew their countrys wealth and loved to acquire every penny of it that they could and so following the steps of our delicate and courteous guide we entered into the dimness of the little building and mrs weguelins voice lowered to suit the sanctity which the place had for her began to tell us very quietly and clearly the story of its early days i knew it or something of it from books but from this little ladys lips it took on a charm and graciousness which made it fresh to me i listened attentively until i felt without at first seeing the cause that dulling of enjoyment that interference with the receptive attention which comes at times to one during the performance of music when untimely people come in or go out next i knew that our group of listeners was less compact and then as we moved from the first point in the church to a new one i saw that bohm and charley were dropping behind and i lingered with the intention of bringing them closer but there was nothing in it i heard charleys slow monologue continuing behind me to the silent bohm we could have bought the parsons road at that time gentlemen i said to them what is there for us in tidewater at kings port it was not to be done and i rejoined mrs weguelin and those of the party who were making some show of attention to her quiet little histories and explanations and kittys was the next voice which i heard ring out oh you must never let it fall to pieces its the cunningest little fossil ive seen in the south so said charley behind me we let the other crowd buy their strategic point and i guess they know they got a gold brick i moved away from the financiers i endeavored not to hear their words and in this much i was successful but their inappropriate presence had got i suppose upon my nerves at any rate go where i would in the little church or attend as i might and did to what mrs weguelin st michael said about the tablets and whatever traditions their inscriptions suggested to her that quiet low persistent bankers voice of charleys pervaded the building like a draft of cold air once indeed he addressed mrs weguelin a question she was telling beverly who followed her throughout protectingly and charmingly with his most devoted attention and his best manner the honorable deeds of certain older generations of a family belonging to this congregation some of whose tombs outside had borne french inscriptions my mothers family said mrs weguelin and nowadays inquired beverly what do they find instead of military careers there are no more of us nowadays they they were killed in the war and immediately she smiled and with her hand she made a light gesture as if to dismiss this subject from mutual embarrassment and pain i might have known better murmured the understanding beverly but charley now had his question how many did you say how many mrs weguelin did not quite understand him were killed explained charley again there was a little pause before mrs weguelin answered my four brothers met their deaths charley was interested and what was the percentage of fatality in their regiments oh said mrs weguelin we did not think of it in that way and she turned aside charley said kitty with some precipitancy do make mr bohm look at the church and she turned after mrs weguelin it is such a gem but i saw the little lady try to speak and fail and then i noticed that she was leaning against a windowsill beverly rodgers also noticed this and he hastened to her thank you she returned to his hasty question i am quite well if you are not tired of it shall we go on it is such a gem repeated kitty throwing an angry glance at charley and bohm and so we went on yes kitty did her best to cover it up kitty as she would undoubtedly have said herself could see a few things but nobody could cover it up though beverly was now vigilant in his efforts to do so indeed replacers cannot be covered up by human agency they bulge they loom they stare they dominate the road of life even as their automobiles drive horses and pedestrians to the wall bohm roused from his financial torpor by kittys sharp command did actually turn his eyes upon the church which he had now been inside for some twenty minutes without noticing instinct and long training had given his eye when it really looked at anything a particular glance the glance of the replacer which plainly calculated can this be made worth money to me and which died instantly to a glaze of indifference on seeing that no money could be made bohms eye accordingly waked and then glazed manners courtesy he did not need not yet he had looked at them with his replacer glance and seeing no money in them had gone on looking at railroads and mines and mills and bare shoulders and bottles should manners and courtesy come some day to mean money to him then he could have them in his fashion so that his admirers and his apologists should alike declare of him a rough diamond but consider what he has made of himself after what did you say this was the voice of gazza addressing mrs weguelin st michael it must be said of gazza that he too made a certain presence of interest in the traditions of kings port after the revocation of the edict of nantes replied mrs weguelin built it in savannah charley was saying to bohm or norfolk this is a good place to bury people in but not money now the phosphate proposition again i dragged my attention by force away from that quiet relentless monologue and listened as well as i could to mrs weguelin there had come to be among us all i think beverly kitty gazza and myself a joint impulse to shield her to cluster about her to follow her steps from each little lecture that she finished to the new point where the next lecture began and we did it performed our pilgrimage to the end but there was less and less nature in our performance i knew and it was like a dream which i could not stop that we pressed a little too close that our questions were a little too eager that we overprinted our faces with attention knowing this did not help nothing helped and we went on to the end seeing ourselves doing it and it must have been that mrs weguelin saw us likewise but she was truly admirable in giving no sign she came out well ahead the lectures were not hurried one had no sense of points being skipped to accommodate our unworthiness it required a previous familiarity with the church to know as i did that there was indeed more and more skipping yet the little lady played her part so evenly and with never a falter of voice nor a change in the gentle courtesy of her manner that i do not think save for that moment at the windowsill i could have been sure what she thought or how much she noticed her face was always so pale it may well have been all imagination with me that she seemed when we emerged at last into the light of the street paler than usual but i am almost certain that her hand was trembling as she stood receiving the thanks of the party these thanks were cut a little short by the arrival of one of the automobiles and at the same time the appearance of hortense strolling toward us with john mayrant charley had resumed to bohm a tax of twentyfive cents on the ton is nothing with deposits of this richness when his voice ceased and looking at him to see the cause i perceived that his eye was on john and that his polished fingernail was running meditatively along his thin mustache hortense took the matter whatever the matter was in hand you havent much time she said to charles who consulted his watch whos coming to see me off he inquired wheres he going i asked beverly shes sending him north beverly answered and then he spoke with his very best simple manner to mrs weguelin st michael may i not walk home with you after all your kindness she was going to say no for she had had enough of this party but she looked at beverly and his face and his true solicitude won her she said thank you if you will and the two departed together down the shabby street the little veiled lady in black and beverly with his excellent london clothes and his still more excellent look of respectful sheltering attention and now bohm pronounced the only utterance that i heard fall from his lips during his stay in kings port he looked at the church he had come from he looked at the neighboring larger church whose columns stood out at the angle of the street he looked at the graveyard opposite that then at the stale dusty shop of old furniture and then up the shabby street where no life or movement was to be seen except the distant forms of beverly and mrs weguelin st michael then from a gold cigarcase curved to fit his breast pocket he took a cigar and lighted it from a gold matchbox offering none of us a cigar he placed the case again in his pocket and holding his lighted cigar a moment with two fingers in his strong glove he spoke this towns worse than sunday then he got into the automobile they all followed to see charley off and he addressed me i shall be glad he said if you will make one of a little party on the yacht next sunday when i come back and you also he added to john both john and i expressed our acceptance in suitable forms and the automobile took its way to the train your kings port streets i said as we walked back toward mrs trevises are not very favorable for automobiles no he returned briefly i dont remember that either of us found more to say until we had reached my front door when he asked will the day after tomorrow suit you for udolpho whenever you say i told him weather permitting of course but i hope that it will for after that i suppose my time will not be quite so free after we had parted it struck me that this was the first reference to his approaching marriage that john had ever made in my hearing since that day long ago it seemed long ago at least when he had come to the exchange to order the weddingcake and eliza la heu had fallen in love with him at sight that in my opinion looking back now with eyes at any rate partially opened was what eliza had done had john returned the compliment then or since xix udolpho it was to me continuously a matter of satisfaction and of interest to see hortense disturbed whether for causes real or imaginary about the security of her title to her lover john nor can i say that my misinterpreted bunch of roses diminished this satisfaction i should have been glad to know if the accomplished young woman had further probed that question and discovered the truth but it seemed scarce likely that she could do this without the help of one of three persons eliza and myself who knew all or john who knew nothing for the upcountry bride and whatever other people in kings port there were to whom the bride might gayly recite the tale of my roses were none of them likely to encounter miss rieppe their paths and hers would not meet until they met in church at the wedding of hortense and john no she could not have found out the truth for never in the world would she at this eleventh hour risk a conversation with john upon a subject so full of wellpacked explosives and so she must be simply keeping on both him and eliza an eye as watchful as lay in her power as for charley what bait what persuasion what duress she had been able to find that took him at an hour so critical from her side to new york i could not in the least conjecture had she said to the little banker go because i must think it over alone it did not seem strong enough or had she said go and on your return you shall have my answer not adequate either i thought or had it been if you dont go it shall be no today and forever this last was better but there was no telling nor did beverly rodgers to whom i propounded all my theories have any notion of what was between hortense and charley he only knew that charley was quite aware of the existence of john but had always been merely amused at the notion of him so have you been merely amused i reminded him not since that look i saw her give him old chap i know she wants him only not why she wants him and charley you know well of course poor charleys a banker just a banker and no more and a banker is merely the ace in the same pack where the drummer is the twospot our american civilization should be called drummers delight and theres nothing in your fireeater to delight a drummer hes a gentleman hell be only soso rich and hes away back out of the limelight while poor old charleys a bounder and worth forty millions anyhow and right in the centre of the glare how should he see any danger in john i wonder if he hasnt begun to well perhaps he and hortense have been talking business i know that oh and why do you think she said he must go to new york to make a better deal for the fireeaters phosphates than his fuddling old trustee here was going to close with charley said that could be arranged by telegram but she made him go himself shes extraordinary hell arrive in town tomorrow hell leave next day hell reach here by the southern on saturday night in time for our sunday yacht picnic and then something has got to happen i should think here was another key unlocking a further piece of knowledge for me i had not been able to guess why hortense should be keeping charley on but how natural was this policy when understood clearly she still needed charleys influence in the world of affairs charleys final service was to be the increasing of his successful rivals fortune i wondered what charley would do when the full extent of his usefulness dawned upon him and with wonder renewed i thought of general rieppe and this daughter he had managed to beget surely the mother of hortense whoever she may have been must have been a very richly endowed character something has most certainly got to happen and soon i said to beverly rodgers especially if my busy boardinghouse bodies are right in saying that the invitations for the wedding are to be out on monday well i had friday i had udolpho and there while on that excursion when i should be alone with john mayrant during many hours and especially the hours of deep confidential night i swore to myself on oath i would say to the boy the last word up to the verge of offense that my wits could devise apart from a certain dramatic excitement as of battle battle between hortense and me i truly wished to help him out of the miserable mistake his wrong standard his chivalry gone perverted was spurring him on to make and i had a comic image of myself summoning miss josephine summoning miss eliza summoning mrs gregory and mrs weguelin and the whole company of aunts and cousins and handing to them the rescued john with the single but sufficient syllable there he was in apparent spirits was john at that hour of our departure for udolpho he pretended so well that i was for a while altogether deceived he had wished to call for me with the conveyance in which he should drive us out into the lonely country through the sunny afternoon but instead i chose to walk round to where he lived and where i found him stuffing beneath the seats of the vehicle the baskets and the parcels which contained the provisions for our ample supper i have never seen you drink hearty yet and now i purpose to said john as the packing was finishing miss josephine st michael came by and the sight of the erect old lady reminded me that of all kings port figures known to me and seen in the garden paying their visit of ceremony to hortense she alone she and eliza la heu had been absent elizas declining to share in that was wellnigh inevitable but miss josephine was another matter perhaps she had considered her sisters going there to be enough at any rate she had not been party to the surrender and this gave me whimsical satisfaction moreover it had evidently occasioned no ruffle in the affectionate relations between herself and john john said she as you drive by do get me a plumber much better get a burglar aunt josephine cheaper in the end and neater work it was thus at the outset that i came to believe johns spirits were high and this illusion he successfully kept up until after we had left the plumber and kings port several sordid miles behind us the approach to kings port this way lies through dirtiest africa john was loquacious john discoursed upon the replacers mrs weguelin st michael had quite evidently expressed to her own circle what she thought of them and the town in consequence although it did not see them or their automobiles because it appeared they were gone some twenty miles inland upon an excursion to a resort where was a large hotel and a little variety in the way of some tourists of the replacer stripe the town kept them well in its minds eye the automobiles would have sufficed to bring them into disrepute but kings port had a better reason in their conduct in the church and john found many things to say to me as we drove along about bohm and charley and kitty gazza he forgot although as shall appear in its place gazza was likely to live a long while in his memory beverly rodgers he of course recognized as being a gentleman it was clear that beverly met with kings ports approval and from his newport experiences john was able to make out quite as well as if he had heard beverly explain it himself the whole wise philosophic system of joining with the replacers in order that you be not replaced yourself in his shoes mightnt i do the same he surmised i fear im not as spartan as my aunts only pray dont mention it to them and then because i had been answering him with single syllables or with nods or not at all he taxed me with my taciturnity he even went so far as to ask me what thoughts kept me so silent which i did not tell him i am wondering i told him instead how much they steal every week those financiers yes bohm is president of an insurance company and charleys a director and reorganizes railroads well if other people share your pleasant opinion of them how do they get elected other people share their pleasant spoils senators vestrymen you cant be sure who youre sitting next to at dinner any more come live north youll find the only safe way is never to know anybody worth more than five millions if you wish to keep the criminal classes off your visiting list this made him merry put em in jail then ah the jail i returned its the great american joke it reverses the rule of our smart society only those who have no incomes are admitted but what do you have laws and lawyers for to keep the rich out of jail its called professional etiquette your picture flatters you flatter me its only a photograph come north and see one might think from your account the american had rather be bad than good o dear no the american had much rather be good than bad your admission amazes me but also the american had rather be rich than good and he is having his wish and moneys golden hand is tightening on the throat of liberty while the labor union stabs liberty in the back for trusts and unions are both trying to kill liberty and the soul of uncle sam has turned into a dollarinside his great big strong triumphant flesh so that even his new religion his own special invention his last offering to the creeds of the world his gatherer of converted hordes his christian science is based upon physical benefit john touched the horses youre particularly cheerful today no i merely summarize what im seeing well a moral awakening will come he declared inevitably tomorrow perhaps the flesh has had a good long prosperous day and the hour of the spirit must be near striking and the moral awakening will be followed by a moral slumber since in the uncomprehended scheme of things slumber seems necessary and you neednt pull so long a face mr mayrant because the slumber will be followed by another moral awakening the alcoholic society girl you dont like will very probably give birth to a waterdrinking daughter who in her turn may produce a bibulous progeny how often must i tell you that nothing is final john mayrant gave the horses a somewhat vicious lash after these last words of mine and as he made no retort to them we journeyed some little distance in silence through the mild enchanting light of the sun my deliberate allusion to alcoholic girls had made plain what i had begun to suspect i could now discern that his cloak of gayety had fallen from him leaving bare the same harassed spirit the same restless mood which had been his upon the last occasion when we had talked at length together upon some of the present social and political phases of our republic that day of the new bridge and the advent of hortense only upon that day he had by his manner in some subtle fashion conveyed to me a greater security in my discretion than i felt him now to entertain his many observations about the replacers with always the significant and conspicuous omission of hortense proved more and more as i thought it over that his state was unsteady even now he did not long endure silence between us yet the eagerness which he threw into our discussions did not it seemed to me so much proceed from present interest in their subjects though interest there was at times as from anxiety lest one particular subject ever present with him should creep in unawares so much i at any rate concluded and bided my time for the creeping in unawares content meanwhile to parry some of the reproaches which he now and again cast at me with an earnestness real or feigned we had made now considerable progress and were come to a space of sand and cabins and intersecting railroad tracks where freight cars and locomotives stood and negroes of all shapes but of one lowering and ragged appearance lounged and stared there used to be a murder here about once a day said john before the dispensary system now it is about once a week that law is of benefit then i inquired to those who drink the whiskey possibly certainly to those who sell it and he condensed for me the long story of the state dispensary which in brief appeared to be that south carolina had gone into the liquor business the profits were to pay for compulsory education the liquor was to be pure society and sobriety were to be advanced such had been the threefold promise of which the threefold fulfillment was defeat of the compulsory education bill a political monopoly enriching favored distillers and lately said john a thoroughly democratic whiskey for the plain people pay ten cents for a bottle of x if youre curious it may not poison you but the murders are coming up again what a delightful example of government ownership i exclaimed but john in kings port was not in the way of hearing that cureall policy discussed and i therefore explained it to him he did not seem to grasp my explanation i dont see how it would change anything he remarked beyond switching the stealing from one set of hands to another i put on a face of concern what you dont believe in our patent american shortcuts shortcuts certainly shortcuts to universal happiness universal honesty universal everything for instance dont make a boy study four years for a college degree just cut the time in half and youve got a shortcut to education write it down that man is equal that settles it youll notice how equal he is at once write it down that the negro shall vote youll observe how instantly he is fit for the suffrage now they want it written down that government shall take all the wicked corporations because then corruption will disappear from the face of the earth youll find the farmers presently having it written down that all hens must hatch their eggs in a week and next a league of earnest women will advocate a constitutional amendment that men only shall bring forth children oh we americans are very thorough and i laughed but johns face was not gay well he mused south carolina took a shortcut to pure liquor and sober citizens and reached instead a new den of thieves is the whole country sick sick to the marrow my friend but young and vigorous still a nation in its long life has many illnesses before the one it dies of but we shall need some strong medicine if we do not get well soon what kind ah thats beyond any one and we have several things the matter with us as bad a case for example of complacency as ive met in history complacencys a very dangerous disease seldom got rid of without the purge of a great calamity and worse where does our dishonesty begin and where end the boy goes to college and there in football it awaits him he graduates and in the downtown office it smirks at him he rises into the confidence of his superiors the towns chief citizens and finds their gray hairs crowned with it the very men he has looked up to believed in his ideals his examples the merchant prince the railroad magnate the president of insurance companies all dirty rascals presently he faces worldly success or failure and then in the new ocean of mind that has swallowed morals up he sinks with his isolated honesty like a fool or swims to respectability with his brother knaves and into this mess the immigrant sewage of europe is steadily pouring such is our continent today with all its fair winds and tides and fields favorable to us and only our shallow complacent dishonest selves against us but dont let these considerations make you gloomy for i must say it again nothing is final and even if we rot before we ripen which would be a wholly novel phenomenon we shall have made our contribution to mankind in demonstrating by our collapse that the sows ear belongs with the rest of the animal and not in the voting booth or the legislature and that the doctrine of universal suffrage should have waited until men were born honest and equal that in itself would be a memorable service to have rendered we had come into the divine sad stillness of the woods where the warm sunlight shone through the gray moss lighting the curtained solitudes away and away into the depths of the golden afternoon and somewhere amid the miles of sleeping wilderness sounded the hoarse honk of the automobile the replacers were abroad enjoying what they could in this country where they did not belong and which did not as yet belong to them once again we heard their honk off to our left from a farther distance and i am glad to say that we did not see them at all if said john mayrant what you have said is true the nation had better get on its knees and pray god to give it grace i looked at the boy and saw that his countenance had grown very fine the act i said would bring grace wherever it comes from yes he assented if in the stars and awfulness of space theres nothing that does not trouble me for my greater self is inside me safe and our country has a greater self somewhere think i do not have to think i replied when i know the nobleness we have risen to at times and i he pursued happen to believe it is not all only stars and space and that god as much as any shipbuilder rejoices to watch every tiniest boat meet and brave the storm out of his troubles he had brought such mood sweetness instead of bitterness he was saying as plainly as if his actual words said it misfortune has come to me and i am going to make the best of it his nobleness his moral elegance compelled him to this and i envied him not sure if i myself thus placed would acquit myself so well and there was in his sweetness a contagion that strangely reconciled me to the troubled aspects of our national hour i thought invisible among our eighty millions there is a quiet legion living untainted in the depths while the yellow rich the prismatic scum and bubbles boil on the surface yes he had accidentally helped me and i wished doubly that i might help him it was well enough he should feel he must not shirk his duty but how much better if he could be led to see that marrying where he did not love was no duty of his i knew what i had to say to him but lacked the beginning of it and of this beginning i was in search as we drove up among the liveoaks of udolpho to the little clubhouse or hunting lodge where a negro and his wife received us and took the baskets and set about preparing supper my beginning sat so heavily upon my attention that i took scant notice of udolpho as we walked about its adjacent grounds in the twilight before supper and john mayrant pointed out to me its fine old trees its placid stream and bade me admire the snug character of the hunting lodge buried away for bachelors delights deep in the heart of the pleasant forest i heard him indulging in memories and anecdotes of date sittings after long hunts but i was myself always on a hunt for my beginning and none of his words clearly reached my intelligence until i was aware of his reciting an excellently pertinent couplet if you would hold your fathers land you must wash your throat before your hand and found myself standing by the lodge table upon which he had set two glasses containing i soon ascertained gin vermouth orange bitters and a cherry at the bottom all which he had very skillfully mingled himself in the happiest proportions the poetry he remarked is hereditary in my family and setting down the empty glasses we also washed our hands a moon halfgrown looked in at the window from the filmy darkness and john catching sight of it paused with the wet soap in his hand and stared out at the dimly visible trees oh the times the times he murmured to himself gazing long and then with a sort of start he returned to the present moment and rinsed and dried his hands presently we were sitting at the table pledging each other in wellcooled champagne and it was not long after this that not only the negro who waited on us was plainly reveling in johns remarks but also the cook with her bandannaed ebony head poked round the corner of the kitchen door was doing her utmost to lose no word of this entertainment for john taking up the young and the old the quick and the dead of masculine kings port proceeded to narrate their private exploits until by coffeetime he had unrolled for me the richest tapestry of gayeties that i remember and i sat without breath tearful and aching while the two negroes had retired far into the kitchen to muffle their emotions tom oh tom you tom called john mayrant and after the man had come from the kitchen you may put the punchbowl and things on the table and clear away and go to bed my greatuncle marston chartain he continued to me was of eccentric taste and for the last twenty years of his life never had anybody to dinner but the undertaker he paused at this point to mix the punch and then resumed but for all that he appears to have been a lively old gentleman to the end and left us his version of a saying which is considered by some people an improvement on the original cherchez la femme uncle marston had it hunt the other woman dont go too fast with that punch it isnt as gentle as it seems but john and his uncle marston had between them given me my beginning and as i sat sipping my punch i ceased to hear the anecdotes which followed i sat sipping and smoking and was presently aware of the deepening silence of the night and of john no longer at the table but by the window looking out into the forest and muttering once more oh the times the times its always a triangle i began he turned round from his window triangle he looked at my glass of punch and then at me go easy with the bombo he repeated bombo i echoed you call this bombo you dont know how remarkable that is but thats because you dont know aunt carola who is very remarkable too well never mind her now point is its always a triangle i havent a doubt of it he replied there youre right and so was your uncle he knew triangle here i found myself nodding portentously at john and beating the table with my finger very solemnly he stood by his window seeming to wait for me and now everything in the universe grew perfectly clear to me i rose on mastering tides of thought and all problems lay disposed of at my feet while delicious strength and calm floated in my brain and being nothing was difficult for me but i was getting away from the triangle and there was john waiting at the window and i mustnt say too much mustnt say too much my will reached out and caught the triangle and brought it close and i saw it all perfectly clear again what are they all i said the old romances you take paris and helen and menelaus whats that you take launcelot and arthur and guinevere you take paola and francesca and her husband whatshisname or tristram and iseult and mark two men one woman triangle and trouble other way around you get tannhauser and venus and elizabeth two women one man more triangle and more trouble yes and i nodded at him again the tide of my thought was pulling me hard away from this to other important worldproblems but my will held struggling and i kept to it you wait i told him i know what i mean trouble is so hard to advise him right advise who right inquired john mayrant it helped me wonderfully my will gripped my floating thoughts and held them to it friend of mine in trouble though why he asks me when im not married id be married now you know but afraid of only one wife man doesnt love twice loves thrice four six lots of times but they say only one wife ought to be two anyhow much easier for man to marry then wouldnt it be rather immoral john asked morality is queer thing like kaleidoscope new patterns all the time abraham and wives perfectly respectable you take pharaohs or kings of that sort married own sisters all right then perfectly horrible now of course but you ask men about two wives theyd say something to be said for that idea only there are the women you know theyd never but im going to tell my friend hes doing wrong going to write him tonight wheres ink it wont go tonight said john what are you going to tell him going to tell him since only one wife wicked not to break his engagement john looked at me very hard as he stood by the window leaning on the sill but my will was getting all the while a stronger hold and my thoughts were less and less inclined to stray to other worldproblems moreover below the confusion that still a little reigned in them was the primal cunning of the old adam the native man quite untroubled and alert it saw johns look at me and it prompted my course yes i said he wants the truth from me wheres his letter no harm reading you without names and i fumbled in my pocket letter gone never mind facts are friends asked girl girls said yes now he thinks hes bound by that he thinks right said john not a bit of it you take tannhauser engagement to venus all a mistake perfectly proper to break it much more than proper only honorable thing he could do im going to write it to him wheres ink and i got up john came from his window and sat down at the table his glass was empty his cigar gone out and he looked at me but i looked round the room for the ink noting in my search the big fireplace simple wooden unornamented but generous and the plain plaster walls of the lodge whereon hung two or three old prints of gamebirds and all the while i saw john out of the corner of my eye looking at me he spoke first your friend has given his word to a lady he must stand by it like a gentleman lot of difference i returned still looking round the room between spirit and letter if his heart has broken the word his lips cant make him a gentleman john brought his fist down on the table he had no business to get engaged to her he must take the consequences that blow of the fist on the table brought my thoughts wholly clear and fixed on the one subject my will had no longer to struggle with them they worked of themselves in just the way that i wanted them to do if hes a gentleman he must stand to his word john repeated unless she releases him i fumbled again for my letter thats just about what he says himself i rejoined sitting down he thinks he ought to take the consequences of course john mayrants face was very stern as he sat in judgment on himself but why should she take the consequences i asked what consequences being married to a man who doesnt want her all her life until death them do part hows that having the daily humiliation of his indifference and the worlds knowledge of his indifference hows that perhaps having the further humiliation of knowing that his heart belongs to another woman hows that thats not what a girl bargains for his standing to his word is not an act of honor but a deception and in talking about taking the consequences hes patting his personal sacrifice on the back and forgetting all about her and the sacrifice hes putting her to whats the brief suffering of a broken engagement to that no the true consequences that a man should shoulder for making such a mistake is the poor opinion that society holds of him for placing a woman in such a position and to free her is the most honorable thing he can do her dignity suffers less so than if she were a wife chained down to perpetual disregard john after a silence said that is a very curious view that is the view i shall give my friend i answered i shall tell him that in keeping on he is not at bottom honestly thinking of the girl and her welfare but of himself and the public opinion hes afraid of if he breaks his engagement and i shall tell him that if im in church and they come to the place where they ask if any man knows just cause or impediment i shall probably call out he does his hearts not in it this is not marriage that hes committing youre pronouncing your blessing upon a fraud john sat now a long time silent holding his extinct cigar the lamp was almost burned dry we had blown out the expiring candles some while since that is a very curious view he repeated i should like to hear what your friend says in answer this finished our late sitting we opened the door and went out for a brief space into the night to get its pure breath into our lungs and look to the distant place where the moon had sailed then we went to bed or rather i did for the last thing that i remembered was john standing by the window of our bedroom still dressed looking out into the forest xx what she wanted him for he was neither at the window nor in his bed nor anywhere else to be seen when i opened my eyes upon the world next morning nor did any answer come when i called his name i raised myself and saw outside the great branches of the wood bathed from top to trunk in a sunshine that was no early mornings light and upon this the silence of the house spoke plainly to me not of man still sleeping but of man long risen and gone about his business i stepped barefoot across the wooden floor to where lay my watch but it marked an unearthly hour for i had neglected to wind it at the end of our long and convivial evening of which my head was now giving me some news and then i saw a note addressed to me from john mayrant you are a good sleeper it began but my conscience is clear as to the bombo called by some killdevil about which i hope you will remember that i warned you he hoped i should remember of course i remembered everything why did he say that an apology for his leaving me followed he had been obliged to take the early train because of the custom house where he was serving his final days they would give me breakfast when ever i should be ready for it and i was to make free of the place i had better visit the old church they had orders about the keys and drive myself into kings port after lunch the horses would know the way if i did not it was the boys closing sentence which fixed my attention wholly took it away from killdevil bombo and my aunt carolas commission for the execution of which i now held the clue and sent me puzzling for the right interpretation of his words i believe that you will help your friend by that advice which startled me last night but which i now begin to see more in than i did only between alternate injuries he may find it harder to choose which is the least he can inflict than you who look on find it for in following your argument he benefits himself so plainly that the benefit to the other person is very likely obscured to him but if you wish to tell him a southern gentleman would feel he ought to be shot either way thats the honorable price for changing your mind in such a case no interpretation of this came to me i planned and carried out my day according to his suggestion a slow dressing with much cold water a slow breakfast with much good hot coffee a slow wandering beneath the dreamy branches of udolpho this course cleared my head of the bombo and brought back to me our whole evening and every word i had said to john except that i had lost the solution which last night the triangle had held for me at that moment the triangle and my whole dealing with the subject of monogamy had seemed to contain the simplicity of genius but it had all gone now and i couldnt get it back only what i had contrived to say to john about his own predicament had been certainly well said i would say that over again today it was the boy and the meaning of his words which escaped me still baffled me and formed the whole subject of my attention even when i was inside the tern creek church so that i retain nothing of that save a general quaintness a general loneliness a little deserted forgotten token of human doings long since done standing on its little acre of wilderness amid that solitude which suggests the departed presence of man and which is so much more potent in the flavor of its desolation than the virgin wilderness whose solitude is still waiting for man to come it made no matter whether john had believed in the friend to whom i intended writing advice or had seen through and accepted in good part my manoeuvre he had considered my words that was the point and he had not slept in his bed but on it if sleep had come to him at all this i found out while dressing several times i read his note over between alternate injuries he may find it harder to choose this was not an answer to me but an explanation of his own perplexity at times it sounded almost like an appeal as if he were saying do not blame me for not being convinced and if it was such appeal why then taken with his resolve to do right at any cost and his night of inward contention it was poignant i believe that you will help your friend those words sounded better but tell him a southern gentleman ought to be shot either way what was the meaning of this a chill import rose from it into my thoughts but that i dismissed to die on account of hortense such a thing was not to be conceived and yet given a highstrung nature not only trapped by its own standards but also wrought upon during many days by increasing exasperation and unhappiness while helpless in the trap and with no other outlook but the trap the chill import returned to me more than once and was reasoned away as with no attention to my surroundings i took a pair of oars and got into a boat belonging to the lodge and rowed myself slowly among the sluggish windings of tern creek whence come those thoughts that we ourselves feel shame at it shamed me now as i pulled my boat along that i should have thoughts of john which needed banishing what tale would this be to remember of a boys life that he gave it to buy freedom from a pledge which need never have been binding what pearl was this to cast before the sophisticated hortense such act would be robbed of its sadness by its absurdity yet surely the bitterest tragedies are those of which the central anguish is lost amid the dust of surrounding paltriness if such a thing should happen here no one but myself would have seen the lonely figure of john mayrant standing by the window and looking out into the dark quiet of the wood his name would be passed down for a little while as the name of a fool and then he would be forgotten i believe that you will help your friend yes he had certainly written that and it now came to me that i might have said to him one thing more had he given hortense the chance to know what his feelings to her had become but he would merely have answered that here it was the duty of a gentleman to lie or had he possibly at newport ever become her lover too much for any escaping now had his dead passion once put his honor in a pawn which only marriage could redeem this might fit all that had come so far and still with such a two as they i should forever hold the boy the womans victim but this did not fit what came after perhaps it was the late sitting of the night before and the hushed and strange solitude of my surroundings now that had laid my mind open to all these thoughts which my reason in dealing with answered continually one by one yet which returned requiring to be answered again for there are times when our uncomfortable eyes see through the appearances we have arranged for daily life into the actualities which lie forever behind them going about thus in my boat i rowed sleepiness into myself and pushed into a nook where shade from some thick growth hid the boat and me from the sun and there almost enmeshed in the deep lattice of green i placed my coat beneath my head and prone in the boats bottom i drifted into slumber once or twice my oblivion was pierced by the roaming honk of the automobile but with no more than the halfmelted consciousness that the replacers were somewhere in the wood oblivion closed over me again and when it altogether left me it was because of voices near me on the water or on the bank their calls and laughter pushed themselves into my drowsiness and soon after i grew aware that the replacers were come here to see what was to be seen at udolpho the club the old church a country place with a fine avenue and that it was the church they now couldnt get into because my visit had disturbed the usual whereabouts of the key of which gazza was now going in search i could have told him where to find it but it pleased me not to disturb myself for this as i listened to him assuring kitty that it was probably in the cabin beyond the bridge but not to be alarmed if he did not immediately return with it kitty not without audible mirth assured him that they should not be alarmed at all to which the voice of hortense supplemented not at all they were evidently in a boat which hortense herself was rowing and which she seemed to bring to the bank where i gathered that kitty got out and sat while hortense remained in the boat there was the little talk and movement which goes with borrowing of a cigarette a little exclamation about not falling out accompanied by the rattle of a displaced oar and then stillness and the smell of tobacco smoke presently kitty spoke charley will be back tonight to this i heard no reply what did his telegram say kitty inquired after another silence its all right this was hortense her slow rich murmur was as deliberate as always mr bohm knew it would be said kitty he said it wouldnt take five minutes talk from charley to get a contract worth double what they were going to accept after this nothing came to me for several minutes save the odor of the cigarettes of course there was now but one proper course for me namely to utter a discreet cough and thus warn them that some one was within earshot but i didnt i couldnt strength failed curiosity won my baser nature triumphed here and i deliberately remained lying quiet and hidden it was the act of no gentleman you will say well it was and i must simply confess to it hoping that i am not the only gentleman in the world who has on occasion fallen beneath himself hortense rieppe began kitty what do you intend to say to my brother after what he has done about those phosphates he is always so kind murmured hortense well you know what it means means if you persist in this folly youll drop out hortense chose another line of speculation i wonder why your brother is so sure of me charley is a set man and ive never seen him so set on anything as on you hortense rieppe he is always so kind murmured hortense again hes a man youll always know just where to find declared kitty charley is safe hell never take you by surprise never fly out never do what other people dont do never make any one stare at him by the way he looks or the way he acts or anything he says or or why how you can hesitate between those two men after that ridiculous childish conspicuous unusual scene on the bridge unusual yes said hortense kittys eloquence and voice mounted together i should think it was unusual tearing peoples money up and making a rude awkward fuss that everybody had to smooth over as hard as they could why even mr rodgers says that sort of thing isnt done and youre always saying he knows no said hortense it isnt done well ive never seen anything approaching such behavior in our set and he was ready to go further nobody knows where it might have gone to if charleys perfect coolness hadnt rebuked him and brought him to his senses theres where it is thats what i mean hortense by saying you could always feel safe with charley hortense put in a languid word i think i should always feel safe with mr mayrant but kitty was a simple soul indeed you couldnt hortense i assure you that youre mistaken theres where you get so wrong about men sometimes i have been studying that boy for your sake ever since we got here and i know him through and through and i tell you you cannot count upon him he has not been used to our ways and i see no promise of his getting used to them he will stay capable of outbreaks like that horrid one on the bridge wherever you take him wherever you put him no matter how much you show him of us and the way we dont allow conspicuous things like that to occur believe me hortense hell never learn hell never smooth down you may brush his hair flat and keep him appearing like other people for a while but a time will come something will happen and that boyll be conspicuous charley would never be conspicuous no assented hortense kitty urged her point why i never saw or beard of anything like that on the bridge that is among among us no assented hortense again and her voice dropped lower with each statement one always sees the same thing always hears the same thing always the same thing these last almost inaudible words sank away into the silent pool of hortenses meditation have another cigarette said kitty youve let yours fall into the water i heard them moving a little and then they must have resumed their seats youll drop out of it kitty now pursued into what shall i drop just being asked to the big things everybody goes to and nobody counts for even with the way charley has arranged about the phosphates it will not be enough to keep you in our swim just by itself hell weigh more than his money because hell stay different too different he was not so different last summer because he was not there long enough my dear he learned bridge quickly and of course he had seen champagne before and nobody had time to notice him but hell be married now and they will notice him and they wont want him to think of your dropping out kitty became very earnest to think of not seeing you among us youll be in none of the small things youll never be asked to stay at the smart houses why not even your name will be in the paper not a foreigner you entertain not a dinner you give not a thing you wear will ever be described next morning and charleys so set on you and youre so just exactly made for each other and it would all be so splendid and cosey and jolly and to throw all this away for that crude boy kittys disdain was high at the thought of john hortense took a little time over it once she then stated he told me he could drown in my hair as joyfully as the duke of clarence did in his butt of malmsey wine kitty gave a little scream did you let him one has to guard ones value at times kittys disdain for john increased how crude hortense did not make any answer how crude kitty after some silence repeated she seemed to have found the right word steps sounded upon the bridge and the voice of gazza cried out that the stupid key was at the imbecile clubhouse whither he was now going for it and not to be alarmed their voices answered reassuringly and gazza was heard growing distant singing some little song kitty was apparently unable to get away from johns crudity he actually said that yes where was it tell me about it hortense we were walking in the country on that occasion kitty still lingered with it did he look ive never had any man i wonder if how did you feel not disagreeably and hortense permitted herself to laugh musically kittys voice at once returned to the censorious tone well i call such language as that very very hortense helped her operatic he could never be taught in those ways either declared kitty you would find his ardor always untrained provincial once more hortense abstained from making any answer kitty grew superior well if thats to your taste hortense rieppe it was none of it like charley murmured hortense i should think not charleys not crude what do you see in that man i like the way his hair curls above his ears for this kitty found nothing but an impatient exclamation and now the voice of hortense sank still deeper in dreaminess down to where the truth lay and from those depths came the truth flashing upward through the drowsy words she spoke i think i want him for his innocence what light these words may have brought to kitty i had no chance to learn for the voice of gazza returning with the key put an end to this conversation but i doubted if kitty had it in her to fathom the nature of hortense kitty was like a trim little clock that could tick tidily on an ornate shelf she could go she could keep up with time with the rapid epoch to which she belonged but she didnt really have many works i think she would have scoffed at that last languorous speech as a piece of hortenses nonsense and that is why hortense uttered it aloud she was safe from being understood but in my ears it sounded the note of revelation the simple central secret of hortenses fire a flame fed overmuch with experience with sophistication grown cold under the ministrations of adroitness and lighted now by the crudity of johns lovemaking and when after an interval i had rowed my boat back and got into the carriage and started on my long drive from udolpho to kings port i found that there was almost nothing about all this which i did not know now hortense like most riddles when you are told the answer was clear i think i want him for his innocence yes she was tired of lovemaking whose down had been rubbed off she hungered for lovemaking with the down still on even if she must pay for it with marriage who shall say if her enlightened and modern eye could not look beyond such marriage when it should grow monotonous to divorce xxi hortenses cigarette goes out john was the riddle that i could not read among my last actions of this day was one that had been almost my earliest and bedtime found me staring at his letter as i stood half undressed by my table the calm moon brought back udolpho and what had been said there as it now shone down upon the garden where hortense had danced i stared at johns letter as if its words were new to me instead of being words that i could have fluently repeated from beginning to end without an error it was as if by virtue of mere gazing at the document i hoped to wring more meaning from it to divine what had been in the mind which had composed it but instead of this i seemed to get less from it instead of more had the boys purpose been to mystify me he could scarce have done better i think that he had no such intention for it would have been wholly unlike him but i saw no sign in it that i had really helped him had really shaken his old quixotic resolve nor did i see any of his having found a new way of his own out of the trap i could not believe that the dark road of escape had taken any lodgement in his thought but had only passed over it like a cloud with a heavy shadow but these are surmises at the best if john had formed any plan i can never know it and junos remarks at breakfast on sunday morning sounded strange like something a thousand miles away for she spoke of the wedding and of the fact that it would certainly be a small one she went over the names of the people who would have to be invited and doubted if she were one of these but if she should be then she would go for the sake of miss josephine st michael she declared in short it was perfectly plain that juno was much afraid of being left out and that wild horses could not drag her away from it if an invitation came to her but as i say this side of the wedding seemed to have nothing to do with it when i thought of all that lay beneath my one interest today was to see john mayrant to get from him if not by some word then by some look or intonation a knowledge of what he meant to do therefore disappointment and some anxiety met me when i stepped from the hermanas gangway upon her deck and charley asked me if he was coming but the launch sent back to wait finally brought john apologizing for his lateness meanwhile i was pleased to find among the otherwise complete party general rieppe what i had seen of him from a distance held promise and the heros nearer self fulfilled it we fell to each others lot for the most natural of reasons nobody else desired the company of either of us charley was making himself the devoted servant of hortense while kitty drew beverly bohm and gazza in her sprightly wake to her indeed i made a few compliments during the first few minutes after my coming aboard while every sort of drink and cigar was being circulated among us by the cabin boy kittys costume was the most markedly maritime thing that i have ever beheld in any waters and her white shoes looked i must confess supremely well on her pretty little feet i am no advocate of sumptuary laws but there should be one prohibiting bigfooted women from wearing white shoes did these women know what a spatulated effect their feet so shod produce no law would be needed yes kitty was superlatively stridently maritime you could have known from a great distance that she belonged to the very latest steam yacht class and that she was perfectly ignorant of the whole subject on her left arm for instance was worked a red propeller with one blade down and two chevrons it was the rating mark for a chief engineer but this had she known it would not have disturbed her i chose it she told me in reply to my admiration of it because its so pretty oh wont we enjoy ourselves while those stupid old bluebloods in kings port are going to church and with this she gave a skip and ordered the cabin boy to bring her a remsen cooler beverly rodgers called for dwarfs blood and i chose a horses neck and soon found myself in the society of the general he was sipping whiskey and plain water i am a rough soldiers sir he explained to me and i keep to the simple beverage of the camp had we not rather bear those ills we have than fly to others that we know not of and he waved a stately hand at my horses neck you are acquainted with the works of shakespeare i replied that i had a moderate knowledge of them and assured him that a horses neck was very simple doubtless sir but a veteran is ever oldfashioned papa said hortense dont let the sun shine upon your head thank you daughter mine they said no more but i presently felt that for some reason she watched him he moved farther beneath the awning and i followed him are you a father sir no then you cannot appreciate what it is to confide such a jewel as yon girl to anothers keeping he summoned the cabin boy who brought him some more of the simple beverage of the camp and i feeling myself scarce at liberty to speak on matters so near to him and so far from me as his daughters marriage called his attention to the beautiful aspect of kings port spread out before us in a long white line against the blue water the general immediately seized his opportunity sweet auburn loveliest village of the plain you are acquainted with the works of goldsmith sir i professed some knowledge of this author also and the generals talk flowed ornately onward though i had little to say to him about his daughters marriage he had much to say to me miss josephine st michael would have been gratified to hear that her family was considered suitable for hortense to contract an alliance with my girl is not stepping down sir the father assured me and he commended the st michaels and the whole connection he next alluded tragically but vaguely to misfortunes which had totally deprived him of income i could not precisely fix what his inheritance had been sometimes he spoke of cotton but next it would be rice and he touched upon sugar more than once but whatever it was it had been vast and was gone he told me that i could not imagine the feelings of a father who possessed a jewel and no dowry to give her a queens estate should have been hers he said but what who steals my purse steals trash and he sat up nobly braced by the philosophic thought but he soon was shaking his head over his enfeebled health was i aware that he had been the cause of postponing the young peoples joy twice twice had the doctors forbidden him to risk the emotions that would attend his giving his jewel away he dwelt upon his shattered system to me and indeed it required some dwelling on for he was the picture of admirable preservation but i know what it is myself he declared to be a lover and have bliss delayed they shall be united now a soldier must face all arrows what i had hoped he might quote something here but was disappointed his conversation would soon cease to interest me should i lose the excitement of watching for the next classic and my eye wandered from the general to the water where happily i saw john mayrant coming in the launch i briskly called the generals attention to him and was delighted with the unexpected result oh young lochinvar has come out of the west said the general lifting his glass i touched it ceremoniously with mine the day will be hot i said the boy stood on the burning deck on this i made my escape from him and leaving him to his whiskey and his contemplating i became aware that the eyes of the rest of the party were eager to watch the greeting between hortense and john but there was nothing to see hortense waited until her lover had made his apologies to charley for being late and from the way they met she might have been no more to him than kitty was whatever might be thought whatever might be known by these onlookers hortense set the pace of how the open secret was to be taken she made it for all of us as smooth and smiling as the waters of kings port were this fine day how much did they each know i asked myself how much they had shared in common to these replacers kings port had opened no doors they and their automobile had skirted around the outside of all things and if charley knew about the wedding he also knew that it had been already twice postponed he too could have said as miss eliza had once said to me the cake is not baked yet the generals talk to me i felt as i took in how his health had been the centred point was probably the result of previous arrangements with hortense herself and she quite as certainly inspired whatever she allowed him to say to charley as for kitty she knew that her brother was set she always came back to that if hortense found this sunday morning a passage of particularly delicate steering she showed it in no way unless by that heightened radiance and triumph of beauty which i had seen in her before no the splendor of the day the luxuries of the hermana the conviviality of the replacers all melted the occasion down to an ease and enjoyment in which even john mayrant with his grave face was not perceptible unless like myself one watched him it was my full expectation that we should now get under way and proceed among the various historic sights of kings port harbor but of this i saw no signs anywhere on board the hermana abeam of the foremast her boat booms remained rigged out on port and starboard her boats riding to painters while her crew wore a look as generally lounging as that of her passengers beverly rodgers told me the reason we had no pilot the negro waterman engaged for this excursion in the upper waters had failed of appearance and when charley was for looking up another kitty bohm and gazza had dissuaded him kitty said beverly told me she didnt care about the musty old forts and things anyhow i looked at kitty and heard her tongue ticking away like the little clock she was she had her bohm she had her nautical costume and her remsen cooler these with the lunch that would come in time were enough for her but it was such a good chance i exclaimed in disappointment chance for what old man to see everything the forts the islands and its beautiful you know all the way to the navy yard beverly followed my glance to where the gay company was sitting among the cracked ice and bottles and cigar boxes chattering volubly with its back to the scenery he gave his laisserfaire chuckle and laid a hand on my shoulder dont worry em with forts and islands old boy they know what they want no living breed on earth knows better what it wants well they dont get it ho dont they the cold fear of ennui gnaws at their vitals this minute shrill laughter from kitty and gazza served to refute my theory of course very few know whats the matter with them i added you seldom spot an organic disease at the start hm said beverly lengthily you put a pin through some of em hortense hasnt got the disease though ah she spotted it shes taking treatment its likely to help her for a time he looked at me you know something i nodded he looked at hortense who was now seated among the noisy group with quiet john beside her she was talking to bohm she had no air of any special relation to john but there was a lustre about her that spoke well for the treatment then its coming off said beverly she has been too much for him i answered beverly misunderstood he doesnt look it thats what i mean but the fool can cut loose oh you and i have gone over all that ive even gone over it with him beverly looked at hortense again and her fireeaters fortune is about double what it would have been i dont see how shes going to square herself with charley shell wait till thats necessary it isnt necessary today we had to drop our subject here for the owner of the hermana approached us with the amiable purpose i found of making himself civil for a while to me i think you would have been interested to see the navy yard i said to him i have seen it charley replied in his slightly foreign careful voice it is not a navy yard it is small politics and a big swamp i was not interested dear me i cried but surely its going to be very fine another gold brick sold to uncle sam charleys words seemed always to drop out like little accurately measured coins from some minting machine they should not have changed from the old place if they wanted a harbor that could be used in wartime here they must always keep at least one dredge going out at the jetties so the enemy blows up your dredge and you are bottled in or bottled out it is very simple for the enemy and for kings port navy yards do not galvanize dead trade it was a gold brick you have not been on the hermana before he knew that i had not but he wishes to show her to me and i soon noted a difference as radical as it was diverting between this bankeryachtsmans speech when he talked of affairs on land and when he attempted to deal with nautical matters the clear dispassionate finality of his tone when phosphates or railroads or navy yards or imperial loans were concerned left him and changed to something very like a recitation of trigonometry well memorized but not at all mastered he could do that particular sum but you mustnt stop him and i concluded that i would rather have charley for my captain during a panic in wall street than in a hurricane at sea he too wore highly pronounced sea clothes of the ornamental kind and though they fitted him physically they hung baggily upon his unmarine spirit giving him the air as it were of a broiled quail served on oyster shells beverly rodgers the consummate beverly was the only man of us whose clothes seemed to belong to him he looked as if he could sail a boat while the cabin boy continued to rush among the guests with siphons ice and fresh refreshments charley became the hermanas guidebook for me and our interview gave me i may say entertainment unalloyed although there lay all the while beneath the entertainment my sadness and concern about john charley was owner of the hermana there was no doubt of that she had cost him it was not long before he told me fifty thousand dollars and to run her it cost him a thousand a month yes he was her owner but there it stopped no matter with how solemn a face he inspected each part of her or spoke of her details he was as much a passenger on her as myself and this was as plain on the equally solemn faces of his crew from the sailingmaster down through the two quartermasters to the five deckhands as was the color of the hermanas stack which was of course yellow she was a polemast schoonerrigged steam yacht charley accurately told me with clipper bow and spiked bowsprit about a hundred tons i inquired yes a hundred feet long beam twenty feet and she draws twelve feet said charley and i thought i detected the mate listening to him he now called my attention to the flags and i am certain that i saw the sailingmaster hide his mouth with his hand some of the deckhands seemed to gather delicately nearer to us sunday of course i said and i pointed to the jack flying from a staff at the bow but charley did not wish me to tell him about the flags he wished to tell me about the flags i am very strict about all this he said his gravity and nauticality increasing with every word at the fore truck flies our club burgee i went through my part giving a solemn silent intelligent assent that is my private signal at the main truck it was designed by miss rieppe as i again intelligently nodded i saw the boatswain move an elbow into the ribs of one of the quartermasters on the staff at the taffrail i have the united states yacht ensign charley continued thats all he said looking about for more flags and to his disappointment i think finding no more for he added but at twelve oc at eight bells the crews mealflag will be in the port fore rigging while we are at lunch my mealflag will be in the starboard main rigging it should be there all day i was tempted to remark to him as my wandering eye fell on the cabin boy carrying something more on a plate to kitty but instead of this i said well shes a beautiful boat charley shook his head im going to get rid of her i was surprised isnt she all right it seemed to me that the crew behind us were very attentive now there is not enough refrigerator space said charley one of the deckhands whirled round instantly but stolidity sat like adamant upon the faces of the others as charley turned in their direction and we continued our tour of the hermana thus the little banker let me see his little soul deep down and there i saw that to pass for a real yachtsman which he would never be able to do was dearer to his pride than to bring off successfully some huge and delicate matter in the worlds finance which he could always do supremely well im just like that too i thought to myself and we returned to the gay kitty but kitty despite her gayety had serious thoughts upon her mind charleys attentions to me had met all that politeness required and as we went aft again his sister caused certain movements and rearrangements to happen with chairs and people i didnt know this at once but i knew it when i found myself somehow sitting with her and john and saw hortense with charley hortense looked over at kitty with a something that had in it both raised eyebrows and a shrug though these visible signs did not occur and indeed so far as anything visible went except the look you might have supposed that now hortense had no thoughts for any man in the world save charley and john was plainly more at ease with kitty he began to make himself agreeable so that once or twice she gave him a glance of surprise there was nothing to mark him out from the others except his paleness in the midst of their redness yachting clothes bring out wonderfully how much you are in the habit of eating and drinking and an innocent stranger might have supposed that the replacers were richly sunburned from exposure to the blazing waters of cuba and the tropics kitty deemed it suitable to extol kings port to john quaint was the word that did most of this work for her she found everything that even the negroes and when she had come to the end of it she supposed the inside must be just as quaint as the outside it is said john mayrant he was enjoying kitty then he became impertinent you ought to see it do you stay inside much said kitty we all do said john some of us never come out but you came out kitty suggested oh ive been out john returned he was getting older i doubt if the past few years of his life had matured him as much as had the past few days then he looked at kitty in the eyes and id always come out if romance rang the bell hm said kitty then you know that ring we begin to hear it early in kings port remarked john about the age of fourteen kitty looked at him with an interest that now plainly revealed curiosity also it occurred to me that he could not have found any great embarrassment in getting on at newport what if i rang the bell myself explained kitty come in the evening returned john we wont go home till morning kitty kissed her hand to him and during the pleased giggle that she gave i saw her first taking in john and then hortense kitty was thinking thinking of johns crudity and so i made a little experiment for myself i wonder if men seem as similar in making love as women do in receiving it they arent shouted both john and kitty in the same indignant breath their noise brought bohm to listen to us this experiment was so much a success that i promptly made another for the special benefit of bohm kittys next husband i find it often delightful to make a little gratuitous mischief just to watch the victims i addressed kitty what would you do if a man said he could drown in your hair as joyfully as the duke of clarence did in his butt of malmsey why why gasped kitty why why i suppose it gave john time but even so he was splendid she has heard it said this was his triumphant shout i should not have supposed that kitty could have turned any redder but she did john buried his nose in his tall glass and gulped a choking quantity of its contents and mopped his face profusely but little good that effected there sat this altogether innocent pair deeply suffused with the crimson of apparent guilt and there stood kittys next husband eyeing them suspiciously my little gratuitous mischief was a perfect success and remains with me as one of the bright spots in this day of pleasure vivacious measures from the piano brought kitty to her feet theres gazza she cried well make him sing and on the instant she was gone down the companionway bohm followed her with a less agitated speed and soon all were gone below leaving john and me alone on the deck sitting together in silence john lolled back in his chair slowly sipping at his tall glass and neither of us made any remark i think he wanted to ask me how i came to mention the duke of clarence but i did not see how he very well could and he certainly made no attempt to do so thus did we sit for some time hearing the piano and the company grow livelier and louder with solos and choruses and laughter by and by the shadow of the awning shifted causing me to look up when i saw the shores slowly changing the tide had turned and was beginning to run out land and water lay in immense peace the long white silent picture of the town with its steeples on the one hand and on the other the long low shore and the trees behind into this rose the high voice of gazza singing in broken english razzladazzla razzladazzla while his hearers beat upon glasses with spoons at least so i conjectured arent you coming john asked hortense appearing at the companionway she looked very bacchanalian her splendid amber hair was half riotous and i was reminded of the toboggan fireescape he obeyed her and now i had the deck entirely to myself or rather but one other and distant person shared it with me the hour had come the bells had struck charleys crew was eating its dinner below forward charleys guests were drinking their liquor below aft charleys correct mealflag was to be seen in the port fore rigging as he had said red and triangular and away off from me in the bow was the anchor watch whom i dreamily watched trying to light his pipe his matches seemed to be bad and the brotherly thought of helping him drifted into my mind and comfortably out of it again without disturbing my agreeable repose it had been really entertaining in john to tell kitty that she ought to see the inside of kings port that was like his engaging impishness with juno if by any possible contrivance and none was possible kitty and her replacers could have met the inside of kings port kitty would have added one more quaint impression to her stock and gone away in total ignorance of the quality of the impression she had made and bohm would probably have again remarked worse than sunday no the st michaels and the replacers would never meet in this world and i see no reason that they should in the next johns light and pleasing skirmish with kitty gave me the glimpse of his capacities which i had lacked hitherto john evidently knew his way about as they say and i was diverted to think how miss josephine st michael would have nodded over his adequacy and shaken her head at his squandering it on such a companion but it was no squandering the boys heavy spirit was making a gallant bluff at playing up with the lively party he had no choice but to join and this one saw the moment he was not called upon to play up the peaceful loveliness that floated from earth and water around me triumphed over the jangling hilarity of the cabin and i dozed away aware that they were now all thumping furiously in chorus while gazza sang something that went oh shes my leetle preety poosee pet when i roused it was kittys voice at the piano but no change in the quality of the song or the thumping and hortense was stepping on deck she had a cigarette her beauty flashed with devilment and john followed her they are going to have an explanation i thought as i saw his face if that were so then kitty had blundered in her strategy and hurt charleys cause for after the two came gazza as obviously sent as any emissary ever looked kitty took care of the singing while gazza intercepted any teteatete i rose and made a fourth with them and even as i was drawing near the devilment in hortenses face sank inward beneath cold displeasure i had never been a welcome person to hortense and she made as little effort to conceal this as usual her indifferent eyes glanced at me with drowsy insolence and she made her beautiful low voice as remote and inattentive as her skilful social equipment could render it it is so hot in the cabin this was all she had for me then she looked at gazza with returning animation oh la la said gazza if it is hot in the cabin and he flirted his handkerchief back and forth i think i had the best of it i remarked all the melody and none of the temperature hortense saw no need of noticing me further the singer has the worst of it said gazza but since you all sang i laughed miss rieppe she is cool continued gazza and she danced it is not fair john contributed nothing he was by no means playing up now he was looking away at the shore gazza hummed a little fragment but after lunch i will sing you good music so long as it keeps us cool i suggested ah no it will not be cool music cried gazza for those who understand are those boys bathing hortense now inquired we watched the distant figures and presently they flashed into the water oh me sighed gazza if i were a boy hortense looked at him you would be afraid the devilment had come out again suddenly and brilliantly i never have been afraid declared gazza you would not jump in after me said hortense taking his measure more and more provokingly gazza laid his hand on his heart where you go i will go hortense looked at him and laughed very slightly and lightly i swear it i swear protested gazza johns eyes were now fixed upon hortense would you go she asked him decidedly not he returned i dont know whether he was angry or anxious oh yes you would said hortense and she jumped into the water cigarette and all get a boat quick said john to me and with his coat flung off he was in the river whose current hortense could scarce have reckoned with for they were both already astern as i ran out on the port boat boom gazza was dancing and shrieking man overboard which indeed was the correct expression only it did not apply to himself gazza was a very sensible person i had as i dropped into the nearest boat a brisk sight of the sailingmaster springing like a jackinthebox on the deserted deck with a roar of wheres that haymaker his reference was to the anchor watch the temptation to procure good matches to light his pipe had ended i learned later by proving too much for this responsible sailorman and he had unfortunately chosen for going below just the unexpected moment when it had entered the daring head of hortense to perform this extravagance of course before i had pulled many strokes the deck of the hermana was alive with many manifestations of lifesaving and they had most likely been in time but i am not perfectly sure of this the current was strong and a surprising distance seemed to broaden between me and the hermana before another boat came into sight around her stern by then or just after that for i cannot clearly remember the details of these few anxious minutes i had caught up with john whose face and total silence as he gripped the stern of the boat with one hand and held hortense with the other plainly betrayed it was high time somebody came a man can swim especially in salt water with his shoes on and his clothes add nothing of embarrassment if his arms are free but a womans clothes do not help either his buoyancy or the freedom of his movement john now lifted hortenses two hands which took a good hold of the boat from between her lips the dishevelled cigarette bitten through and limp fell into the water the boat felt the weight of the two hands to it take care i warned john hortense opened her eyes and looked at me she knew that i meant her ill not swamp you this was her first remark her next was when after no incautious haste i had hauled her in over the stern john working round to the bow for the sake of balance i was not dressed for swimming very quietly did hortense speak very coolly very evenly no fainting and no flippancy she was too game for either after this whatever emotions she had felt or was feeling she showed none of them unless it was by her complete silence johns coming into the boat we managed with sufficient dexterity aided by the horrified charley who now arrived personally in the other boat and was for taking all three of us into that but this was altogether unnecessary he was made to understand that such transferences as it would occasion were superfluous and so one of his men stepped into our boat to help me to row back against the current and for this i was not unthankful our return took it appeared to me a much longer time than everything else which had happened when i looked over my shoulder at the hermana she seemed an incredible distance off and when i looked again she had grown so very little nearer that i abandoned this fruitless proceeding charleys boat had gone ahead to announce the good news to general rieppe as soon as possible but if our return was long to me to hortense it was not so she sat beside her lover in the stern and i knew that he was more to her than ever it was her spirit also that wanted him now poor kittys words of prophecy had come perversely true something will happen and that boyll be conspicuous well it had happened with a vengeance and all wrong for kitty and all wrong for me then i remembered charley last of all my doubt as to what he would have done had he been on deck was settled later by learning from his own lips that he did not know how to swim yes the sentimental world and by that i mean the immense and mournful preponderance of fools and not the few of true sentiment would soon be exclaiming how romantic she found her heart she had a glimpse of deaths angel and in that light saw her lifes true happiness but i should say nothing like that nor would miss josephine st michael if i read that lady at all right she didnt know what i did about hortense she hadnt overheard sophistication confessing amorous curiosity about innocence but the old kings port ladys sound instinct would tell her that a souse in the water wasnt likely to be enough to wash away the seasoning of a lifetime and she would wait as i should for the day when hortense having had her taste of johns innocence and having grown used to the souse in the water would wax restless for the replacers for excitement for complexity for the prismatic life then it might interest her to corrupt john but if she couldnt where would her occupation be and how were they going to pull through but now there sat hortense in the stern melted into whatever best she was capable of it had come into her face her face was to be read for the first time since i had known it and strangely enough i couldnt read johns at all it seemed happy which was impossible way enough he cried suddenly and at his command the sailor and i took in our oars here was hermanas gangway and crowding faces above and ejaculations and tears from kitty yes hortense would have liked that return voyage to last longer i was first on the gangway and stood to wait and give them a hand out but she lingered and rising slowly spoke her first word to him softly and so i owe you my life and so i restore it to you complete said john instantly none could have heard it but myself unless the sailor beyond whose comprehension it was and i doubted for a moment if i could have heard right but it was for a moment only hortense stood stiff and then turning came in front of him and i read her face for an instant longer before the furious hate in it was mastered to meet her fathers embrace as i helped her up the gang daughter mine said the general with a magnificent break in his voice but hortense was game to the end she took kittyshysterics and the mens various grades of congratulation her word to gazza would have been supreme but for his imperishable rejoinder i told you you wouldnt jump was what she said gazza stretched both arms pointing to john but a native he was surer to find you at this they all remembered john whom they thus far hadnt thought of where is that lionhearted boy the general called out john hadnt got out of the boat he thought he ought to change his clothes he said and when charley truly astonished proffered his entire wardrobe and reminded him of lunch it was thank you very much but if he could be put ashore i looked for hortense to see what she would do but hortense had gone below with kitty to change her clothes and the genuinely hearty protestations from all the rest brought merely pleasantly firm politeness from john as he put on again the coat he had flung off on jumping at least he would take a drink urged charley yes thank you he would and he chose brandyandsoda of which he poured himself a remarkably stiff one charley and i poured ourselves milder ones for the sake of company heres how said charley to john yes heres how i added more emphatically john looked at charley with a somewhat extraordinary smile heres unquestionably how he exclaimed we had a gay lunch i should have supposed there was plenty of room in the hermanas refrigerator nor did the absence of hortense and john the cause of our jubilation at all interfere with the jubilation itself by the time the launch was ready to put me ashore gazza had sung several miles of good music and double that quantity of razzladazzla and general rieppe was crying copiously and assuring everybody that god was very good to him but kitty had told us all that she intended hortense to remain quiet in her cabin and she kept her word quite suddenly as the launch was speeding me toward kings port i exclaimed aloud the cake and i thought the cake was now settled forever xxii behind the times it was my lot to attend but one of the weddings which hortense precipitated or at least determined by her plunge into the water and truth to say the honor of my presence at the other was not requested therefore i am unable to describe the nuptials of hortense and charley but the papers were full of them what the female guests wore what the male guests were worth and what both ate and drank were set forth in many columns of printed matter and if you did not happen to see this just read the account of the next wedding that occurs among the new york yellow rich and you will know how charley and hortense were married for its always the same thing the point of mark in this particular ceremony of union lay in charleys speech charley found a happy thought at the breakfast the bridal party so the papers had it sat on a dais and was composed exclusively of oil sugar beef steel and union pacific merely at this one table five hundred million dollars were sitting so the papers computed and it helped the bridegroom to his idea when by the importunate vociferations of the company he was forced to get on his unwilling legs poets and people of that sort say charley concluded after thanking them that happiness cannot be bought with money well i guess a poet never does learn how to make a dollar do a dollars work but i am no poet and i have learned it is as well to have a few dollars around and i guess that my friends and i right here at this table could organize a corner in happiness any day we chose and if we do we will let you all in on it i am told that the bride looked superb both in church and at the reception which took place in the house of kitty and that general rieppe in spite of his shattered health maintained a noble appearance through the whole ordeal of parting with his daughter i noticed that beverly rodgers and gazza figured prominently among the invited guests bohm did not have to be invited for some time before the wedding he had become the husband of the successfully divorced kitty so much for the nuptials of hortense and charley they were as one paper pronounced them up to date and distingue the paper omitted the accent in the french word which makes it i think fit this wedding even more happily so hortense i said to myself as i read the paper has squared herself with charley after all and i sat wondering if she would be happy but she was not constructed for happiness you cannot be constructed for all the different sorts of experiences which this world offers each of our natures has its specialty hortense was constructed for pleasure and i have no doubt she got it if not through charley then by other means the marriage of eliza la heu and john mayrant was of a different quality no paper pronounced it up to date or bestowed any other adjectival comments upon it for being solemnized in kings port where such purely personal happenings are still held by the st michael family at any rate to be no business of any ones save those immediately concerned the event escaped the famishment of publicity yes this marriage was solemnized a word that i used above without forethought and now repeat with intention for certainly no respecter of language would write it of the yellow rich and their blatant unions if youre a bohm or a charley you may trivialize or vulgarize or bestialize your wedding but solemnize it you dont for that is not up to date and to the marriage of eliza and john i went for not only was the honor of my presence requested but john wrote me in both their names a personal note which came to me far away in the mountains whither i had gone from kings port this was the body of the note to the formal invitation which you will receive miss la heu joins her wish with mine that you will not be absent on that day we should both really miss you miss la heu begs me to add that if this is not sufficient inducement you shall have a slice of lady baltimore not a long note but you will imagine how genuinely i was touched by their joint message i was not an old acquaintance and i had done little to help them in their troubles but i came into the troubles with their memory of those days i formed a part and it was a part which it warmed me to know they did not dislike to recall i had actually been present at their first meeting that day when john visited the exchange to order his weddingcake and eliza had rushed after him because in his embarrassment he had forgotten to tell her the date for which he wanted it the cake had begun it the cake had continued it the cake had brought them together and in elizas retrospect now i doubted if she could find the moment when her love for john had awakened but if with women there ever is such a moment then as i have before said it was when the girl behind the counter looked across at the handsome blushing boy and felt stirred to help him in his stumbling attempts to be businesslike about that cake if his youth unwittingly kindled hers how could he or she help that but had he ever once known it and shown it to her during his period of bondage to hortense then indeed the flame would have turned to ice in elizas breast what saved him for her was his blind steadfastness against her that was the very thing she prized most once it became hers whereas any secret swerving toward her from hortense during his heavy hours of probation would have degraded john to nothing in elizas eyes and so making all this out by myself in the mountains after reading johns note i ordered from the north the handsomest old china cakedish that aunt carola could find to be sent to miss eliza la heu with my card i wanted to write on the card rira bien qui viva le dernier but alas so many pleasant thoughts may never be said aloud in this world of ours that i ordered china instead of silver was due to my surmise that in kings port or at any rate by mrs weguelin and miss josephine st michael silver from any one not of the family would be considered vulgar it was only a surmise and of course it was precisely the sort of thing that i could not verify by asking any of them but you may be asking how on earth did all this come about what happened in kings port on the day following that important swim which hortense and john took together in the waters of the harbor i wish that i could tell you all that happened but i can only tell you of the outside of things the inside was wholly invisible and inaudible to me although we may be sure i think that when the circles that widened from hortenses plunge reached the shores of the town there must have been in certain quarters a considerable splashing i presume that john communicated to somebody the news of his broken engagement for if he omitted to do so with the wedding invitations to be out the next day he was remiss beyond excuse and i think this very unlikely and i also presume with some evidence to go on that hortense did not in the somewhat critical juncture of her fortunes allow the grass to grow under her feet if such an expression may be used of a person who is shut up in the stateroom of a steam yacht to me john mayrant made no sign of any sort by word or in writing and this is the highest proof he ever gave me of his own delicacy and also of his reliance upon mine for he must have been pretty sure that i had overheard those last destinydeciding words spoken between himself and hortense in the boat as we reached the hermanas gangway in johns place almost any man even beverly rodgers would have either dropped a hint at the moment or later sent me some line to the effect that the incident was of course between ourselves that would have been both permissible and practical but there it was the difference between john of kings port and us others he was not practical when it came to something between gentlemen as he would have said the finest flower of breeding blossoms above the level of the practical and that is why you do not find it growing in the huge truckgarden of our age save in corners where it has not yet been uprooted johns silence to me was something that i liked very much and he must have found that it was not misplaced the first external splash of the few that i have to narrate was a negative manifestation and occurred at breakfast juno supposed if the wedding invitations would be out later in the day the next splash was somewhat louder on was at dinner when juno inquired of mrs trevise if she had received any wedding invitation at tea time was very decided splashing no invitation had come to anybody juno had called at five of the st michael houses and got in at none of them and there was a rumor that the hermana had disappeared from the harbor so far none of the splashing had wet me but i now came in for a light sprinkle were you not on board that boat yesterday juno inquired and to see her look at me you might have gathered that i was suspected of sinking the vessel a most delightful occasion i exclaimed filling my face with a bright blankness isnt he awful to speak that way about sunday said the upcountry bride this was a chance for the poetess and she took it to me she mused every day seems fraught with an equal holiness but i should think observed the briton that you could knock off a hymn better on sundays all this while juno was looking at me and i knew it and therefore i ate my food in a kindly sort of unconscious way until she fired another shot at me there is an absurd report that somebody fell overboard dear me i laughed so that is what it has grown to already i did go out on the boat boom and i did drop off but into a boat at this confession of mine the upcountry bride became extraordinarily arch on the subject of the wellknown hospitality of steam yachts and for this i was honestly grateful to her but juno brooded still i hope there is nothing wrong she said solemnly feeling that silence at this point would not be golden i went into it with spirit i told them of our charming party of general rieppes rich store of quotations of the strict discipline on board the wellappointed hermana of the great beauty of hortense and her evident happiness when her lover was by her side this talk of mine turned off any curiosity or suspicion which the rest of the company may have begun to entertain but upon juno i think it made scant impression save causing her to set me down as an imbecile for there was doctor beaugarcon when we came into the sittingroom who told us before any one could even say howdoyoudo that miss hortense rieppe had broken her engagement with john mayrant and that he had it from mrs cornerly whom he was visiting professionally i caught the pitying look which juno threw at me at this news and i was happy to have acquitted myself so creditably in the manipulation of my secret nobody asked me any more questions there is almost nothing else to tell you of how the splashes broke on kings port before the day when i was obliged to call in doctor beaugarcons professional services quite a sharp attack put me to bed for half a week i found merely the following things the hermana gone to new york the automobiles and the replacers had also disappeared and people were divided on the not strikingly important question as to whether hortense and the general had accompanied charley on the yacht or continued northward in an automobile or taken the train gone in any case the whole party indubitably was leaving i must say a sense of emptiness the comedy was over the players departed i never heard any one not even juno doubt that it was hortense who had broken the engagement this part of the affair was conducted by the principals with great skill hortense had evidently written her version to the cornerlys and not a word to any other effect ever came from johns mouth of course one result i had not looked for though it was a natural one if the old ladies had felt indignation at hortense for her determination to marry john mayrant this indignation was doubled by her determination not to i fear that few of us live by logic even in kings port and then they had all called upon her in that garden for nothing the sudden thought of this made me laugh alone in my bed of sickness and when i came out of it had such a thing been possible i should have liked to congratulate miss josephine st michael on her absence from the garden occasion i said however nothing to her or to any of the other ladies upon this or any subject for i was so unlucky as to find them not at home when i paid my round of farewell visits nor to my real distress did i see john mayrant again the boy wrote me i received it in bed a short warm note of regret with nothing else in it save the fact that he was leaving town having become free from the custom house at last i fancy that he ran away for a judicious interval who would not was there one person to whom he told the truth before he went did the girl behind the counter hear the manner in which the engagement was broken ah none of us will ever know that but although i could not without the highest impropriety have spoken to any of the old ladies about this business unless they had chosen to speak to me and somehow i feel that after the abrupt close of it not even mrs gregory st michael would have been likely to touch on the subject with an outsider there was nothing whatever to forbid my indulging in a skirmish with eliza la heu therefore i lunched at the exchange on my last day to the mountains she said in reply to my information about my plans of travel doctor beaugarcon says nothing else can so quickly restore me stay there for the rhododendrons then she bade me no sight more beautiful in all the south town seems deserted i pursued everybody gone oh not everybody all the interesting people thank you i meant interesting to you i saw her decide not to be angry and her decision changed and saved our conversation from the trashy bantering tone which it was taking and brought it to a pass most unexpected to both of us she gave me a charming and friendly smile well you at any rate are going away and i am really sorry for that her eyes rested upon me with perfect frankness i was not in love with eliza la heu but nearer to love than i had ever been then and it would have been easy very easy to let ones self go straight onward into love there are for a man more ways of falling into that state than romancers would have us to believe and one of them is by an assent of the will at a certain given moment which the heart promptly follows just as a man in a moment decides he will espouse a cause and soon finds himself hotly fighting for it body and soul i could have gone out of that exchange completely in love with eliza la heu but my will did not give its assent and i saw john mayrant not as a rival but as one whose happiness i greatly desired thank you i said for telling me you are sorry i am going and now may i treat you more than ever as a friend and tell you of a circumstance which kings port does not know it put her on her guard dont be indiscreet she laughed isnt timely indiscretion discretion and dont be clever she said tell me what you have to say if youre quite sure youll not be sorry quite sure theres no reason now that the untruth is properly and satisfactorily established that one person should not know that john mayrant broke that engagement and i told her the whole of it if im outrageous to share this secret with you i concluded i can only say that i couldnt stand the unfairness any longer he jumped straight in said eliza oh straight of course she murmured and just after declaring that he wouldnt of course she murmured again and the current took them right away instantly was he very tired when you got to him i answered this question and a number of others backward and forward until she had led me to cover the whole incident about twiceandahalf times then she had a silence and after this a reflection how well they managed it managed what the accepted version oh yes indeed and you and i will not spoil it for them she declared as i took my final leave of her she put a flower in my buttonhole my reflection was then and is now that if she already knew the truth from john himself how well she managed it so that same night i took the lugubrious train which bore me with the grossest deliberation to the mountains and among the mountains and their waterfalls i stayed and saw the rhododendrons and was preparing to journey home when the invitation came from john and eliza i have already said that of this wedding no word was in the papers kings port by the war lost all material things but not the others among which precious privacy remains to her and o kings port may you never lose your grasp of that treasure may you never know the land where the reporter blooms where if any joy or grief befall you the public press rings your doorbell and demands the particulars and if you deny it the particulars it makes them up and says something scurrilous about you into the bargain therefore nothing was printed morning or evening about john and eliza nor was the wedding service held in church to the accompaniment of nodding bonnets and gaping stragglers no eye not tender with regard and emotion looked on while john took eliza to his wedded wife to live together after gods ordinance in the holy state of matrimony in royal street not many steps from south place there stands a quiet house a little back upon whose face sorrow has struck many blows but made no deep wounds yet no scorch from the fires of war is visible arid the rending of the earthquake does not show too plainly but there hangs about the house a gravity that comes from seeing and suffering much and a sweetness from having sheltered many generations of smiles and tears the long linked chain of births and deaths here has not been broken and scattered and the grandchildren look out of the same windows from which the grandsires gazed whose faces now in picture frames still watch serenely the sad present from their happy past therefore the rooms lie in still depths of association and from the walls the stairs the furniture flows the benign influence of undispersed memories it sheds its tempered radiance upon the old miniatures and upon every fresh flower that comes in from the garden it seems to pass through the open doors to and fro like a tranquil blessing it is beyond joy and pain because time has distilled it from both of these it is the assembled essence of kinship and blood unity enriched by each succeeding brood that is born is married is fruitful in its turn and dies remembered only the balm of faith is stronger to sustain and heal for that comes from heaven while it is earth that gives us this and the sacred cup of it which our native land once held is almost empty amid this influence john and eliza were made one and the faces of the older generations grew soft beneath it and pensive eyes became lustrous and into pale cheeks the rosy tint came like an echo faintly back for a short hour they made so little sound in their quiet happiness of congratulation that it might have been a dream and they were so few that the house with the sense of its memories was not lost with the movement and crowding but seemed still to preside over the whole and send down its benediction when it was my turn to shake the hands of bride and groom john asked what did your friend do with your advice and i replied he has taken it perhaps not that john returned but you must have helped him to see his way when the bride came to cut the cake she called me to her and fulfilled her promise you have always liked my baking she said then you made it after all i answered i would not have been married without doing so she declared sweetly when the time came for them to go away they were surrounded with affectionate godspeeds but miss josephine st michael waited to be the last standing a little apart her severe and chiselled face turned aside and seeming to watch a mockingbird that was perched in his cage at a window halfway up the stairs he is usually not so silent miss josephine said to me i suppose we are too many visitors for him then i saw that the old lady beneath her severity was deeply moved and almost at once john and eliza came down the stairs miss josephine took each of them to her heart but she did not trust herself to speak and a single tear rolled down her face as the boy and girl continued to the halldoor there daddy ben stood and johns gay goodby to him was the last word that i heard the bridegroom say while we all stood silently watching them as they drove away from the tall iron gate the mockingbird on the staircase broke into melodious ripples of song xxiii poor aunt carola and now here goes my language back into the smallclothes that it wore at the beginning of all when i told you something of that colonial society the selected salic scions dear to the heart of my aunt it were beyond my compass to approach this august body of men and women with the respect that is its due did i attire myself in that modern garment which in the phrase of the vulgar is denoted pants you will scarce have forgot i must suppose the importance set by my aunt carola upon the establishing of the scions in new territories wherever such persons as were both qualified by their descent and in themselves worthy should be found and you will remember that i was bidden by her to look in south carolina for members of the bombo connection which she was inclined to suspect existed in that state my neglect to make this inquiry for my kind aunt now smote me sharply when all seemed too late john mayrant had spoken of killdevil bombo the very personage through whom lay aunt carolas claim to kingly lineage and i had let john mayrant go away upon his honeymoon without ever questioning him upon this subject as i looked back upon the ease with which i might have settled the matter and forward to my return emptyhanded to the generous relative to whom i owed this agreeable experience of travel i felt guilty indeed i wrote a letter to follow john mayrant into whatever retreat of bliss he had betaken himself to and i begged him earnestly to write me at his early convenience all that he might know of bombos in south carolina consequently i was able on reaching home to meet aunt carola with some sort of countenance and to assure her that i expected presently to be furnished with authentic and valuable particulars i now learned that the selected salic scions had greatly increased in numbers during my short absence it appeared that the origin of the whole movement had sprung from a needy but ingenious youth in some manufacturing town of new england this lad had a cousin who had amassed from nothing a noble fortune by inventing one day a speedy and convenient fashion of opening beer bottles and this cousins achievement had set him to looking about him he soon discovered that in our great republic everywhere there were living hundreds and thousands of men and women who were utterly unaware that they were descended from kings borrowing a little money to float him he set up the american almanach de gotha and began for the minimum sum of fifty dollars a pedigree to reveal to these eager people the chain of links that connected them with royalty thus in a period of time the brevity of which is incredible this young man passed from complete indigence to a wife and four automobiles or an automobile and four wives i dont remember which he had the four of there was so much royal blood about that it had spilled into several rival organizations each bitterly warring with the other but my aunt assured me that her society was the only one that any respectable person belonged to i am minded to announce a rule of discreet conduct never read aloud any letter that you have not first read to yourself had i observed this rule but listen it so happened that aunt carola was at luncheon with us when the postman brought john mayrants answer to my inquiry and at the sight of his handwriting i thoughtlessly exclaimed to my aunt that here at last we had all there was to be known concerning the bombos in south carolina with this i tore open the missive and embarked upon a reading of it for the edification of all present i pass over the beginning of johns communication because it was merely the observations of a man upon his honeymoon and was confined to laudatory accounts of scenery and weather and the beauty of all life when once one saw it with his eyes truly opened no bombos ever came to carolina he now continued that i know of or that aunt josephine knows of which is more to the point aunt josephine has copied me a passage from the writings of william byrd esq of westover virginia in which mention is made not of the family but of a rum punch which seems to have been concocted first by admiral bombo from a new england brand of rum so very deadly that it was not inaptly styled killdevil by the early planters of the colony that the punch drifted to carolina and still survives there you have reason to know therefore if any remote ancestors of yours contracted an alliance with killdevil bombo i can imagine no resulting offspring of such union but a series of severe attacks of delir what interrupted aunt carola at this point in her most formidable voice whats that stuff youre reading augustus i shook in my shoes why aunt its john not another word sir and never let me hear his name again to think to think but here aunt carolas face grew extremely red and she choked so decidedly that uncle andrew poured her a glass of water the rest of our luncheon was conducted with remarkable solemnity as we were rising from table my aunt said it was high time augustus that you came home you seem to have got into very strange company down there this was the last reference to the bombos that my aunt ever made in my hearing of course it is preposterous to suppose that she traces her descent from a king through a mere bowl of punch and her being still the president of the selected salic scions is proof irrefutable that her claim rests upon a more solid foundation xxiv post scriptum i think that john mayrant jr is going to look like his mother i was very glad to be present when he was christened and at this ceremony i did not feel as i had felt the year before at the wedding for then i had known well enough that if the old ladies found any blemish on that occasion it was my being there to them i must remain forever a yankee a wall perfectly imaginary and perfectly real between us and the fact that young john could take any other view of me was to them a sign of that radical tendency in him which they were able to forgive solely because he was of the younger generation and didnt know any better and with these thoughts in my mind and remembering a certain very grave talk i had once held with eliza in the exchange about the north and the south in which it was my good fortune to make her see that there is on our soil nowadays such a being as an american who feels wherever he goes in our native land that it is all his and that he belongs everywhere to it i looked at the little john mayrant and then i said to his mother and will you teach him dixie and yankee doodle as well but eliza smiled at me with friendly inscrutable eyes oh said john you mustnt ask too much of the ladies ill see to all that perhaps he will and an education at harvard college need not cause the boy to forget his race or his name or his traditions but only to value them more as they should be valued and the way that they should be valued is this that the boy in thinking of them should say to himself i am proud of my ancestors let my life make them proud of me but in any case is it not pleasant to think of the boy being brought up by eliza and not by hortense and so my portrait of kings port is finished that the likeness is not perfect i am only too sensible no painter that i have heard of ever satisfies the whole family but should any of the st michaels see this picture i trust they may observe that if some of the touches are faulty true admiration and love of his subject animated the artists hand and if miss josephine st michael should be pleased with any of it i could wish that she might indicate this by sending me a lady baltimore we have no cake here that approaches it
