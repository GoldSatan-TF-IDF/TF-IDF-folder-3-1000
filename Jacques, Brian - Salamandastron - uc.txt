the dormouse was a jolly plump old fellow clad in a rustcolored jerkin his white beard curled and trimmed neatly an infant mole who could not sleep because of the onset of spring sat beside him on a mossy beechlog in the orchard together they shared an early breakfast of oatcakes hot from the kitchens and two of last autumns russet apples dawn was touching the earth with its rosy paws promising sunny spring days as a compensation for the long winter redwall abbey had endured soft white clouds with golden underbellies hung on the still air dewdrops glistened on new green grass budding narcissus and snowdrop awaited the coming of the sunwarmed day the dormouse nodded sagely soon be pickin a nameday for this good season aye soon the small mole chewed slowly at his oatcake wrinkling a black button snout as he gazed up at the elder youm said youm tell oi a story zurr the dormouse polished an apple on his jerkin dyou like my stories burrem the little fellow smiled burr aye oi serpintly do zurr his friend settled down comfortably on the grass propping his back against the log brian jacques right then its a good long one well have to break off for lunch and tea supper too maybe ah well here goes once upon a time colder than the winter wind howling its dirge through the southwest forest colder than the snow blanketing tree rock and earth in its silent shroud colder than ice that lay on water and hung in shards from branches and bushes colder than these was the smile of ferahgo the assassin ferahgo was still young but as the seasons passed his evil and infamy would grow and everybeast would come to fear the name of the blueeyed weasel hisband searched the wrecked badgers den scavenging and snarling over winter food and the few pitiful possessions strewn among the debris smiling pitilessly ferahgo stepped over the bodies of the slain badger urthound and his wife urthrun the last two brave creatures to stand against him stealth and deceit reinforced by a crew of backstabbers were the assassins trademark he had tricked the badgers into thinking this would be a peace conference fools migroo the stoat pulled aside a heap of dried moss chief look two badger babes lay huddled together mewling and shiv brian jacques ering as they stuck their heads up lips pursed in a plea for mothers milk migroo laughed that one looks like his father but this other one chief its white i thought all badgers had stripes ferahgo tickled their nose tips with his knifepoint theyre both males one is a proper badger the other is an albino they might not be orphans today if their parents had not resisted me migroo watched the point of ferahgos knife whatre yen goin t do with em the assassin shrugged and sheathed his blade nothing the winter will take care of urthounds whelps fondling the round gold medallion he had taken from the neck of unbound ferahgo gave one last glance around now nobeast in the southwest is left to oppose me come on my corpsemakers the weasel swept out into the wintering forestlands with his band a smile still fixed in his beautiful light blue eyes behind him in the ruins of the den the two badger babes one striped the other pure white snuggled against the cold body of their mother they made pitiful little noises waiting for her to wake and comfort them outside the snowflakes blew gustily between tree and bush chased by the soughing wind it was cold but not as cold as the smile on the face of ferahgo the assassin book one questors and runaways many and many a long seasdnhad come and gone since that fateful midwinter day in the southwest lands the only sound disturbing the stillness of a high summer noontide was that of seabirds plaintively calling as they wheeled and circled overhead the vastness of the sea lay becalmed without blemish of wave or whitecrested roller still as a millpond mirroring the faded blue of a cloudless sky obscured in its own heat haze the sun blushed forth a radiant golden wash tinting sand and rock with a soft amber glow above the tideline stood the great citadel of salamandastron the mountainous shell that had once been a volcano when the world was young through countless ages it had been ruled by the mysterious badger lords and their friends the hares of the long patrol the entire rock was a towering fortress riven through with caves passages and halls standing guard to protect the shores and all the sprawling country of west mossflower from salamandastrons main entrance a solitary set of pawprints led through the sand to a limpetcrusted outcrop by the sea perched on the stone chin in paw lord urthstripe the strong gazed seaward clad in his stout forge apron devoid brian jacques of armor or sword at one with earth sea and sky the badger lord sat alone with his thoughts mara had not been home for two nights and he was worried had he done the right thing adopting a young female badger she was one of the few badger maids ever to live at the mountain traditionally it was the preserve of single male badgers five seasons ago his hares had found her among the dunes a tiny whimpering babe lost and alone urthstripe was overjoyed when they had brought her to him he cherished her as the daughter he had never had but that was when she was an infant he was a badger lord with many things to attend to and as she grew up so they had drifted apart life presented various obstacles to mara she had come to resent the strict ways and regimented existence at salamandastron urthstripe became awkward and severe in his dealings with her and mara in her turn was rebellious of his heavypawed authority against urthstripes wishes she had gone off two days ago with her close friend pikkle ffolger a young hare the badger lord scowled pikkle was far too wild and erratic mara would never grow up to be a proper badger lady running about with the like of that mischiefmaker but that was the way of things between them now if he lectured her or threatened penalties he felt like an ogre so they avoided each other she going her own way and he unhappily having to go his sergeant sapwood loped slowly across to the rock he bobbed about shadowboxing until urthstripe noticed him sidestepping the strong lanky hare tucked in his chin and hooked out a left paw haint much t do out ere sir you acomin in for summat to eat theres wild oatcakes bilberry tart an cold cider you haint touched vittles since yesterday morn urthstripe climbed slowly down from the rock and growled anxiously at the hare any sign of mara yet sergeant nah not so far but dont you fret yself sir shell come trottin back wi young pikkle soon as theyre hungered salamandastron enough dyou want me to send the missie t you when she does arrive back no but let me know the moment shes back home see she gets a good meal and then then send her to me sapwood ducked and feinted as they made their way across the shore swaying lightly on his paws as he circled urthstripe cmon sir lets see you try t put one on me button the badger lord tried to ignore his pugnacious friend but sapwood persisted go on sir try the old onetwo eh urthstripe halted blinking as the hare bobbed and dodged under his nose really sapwood im in no mood for sport the sergeant dabbed a swift paw at urthstripes jaw ohave a go sir try yer luck for all his great bulk the badger was surprisingly swift he spun sideways clipping sapwood under the chin with what he judged to be a light tap the sergeant was bowled over knocked flat on his back instantly the badger lord was at his friends side his huge striped face showing concern sap are you all right i didnt hurt you did i sapwood sat up uncrossing his eyes and rubbing his chin he chuckled ruefully bless your eart sir im as right as rain never saw thatn comin though good job you never punched your weight or youd ave knocked me block clean off with their paws about each other the two friends entered salamandastron chatting and chuckling about old fights and bygone battles before he entered the mountain urthstripe could not resist casting a final longing glance to the open country disappointed that he could not see mara arriving home he heaved a lonely sigh and followed sapwood inside a massive ridge of mountains created a high spine down the land east of salamandastron in the foothills to the south they gave way to swamplands which in their turn led to the dunes sweeping in from the west the early noon sun was causing brian jacques grasshoppers to chirrup and rustle in the rockstrewn foothills ferahgo the assassin sighted his skinning knife at one insect which was about to leap he flicked the knife expertly his aim was good the keenedged blade sliced the grasshopper in two the knifepoint was still quivering in the ground as ferahgo pulled it free and wiped it clean on the grass thats one grasshopper wont jump any more he chuckled am i not right migroo the stoat nodded vigorously aye chief twas a grand throw ferahgo sheathed the weapon in the crossbelts he wore diagonally across his chest two other knives were encased there each as sharp and deadly as the one he had thrown smiling he rested his paws on the broad belt supporting his short kilt of skins he had grown taller and more sinewy than other weasels the seasons seemed to lend an extra sparkle to his eyes which were light brilliant blue like a fresh spring sky beautiful almondshaped eyes with deep laughter creases etching their corners many a stranger had met death through the deceit and vicious cruelty which lay behind those innocently smiling eyes every weasel stoat rat ferret or fox in his army of corpsemakers knew that the more ferahgo the assassin smiled the more evil and brutal he became his reign of terror had spread and flourished in the southwest lands until the whole country trembled with fear at his name ferahgo this summer he had decided to push further north none of his army dared question the odd decision though they speculated in secret as to his reason for such a long trek the horde lounged in the dunes and the foothillssome stretched on the sunscorched sand and grass others seeking the shade of rocksapparently idle but ever vigilant for their leaders commands disobedience to ferahgo meant death the assassin stretched luxuriously upon the dry curling grass and closed his eyes enjoying the still warmth of summer one eye suddenly snapped open as he called to a weasel stationed in the rocks higher up salamandastron feadle keep your eyes peeled for my son and goffa dont go to sleep up there feadle made a show of scouring the terrain north and west before shouting back down ill let you know as soon as klitch and goffa show up master dont you worry ferahgos reply gave the lookout good reason to stay awake oh im not worried feadlebut you should be because if you miss them ill skin you alive with my knives keep those eyes open now theres a good weasel it was a plainspoken matteroffact statement but everybeast within hearing knew that the assassin was not joking ferahgo seldom joked even though he did smile a lot dethbrush the fox and his six tracker rats loped in from the south he heard feadle announce their sighting from his high perch dethbrush an the trackers coming in master the fox stood by as ferahgo still lying down with his eyes closed questioned him you have not brought dingeye and thura back with you dethbrush was weary but he did not dare sit or relax no master we tracked them for two moons they have gone east into the flatlands on the other side of these mountains ferahgos paw strayed to the handle of his favorite knife it does not please me when my orders are not carried out dethbrush tried hard to stop his limbs trembling he swallowed hard licking at dry lips master we searched night and day without rest they must have found a way to cross the south streamthat is where i lost their tracks i thought it would be better to report back to you rather than get lost in strange country ferahgo opened his eyes he was not smiling you did right dethbrush rest and eat until tomorrow then you will go tracking again with your rats but remember i want dingeye and thura or their heads brought back here to me it is bad for the morale of my corpsemakers if they realize that deserters can escape my punishment and roam free do you understand brian jacques dethbrush gave a sigh of relief and nodded i understand ferahgo this time i wont fail you ferahgo closed his eyes make sure you dont my friend he smiled slightly and waved a paw in dismissal dethbrush went to look for water his mouth dry with fear redwall abbey slumbered peacefully under the noontide sun a songthrush trilled sweetly from the surrounding greenery of mossflower woods its melodious tune echoing from the dusty red sandstone walls of the main building to the outer ramparts somewhere in the abbey pool a trout half leaped at a passing gnat missed it and flopped back lazily into the water two moles lugging a trolley laden with vegetables for the kitchen turned at the sound commenting in their quaint molespeech ee be a gurt noisy trowt that un eh burrley burrley the smaller of the two wrinkled his button nose hurr youm doant say oid be gurt n lazy iffen oi dwelled inna pond wi nothen t do ho urr they trundled into the abbey speculating on the easy lifestyle of trouts who lived in ponds mrs faith spinney was picking fruit in the orchard the good hedgehog lady muttered quietly to herself as she checked the contents of her basket early plums gooseberries small pears dearie me they are liddle uns too no mind theyll make tasty cordial damsons arent near ready yetpity i do like a good damson brian jacques pudden now let me see what have i forgotten the sight of a tree jogged her memory apples of course those big green uns be just right for bakin pies standing on tippaw she reached for a large green apple hanging from a low bough zzzzip splott an arrow sped by a hairsbreadth from mrs spinneys paw it pierced the juicy apple sending it spinning from the bough onto the grass the hedgehog dropped her basket and dashed off ducking low and shielding her head with both paws as she whooped out in terror ooowhoo help murder were bein attacked by scallawagians help appeared swiftly in the form of a brawny male otter sink me whats all the todo about marm faith spinney was hiding behind a gooseberry bush with her apron over her head she peeped out at the otter hoohoo do urry an sound the alarm bell mr thrugg just lookit that apple lyin in yonder grass striding boldly over thrugg retrieved the apple pulling the arrow from it he looked about nodding grimly there there now marm dont get yore prickles in an uproar everythings shipshape i didnt clap eyes on the villain who shot that arrer but ill stake me rudder i know who it is that did thrugg filled the basket with the fruit that had spilled out adding the apple placing a paw gingerly about mrs spinneys bristling shoulders he led her off toward the abbey carrying the basket for her afternoon summer tea at redwall was always very good the mice who formed the brother and sisterhood sat among other creatures in great hall there was never any distinction to class or species all were redwallers and friends and they mingled freely sharing the delicious repast hot scones hazelnut bread apple jelly meadowcream redcurrant tart mint tea and strawberry cordial were consumed in great quantities abbess vale successor to old abbot saxtus sat dwarfed solamandosmm in the big badger chair at the head of the long table redwall abbey had not seen a female badger guardian in many a long season old mother mellus having gone to her wellearned rest quite some time ago beside the abbess sat bremmun a venerable squirrel he leaned across to speak to her raising his voice over the hubbub and jollity of redwallers at tea you heard what thrugg had to say about samkim vale put aside her beaker yes i heard all about it bremmun chose a slice of the latticed redcurrant tart and ladled it thickly with meadowcream shall i leave it for you to deal with as mother abbess or do you wish me to do it the abbess turned the beaker slowly in her paws you are both squirrels i think it would be better if it were to come from you my friend samkim can be very naughty at times but ive always liked the little fellow i really dont have the heart to scold him ill leave it to you if i may bremmun those on serving duty were beginning to clear away the dishes and one or two diners were rising to leave bremmun rapped the tabletop sharply with a wooden ladle one moment friends your attention please the hubbub of conversation stopped immediately those about to leave respectfully kept their seats reaching beneath the linen table runner bremmun produced the arrow thrugg had given him he held it up for all to see this shaft was loosed in the orchard this afternoon would the creature who fired it please stand forward amid a scraping of wooden benches everybeast turned to watch two small figures emerge from the table nearest the door many a knowing nod was passed samkim and arula again the young squirrel samkim was a strongly built fellow wearing a beret sporting a wren feather at a jaunty angle straightening his soft greencloth tunic he strode up to the long table unable to extinguish the roguish twinkle in his hazel eyes arula the young mole padded alongside him she too was clad in beret and tunic though her small round eyes were downcast samkims head was barely visible over the tabletop as he denounced himself to bremmun brian jacques salamandostron the arrow is mine i shot it arula had no part in it the mole shook her velvety head ho no zurrtwas oi who axed sankin to shoot ee arpel hurr aye tis moi fault zurr brummn the squirrels voice was loud and stern silence missie samkim this is not the first time a short while ago an arrow was found lodged in the kitchen door then one of the gatehouse windows was broken by an arrow later it was brother hal who was the victim of another arrow he has a permanent furrow through his headfura fraction lower and he would not be with us today now it is poor mrs spinneys turn the good lady was half frightened to death by your archery what have you got to say for yourself young squirrel samkim shrugged apologetically sorry i never meant to hurt anyone bremmun hurried around the table to face the culprit you never meant to hurt anyone a bow and arrow is a weapon not a toy but you do not seem to realize that oh no off you go willy nilly firing arrows carelessly without a thought for anybeast arula interrupted pointing to herself et wurr moi fault zurr twas oi oo tof sankin t do et quite so quite so arula bremmun waved her aside distractedly now as for you samkim you young wretch you make me ashamed to call myself a squirrel mother abbess was far too upset by your disgraceful behavior to speak to you therefore it is my painful duty to do this both of you samkim and arula are confined to the infirmary until further notice i am sure brother hollyberry can find lots of tasks scrubbing bedmaking and washing floorsfor both of you your meals will be delivered to you up there you will sleep in the infirmary and under no circumstances must either of you leave until the mother abbess and i have decided that you are fit to join ordinary decent redwallers again furthermore samkim if i ever hear that you have been within paws length of a bow or arrows again you will be in very deep and serious trouble do i make myself clear two young heads nodded miserably yes sir hurr clearern broit summer morn thankee zurr silence fell over great hall as the two miscreants were led off to their fate by brother hal punishments and penalties were an absolute rarity in the friendly abbey bremmun returned to his seat leaning across he whispered to abbess vale thank goodness thats over with do you think i was too hard on them vale she folded her paws in her lap yes bremmun i do oh i know that samkim and arula are always in trouble but they are young restricting their freedom to the infirmary is very severe i think bremmun looked uncomfortable and shrugged apologetically not to worry i wont keep them confined there for long theyll soon learn their lesson did you notice little arula i had to try hard to stop myself smilingthere she was standing up bold as a stone taking all the blame herself the abbess pursed her lips to hide her own smile bless her she was very brave those two are true friends even if they are a pair of scamps young ones like them are the very backbone of our abbey they do not lack courage or honesty we need creatures like that they will take the reins and show an example to all in the seasons to come samkim and arula sat on a bed facing brother hollyberry the ancient healer and keeper of the infirmary leaned back in his armchair chuckling dryly thank your lucky stars there wasnt a badger sitting in the chair today by the fur you two would have really found out what punishment was like those badgers were very very strict boi ecky lucky fer usns bruther oi spect ee badgerd choppen our tails off

walls doors cupboards and shelves to be brian jacques washed windows to be cleaned sheets to be counted and folded lots of torn nightshirts to be sewn pillowslips to be scrubbed he watched their faces going from glumness to despair at the mention of each new chore chuckling aloud hollyberry rose and patted their heads but well start all that tomorrow you can have the rest of the day off sorry youre not allowed out young uns maybe if you look in the big cupboard youll find a game of pebbles and acorns oh and some candied chestnuts in my little locker here that should keep you amused until bedtime or thereabouts samkim rubbed his paws delightedly thanks brother hollyberry youre a real matey er were you ever naughty when you were young the old mouse looked secretively to and fro as he whispered naughty let me tell you young un i was known as hollyberry the horrible when i was a little mouse old abbot saxtus said that i was the reason he was gray and bent double listen now ive got to go and tend my herbs in the garden do you think you can behave yourself while im gone arula draped a clean sheet over her head gudd zurr lookit oi hurr hurt a snowwhoitchoild oi be pikkle ffolger searched the corners of his knapsack and came up with a single wild oatscone which he wagged in maras face the last bally scrap of tuck between two stout n starvin travelers would y believe it old chum the sturdy young badger maid plucked the scone from his paws there were four oatscones in that bag before i went to sleep last night you flopeared glutton youve scoffed em pikkle placed a paw over his heart his face a picture of injured innocence scoffed did i hear you use the expression scoffed o boon companion and playmate of my younger days nibbled daintily picked idly at maybe even mouthed a morsel or so but scoffed never mara broke the scone in two and tossed half to him listen here ffolger me old pikkle dont try baffling me with owery phrases youre a scoffer and you always have been so there grinning from ear to ear pikkle scoffed his half oh well truth will out old gel wot i say its goin to take us until late night to get back to jolly old salamawotsit i bet were brian jacques salamandas tron both in for some pretty stiff words when old urthstripe catches up with us mara slumped moodily in the hollow of two dunes her appetite suddenly gone at the thought of returning to face the badger lord huh salamandastroni wish i never had to go back to that dreary mountain pikkle day and night dawn to dusk its watch your manners learn your badger lore keep your room tidy sit up straight dont slouch do this do that dont do this dont do that im sick to the stripes of it all isnt there somewhere young ones can do what they want have fun all day without elders and grownbeasts making you do silly boring things then come with uswe do as we please mara and pikkle looked around in surprise a pair of young creatures a weasel and a ferret appeared around the dune the garrulous pikkle winked and grinned cheekily at them what ho chaps who are you the weasel smiled back he was a handsomelooking beast with the brightest blue eyes mara had ever seen hello there im klitch and hes goffa weve come up from the southwest lands mara sized the pair up the ferret was a shiftylooking creature dressed in a long tunic that had obviously been cut down to fit him he carried a spear and wore a dagger in the piece of rope that served him as a belt the young weasel was a different matter altogether his clothing fitted perfectly he wore a smart yellow tunic and on his woven belt hung a short sword complete with case he also sported a pair of thick white bone bracelets all in all he appeared quite dashing mara felt selfconscious both she and pikkle were clad in the homely sandcolored smocks worn by those who lived at salamandastron my name is mara and this is my friend pikkle ffolger we come from the mountain fortress of salamandastron almost a days march north of here klitch smiled oddly but you dont want to go back right mara stood up dusting sand from herself oh we moan and groan a bit but we always return there its our home you see tell me did you and goffa come all the way up from the southwest by yourselves a quick smile passed between klitch and goffa then the weasel shrugged carelessly oh more or less we do exactly what we want and go just where we please isnt that right goffa the ferret leaned on his spear and nodded right but you two are only young ones like us pikkle interrupted i say who allows you to carry weapons like that klitchs blue eyes twinkled merrily nobeast allows us to do anythingwe feel like having weapons so we carry em and dont give a hoot for anyone the more mara heard from klitch the more she admired him he drew his sword and swung it neatly clipping the heads from two dandelions growing amid the reedgrass so youre from salamandastron hellsteeth thats a right old mouthful of a name tell you what me and goffa here will walk along with you id like to see this place you can tell me all about it as we go without further preamble the four young ones set out for the mountain chatting and laughing klitch was an amusing talker with lots of interesting tales to tell he was also a good listener and paid rapt attention to anything mara or pikkle had to say about their homeso much so that eventually they were doing all the talking and he was doing all the listening goffa rarely spoke the journey did not seem half so arduous with friends to share it still it was night when they came within hailing distance of the great mountain windpaw a fully grown female hare met them as they crossed the shore she nodded at the two newcomers and shook a cautionary paw at mara and pikkle we were about to send search parties out looking for you brian jacques salamandastron mara you are untidy where in the name of seashells have you been pikkle waved a paw airily oh here an there yknow thither an yon as they say windpaw silenced him with a frosty glare you can tell that to lord urthstripe young ffolger first youd both better come with me have you eaten today mara indicated the ferret and the weasel meet our friends klitch and goffa theyll need food too windpaw shook her head doubtfully at the thought of ferret and a weasel entering the fortress she looked them up and down then snorted hmmm they look young and hungry enough i suppose follow me klitch bowed gracefully putting on a smile that would have charmed a bird from its nest thank you kindly beautiful lady windpaw sniffed she led them through a concealed entrance the dining room is down that passage theres a bowl of water and towel as you go in make sure you wash your paws before sitting down to eat klitch winked at his companion we wouldnt dream of eating with dirty paws would we friend goffa the ferret winced as klitch kicked his paw ouch what er oh no of course not there was good hot mushroom soup vegetable pasties a flagon of mountain pear cordial salad and a beechnut cake preserved in honey they ate with full and hearty appetite pikkle ffolger putting away twice as much as the others lord urthstripe and sergeant sapwood entered the dining room just as the meal finished the badgers jaw tightened at the sight of his two visitors sapwood crossed his paws behind him and held his breath both pikkle and mara fiddled about needlessly with their empty bowls keeping their eyes fixed firmly on the tabletop to avoid the badger lords fearsome gaze showing flawless good manners klitch rose nudging goffa to do likewise the weasels blue eyes shone with sincerity as he spoke lord urthstripe i believe i hope i find you well sir am klitch and this is my friend goffa and we both wish to thank you for your good food and kind hospitality for a long time there was silence urthstripe was staring at the weasel strangely as if trying to remember something pikkle dropped his spoon and the clatter of wood on the stone seemed to restore the badger lord to the present he bowed his head in curt acknowledgment of the weasels compliment though the distaste in his voice was plain this is my mountain master klitch while you are here i must treat you both as guests if you have finished eating my sergeant will show you to a room where you will spend the night after breakfast tomorrow you must both leave salamandastron you will be given food for your travels now i bid you both a good night sergeant sapwood came smartly to attention grimfaced he led klitch and goffa off to their bedchamber when they were gone the badger lord folded his paws across his broad chest and faced mara young maid have you nothing to say for yourself missing without a word to anybeast for two whole nights now you return bringing a ferret and a weasel here mara shook her head in bewilderment how could you be so rude to those two young creatures they are my friends urthstripes paw crashed loud against the tabletop friends a ferret and a weasel they are not friends they are vermin have you no sense mara ferrets weasels stoats rats and foxes have caused murder and warfare in mossflower since before the days of my ancestors who are they with where is the rest of their band screwing up his courage pikkle chipped in i say sir steady on those two chaps were all alone when we met em they traveled up from the southwest actually theyre rather jolly brian jacques salamandas tron urthstripes roar cut him short silence ffolger when i want your opinion i shall ask for it go to your room this instant its time you learned to grow up and show some hare responsibility pikkle vacated the dining room in haste knowing it was useless to argue with a badger lord of urthstripes temper huge tears welled from maras eyes to drip on to the table the badger lord gave a deep sigh of helplessness and shook his great striped head mara little one please dont cry im sorry i lost my temper but i thought you knew about our enemies the badger maid rubbed paws into her eyes sniffing theyre not all enemies but you dont seem to care you dont even want me having pikkle as a friend sometimes i wish i was dead instead of being stuck inside this miserable od mountain urthstripe pulled a spotted kerchief from his forge apron and gently wiped her eyes sadness and concern showing on his heavy features please dont say that mara you are all i have and someday when i am gone the duty may fall upon you to rule this mountain i know it is a lonely and demanding life but it is our solemn duty as badgers to protect mossflower and its shores only then can good honest creatures not as strong as we live in peace and happiness you must believe me browneye the sound of the pet name he had called her as an infant brought a flood of fresh tears mara dashed from the room calling as she ran to her bedchamber i dont know what to believe anymore i just want to be somewhere where i can be happy urthstripe sat at the dining table shutting his eyes tight he gripped the table edge until his blunt claws scored deep gouges into the oak when he looked up again sergeant sapwood was standing there quickly composing himself urthstripe asked in a gruff voice are those vermin securely locked in their room for the night the hare sat down beside him aye sir turned the key myself the badger lords eyes narrowed in a hard line good id hate to think that a ferret and a weasel were skulking about our mountain during the night sapwood tapped a paw alongside his nose haint much fear o that sir i posted two sentries near their doorcatkin an big oxeye if n they ever did manage to sneak out o that room those two would really find theirselves wi problems big oxeye dont like vermin no sir urthstripe could not resist a small chuckle almost makes you wish theyd try something doesnt it its been a few seasons since i saw oxeye chastise an enemy the sergeant nodded wholehearted agreement hohoe can chastise all right i never did see anybeast return for a second elpin off big oxeye soft summer night cast its shades over the mountain stronghold the two friends sat up into the small hours discussing and reliving old days of past seasons outside the full moon beamed down upon the deserted shore tipping countless small wavetips with a thread of pale silver light perched high in the rocks of the lookout post feadle strove to keep awake he spat on his paws rubbing them hard into redrimmed eyes blinking intently he peered among the moonshadowed dunes fearful lest he miss klitchs return ferahgo sat apart from the rest of his band pawing thoughtfully at the gold badger medal about his neck and stirring the flames of a guttering fire keeping his voice low the assassin spoke to a small stringy water rat seated close by him tell me again sickear how did you find out about the mountain i was a searat and i saw the place a few times master though only from a distance they call it salamandastron ferahgo stroked the badger medal repeating the name slowly as if it were a magic charm salamandastron i like the sound of it salamandastron but tell me the rest you know the part i like to hear brian jacques salamandastron sickear repeated the tale as he had done many times in secret to ferahgo since joining his band last winter the searat captains said there was great treasure hidden inside the mountaintheir old legends are full of it the fortress is guarded by tough fighting hares and ruled by a badger lordalways has been since anybeast could remember the present ruler is called urthstripe the strong a great and fearsome warrior ferahgo moved closer to the speaker his eyes shining blue in the firelight aglitter with greed the treasuretell me about the treasure sickear swallowed hard as the assassins claws closed on his shoulder he repeated what ferahgo wanted to hear it is said the great badgers never lacked riches as each one lived out his seasons or died in battle so his possessions were added to the pile hidden somewhere inside the mountain pearls from the sea manycolored precious stones armor wrought from silver gold and copper spears and other great weapons all made by the badgers at their forge bright war axes that can cut through stone shields that are wonderful to look upon swords with blades that can slice armor like butter red and green stones set into their handles sheathed in cases of the finest aaaarrghh ferahgos claws had pierced the rats shoulder sickear whimpered in pain tears rolling down his narrow face the weasel chieftain freed his claws from the matted fur and flesh with a quick wrench slumping to one side sickear moaned piteously trying to lick his injured shoulder ferahgo grinned his strange blue eyes twinkling in the firelight like a happy infant oh im sorry friend i must have got carried away never mind its only a scratch the best thing for you is fresh air and something to take your mind off it listen now you shin up those lookout rocks and keep feadle company the rest of the night itll do you good stop weeping and groaning now come on up you go the assassins eyes smiled wide and innocent as he watched the injured sickear hauling himself painfully up among the rocks with a note of deceptive concern he called softly up to the weary lookout not sleepy yet feadle the lookout stared down into the treacherous blue eyes smiling up at him straightening his back against the rock he sang out in an alert manner no sign of your son or goffa yet master im wide awake feadles heart sank at the cheerful reply good work stop up there and keep sickear company keep your eyes open now both of you theres a fresh edge on my skinning knife that i havent used yet feadle stretched down grasping sickears paw he helped him up to the lookout post below them ferahgo lay fiat on his back watching through halfclosed eyes rosy dawn light caressed the abbey walls as bremmun the squirrel climbed the stairs to the infirmary knocking softly on the door he entered brother hollyberry never slept in a bed he sat propped up by cushions in his armchair watching the birth of another summer day rise over the windowsill arula and samkim lay asleep in their beds bremmun nodded toward them keeping his

came marching through the winters cold and martin was his name martin martin the warrior of redwall with courage and his trusty sword he came to save us all now in those high and faroff days the country was oppressed by vermin cruel whose tyrant ways would let no creature rest but truth and bravry won the day for through all mossflowr wide good honest creatures made their way to stand by

redwall with courage and his trusty sword he came to save us all every creature joined in the last rousing chorus and set up a loud cheer the echoes bounced off the homely red walls and soared to the blue summer skies above dingeye and thura cheered as loud as anybeast then they looked at each other in slight bewilderment wotre we cheerin for we dont even know who martin is well whoever e is i bet

it sister nasturtium patted the stoats back you dont understand martin may have died a long time ago but his spirit lives on in the very stones of redwall and its creatures maybe he has not been seen or felt because this is a time of peace though in troubled times he has visited certain ones and inspired them to great deeds thura scratched his head have you ever seen martin a silence fell over the company as they watched nasturtium she looked as if she were dreaming with her eyes wide open fixed on the red stone walls in front of her she started slowly to recite words they had never heard before i am but an orchard shadow in the sunny tide of noon the dust of olden seasons on a stone my paw is light and silent as a waning autumn moon i walk the halls of memory alone you may hear me as a whisper that the wind has left behind or see me as the pale calm light of dawn feel me take the toll of care from off your sleeping mind brian jacques in times of deep despair and hope forlorn then i will be beside you in the corridors of dream a warriors strength ill give to you my friend like the waters of a storm that swell a tiny mountain stream a mightiness your loved ones to defend

recorder to write it all down nasturtium shook her head strange i cant remember a single word im afraid the whole thing has gone clear out of my head how odd its as if some other creature was in charge of my tongue and my mind too friar bellows came panting up he was waving a ladle come on you lot nameday tomorrow the food isnt going to prepare itself yknow up on your paws and look busy now there were a few groans but most of the helpers went willingly dingeye and thura were among the back stragglers huh i wish we cd train those pots v pans to scrub emselves hup there cauldron jump in the sink and give yerself a good scourin now salamandastron or maybe we could get that martin spirit to wash a few owch dingeye had not realized thrugg was still within hearing range earlier that morning a somber pall hung over the fortress of salamandastron mara lay abed for as long as she could before rising to make her way down to the dining hall urthstripe sat in his large chair with sergeant sapwood and big oxeye on either side of him mara sidled in and took a seat at the far end of the big table next to pikkle klitch and goffa sat on her other side usually there would be lots of goodnatured joking and chatter over the plain fare but today breakfast was a dismal affair silence hung broodingly over the assembly pikkle passed mara a bowl of wild oatmeal porridge and a beaker of sage tea keeping his voice to a whisper as he said jolly lot arent they wot i say old gel did you get an awful tickin off from lord urthstripe last night maras appetite had deserted her she dabbed at the porridge with a crust of ryebread oh it was much the same as usual one word led to another and i ran off to bed in the end because i couldnt stick it klitch leaned over the sly blue eyes he had inherited from his father ferahgo now radiating candor and sympathy you didnt get into trouble because of goffa and me did you the young badger maid shrugged it was nothing to do with you klitch i just get tired of being pushed and bossed scdamandas tron like a silly infant around here did you father shout at you goffa refilled his bowl from a nearby serving dish pikkie wiped his bowl with ryebread hes not her father klitch stole a quick glance up the table at urthstripe then why does mara have to do as he says i wouldnt me and goffa do as we pleasenobeast gives us orders urthstripe sat looking at his untouched breakfast mara had not even acknowledged him this morning one part of him longed to be friends with her but the other half detested what he was seeing a fine young badger maid gossiping with a ferret and a weasel as if they were lifelong friends the badger lord caught the weasel stealing a glance at him the creature had light blue eyes shining as honest as a newborn infant some faraway faint memory was struggling to surface within urthstripes brain but then it was wiped away as oxeye nudged him and nodded down the table that chap could charm the bally birds out of the trees with his babyblue peepers still id hate ter be the jolly old bird that fell into his claws what dyou say mlud a deep growl issued from urthstripes cavernous chest i once knew a searat who could sing like a lark beautiful ballads he used to sing to his victims as he cut them up vermin are vermin no matter whative learned that much sapwood i cannot stand the sight of those two at my table any longer give them provisions and get them clear of my mountain ill feel easier when theyve gone the hare sergeant stood up and threw a salute yes sir ill hescort em ter the door persnally the forty odd hares who lived at salamandastron watched in silence as sapwood made his way down the table he nodded to mara and pikkle before turning to klitch and goffa hare you finished with your vittles you two klitch sniggered as he did an impression of the sergeants voice yes we have hactually the hare kept his face impassive and his voice level right ho then if youd hallow me to show you out brian jacques sojamandostron show them out mara placed a paw on sapwoods arm but these are my friends sergeant sapwood stood stiffly to attention avoiding her eyes lord urthstripe says they must leave dont worry missie theyll be given aversack rations and sent on their way unharmed come on foller me you two lively now goffa and klitch rose the latter smiling ruefully at mara well be fine dont bother your head about us i wish you luck with urthstripe goodbye mara maybe well meet again someday as sapwood led them the length of the dining hall mara could stand the tension no longer the badger maid knew that urthstripe loved and cared for her as she did for him but he was becoming like a dictator to her ruling her life saying how she should behave and conduct herself now in his usual heavypawed way he had insulted her newfound friends it was too much without thinking mara suddenly found herself shouting angrily over the hushed assembly at urthstripe go on send my friends away its your mountain you can do as you like and every beast has to obey every hare present jumped in their seats as the badger lords paws crashed forcefully on the tabletop mara go to your room but mara was already up and hurrying from the hall her mind finally made up as to what she would do i wont go to that room anymore im leaving this mountain to go with my friends and you cant stop me windpaw leaped up to intercept mara but urthstripe shook his head let her go pikkle dashed after his companion mara i say wait im comin with you when they had gone sapwood returned to his chair the tough hare gazed imploringly at urthstripe whose face was set in a stony stare at maras empty seat shes gone sir er an pikkle should i bring em back urthstripe looked away swiftly brushing a tear from his eye with a heavy paw no i must let her go she is not ppy here anymore big oxeye stood up the huge hare saluted his lord beg gin yer leave sah with or without permission from you me jfti old sappers here are goin ter follow em watch that they dont get themselves in some bally scrape or other keep an eye on em wot urthstripe grasped both their paws thank you my friends snatching a light throwing lance apiece from a weapon jack sapwood and oxeye set off at an easy lope on the track of mara and pikkle urthstripe went to his forge all that day vjfce mountain interior resounded with the pounding and bang ing of his forge hammers and chunks of red hot metal show red sparksas he battered them as flat as dead leaves hiding among the dunes to the south of salamandastron iqitch and goffa watched mara and pikkle getting nearer as ibey followed the trail klitch nudged his companion theyll be here any moiftent so listen dont you say a wordleave the talking to ifte my plan has worked well so far f goffa patted the two haversacks of food that lay nearby lyour father wont think so two bags o food isnt really l dgers treasure is it he flinched slightly as klitch elbowed him sharply in the if brains were acorns youd be a dead oak there was fcsneer in the weasels voice weve been inside the mounweve seen for ourselves meres about forty fighting s and urthstripe and theyre not there for nothing ill my tail theyre guarding a treasure now ive given feran extra move in the gameim providing him with a stage lord urthstripes own precious little mara we could ve done without that hare pikkle but if she wants to bring along the more the merrier ptne light of understanding dawned in goffas eyes foure right by the claw youre a clever one klitchwithout taking his eyes from the two approaching crea brian jacques salamandastron tures the young weasel muttered fiercely right goffa i am clever im smarter than farran dethbrush migroo or any of that deadheaded bunch thats why ferahgo allows me to spy for him but what my father doesnt realize is that hes getting old and im still young ill show him whos the more cunning one day soon stow it now here they are as mara and pikkle breasted the hill klitch feigned surprise he turned to them his open blue eyes shining happily mara pikkle what are you two doing here pikkle let his ears flop forward comically what ho you chaps two more recruits for your rovin band mara nodded agreement her face alight with the joy of freedom ive done it left salamandastron for good as you can see pikkle came with me hes my only friend klitch grasped her paw warmly well youve got two more good pals nowme and goffa well stick by you like true companions isnt that right goffa the ferret leaned on his spear echoing the words true companions mara could still see salamandastron rising tall and grim in the distance she looked away banishing thoughts of it from her mind taking in her immediate surroundings the badger maid quivered with delight they were in a small hollow amid the dunes basking in the heat of a fresh summer day beyond the grasstufted hilltops she could see a distant mountain range rearing up ahead of them it was framed majestically against a cloudless sky of vivid blue her heart sang within at the prospect of boundless freedom oh isnt it exciting klitch from now on pikkle and i are going to be just like you two traveling where we want sleeping beneath the stars eating when we feel like and no one to boss or push us around were free goffa pulled a face and grunted wheres yer food pikkle spread his paws chuckling ask mara the gallopin badger there she was in such a bally rush that she dashed off without a jolly crumb had to follow her of course so i didnt wait to stock up with tucker but here we are hale an hungry you never brought anything klitch looked concerned mara waggled her paws in a carefree manner no not a single scone still i suppose well find something goffa hefted his spear meaningly you mean you didnt even bring a weapon between you no weapons eh klitchs look of concern deepened pikkle sat and drew doodles in the sand who needs moldy ol weapons i mean i cant see enemies to fight with round here wot wot the blueeyed young weasel sat down beside him i wouldnt take it so lightly if i were you pikkle alone out in this country and unarmed you never know what might happen mara havent you got anything that could be used as a bribe something to buy your way with perhaps a piece of badger treasure badger treasure what dyou mean klitch mara was puzzled by the odd question the weasel shrugged as if it were not really important oh you know gold or silver trinkets medallions maybe or jewels and such i thought all badgers had some sort of treasure stowed away mara scratched her stripes thoughtfully hmm i cant recall ever seeing treasure at salamandastron can you pikkle me no not a bloomin bauble old gel klitch smiled shrewdly ill bet old urthstripe has loads of it hidden away somewhere but he wouldnt tell you about it mara oh no hed be more at home ordering and shoving you about like a slave i reckon that he thinks any treasure stowed away in the mountain is his and none of your business because youre too young to know about such things but forgive me you must be hungry well share our supplies with you lets have an early lunchyour first one as a free creature mara and you pikkle they gratefully accepted the wheatcakes cheese and apples from the packs that had been given to the weasel and the ferret pikkle fell upon the food with his usual good appetite brian jacques thats what friends are for wot jolly good chaps these two what dyou say mara m gel mara lowered her voice as she munched an apple youre right pikkle dyou know i dont feel as much of a young one as i used to be perhaps its because klitch treats us as equals and not underlings some of the things he said have made me think all that secrecy about not allowing other creatures inside the mountainmaybe urthstripe does have something to hide ill bet he does have a hidden treasure not that im bothered about it he can keep his moldy old treasure for all i care they missed the knowing wink that passed from klitch to goffa the weasel tossed the haversack across to mara here have some cheese help yourself friend the muted boom of the great joseph bell signaled the twilight hour over redwall abbey blackbirds song

him soundly on the head belt up an lissen frogsbum the storyteller continued his grisly tale then one night as the lightning was flashing and the thunder was crashing out boomz the beastly phantom came ahaunting into this very room brian jacques when up stood a young one pale as the ghost and to the spirit said how dare you moan round here at night and wake me from my bed the ghost sprang at him with a cry whoohoo ill eat you whole the pale mouse laughed as he replied youll need a great big bowl for i am martin the warrior the spirit of redwall whilst i protect this abbey youll eat nobeast at all the mice beneath the bed raised a cheer at the name of their hero hooray good old martin what did he do brother hollyberry stood drawing a long ladle from his habit sleeve then martin drew his trusty sword and chopped that ghost apart he sliced his nose he carved his ears he whacked its legs and head he chopped its claws he hacked its jaws then to the ghost he said be sure to brush up all your bits goodnight im off to bed applause and relieved laughter greeted the fitting end of the ghost of redwall creatures were settling down to await the next story when thrugann mischievously tossed a crust of jamsmeared bread into dingeyes lap and whooped oo dear look out its the ghosts tail oohoo the panicstricken stoat bowled thura and arula tip over tail as he leapt up startled it was some time before the laughter subsided and order was restored dingeye brushed the floor with his paws laughing nervously as he searched saiamandastron haha that werent no ghosts tail at all haha it

away beware the abbey then stay close beside the rampart wall await the moment when the flame of storm will strike my blade to aid the badger lord and bring back to redwall one day a guardian and a sword in the hush that followed brother hollyberry shook the sleeve of nasturtium who was sitting staring as if in a trance sister what is it are you all right she blinked and looked about her oh dear

upset over you look tired come on its bed for you in fact its bed for all you young uns too otherwise youll sleep right through nameday tomorrow an miss it that night samkim fell immediately into a deep sleep and dreamed a strange dream in the dream he was walking into great hall he went up to the huge tapestry hanging from the wall the likeness of martin the warrior seemed to stand out from the rest of the skillful weave he was clad in his armor holding his sword lightly and a friendly smile lit up his brave features without warning he tossed the sword it twirled once brian jacques in the air and sped from the tapestry burying its point in a crack between the stones at samkims side the young squirrel felt no fear without knowing why he withdrew the sword from the floor and held it out offering it back to the warrior of redwall martin took it though his lips did not move samkim could hear his voice squirrel mouseit makes no difference you are a redwaller samkim be brave and courageous true to your friends one day you will return my sword again and give this abbey another guardian beware the vermin seek out the white one thrugg crept up from the kitchens sleep did not come easily to the burly otter particularly with the knowledge that there was a huge pot of shrimp and bulrush soup flavored with watercress and hotroot pepper simmering gently on the embers of the kitchen fire thrugg could not rest until he had sampled it slipping down to the kitchen in his voluminous white nightshirt the big otter cut a curious figure he consumed two bowls of his favorite soup smacked his lips yawned and added more hotroot pepper to the pot before stealing off back to his bed crossing great hall he was surprised to see samkim the young squirrel stood illuminated by a shaft of moonlight in front of the tapestry thrugg had seen sleepwalkers before and he knew what to do strolling up he lifted samkim easily in his strong paws the young squirrel opened his eyes and stared at thrugg are you the white one thrugg glanced at his long white nightshirt and grinned aye thats me matey the white un samkim snuggled down in thruggs arms murmuring happily oh thats good i was seeking you he closed his eyes and went instantly into a deep sleep back at the dormitory thrugg deposited him gently in his bed strike me sails he aint no lightweight all that carryin has set me appetite off again ill just nip back down an see if n that there soup tastes better with the pepper i added the moon over the dunes made hollows of darkness against the duncolored sand which stood out in stark relief still radiating warmth from the hot day into the soft summer night at first feadle thought his eyes were deceiving him but as he peered into the moonshadowed dunes he distinguished the smartly dressed figure of klitch hurrying toward the camp filling his lungs with air feadle roared at the top of his voice master see its your son klitch and hes alone roused rudely from his slumbers the weasel chieftain hissed upward at the hapless sentry wormbrain couldnt you shout any louder to advertise our presence to the entire countryside sickear scrabbled for balance wakened by the sudden shout feadle steadied him as he whispered back in an exaggerated tone but master you said to let you know a wellaimed pebble struck him stingingly on the eartip followed by ferahgos voice heavy with contempt feadle you useless toad get down here sickear you stay up there and keep your wits about you the assassin sat with his son apart from the rest and out of hearing he nodded his head approvingly as klitch made his brian jacques report then commented i knew there was something to those tales of a hollow mountain and the badgers treasure but you say you didnt see any of it how dyou know its there you sly young fiend klitchs blue eyes twinkled in the darkness hah its there all right you old murderer that badger mara she let slip about it in conversation shed know where the treasure of salamandastron is hidden mark my words where is she now back in the dunes there with her friend a hare name pikkle goffas keeping an eye on them while im away no need to worry they were sleeping like babies when i left them to come here well done klitch now we know exactly where the mountain is the next question is how to get in there and grab the treasure klitch toyed with the sword that hung by his side it wont be easy ive told you the place is a fortress besides which theres more than twoscore of haresproper battletrained fighters not like the helpless creatures were used to but the main one is that badger lord urthstripe ive never seen a beast so big and fierce hes a real warrior id hate to have to go up against him ferahgos long skinning knife appeared under klitchs nose you leave him to me ive dealt with big badgers before oh theyre fierce fighters sure enough but they lack cunning and suffer from silly little things like honor and conscience now you get off back to your new comrades and guide them over this way to me theres more than one way of frying a frog off you go you young backstabber klitch vanished amid the nightwashed dunes unaware of the two shadowy forms at the side of a hill sergeant sapwood and big oxeye had followed him though they had not heard what passed between klitch and ferahgo they were not slow in realizing that the large vermin horde camped in the foothills spelled death and destruction the young weasel loped past the pair not knowing they were within a hairsbreadth of him oxeye hefted the light throwing lance feeling its balance as he eyed the receding klitch salamandastron dyou know i could pin the filthy little blighter through his neck from here even though the blinkin lights bad wot the sergeant restrained his friends throwing paw steady in the ranks youd blow the gaff now theres dirty work apaw weve got ter use our brainboxes i reckons if one o us reports back to lord urthstripe the other cn follow yonder weasel an watch out for new intelligence you go back ter the mountain and ill foller the weasel thats what like about you sarge oxeye chuckled goodhumoredly always ready to vote on a democratic decision wot big oxeye held up his paws defensively as sapwood crouched into a sparring position pax i was only jokin youre quite right of course ill go back an sound the jolly old alarm at salamandastron and you stick close to young pikkle an mara we both know this country like the backs of our paws shouldnt be any bother trackin one another if we need to make contact ok after a silent shake of paws they split up going their separate ways into the nightshaded dunes an early fly landed on maras eyelid she shooed it off with a dozy paw as she awakened to peachgold dawn stealing softly over the sleeping dunes the land lay in a pool of calm serenity the sand now still and cool awaited sunwarmed day somewhere a lark began trilling as it fluttered its morning ascent into the airy heights pikkle opened one eye and swiftly closed it again its no use tryin ter wake me up im fast a bally sleep the badger maid gathered a double pawful of sand and began trickling it onto the tip of her friends nose he sneezed and sat up straight his long ears springing to attention is it that late already by the fur my old tummyclock tells me there should be brekkers around hope its something nice wot goffa pulled himself upright on his spear haft you ate it all last night greedyguts brian jacques greedyguts yself sir pikkle brushed sand from his coat i didnt notice you stintin your belly when it came to puttin food in it matter o fact i began to think youd had news of a tenseason famine an you were packin it away just in case goffa scowled nastily testing his spearpoint you mind your mouth you great overgrown rabbit here here whats all this friends fighting already as klitch brushed past goffa he dug an open claw in his back and shot him an angry glance turning to mara and pikkle his eyes switched to open blue wonderment now then pals whats all the quarreling about no quarrel really pikkle laughed i merely made inquiries about breakfast old goffa mustve got out the wrong side of the sandhill this mornin he accused me of scoffin all the rations last night blinkin cheek do i look like a scoffer klitch go on be honest dont spare mfeelins the blueeyed weasel upended the empty haversacks actually you do pikkle but its no use falling out over it the point is that weve run out of food mara licked sand grains from her dry lips not even an apple and ive got a dreadful thirst she thought for a fleeting moment of the cool dark dining room inside the mountain the tables laid with plain wholesome food and flagons of cold cider greensap milk and mint tea thrusting the memory from her mind she looked around well i only know the country north and west of here its much the same as this mountains foothills dunes and sandhills running to the shores we wont find much food in that direction what about that way down south klitch shook his head thats the way we came up here theres a broad stream in the far south but between that and here theres a big area of swampland that we had to skirt the place is overrun with big toads and its a pretty bad bet id say pikkles stomach made a loud audible growl he patted it yes i know old lad but youll just have ter wait until we find some tucker come on chaps anybeast got an idea salamandastton which way we should go to relieve the jolly old pangs klitch winked at goffa i suggest we carry on into the foothills over to the east what do you think goffa foothills yeh good idea the ferret agreed readily mara looked east to the distant foothills with the mountain range rising green and grayish blue behind them do you think well find food there klitch the weasel patted her shoulder and started walking east its a good chance streams usually run down from mountains and stuff always grows by themplants roots berry bushes goffa followed klitch hes good at findin food pikkle gave mara a shove in their direction then whatre we waitin for lead us t the berrybushes chums food had been passed up to sickear in the lookout post it was not mucha pawful of berries a crust of bread and some waterbut he ate it gratefully saving a little of the water to bathe his clawed shoulder the hot summer morning wore on sickear rubbing his eyes to stay awake as he kept watch while below the lookout rock normal camp routine went on foraging and hunting parties came and went keeping away from salamandastron they moved south and stalked the swampland fringes for toads frogs and birds when these were not available there were always plants and roots though everybeast feared ferahgo there were one or two who doubted the wisdom of his trek north forgrin the fox and raptail the searat were two such creatures they carried the breadsack doling out stale bread to the horde a ferret named bateye knocked his crust of bread against a rock muttering complaints under his breath lookit this bread they calls it more like stone it is forgrin rooted about in the breadsack his voice mocking oh dearie me did yew ear that raptail pore ol bateyes bread aint fresh ang on a bit mate and ill see if theres any cake ere now which would yew like yer ighness the sort wi plums in or the cake wi cream atop of it brian jacques salamandas iron bateye raised his paw to fling the bread at forgrin yah shaddap yer grinnin idjit there was a whirring swish as ferahgos skinning knife zipped between forgrin and raptail to pierce the crust held in bateyes paw the blood drained from the ferrets narrow face as the assassin strode forward and picked up the knife with the crust fixed to its blade something wrong with your bread bateye the ferret sat staring up into the smiling blue eyes then shook his head in vigorous denial no master norra thing the breads jus fine thank yer excellent then lets see you eat it all up now ferahgo smiled wickedly holding the bread transfixed upon his knife as bateye tried to eat it under his gaze bateye was no longer young he had teeth missing and the rockhard dry crust cut his gums but he ate on doggedly too scared to stop ferahgo watched him intently and commented whats that noise has one of your teeth broken oh look its fallen out tuttut bateye you should have taken better care of those molars and cleaned them with a soft twig every morning still eating that bread will strengthen them what do you say bateye tried to speak around the knife blade and the stale dried bread filling his mouth but he was only able to produce a strangled noise i understand friend ferahgo nodded sympathetically youd like more forgrin raptail give me more bread out of that sack this poor ferret is still hungry forgrins jaw tightened at the wanton cruelty of ferahgo but he obeyed just as raptail was about to pass ferahgo the bread a stoat called dewnose came running up master sickear says to come quick hes spotted somethin that you should see flicking the blade from bateyes open mouth the assassin ran to the lookout rock and scaled it nimbly sickear moved over the perch to make room his claw pointing over there master its klitch an goffa with two others yes i see good work sickear but look can you see master just behind em in the hills theres a hare followin them hmm so there is i wonder if the badger knows were here or is that just a lone hare spying on us well soon find out pikkle shielded his eyes from the midday glare as he viewed the mountainous country before them oh corks how much farther do we go im absolutely whacked too much to eat last night pikkle thats your trouble klitch shook his head reprovingly look its not much farther now why dont you and mara rest here awhile with goffa and ill go on ahead and scout the land how does that sound pikkle flung himself gratefully on the ground absolutely tophole old lad you carry on bein the jolly intrepid scout and well flop down here mara did not argue she was glad of me rest goffa merely nodded to klitch and sat moodily some distance from mara and pikkle the badger maid rested her back against a rock and closed her eyes suddenly a voice nearby whispered urgently missie dont turn round stay has you are you an pikkle ave got ter get away from ere sharpish its a trap startled mara opened her eyes and leaned around the rock sergeant sapwood what are you doing here goffa sprang up he came dashing over spear at the ready wots goin on ere who are you talki sapwood leaped out in front of him poised for action with a yell the ferret thrust the spear forward sapwood neatly sidestepped kicking the spear adrift with his long hind legs goffa tried to make a grab for it but he was confronted by the champion boxing hare of salamandastron in swift succession two neat left pawhooks thudded to the side of his head followed brian jacques by a powerful straight right paw smack dab on his chin goffa crumpled to the ground senseless pikkle came dashing over puzzlement and concern on his face i say steady on sappers op boy sergeant sapwood seized him by the ear liddle blockeads theres a whole harmy of vermin jus over yon ill yore in a trap run for yore lives a yelling horde of ferahgos creatures came charging over the hill in front of them sapwood threw an imploring glance at mara then snatched his javelin from behind the rock and thrust it into her paws too late missie but run ymight ave a chance both of you ill lead em off the nameday celebrations at redwall abbey were in full swing early that morning they had started with the young ones marching round to the orchard where they were met by thrugg as there was no badger to challenge them the big otter had disguised himself striping his face black and white and garbing himself with dusty old gray drapes he shook a ladle at them as if it were a club and called out the challenge what want you here young beast young beast what want you here at my feast my feast two young mousemaids turzel and blossom stood forward they danced around thrugg as they chanted o stripedog great guardian some food for us all for we are good young ones who live at redwall

upon the abbess to open the feast he was pushed forward his head wreathed in a posy of flowers and a willow wand in his paw twice he forgot his words as he waved the wiilow wand but finally he plucked

old days the abbey badger was often called guardian it was usually a female badger like a great mother to redwallers she was why do you ask but the excitement of the feast had gripped samkim and he

promptly put two pawfuls into her soup and went at it with her eyes streaming not to be outdone thrugg added a full ladle of the pepper to his whereupon thrugann tipped the full peppersack over the top of her bowl with tears gushing from their reddened eyes both otters spooned away bravely until the abbess called out i declare a draw the winners thrugg and thrugann both otters bolted from the table and immersed their heads in an open cask of old cider amid the laughter from the tables the sound of thrugg and thrugann sucking in massive drafts of cider to cool their burning mouths could be heard all over the orchard brother hollyberry tipped both the bowls into his own and spooned the lot down without turning a hair his only commentbeing hmm this soup could do with a little more pepper

pace cut me a wedge of that great hall cake please toward the bottom of the table several baby mice and young hedgehogs had secreted a sizable fruit and cream trifle under the table they sat on the ground eating it with their paws out of the sight of older creatures who insisted on them using spoons and there was trifle everywhere mmm s better wivvout spoons heehee i cn eat it wiv all four paws lookit me by noon most creatures had deserted the festive board and were lying beneath trees and bushes all over the orchard dumble and the rest of the infants were snoring loudly in a hammock that sister nasturtium had strung between two ap pie trees samkim and arula joined brother hollyberry and friar bellows in the shade of a big old maple that grew in the south corner and hollyberry yawned and stretched as he settled down to his nap well samkim how are the two stoats enjoying nameday samkims halfopen eyes were trying to follow a large bee as it droned lazily toward the flowerbeds oh those two would you believe it brother theyre still at the table eating im sure they think theres going to be a famine huh talk about scoff theym woant be no gudd for ee games this evenin zurr arula stifled a giggle as she pointed to friar bellows the fat little friar was lying upon his back fast asleep snoring with his mouth wide open a spider on its thread was directly over his mouth hanging there it went into his mouth and blew out again each time he inhaled and exhaled they all i laughed silently not wanting to wake him i if n froir doant blow out ard enuff eell ave spider i pudden tјmara and pikkle dashed off as sapwood shot away in the opposite direction ferahgo and klitch headed the band that js had come over the hill they had lost the element of surprise brian jacques breaking into a charge when they heard goffa shout the assassin sized up the situation quickly as he breasted the hill immediately he called to his followers after the hare get the spythe other two are cut off running southward over the dunes mara and pikkle saw to their dismay two ferrets and a fox circling in on them ferahgo had sent them in behind on a wide sweep to take sapwood from the back and now they were heading straight for the two young ones as they closed in mara felt a fury rise within her they had been deceived by false friends hurriedly she breathed to pikkle passing him the javelin leave the fox to me you take one of the ferrets and well deal with the other one together the fox carried a pike he snarled at mara and came straight for her recalling sapwoods action she jumped to one side swept the pike away and struck out hard with both paws the fox was not expecting such aggression from a young female badger and there was a resounding crack as both of maras forepaws met solidly along the side of his jaw his eyes expressed surprise for a moment then turned up until only the whites were showing and the fox buckled and fell in a limp heap meanwhile pikkle ran straight for the two ferrets and laid the first one low by thwacking him hard between the ears with the javelin it did the trick wonderfully but the force of the blow snapped the weapon in two halves mara dashed in grabbing a pointed half she brandished it wildly growling in a dangerous manner come on pikkle lets see if this vermin can die like a warrior the ferret who was wielding a dagger lost his nerve completelytwo angry creatures with a broken javelin were closing in on him their eyes alight with battlefire with a shriek of fear he dropped the dagger and ran for his life mara picked up the dagger she was breathing heavily and snarling to herself try to stop me eh just lets see them try pikkles ears drooped in amazement good grief old gel i never realized you were such a swashbucklin warrioress salamandastron the young badger was trembling all over after her first experience of warlike action nor did i pikkle nor did i its a frightening thing to have the fighting blood of a badger running through your veins a burst of whooping and shouting from across the dunes announced that many more of ferahgos army were coming no time for gossipin now chum pikkle grabbed maras paw come on wed best make a run for ittheres too many for us to cope with by the sounds of that lot together they dashed off willynilly across the sandhills sapwood had run off in the opposite direction with the main pack hard on his heels the hare sergeant was an experienced campaigner and he put on a turn of speed that could not be equaled by his pursuers knowing that he could not keep running at that rate for any length of time glancing over his shoulder he saw that three frontrunners all weasels had broken away from the pack and were trying hard to catch up smiling grimly to himself sapwood dropped out of sight behind a dune mentally gauging their approach at exactly the right moment he sprang out in front of them paws at the ready before they could stop he had laid two of them flat one with a superb double frontpaw volley to the nose the other by lashing out with his long hindlegs and catching the weasel square under the chin the third he mistimed and dealt a glancing blow to the stomach as he turned to finish the job with a hooking leftpaw the winded creature swung out with his curved sword and gashed sapwoods paw heavily the rest of the hunters were too close now so sapwood gave a grunt of pain and took off swiftly ducking bobbing and dodging as he ran ferahgo and klitch stopped running and stood together on top of a dune ferahgo watching the main band chasing after sapwood he spat angrily into the sand hellteeth theyre no match for a running harehe could run and dodge at half that speed brian jacques and those oafs would never catch him how are the others doing klitch stood on tippaw scouring the dunes in the other direction i cant see them anywhere they should be able to catch em theres enough of ours chasing those two ferahgo slumped down and began thrusting his skinning knife into the ground in high bad temper its like ive always said if you want anything doing then do it yourself dont rely on others fools and clods klitch curled his lip scornfully i did all the spying me and goffa we brought them hereall you had to do was surround them you young whelp ferahgo stood up leveling his knife meaningly are you saying that it was me

spinney carried off the honors on the croquet lawn using his stick in place of a mallet turzel and blossom the brian jacques salamandas tron two small mousemaids teamed up with thrugann to win the

the air yurr et smells loik thunner an loitenen be due bremmun shook his head no its only nighttime arriving nay nay lissen ee maister bremmn the distant rumble of thunder proved foremoles instinct correct on the stillwarm evening air a heaviness began to settle and over to the east the sky lit up in a flash across the treetops of mossflower the little ones threw up their paws and began crying but sister nasturtium cheered them up with the suggestion of indoor games in great hall faith spinney seconded the idea come on now redwallers gather all this sporty gear up and take it to great hall ill see if i can manage to prepare some liddle goodies for supperhot honey n nutdip an cold strawbrry cordial from the cellars ows that the young ones raised a cheer and began collecting the equipment samkim and arula were about to carry in the bows and arrows from an archery butt that had been set up when bremmun gave them both a stern glance remember what i said about bows and arrows you two best leave them to me and keep temptation away from your paws get that big tug of war rope insidethatll be a help thunder boomed overhead and lightning cut the sky as drops of rain big as chestnuts began spattering down the equipment was all indoors and sister nasturtium and abbess vale were going about toweling small wet heads tudd spinny felt in his waistcoat pockets and checked his front headspikes oh wildflowers n weeds he tutted in annoyance i gone an left my glasses on the west wallsteps ill get soaked goin over there for em samkim stepped forward helpfully ill get your glasses mr spinney im already wet through from carrying sports gear in come on arula the rain was warm and heavy pouring straight down without wind or breeze to drift it samkim and arula skipped across to the west wallsteps splashing their paws in the puddles that were beginning to build up they found the spectacles where tudd had said they would be both young ones were enjoying the heavy rain walking slowly back to the abbey unafraid of thunder or lightning they held their heads back and caught the raindrops in their open mouths suddenly there was a massive bang of thunder overhead a long bright bolt of lightning struck the weathervane on the abbey roof and the entire scene lit up with an eerie light samkim and arula stared up at the high roof in awe as they walked toward the abbey gosh did you see that arula boi ecky oi did twere a big un aroight sankin there followed a whirring noise overhead fearing it was more lightning arula threw herself flat paws covering her head samkim shut his eyes tight as something zipped by him sssshhfifttt close by his side a sword had buried itself half its bladelength in the wet lawn he gasped with shock arula risked a glimpse through her digging claws wot whurr et more hghtenen samkim tugged the blade free it was this look arula from the red pommel stone to the tight black leatherbound handle and stout silver crosstree hilt the rain ran down the razorsharp edges through the runneled blood channel to a pointed tip keen as a midwinter blizzard they stared at the sword in awe it glittered and shone in the downpour reflecting a lightning bolt over the threshold in a shimmering gleam of whitefire samkim held it flat across both his paws the sword of martin the warrior mara and pikkle heard the thunder rolling in the east as they ran staggering and panting into the twilit dunes the troops irf ferahgo were still after them they had spent a long and brian jacques salamandas tron breathless afternoon being pursued sometimes hiding among the sandhills for a short breather other times running flat out across the hilltops with their pursuers in plain sight mara stumbled and fell gasping for breath and pikkle tried pulling her upright no she pushed him away you go on cant run any more hare can make it you go pikkle please pikkle stood shaking his head his narrow chest heaving not the done thing old sport fraid youre stuck with me wot then the rain started slowly at first but rapidly increasing to a fullfledged downpour thunder boomed overhead and lightning flashed across the dunes pikkle looked about brushing rainwater from his eyes he grinned what ho heres a bit of a chance see that high straight dune yonder look theres a sort of a thingummy a tiny scoopout like a cave at the top see that one with the long grass hangin down over it exerting all his strength he pulled mara upright nothin t lose old badgerbonce come on they skirted the hill and climbed it from the opposite side where it was not so sheer the rain lashed and battered at the pair as they crawled over the top and swung down into the small hole at the top of the dune little more than a ledge with a grass fringe hanging in front of it quickly they scooped it deeper until they were able to lie flat and regain their breath while peering out through the grass curtain in front of them the deluge had washed out all trace of their pawprints and night was gathering soon they could make out shapes and hear the voices of their hunters as they scoured the ground below did yer see em go this way sickear course i did i told yer well where are they now search me this rains messed everythin up ferahgos goin to be mad if we go back without em dont remind me come on you lot spread out an get lookin im soaked through aaahh pore ol you an i suppose

jawin like ol frogwives an start searchin in their hideout the two fugitives were snug and dry pikkle yawned quietly and whispered to mara well they wont find us tonight im goin to take forty winks wake me later an ill keep sentry all right mara nodded and settled down to watch ferahgos creatures after a while they moved away rebuking sickear for bad eyesight and false information mara listened to their voices as they faded into the dark and rain of the night hey migroo they migntve gone this way yah its too dark n wet to find anythin tonight tell that to the assassin or that sly little whelp e calls son just keep searchin dewnose thems the orders the rumbling of pikkle ffolgers stomach wakened him and he adjusted cramped limbs as he peered through the overhanging grass fringe into the blackness by the fur im famished have they gone yet mara plucked a blade of grass and nibbled on it theyre well gone why dont you try to forget your appetite and go back to sleep theres not much else we can do in our present position pikkle groaned his stomach gurgled like streamwater trav filing over stones mara ruffled his ears sympathetically well find food when it gets light you get some shuteye chum go on ill keep watchim still wide awake kicking out sand to make more space pikkle settled down rather grumpily after a while mara could tell by his steady brian jacques breathing that he had dropped off she rested her chin in her paws and mentally summed up their plight they were hunted creatures in strange country their only protection a hole in die side of a hill as for weaponry tiiey were slightly better off but not much a broken javelin and an old dagger food and water were nonexistent the rain and the night had provided cover for them both but she found herself longing for daylight and warm sun had sergeant sapwood escaped she fervently hoped that he had he could carry back news of their predicament to salamandastron no she was never going back there mara imagined the righteous justification of urthstripe and some of the elder hares had they not told her had she not been warned about vermin was she not a foolish young creature no definitely no but suppose sapwood had been captured it would be her duty to get back to the mountain and warn them of the impending menace the young badger maid cudgeled her brains weighing up the probabilities of their next move she felt responsible for pikkle he had deserted the mountain with her his loyalty and friendship were beyond question and no harm could befall him because of her gradually her eyelids began to droop she blinked halfheartedly welcoming the approach of slumber a rustling noise in the grass overhead caused her to come alert suddenly there was a malignant hissing noise and a narrow reptilian head poked its way into the hole eyes aglitter and tongue snaking out venomously maras paw felt about madly for the dagger as she came fully awake yelling pikkle wake up pikkle all activity within great hall had ceased redwallers crowded around the long table eager to catch a glimpse of the legendary weapon brother hollyberry reverently dried it with a soft cloth then it lay on the tabletop winking and shining in the lamplight outside the thunder rolled off into the distance and rain was still pattering thickly against the doors and windowpanes tudd spinney donned his spectacles and peered closely at the weapon the sword of martin the warrior it could be naught else samkim and arula had repeated the story of the finding several times over samkim could not resist touching the red pommel stone on the swordhandle as he repeated tudds words the sword of martin the warrior brother hollyberry took samkims face in both paws and stared into the young squirrels eyes and you say it fell from the skies are you sure young un this isnt just some piece of mischief you are dreaming up is it no brother honest arula tell him oh aye zurr sanken doant be atellen whoppers et be true well i for one find it all pretty hard to swallow brem brian jacques salamandastron mun snorted granted it is a beautiful sword and it might even be the very one that belonged to martin but swords dont just fall out of the sky like rain theres more to all this im sure listen samkim young fellow if this turns out to be some kind of joke tidying the infirmary up a bit will be nothing compared to the penalty ill impose on youand you too arula hold hard a moment bremmun before you say something that youll regret later i believe samkim sister nasturtium stepped forward her normally jolly face stern as she placed a paw upon samkims shoulder i think martin the warrior is making his presence felt in our abbey lately i have been saying strange poems and singing songs that i have never even heard beforemost of you have heard me if the spirit of redwall is trying to tell us something then the least we can do is listen abbess vale lifted her gaze from the shining weapon i agree with you sister brother hal as abbey recorder and historian i want you to examine the past records of redwall there are many lessons to be learned from the past and i have no doubt that the old writings will provide a clue to tonights strange events you may start first thing tomorrow morning meanwhile we shall lay the sword in front of our great tapestry close to the picture of martin as for the nameday celebrations it is getting rather late i suggest we abandon the indoor games a wail of protest arose from the young ones but the abbess silenced them with a wave of her paw as she continued tomorrow the weather will most likely be fine so the games can be held outdoors all day is that a satisfactory solution the wailing was quickly replaced by shouts of joy thrugg slapped his rudderlike tail upon the floor righto me earties off to your bunks an get snorin brother hal felt the furrow on his head that samkims arrow had made some time before he smiled ruefully and caught samkim and arula as they passed on their way upstairs you young rogues never mind ill clear up all this mystery for you im going straightaway to my study to take a delve into my records and ill work through the night if i have to dont worry now those ancient scrolls should provide an answer by morning then you can concentrate on the nameday games tomorrow hows that thanks brother hal youre a sport samkim shook him energetically by the paw aye thankee zurr etll stop bremmn ashouten at usns brother hal smiled at them as they scampered off to the dormitory good night young uns dingeye woke shortly before dawn he was pleasantly surprised to find himself feeling quite chipper leaning over he shook thura hoi mucker are you all right thura sat up and felt his stomach then checked his head by the ellteeth mucker i feels like a newborn stoat brother hollyberry muttered in slumber and settled deeper into his armchair dingeye held up a cautionary paw ssshh we dont want ter wake ol sleepychops up come on lets get out o this affirmary

brother hal sat sipping cold mint tea amid a welter of faded parchments and yellowed scrolls he scratched at the furrow in his headfur as he scanned a barkpaper manuscript from the time when old abbot saxtus was a young mouse the sword of martin the warrior has been returned to its rightful home redwall abbey today rufe brushtail our champion climbing squirrel took the weapon and climbed to the very point of the abbey roof there he has secured the sword to the north pointer of the weathervane so will martins sword rest there in peace as his spirit guides our abbey it is my fervent hope that redwall lead a calm and tranquil existence and that the sword never has to be brought down within my lifes seasons hal sat musing as he pondered over the text hmm dark night thunder rain storm thats it he leaped up spilling mint tea over his habit the big lightning bolt samkim said that it struck the weathervane shortly before he found the sword of course the lightning blasted the sword from the weathervane it slid down the roof and fell point first by the fur from what that young un says its a good thing he never moved a pace to the right falling from that height the blade would have cleaved him in two the two stoats had found the archery equipment disdaining the rounded targets they took a bow apiece and began firing arrows upward at the high beamed ceiling of great hall neither was very good at archery yah boggleyes you cant even hit the ceilin thats cos i was brought up in poverty mucker my ol mum never could afford bows n arrers ho shut up snotnose if you ever ad a mum she shouldve tried to shoot yer with a bow n arrer for winjin an scrinjin wowee lookit thatn go betcher that gets the ceilin never look out its comin down on us they leapt out of the way and the arrow landed

bow to its capac iry this is the way ter do it mucker dingeye breathed exitedly now lerrit go straight it should go right across this ј all over the passage an right up the stairs ready fire brother hal came racing down the stairs waving the parchjooent as he muttered to himself triumphantly ha solved illi isfaow old bremmun that swords dont fall out of the sky with ibe rain theres an explanation for everything the records lfhove that hoho just wait until young samki the illtimed shaft came zipping out of the darkness and itself in brother hals throat he gave a small gurgling fei to me flqq jn

name he waved the great sword aloft this is treasure riches i tell yer there aint another weapon like this in in nowhere in a very short time dawnlight was beginning to streak the eastern sky the two stoats sneaked from the abbey and let themselves out by a small wicker gate set in the south wall then they dashed across the open sward and vanished into the fastnesses of mossflower woods unfortunately samkim was awake by the first light of day he could not remain in bed with the thought of the previous evenings events he had to see the sword again to reassure himself he had not been dreaming arula was still snoring as he tippawed from the dormitory and made his way downstairs samkim was in such a hurry that he stumbled over brother hals body and fell with a cry of horror he rolled over and leapt to his feet only to trip and fall again the bowstring had become tangled in his footpaws he extricated himself and stood up holding the bow friar bellows was up at his usual time to start preparing breakfast for the abbey dwellers he came bustling down the stairs and froze to a stop on the bottom step his plump face a mask of horror standing in front of him was samkim with a bow in his paws and close by lay brother hal with an arrow through his throat the friar sat down on the stairs with a bump his voice hoarse with disbelief samkim what have you done sakmumdas tron windpaw bound sap woods injured paw with a poultice of soothing herbs and a woven ryegrass wrapper urthstripe strode up and down the forge cavern like a demented beast though the sergeant had told his tale several times the badger lord kept roaring out a steady stream of questions did they capture mara or didnt they i dont think so sir i gave em the old runabout sos young mara an pikkle could hescape em cant you give me a straight answer sergeant did they or didnt they who was their leader how many of them are there sapwood shook his head despairingly as he glanced at windpaw catkin starbob seawood and big oxeye all the hares knew that urthstripe had thrown reason to the winds oxeye stood between sapwood and urthstripe milord i suggest y leave sapwood alone like me hes told you all he jolly well can workin yourself into a tizzy aint goin to help if y dont mind me sayin so we all know that before the seasons much older meres goin to be a vermin horde knockin on our front door

the strong but he had no need to worrythe badger lord patted his paw lightly thank you oxeye you are right sapwood old friend hows your paw coming along bandage or no bandage hi can still punch me weight sir urthstripe nodded approvingly good now lets get things organized oxeye starbob catkin take your patrols and seal up all entrances except the front windpaw seawood check that the mountain is fully provisioned and see to the waterbarrel levels sapwood you come with me well get together some weaponry to provide a warm reception for whatever scum come visiting i hope that klitch and his pal are among themid enjoy meeting them again so the fortress of salamandastron started gearing itself up for war ferahgo was readying his horde to march upon salamandastron by midmorning of the next day forgrin the fox and raptail the rat were seeing to their weapons forgrin was using a flat rock to grind a new point upon his long rapier raptail was fletching his arrows with leaf flights as they worked the two creatures conversed in low tones keeping silent whenever ferahgo or klitch was near dyou know why were attackin this badger mountain mate i mean whats the real reason behind it yer not supposed to ask that forgrin the chief sez itd make a good fortress for us ter use as a base the fox licked his paw and tested the point of his rapier huh he must think were all as dimwitted as migroo

male though just atwixt you n me ive kept me lugs ter the ground and i thinks theres some kinda treasure at the bottom o this stow it ere comes trouble ferahgo and klitch walked by and the two soldiers kept their heads down working busily at their weapons the assassin flashed a dangerous smile and nodded his approval klitch pawed his short sword looking about impatiently weve lost the edge of surprise this army should have moved quicker urthstripe will be ready and waiting for us tell me when are you going to make your move ferahgo played with the gold badger medal hanging around his neck patience my young backstabber patience when migroo and his hunters get back then we march but why wait for migroo and the others we could leave signs for them to follow ferahgo seated himself on a rock and stared upward his eyes becoming bluer as they reflected the clear skies above what a beautiful summer morning after last nights heavy storm my son do you see how wonderfully clear the air is i like to clear the air before i do anything have you noticed a few grumblings and rumblings amongst my army of corpsemakers i have when migroo returns with the rest depending on whether or not he has captives with him ill use him as a shining example or a warning either way ill instill some loyalty into those who murmur behind my back youll see hah so you say old one klitch snorted and stalked off moodily ferahgo smiled mockingly as he called after him with age comes wisdom hotheads are ten for a crust young one at high noon a stoat named doghead called down from the lookout post migroo an the huntin gang comin in from the south master ferahgo tapped goffa lightly on the side of his heavily swollen face the ferret winced and cringed laid out by an unarmed hare eh youre a bright one get klitch and muster salamandastron die army together for a march by the time migroo and his hunters reached camp the entire horde was gathered in one place among the rocks ferahgo stood apart from them his eyes as dangerous as thin blue ice on a deep spring lake ho there migroo whereve you been the stoat was not the brainiest of creatures he stood scratching his head as he pondered the odd question chasin the badger an the hare chief like you told us to ferahgo smiled indulgently he was enjoying this no no youve got it wrong migroo i never said chase them i said capture them and bring them back here right the stoat was beginning to feel nervous he swallowed hard thats right chiefcatcher em an bring them back ere thats wot you said the assassins smile swept around the watching horde he let the tension build a little then shrugged carelessly well i dont see a badger and a hare do you migroo the stoat backed off holding out his paws pleadingly arr now chief we wasnt to blame we tracked em arf the day an all night through the dunes in the dark an the storm we tried chief onest we did but they just vanished in the night when the rain was eavy eeeeyahhhh ferahgos skinning knife had moved like lightning migroo was writhing on the ground clutching the side of his head the warlord wiped his blade on migroo as he stepped over him when he spoke to the horde he did not raise his voice but everybeast heard each word distinctly when i give an order i expect it to be carried out migroo here was lucky he only lost an ear the next one who disobeys me will lose his head oh i know some of you think ferahgo is getting old here he winked at klitch or ferahgo is losing his grip some of you even think ferahgo is going deaf so you gossip behind his back ferahgo smiled at forgrin and raptail they blanched visibly as he continued let me tell you corpsemakers because who knows about me better than myself i am ferahgo the assassin scourge brian jacques salamandastron of all the southwest lands or wherever i choose to set my claw i was murdering and skinning when most of you were milkslopping babes nobeast can outsmart outfight or outwit me now i am leading you against a mountain fortress to do what you do best fight and fight you will and bleed and die if i say so you will either end up wealthy and wellfed or cursing the day you were born the assassin leapt onto a nearby rock and twirled his daggers until they flashed like wheels of light in the sun his blue eyes twinkled like brilliant twin pits of evil as he threw back his head and roared death to the enemies of ferahgo spears lances knives swords pikes and bows sprang into the air as the rocks resounded with a fearsome chant that ripped from the throat of each corpsemaker ferahgo ferahgo death death ferahgo as the evil reptilian head pushed its way into the tiny cave mara searched frantically for the dagger but could not find it pikkle ffolger did wakened by maras shout the startled hare rolled onto the dagger and its point stuck sharply into his rear with an agonized yell pikkle leaped forward butting into the reptiles head it fell backwards with pikkle clinging to its neck locked together both creatures tumbled out of the cave yelling hissing snarling and spitting they halffell halfrolled down the steep side of the high dune throwing caution to the winds mara jumped after pikkle she landed with a thud in the sand below and was immediately assailed by the tail of a yellowbellied sand lizard the creature had its claws locked in pikkles fur while the young hare had it in a good headlock neither would release their grip as they shouted and snarled fiercely at each other wah lemmego you slimy old reptile gitcha paws off rabbit ksss rabbit yself you let me go an ill let you go kkssss nan nah

with lizard nomore kksss the beauty of the soft golden summer morning following the previous nights storm was lost on the inhabitants of redwall abbey nameday sports had been canceled and sadness and shock hung like a shroud over everything samkim sat alone in the infirmary numb with disbelief was poor brother hal actually dead who had done the awful deed the young squirrel knew nothing of what went on outside the infirmary as he had been hastily escorted up there by friar bellows and abbess vale immediately after being discovered by the brothers body bow in paw they had made him promise to stay put and speak to nobeast until investigations were under way while the redwallers took their breakfast outside on the lawn a meeting was convened in cavern hole in the smaller more intimate surrounding of the room that was separated from great hall by a downward flight of steps the abbess foremole hollyberry bremmun and nasturtium gathered to discuss events bremmun pushed away his untouched breakfast friends it staggers belief brother hal dead where is young samkim now abbess vale held up a paw for silence he is confined to the infirmary now bremmun we are all as shocked and salamandostron saddened by hals death as you are but please let us not say anything in haste or jump to conclusions that we may be sorry about later so has anybeast got something to tell us that we do not already knowand let me add we know little or nothing of what took place except that poor hal is no longer with us sister nasturtium spoke up i cannot contribute any evidence mother abbess but i must say what i feel in my heart i do not think that there is a single redwaller who believes that samkim would be so careless as to endanger anothers life it would be horrible to even think of accusing him the abbess folded her paws into wide habit sleeves i agree with you sister and no one has accused him yet bremmun disagreed friar bellows told me that when he found samkim standing over hal with a bow in his paws he said to him samkim what have you done brother hollyberry interrupted bremmun aye and the young un didnt say a word it was as if he was struck dumb by the shock of it all but i have something to tell that may throw some light on things those two stoats dingeye and thurahas anybeast seen them this morning because they werent in their beds when i woke up foremole stood up decisively hurr then youm guddbeasts stay yurr whoil oi gon foind em mayap they do know sumthern vermin bremmun ground his teeth aloud the abbess rapped the tabletop sharply bremmun there you go again i can see you are ready to condemn dingeye and thura without any proof or evidence this must stop instantly redwall has a reputation for goodwill justice and fair play we are here to uphold it bremmun made a shamefaced apology to save him further embarrassment hollyberry opened a parchment upon the table frair bellows gave me this it was in brother hals paw they read the record written down long seasons ago and by simple process of deduction came to the same conclusion that hal had brian jacques saiamcmdastron nasturtium spoke for them all well now we know how the sword of martin was found by samkinthe lightning tore it from the weathervane and it fell to earth to what purpose i wonder foremole came trundling back in shaking his head everybeast be asearchen for they stoaters but yurr this marthens gurt swoard be gone too oi spect enfurmation any moment naow bremmuns angry voice broke the shocked silence the great sword of martin the warrior gone those filthy thieving vermin theyll pay dearly for this when we lay paws on em why id like to indignant voices joined the squirrel until the abbess rapped the tabletop sharply to restore order silence please she held up a paw we wont get anywhere shouting and threatening there was a knock upon the door and tudd spinney entered mornin to ye all sorry i cant say good mornin cos its not foremole did you check all the wallgate locks last night foremole nodded vigorously oi allus do maister wiout fail tudd shook his walking stick i knew ye did cos youre a good v thorough feller well ive just checked the wallgates an the east one is unlocked in the silence that followed foremole ticked off further information on his paws burr hurr an food fer young uns is gone from gurt all an thurr be arrers asticken in table an sporty quipment tossed all oer the place abbess vale stood up as soon as we have laid brother hal to rest in the grounds we will organize a party to search for the stoats and bring them back here now i must go straightaway to samkim to tell he has nothing to reproach himself for hell need some comforting after the death of poor hal but arula had been listening at the keyhole and was already on her way to the infirmary the midmorning sun shone down brightly on a sad little ceremony in the grounds of redwall abbey brother hal was laid to his final rest amid much mourning there were wreaths and posies of wild flowers and small tokens from his friends thrugann reverently placed a small quill pen in tribute to the recorder of the abbey and baby dumble put his favorite straw mousedoll alongside it on the neat heap of earth surrounded by brightly colored pebbles mrs faith spinney recited a few lines your seasons have run their course old friend in your goodlife we were proud to take part but in springtimes unborn and summers to come you will live in each redwallers heart while the ceremony took place at the west lawn a rope snaked downward from a firstfloor window at the east side of the abbey building samkim and arula were down on the ground in a twinkling and running for the east wallgate beside a haversack of provisions apiece samkim carried a quiver of arrows and the bow that had fired the shaft which struck brother hal down arula had a big pruning knife and a sling with a pouch of pebbles they opened the small wallgate quickly and let themselves out into the leafy depths of mossflower woods after the ceremony brother hollyberry and the abbess made their way up to the infirmary the abbess dried her eyes on a spotted kerchief oh brother i can understand how poor samkim was too upset to attend brother hals last resting well maybe it will be some consolation to him that weve recommended his name to thrugg as a member of the search party for those t two stoats the infirmary door was wide open hollyberry entered looked around the empty room and picked up a pillowcase with a badly scrawled charcoal message written on it brian jacques the stoats are the ones what did it we will fetch them back and the sword too tell friar bellows it was not me do not worry me and arula will be all right samkim the abbess produced a kerchief and wiped her eyes hollyberry they may be in danger we cannot let them go alone the old infirmary keeper took the kerchief and dried vales eyes we have to i feel that the sword of martin did not fall from the roof to land at samkims side for nothing he is marked by destiny and the sign from our abbey spirit call off the search party vale let us put our trust in two young friends and martin the warrior the sun started its inexorable descent into the horizon far out to sea at the close of a long hot day the sky remained cloudless salamandastrons monolithic rock took on a somber purple aspect against the dusty fawn of the darkening shoreline hares of the long patrol watched from the top of the crater armed and alert each one silently surveyed the torchlit horde advancing steadily through the dunes myriad pinpricks of light like a river of stars fallen to earth were separating in the distance like the horns of some great animal closing in to surround the mountain ferahgo the assassin was coming to salamandastron a young female hare named pennybright swallowed nervously as she fidgeted with the string of her bow big oxeye patted her gently as he passed steady in the ranks there penny he moved on to another youngster shorebuck who was sorting out his best slingstones oxeye nodded approvingly thats the ticket young feller first battle is it yes sir ive decided to choose good stones an give a good account of mself to those vermin oxeye grinned did the same mself when i was a nipper like you dyou think theyll take long gettin here sir shorebuck tested his sling with an experimental twirl salamandastron dont fret laddie when they do ill be right by your side shorebuck relaxed slightly comforted by the veteran fighters presence keeping his eyes on the advancing lights he murmured no sign of lord urthstripe yet where dyou suppose he is oh hell be around somewheres gettin ready an whatnot stay awake now supper should be round any moment now ydont want to miss that wot oxeye moved on around the vantage points murmuring encouragement his solid presence radiating calm and good humor to the fighters of the long patrols inside the mountain stronghold of salamandastron passageways hewn through the living rock led off caves and chambers some were lit by torches others illuminated from window slits giving the entire place the air of some vast primeval warren at the end of one such corridor a large rock slab had been rolled aside and lantern light cast a warm glow upon the smooth stone face of the chamber where urthstripe stood this was the place where he sought solitude when his mind was troubled all around the walls the record and history of salamandastron and its badger lords was depicted in intricate carvings brocktree spearlady gorse bluestripe the wild ceteruler the wise boar the fighter sunstripe the mace they were all there it was a place of mystery heavy with the ages of badger lore urthstripe set the lantern on a ledge and picked up a fine pointed chisel selecting a clear space on the flat rock wall he began carving the likeness of himself into the stone as he cut skillfully into the rock he reached into his forge apron and produced a pawful of herbs these he sprinkled over the flameheated sides of the lantern soon the cave was filled with a swirling gray smoke that carried with it a smell of autumnal woodlands the badger lord began chanting the words forming in his mind as he gouged trancelike at the wallstone seas and lifespans ebbing flowing past and future merge as one brian jacques mountain rulers coming going seasons future seasons gone badger warriors from the shades stand beside me guide my paw o wise lords and gentle maids restrain my rage preserve our law sergeant sapwood left off stacking lances at a concealed window slit on the lower level he accepted the bowl of hot mushroom and leek soup from a small wiry hare who carried two short swords strapped across his shoulders together they sat on the windowledge and took supper watching the seemingly endless torchlight procession flooding from the dunes into the moonless night sapwood blew on his soup to cool it his strong face expressionless do you think they ope ter scare us thistle bart thistledown of the westshore thistledowns stared languidly down his long aristocratic nose at the lights bobbing and flickering in two prongs toward the mountain actually it all looks rather pretty doncha think sap though if i were those flippin vermin id be gettin a good nights sleep instead of paradin round like a flock of fireflies goin courtin darnfools if yask me old fellow cor you talk luvly thistle sapwood chuckled admiringly yer a cool one all right hi say that for ye thistledown sniffed disdainfully bad form t get ones ears in an uproar over vermin wot klitch shook his head in disapproval well if they didnt know we were coming before they certainly know now all these torchesits foolish ferahgos blue eyes twinkled in the torchlight theyll see us all right i want them to cant you see its a show of strength each of our creatures is carrying two torches and that makes it look like double our numbers also they can see the torchlights but from this distance they dont know if were foxes or frogs ferrets or toads big or small badly or sahmandastron well armed that will have them guessing and worried too they know were here but they wont see us now watch this my young and still wet behind the ears son ferahgo gave a piercing whistle and upended both his torches in the sand extinguishing them immediately every member of the horde followed his example all around salamandastron the lights went out as if by magic now they know were here but they cant see us ferahgo settled down in the sand grinning with satisfaction we can sleep until dawn but theyll have to stay awake and alert klitch dumped his torches head down in the sand i still think its a stupid move ive told you these are trained fighters they know all the tricks in the book of the two weasels klitch was to prove right right chaps an chapesses lights out an heads down wot big oxeye had caught on to ferahgos plan as he watched from the crater top he tossed aside his sling scornfully huh they must think we came ashore in buckets brainless buffoons seawood post six sentries the rest of you can get a bit of jolly old shuteye until dawn lantern shadows flickered around the hidden cave as the badger lord stirred his powerful frame the smoke from the herbs had cleared away and urthstripe rubbed his eyes and yawned as if coming out of a deep sleep casting aside the chisel he picked up the lantern and held it close to the wall where it illuminated the fresh carvings the badger lords gruff voice echoed around the cave as he translated the pictures aloud two badgers this small oneits my mara im sure this other one is it me no it cannot be i have stripes he has none the mountain lords eyes clouded over he shook his head as halfforgotten images flitted through his mind strange a badger without stripes without stripes he blinked turning his attention back to the wall brian jacques whats this vermin eyes yes theyre the eyes of vermintwo pair probably weasels the round thing between them is it the moon or the sun no it has carving on but i cannot see it is too small and fine ah here is a sword the weapon of a warrior and here am i urthstripe lord of salamandastron next to the figure of urthstripe a few lines were written in badger rune he narrowed his eyes studying them faintheart shall be made strong but a warriors fate for the mountain lord blue eyes brings battle ere long whilst the maid comes of her own accord the mount shall be ruled by badger kin the sword shall make mossflower free the abbey will take its guardian in far from this rock by the sea urthstripe stood tall his brooding eyes alight with the knowledge of his own fate he felt as though the heavy paw of destiny had touched him but the thought of a coming war seemed to obliterate all feelings of sadness or fear sapwoods voice cut into his thoughts as it boomed hoilowly along the chamber passage its three hours t dawn sir those vermin are all haround us surroundin the mountain everybeast is in position waitin on your word shall hi tell em yore comin sir the badger lord unfastened his forge apron they will see me in the hour of dawn sergeant and i will see them then we will take a look at this vermin horde in good plain morning light lay out my armor helm sword and spear dingeye and thura headed south through mossflower woods they had a good head start and made the most of it knowing that once brother hals body was discovered together with the loss of the sword pursuit by the creatures of redwall would be inevitable the forest was tall green and silent save for the rustle of leaves and trill of birdsong dingeye had been forging ahead slashing and chopping at fem and nettle with his newly acquired weapon as midday drew near thura was lagging noticeably his companion wiped the blade of the wondrous sword on his sleeve as he waited impatiently for him calling back through the serried columns of treetrunks move yerself mucker cummon stir yer stumps stoatnose thura wiped his brow leaning against an oak he breathed heavily ive got t rest ding dont know wots wrong wi roe i feels all done in mustve been that bath they made me take dingeye sneered and took a swipe at a passing butterfly with the sword admiring the flashing green lights as its blade glinted in the sunlight filtering through the emerald canopy gam i got bathed too an it didnt urt me now get yer paws amovin or ill leave yer beind urry up brian jacques thuras face was an unhealthy grayish pallor his limbs trembled and sweat beaded on his nosetip as he stumbled to keep up calling out to his comrade slow down mucker you wouldnt leave me ere ter be catchered by that lot from redhall ere carry the vittles an ill be able to get along a mite better carry vittles dingeye pulled a lip and slashed moodily at a young rowan tree huh not likely you took em you carry em ive got me paws full luggin this ere sword around tell yer wot though well stop awhile an ave lunch thatll make less food ter

ignoring thuras pitiful state lissen we cant stop ere too long theyll be on our trail by now still weve escaped before an we cn do it again well stick to this forestits bettern flatlands more cover thura curled into a ball shivering uncontrollably his teeth chattering and his tail quivering fitfully dingeye stopped eating and prodded him hah yer wobblin about like a baldy beetle there just look

you stop ere awhile till yer feelin better i wont go too fast so that ycan catch up with me still receiving no reply from his companion he set off into the forest traveling south and slightly west talking aloud to solamandos iron reassure himself must be somethin hes et greedy of toad probiy catch me up ter night when e gets hungry again the trial of the two stoats was not difficult to follow samkim and arula could see plainly the slashed and damaged vegetation which dingeye had hacked at with the sword despite the urgency of their mission neither of the two young ones could help noticing the beauty of mossflower draped in summer green and studded with small islands of color from flowering bush and shrub their paws made little or no sound as they padded along over the carpet of soft brown leaf loam samkim pointed ahead to where a strip of bark had been wantonly sliced from the trunk of a white willow exposing the pale sapped wood beneath easy to see which way they went look at that arula nodded urr foremoled tan thurr ides for doen that to a livin tree ho urr theym surely two nastybeasts samkim touched the trunk noting the dampness of sap on his paw if we travel a little faster we may catch them up by late afternoon they cant be too far ahead come on arula no need to worry young redwallers hen heh heh the thin reedy voice had come from nowhere samkim and arula halted staring at the leafy screen about them the voice spoke again worry hurry thats all some creatures do no time to live to a ripe old age look at mei cant count the summers ive seen and im fit as a flea heh heh heh samkim fitted an arrow to his bowstring show yourself a bed of tall ferns stirred and a woodvole stepped into view he was small and thin dressed in a long smock of brown barkcloth and his face was framed by the biggest white beard they had ever beheld on any creatureit fuzzed out like a cloud and only his bright black eyes were visible through it the woodvole laughed and cut a little caper he was astonishingly agile for such an ancient creature heh heh heh you can put the bow down im not going to hurt you redwaller how do i know youre a redwaller brian jacques easy you talk with the accent of an abbeydweller im furgle the hermit i live here all alonealways have done cant stand the company of any creature for too long prefer my own i suppose youre tracking the two stoats who came by here earlier youm seen em then zurr furgle did an angry little dance around arula why cant moles ever learn to speak properly seen them of course i did two evil smelly vermin slashing away at my woods as if they owned them you dont need to hurry to catch thoi two though samkim bowed politely to the hermit my name is samkim this is arula you are right of coursewe are both from redwall abbey why do you say that we have no need to hurry furgle waited until samkim had unnotched his arrow because one of them is very ill he wont go much further ive never been ill a day in my life come on then redwallers ill go along with youi know mossflower better than you ever will by the oak and the ash ill give that stoat a piece of my mind when i meet him how dare he go about chopping up my woodlands without further ado the woodvole set off in a short while both samkim and arula were having difficulty keeping up with the energetic pace he set an hours swift journey found them on the edge of a clearing arula sighted thura lying curled up lookum oer thurr ee must be the sick un wait furgle restrained them both from running over to thura you can never tell with vermin give me an arrow samkim well see if hes sick or shammingbetter careful than careless i always say generally to myself though furgle snapped the point from the arrow and tied a pad of leaves in its place then returned it to samkim fire that at the creature young squirrel samkim shot the shaft perfectly it thudded against thuras back and bounced off onto the grass the stoat made no move salamandastron as i thought hes finished the hermit nodded knowingly the two young ones dashed over to the body furgle was right thura was freshly dead samkim rolled the stoat over dead i cant believe it only yesterday he was as lively as you or i humm eem dead aroight deadern ee black acorn arula scratched her head with a huge digging claw furgle pulled them away from the body dont get too closethat stoat died of some form of fever or ague well it was nice meeting you but now i must go about my business if you are going to bury him then do it quickly but try not to touch him er sorry theres some urgent business i must attend to see you later goodbye in the twinkling of an eye he had vanished back into the depths of mossflower samkim and arula stood looking at each other slightly disappointed at furgles abrupt departure burr yon owd un doant ang about do ee samkim shook his head not the action of a true forest dweller id say still i suppose he had his reasons now well bury this one and track his friend dingeye huh some friend leaving his pal here to die like that cant see the sword anywheredingeye must have it arula where are you the little molemaid was swiftly excavating a tunnel beside thuras body a shower of dark earth flew upwards as she dug in with powerful blunt claws before long she vanished into the hole and the ground trembled and heaved alongside the dead stoat samkim blinked with surprise as she emerged from the ground nearthuras ears arula dusted herself down thurr that be done jus tipm in with ee bow sanken samkim levered the body over with his bow it plopped onto the tunnel top and the earth gave way arula covered it with the earth she had pushed out from the excavation best oi cn do fer ee pore stoater tho eem wurra bad lot though the lunch at redwall had only been a light summer salad and some blackberry scones friar bellows found him brian jacques salamandastron self weary and perspiring he left the abbey kitchens and went to sit out by the pond where it was

stucked on is face at the main gate wantsa see you muvva the abbess pried dumble free from her gown yes yes dumble now go and play like a good little dormouse ill be down as soon as i can however

coming such a long way come with me and ill see youre fed and rested mrs spinney would you take over here with brother hollyberry while i see to our visitor seated in the privacy of the abbesss room furgle took elderberry wine and plumcake with relish when he had satisfied his hunger he turned to the abbess with a look of concern upon his face you look like a sensible lady abbess ive got something serious to say to you so listen carefully vales paws plucked nervously at her sleeve is it samkim or arula oh please mr furgle tell me that theyre all jght brian jacques the hermit refilled his beaker with the dark red wine oh theyre fine madam just fine its the stoat ive come to tell you aboutone of the two that were here at redwall this very day at sometime before noon he dropped dead ive gone over all the possibilities on the way to your abbey im certain now by the look of that creature he died from dryditch fever the abbesss paws knotted into the hem of her sleeve and her eyes were wide with fright as she breathed the terrible name dryditch fever are you sure mr furgle the woodland recluse nodded his head sadly i wish i werent abbess but its dryditch fever all right mara was awakened by something heavydescending upon her the air was filled with wild gleeful croaking as she tried to stand but fell flat with the smothering weight her voice sounded muffled as she called out whats going on pikkle wake up beside her she felt pikkle stirring into action phwaw i say whats apaw this thing stinks mara managed to push him flat she lay still a moment as she tried to make some sense of the situation instantly it became clear and the icy paw of fear gripped her they were both enveloped in the meshes of a sprawling net fashioned from tough dried reedgrass and weighted all around with boulders through the small apertures she could see literally hundreds of large toads the slimy creatures were waddling and hopping about in a primitive victory dance their baggy throats puffing and swelling as they croaked a horrid tuneless chant most of them were armed with tridents or a curious type of flail with stonetipped thongs the sand lizard swinkee leaped triumphantly forward brandishing the dagger and broken javelin that had been their only weapons thrusting his leering face close to the net he l brian jacques salamandastron slithered his tongue in and out as he watched the plight of pikkle and mara ksss howja feel now kaha kaha want ta pull me tail off steal me den abeat me up kksss mara was about to say that they had not harmed him but she thought better of it unknowingly they had made a dangerous enemy she tried reasoning with swinkee im sorry about what happened we didnt mean to upset you we promised to reward you if you took us back home kksss liarssss the lizard spat through the meshes at her youa dont fool swinkee kahaha i got plenty swampflies v marshworms off king glagweb inna trade for you swinkeea like revenge kksss pikkle pawed at the net in helpless fury youre an absolute bounder stinkee dyou hear me if i could get out of this confounded shrimp trap id raise a blister on your noggin that wouldnt go down in a season before they could exchange further insults the lizard was swept aside by a massively bloated toad redeyed and covered in repulsive yellow warts which blotched its slimegreen skin from end to end the toad prodded a long trident through the meshes narrowly missing their eyes thrrruk foodslaves be silent krrik or you die best do as he saysi think he means it mara whispered under her breath to pikkle the lizard bowed fawningly before the massive toad kksss swinkee bring you gooda trade king glagweb the king of the toads nodded ponderously and waved his trident two smaller toads came forward carrying between them a sack which moved with a wriggling writhing motion swinkee snatched it from them and backed off bowing and scraping kkss kaha swampflies marshworms no need t counta them swinkee trust great king always good toa do trade with dragging the sack off into the dunes he waved to mara and pikkle kahahaha bye bye foodslaves kksss the badger maid and the young hare were made to march with the net still over them stumbling and spitting sand they struggled across the dunes surrounded by hopping croaking toads who were only too willing to jab at them with tridents or lash out with wicked flails should they fall or attempt to stop some of the smaller toads thought it was good fun to sit on the trailing net ends and be towed along pikkle was soon exhausted but mara put out all her strength to aid her friend holding the net up so that he could walk freely she bunched her muscles and dragged the whole thing along on her own ignoring the trident and flail stings impervious to the sand and stones that were thrown at her by the mocking amphibians pikkle crouched low doing his best to keep her footpaws from being snared or tripped in the net night had long fallen over the dunes and the captives were still lugging the enormous weight mara was forced now to travel oh all fours the strain of standing upright had proved too much pikkle crawled doggedly at her side blinded by sand and smarting from the cuts and blows of goading weapons the young ones plowed wearily onward oblivious of where they were bound hoping only to be allowed to stop and rest it gradually filtered through to their numbed senses that they were traveling along flat damp groundthere were tussocks of grass and patches of mud one of the toads produced a conch shell puffing out its f throat the creature blew into it there was an answering call from up ahead and lights began to show king glagweb prodded mara cruelly with his trident krrroik move stripedog hurry krrrik nearly there when they reached their destination the two captives flopped gratefully to the soggy ground panting with exertion k other toads carrying lanterns full of fireflies came waddling j over to inspect the prisoners one firefly settled on pikkles ear which was sticking out of the netting v pikkle gave a yelp of pain yowch that blighter bit me king glagweb laid about with the handle of his trident scattering the onlookers as he called out to his guard brian jacques salamandas iron krroikl get these foodslaves into the pit krrrk the net was roughly dragged for a short distance then tipped by a score of guards mara and pikkle were upended into a deep dank hole they splashed pawsfirst into muddy water almost to their middies squelching to a low ledge at one side the two friends slumped down together covered in sludge and mud they lay waiting until the sounds of the toad guards retreated pikkle immediately jumped up and tried to scale the slippery clay sides of the pit but slid back hopelessly there was a murmur of voices from the darkness one louder than the rest youre wasting time and strength trying to get out dont try again if the guards come back well all be punished mara felt about until her paw encountered short muddy fur who are you what are you doing here the shape of a small creature loomed up out of the gloom were prisoners foodslaves just like you what name do they call you i am mara of salamandastron this is my friend pikkle ffolger he also comes from the mountain the small creature offered his paw i am nordo only son of logalog my father is leader of guosssom the guerrilla union of south stream shrews of mossflower there are thirtyfour of us all told down here mara and pikkle shook nordos paw pikkle pawed sludge from his ear in disgust please t meet you nordo hah foodslaves indeed wed be filthy if we attempted to serve em food in this bally state several shrew voices piped up oh you wont be servin food matey you are the food aye the mudll roast off pretty easy in a cookin fire foodslaves only good for one thing matey food mara was horrified you mean they intend to eat us nordo led them to a small cave scooped out in the pitside he sat them down and explained glagweb and his tribe are cannibal toads if there are no captives they eat the weaker ones of their own kindyou wouldnt believe some of the stories about king glagweb and his band at the moment we are lucky yesterday we numbered forty but they took six of us last night we have a temporary reprieve i heard some of the guards talking today and it seems that we are to be kept and fed until the kings feastday then its our turn nordo held up a paw i know what youre going to ask me next when is the feastday sorry i dont knowyour guess is as good as mine but while theres life theres hope eh at least well be given food for a while and then jolly well served up at a party pikkle gulped what a nice surprise makes a chap feel wanted wot wot mara could not stand in the enclosed space but she clenched her paws and growled fiercely id like to see them try to eat me id give them a few bodies of their own to cook before they got me on the table nordo why do you all wait down here doing nothing cant you attempt some kind of escape instead of just sitting here waiting for those filthy creatures to eat you nordo drew them close and whispered thats exactly what we are doing are you with us mara and pikkle clasped his paw in the darkness were with you all the way just say the jolly ol word an well stick t you like slime on a toads back if youll pardon the pun old lad nordo chuckled grimly good let me explain we have a messenger when it is daylight if you look up you may see a wren fly over that is leaflad he is a friend of the shrews so keep a watchout for him the day he drops an acorn into tills hole thats the day we escape from here you mean youre going to break out with an acorn pikkle ffolger scratched his nose mara slapped his paw stop fooling ffolger and listen to what our friend has to say sorry nordo carry on right when the acorn drops in it means that my father and his shrews will attack from the river south of here they will have to act quickly and drive the toads back beyond this hole it is our job to defend ourselves until help arrives brian jacques mara nodded how will we do that simple really the cave we are sitting in was dug by us to prevent the toads hooking us out when they want us while we were digging this cave and others like it we found lots of good heavy throwing pebbles in the mud so we stockpiled them and tore up our jerkins to make slings thats how well defend ourselves until the shrew warriors can get us out of this pit krrike hey down there heres food for you eat it ail up now kraahaahaa as they piled out of the cave they were hit by a pile of watercress roots tubers and dandelions that the guards had thrown down mara gathered them and heaved them into the cave while they were still dry and edible as you said nordo while theres life theres hope and we need food to stay alive so lets eat up and keep our hopes high pikkle mumbled through a mouthful of roots sright old gel couldnt have said it better mself wot book two warriors and monsters hazy sunlight pierced a palewashed dawn sending streaks of gold lancing to banish the sea mists over salamandastron urthstripe the strong strode boldly out onto the sands in front of his mountain with ten hares at his back the badger lord looked every inch what he wasa true warriorclad in shining metal greaves and breastplate with a plumed and visored headgarb fringed in fine chainmail across his back a mighty doublehiked war sword was strapped resting easily in his right paw was his famed spear which weighed more than a grown hare and was tipped by a long doubleedged blade with ornate iron crosstrees a third of the way down its length he threw back his head and bellowed out the badger lords challenge in a voice like rolling thunder eulaliaaaa i am urthstripe the strong ruler of the mountain who dares trespass on my domain a white flag appeared from behind some rocks on the shore followed by the call of a highpitched voice flag of truce flag of truce my master would parley with you raptail the rat showed himself waving the flag furiously behind the visor urthstripes eyes glittered in anticipation urthstripe does not parley with vermin he buries them a tall blueeyed weasel stood up behind raptail his voice brian jacques carried neither menace nor challenge as he sidled forward i am called ferahgo we have no need to fight each other lord urthstripe besides if i did want to fight you would lose sorely i see you have only ten hares at your back urthstripe had gone silent he stared hard at ferahgo as if trying hard to call up something from the depths of memory sunlight flashed upon the badger medallion around the weasels neck causing it to glimmer like fire and his blue eyes opened wide in a disarming smile the badger lord peered at ferahgo through the slitted visor voices were calling dimly down the corridors of his mind too distant for him to make sense of the hardev he looked the more the blueeyed weasel with the golden medal seemed to confuse him urthstripe shook his head and lifted the visor ferahgo ferahgo where have i heard that name before he banged the spearshaft down bringing himself back to normality hear me ferahgo there may be only a few warriors at my back but there are many more inside my mountain the assassin stopped a few paces from the badger lord and waved his claws once in the air in a trice the rocks were bristling with armed vermin behind him he turned right and left to wave his claws again they flooded onto the sands of the shore and stood like a pestilence of evil weeds sprung there by magic line upon line of ferrets stoats weasels rats and foxes each one armed to the fangs banners of blood red and standards decorated with skins hanks of beast hair and skulls swayed in the light breeze ferahgo turned to urthstripe with a confident smirk you have thirty more fighting hares inside i know the odds would be well over fivescore to one but let us not talk of fighting i am a visitor to this countrywhere is your famous hospitality invite me into your mountain and let me look around we will talk never i do not allow vermin into salamandastron as he was speaking urthstripe noticed the front ranks of the horde advancing slowly behind him he heard the slither of arrows being drawn from quivers sapwood and the ten salamandastron hares were readying themselves for trouble ferahgo shook his head you say you never allow vermin into your mountain yet my son klitch and his friend goffa took breakfast with you not so long ago the point of urthstripes spear had been gradually tilting now it dropped centered on ferahgos midriff a breath away the assassin took a cautious step back urthstripes short patience was worn exceedingly thin leave mossflower country weasel or you and your scum will die here i am tired of talking take your face out of my sight you offend me ferahgo was not short of nerve he spat scornfully in the sand your mountain is surrounded badger if it comes to war there is no way you can win what do you say to that but urthstripe was finished talking except for one word eulaliaaaa there was a deadly hiss of shafts as ten of the advancing enemy were cut down by the long patrol arrows ferahgo leaped to one side roaring charge the horde swept forward over the bodies of the fallen toward the badger and his ten hares the hares dropped behind another ten who had been waiting to back them up with bows ready they fired into the yelling horde as their comrades fitted fresh arrows to their bows and let loose another quick volley carried on by the lust for battle urthstripe instead of retreating into the safety of the mountain flung himself forward into the foe a burly ferret wielding a pike charged urthstripe the badgers spear took him through the chest and lifted him like a rag doll hurling him into the seething horde a weasel flung himself on urthstripes back and stabbed the big badger between greave and breastplate urthstripe slew him with the backward stroke of a huge mailed paw three hares were downtwo to spears one to slingshot ill try an get lord urthstripe away sapwood called out to oxeye keep the entrance open till we gets back oxeye coolly notched an arrow to his bow and felled a fox righty ho but put a move on sap we cant keep up this brian jacques bally performance all day dearie me what a chap has t do for these badger lords sapwoocl dropped his bow and tore out into the melee punching kicking butting and hooking he made it to the badgers side cook sez breakfasts gettin cold sir hare you comin in an illtimed thrust from a vermin spear missed urthstripe but knocked sapwood senseless on the rebound as his head met the blunt end of the spearbutt urthstripe grabbed the hare in one paw and slung him over his shoulder as he fought his way back to the entrance suddenly klitch appeared in front of him brandishing his short sword the badger turned as he thrust taking the blade in his arm burdened as he was with sapwood the badger lord stood for a moment glaring at the young weasel tearing the sword from his arm he stood on it and snapped the blade snarling angrily better luck next time brat well meet again eulaliaaa urthstripe went hurtling through the melee like a juggernaut scattering bodies right and left he pounded through to the entrance dropping the unconscious sapwood into the paws of two waiting hares as he roared out orders oxeye get your hares inside ill block off the entrance within seconds the hares had ducked into the passage and urthstripe threw his weight against a mighty boulder the stone rolled into place sealing the mountain from the horde outside the badger lord drove a large oak wedge into its base with a mallet oxeye leaned on his bow watching him not very friendly those chaps sir i take it they want to fight us wot urthstripe licked blood from his shoulder and grinned at the irrepressible hare good enough oxeye you old battler well give them a fight one that we can talk about in the winters to come when were sitting round the fire growing old and lazy big oxeye checked his empty quiver dont mind me sayin so mlud but there wont be too many around to grow old after this fights finished dryditch fever the awful name was enough to chill the heart of any creature a hasty conference was called by the abbey elders abbess vale bremmun faith spinney and brother hollyberry with furgle the hermit sitting in on the proceedings abbess vale addressed them friends if something is not done swiftly this dreadful fever may wipe us all out brother hollyberry as infirmary keeper do you have any knowledge of this illness hollyberry pursed his lips mother abbess my skills are simple and very limited tummyaches headaches scratches and wounds are what i am used to i have had a quick look through my medical books and the opinion of most former infirmary keepers is that there is no sure cure for dryditch fever i can keep it under a certain amount of control with my own remedies but alas i cannot cure it flowers of icetor heh heh heh but thats only an old mousewives tale heh heh heh flowers of icetor indeed they all turned and stared at furgle the woodland hermit

flowers of lector boiled in fresh springwater i think she was mad of course quite mad faith spinney shook her paw severely at furgle show some respect for your elders my grandma used to say the same

the big otters logic was so strong and straightforward that he received a hearty round of applause everybeast was in agreement thrugg was the otter for the job in fact the questjngmight in thruggs eye discouraged any fainthearted disagreement being a beast of his word and a creature of action thrugg set out without delay taking with him his throwing sling and pebbles and a large haversack of food night had long fallen when he was waved off along the north path from the abbey gates by a contingent of his redwall friends goodbye and good luck thrugg ho urr youm taken good care of eeself hurry back with the flowers matey do be careful mr thrugg the gates shut behind him as the otter strode out boldly along the dusty brown path to the north thrugg had not been walking long when he began hearing sounds from the woodlands on his right he tied a big pebble into his sling whoever was trailing him would be called sharply to account if they tried anything a paie sliver of moon illuminated the path and woodlands dimly as the otter watched the small bushes and shrubs moving not far from where he trod his hidden follower was trying hard to keep pace with him smiling grimly to himself he twirled his sling meaningfully and stopped the other stopped too suddenly a juniper bush began shaking and thrashing madly and a squeaky little voice cut through the night silence elpelpelp mista thugg its a serpink a serpink got me the voice could belong to only one creature baby dumble brian jacques salamandostron thrugg hurled himself into the woodland and pounced upon the bush ripping leaves and branches as he shouted belay matey dont be afrightedthruggs ere the infant dormouse was trapped in the coils of a fully grown grass snake though not poisonous the creature was trying to squeeze the life from dumble thrugg gripped it by the throat and dealt it a powerful blow with his loaded sling it was knocked senseless in a trice baby dumbles face had an unhealthy bluish pallor and his cheeks were puffed out as he tried to breathe sudden shock had paralyzed him the big otter turned the tiny dormouse upside down and dealt him a hefty whack on his bottom it was a drastic but surefire remedy dumble let out a yell that resounded through the woodlands waaaahoooooh a short while later he was seated happily on a fallen tree eating a candied chestnut from the otters haversack as he watched thrugg tying the snake in an intricate knot around a sapling you stringy of rascal ow dare you try ter choke my liddle matey ycan stay there till you learn some manners dumble chuckled

edge of the pit watching mara intently the toad guards heaved a massive load of tubers and roots down to the captives there was even some fruit among ita few apples some halfripe hazelnuts and late strawberries nordo and his shrews gathered it into the little walicaves keeping the hazelnuts to one side as sling material as pikkle helped to gather up the food he called to mara youve got a royal admirer there old gel wot i think he fancies you on toast with an apple in your jolly mouth mara shook a paw at the king of toads go away you fat sloppy swampwalloper kroikl silence stripedog glagweb is king krrk glagweb flung a hazelnut savagely at her not fat or sloppy i punish you when the time comes grrk mara flung the nut back scoring a direct hit on glagwebs nose why not come down here and punish me now if you dare fathead or should i say your royal splodginess glagweb waddled about the edge of the pit quivering with rage his eyes bulging and his throat pulsing wildly brian jacques grrroak i will eat your heart hah mara curled her lip scornfully eat my heart you couldnt eat mud if it hit you in the mouth here she flung a pawful of slime it splattered into the toadkings open mouth the creatures in the pit had to scramble for cover as the toad guards hurled pebbles down at them glagweb went into an insane rage spitting slime as he croaked venomously at the badger maid krrikl i wait no longer you have angered me and soon you will all die kroik i will make your deaths so slow and painful you will plead to be eaten grakk after the toads had gone mara apologized to the other captives im sorry i lost my temper and hastened your deaths but i couldnt stand that loathsome toad staring at me nordo wiped mud from an apple and bit into it whats the difference were all going to die anyway probably better sooner than laterget it over with pikkle nibbled at a strawberry reflectively i dont know whether to stuff mself and give those toads a good scoff or bally well starve so they wont have much to chew on what dyou think nordo ol lad as i said pikklemakes no difference once youre dead then thats it fat or thin here whats all this mara put a paw around nordos shoulders you talk as if the end is inevitable wheres your famous fighting spirit of the guosssom nordo sat down heavily in the mud and slapped his paws in it look at thismud slime sludge everywhere trapped in a pit like frogs in a barrel forced to live in this filth i cant take it anymore living like a wriggling swamp insect he yelled hoarsely and threw himself at the pit walls slipping and sliding as he tried to claw his way upward a grass noose snaked down without warning and settled over nordos shoulders suddenly the pit edge was alive with a mob of toads croaking and hopping gleefully as glagweb waved his trident and bellowed loudly knrrokk now we eat em one by one gurrrrkk solamandostron pikkle dived forward and grabbed nordos footpaws come on chaps dont let the scurvy knaves take him mara waded forward and seized the rope several shrews hurried to help her and the badger maid called to them pull pull with all your might on the topside of the pit toads attached themselves to the rope and hauled frantically krruuuukk heave if you want food heave glagweb shouted at them the toughened grass rope stretched and squeaked taut as creatures at both ends bent their backs into the tugofwar two young shrews named scraggle and wikk climbed over the heads of the others and began attacking the rope with their bare teeth pikkle smiled grimly thats the stuffier give the troops lads bite away several toads leaned over the edge and prodded with their tridents but they were driven back with a volley of mudballs from the pit below scraggle and wikk bit furiously into the straining rope spitting dried grass left and right as their sharp teeth worked on the fibers the rope parted with a loud snapl on top the toads went staggering back and landed in a heap on glagweb he thrust at them cruelly with his trident krrrrekk off fools get off the king mara pikkle and nordo fell back into the pit in a splashing deluge of watery mud still clinging to the severed half of the rope a pile of shrews fell in on top of them through the slime and sludge they laughed aloud at their victory we won we won hooray i say good show you chaps thatll teach old glag guts wot an arrow came streaking down and pierced scraggles paw glagweb appeared at the pit edge with several toad archers krrrg kill kill them all mara felt something hit her between the ears she clapped a paw to her head and caught the object from the comer of her eye she caught sight of a wren zooming overhead brian jacques holding up the acorn she roared aloud look its the acorn eulaliaaaaa immediately the battle cries of the guosssom shrews reached their ears nordo dived into a wallcave avoiding arrows as he threw slings and stones forward lifting his head in an answering war shout to his fathers warriors who were pressing up from the riverbank logalogalogalogalog an arrow zipped between pikkles ears as he flung off a rounded stone from his sling there was a satisfying thud as it caught a toad guard in the throat toads were everywhere swinging their vicious flails and thrusting with tridents fierceeyed guosssom warriors their heads bound in brightcolored cloths leapt to the fray parrying and riposting with their short fencing rapiers yahaa sdeath to you scumback on guard one two slay mara and the rest whirled stones upward with as much speed and force as they could muster dodging arrows and ducking long pike thrusts from the toads on top king glagweb turned back and forth trying to divide his attention between the prisoners in the pit and the advancing guosssom shrews the element of surprise was working well the shrews drove the toad masses backwards mercilessly pushing them into the flames of their own cooking fires as they did logalog the fierceeyed leader of the shrews fought like a mad beast throwing himself onto several toads at a time regardless of danger bleeding from a dozen trident and flail cuts he fought wildly with tooth and rapier all the time booming out in his gruff bass voice im coming nordo my son logalogalogalogalog several shrews had been slain by the toads but the losses on king glagwebs side were far heavier the toads were beginning to lose heart they still fought on but they were pushed into retreat by the ferocity of the guosssom attack salamandastron down in the pit there were four dead shrews but the prisoners never stopped for a moment the upward hail of stones was so fast and thick that they felled many toads mara leapt out of the cave she had been slinging from heaving and throwing anything that came within reach of her paws for a second she glimpsed the snarling features of king glagweb then he retreated from the edge mara hes gettin away pikkles voice called out to her over the melee the tridentsover there two toad guards had been knocked down into the pit they lay dead in the deep watery mud still holding their tridents immediately mara sensed what pikkle meant snatching the two tridents she used them as climbing spikes paw over paw up the side of the pit she went using the tridents to haul herself up thrusting them deep into the slippery sides and exerting all of her huge strength she thrust her way up to the top flailing with the tridents she sent two toads hurtling into the pit before she took off after glagweb the king of the toads wobbled and hopped through the swamps toad warriors less ponderous than himself passed him on both sides as they fled from the wrath of the guosssom fighters krrruk worms deserters come back and help your king glagweb spat at the toads chancing a look back he saw mara coming after him the toadkings throat bulged with terror as he tried to go faster the badger maid was a frightening sight her eyes red with rage foam flecking her jaws as she hurtled forward regardless of brush or sapling glagweb froze with horror the strength draining from his flabby limbs as the young badger threw herself through the air and pounced upon him the logalog and several of his crew came dashing up as mara lifted glagweb from the ground bodily both her paws locked around his throat he dangled helplessly croaking feebly as his legs tried to reach the ground mara found herself suddenly borne down beneath the weight of half a dozen shrews blinded by her warlike badger brian jacques spirit she turned to fight with them as her prisoner was wrested out of her grasp logalogs rapier touched her throat be still young badger leave this one to us he is our longtime enemy and we will deal with him come and watch the toad camp had been destroyed and those who had not fled were slain pikkle nordo and the others were hauled up out of the pit shrew warriors gathered round the pit edge as glagweb was dragged forward he snarled and spat at all about him logalog took little notice of glagwebs anger as he unceremoniously kicked the toadking down into the pit two shrews nearby loosed the mouth of a sack and something flashed down to join the toad in the pit the shrew leader smiled so then toadking you end up in your own pitthe same pit that you kept my shrews in so that you could eat them other creatures are flesheaters too take for instance the pike that has just been thrown in there with you he is only halfgrown but fierce why dont you try to eat him glagweb once he is hungry enough he is going to try to eat you i call that justice toadkingeat or be eaten goodbye glagweb recoiled to the side of the pit trying to avoid the ominous dorsal fin that stuck out of the muddy water as the pike cruised the pit bottom looking for food farther down from the toad camp lay the south stream moored on the bank were fifteen huge logs each one hollowed into a long dugout the shrews sat in pairs along the length of each log mara and pikkle were seated in the prow of the leading log with nordo and his father the dugouts pushed out from the bank and the shrews paddled them out into the center of the broad stream which meandered to the southeast where are you from mara logalog questioned mara as they rode the stream from the mountain called salamandastron sir do you salamandastron know how we can get back to there the shrew nodded it is a long journey but i know the way i am logalog of all these waters the south stream has many tributaries and i know them all like the back of my paw i will take you to the mountain but first you must come with me i have other plans for you at the moment pikkle smiled coyly other plans eh give us a hint logathing the grim expression on logalogs face wilted pikkle he turned aside muttering hmph only asked no harm in jolly well askin is there wonder what shrew tucker tastes like i could eat a toad salamandastran dingeye got over the loss of his comrade thura with surprising speed at first he had grown nostalgic and even wept a bit but then he remembered how stupid and insulting thura could be all the times thura had stolen food from him and the arguments that invariably ended up in fighting as he traveled south and west under the canopy of mossflower dingeye reconciled and justified himself aloud to the lonely thicknesses of the silent green forest yah serves im right anyhow maybe thuras got better and gone off on his own that stoat never really liked mee werent no proper mucker bad luck to him i says besides all that who needs a mucker wi a sword like thisn he swung the fabulous blade and chopped off an overhanging branch it fell tangling his paws and tripping him growling curses he slashed and hacked at the offending branch yowhoo yaha owch that urt dingeyes clumsy attack on the harmless foliage had caused him to wound himself on the left footpaw with the razorkeen sword he dropped the weapon and sat rocking back and forth as he tried to bend double and lick his injured limb urgh thatll be thura wherever e is wishin bad luck on me is old mucker who never did im any wrong nor wished him ill not once that thura was allus a nasty one casting about he found a large dockleaf and improvised a dressing for the paw staunching the blood with a pawful of leaf mold he bound the lot with a thin weed stem using the sword as a walking stick he set off again gnawing on a wrinkled apple and feeling sorry for himself just fancy bein wished bad fortune by me mucker whos deserted me lifes ard an cruel fer a pore stoat whos all alone an wounded samkim and arula had also encountered an unlucky setback tracking steadily the pair were making good progress when they came to an area that dingeye had not chopped at with his sword casting about this way and that they hunted for signs that would help them to pick up the stoats trail arula rummaged about in a yew thicket until samkim gave an excited shout over here arula look blood the young mole scurried across to find her friend sitting among a heap of slashed twigs and branches he pointed to the scarlet stains on the leaves hes been here all right see the stoat pawprintswho else could it be i suspect this is his blood too yes dingeyes passed this way what dyou think arula turned the leaves over with heavy digging claws yurr so e as oi wunner wot yon stoater wurr ableedin for sanken the young squirrel wiped his paws on the ground whoknows dingeye cant be too far ahead now though what dyou say we rest here awhile and have a meal then we can put on a good forced march and catch him up arula agreed readily at the mention of food ho urr gudd idea oim fair famishered but usns sit oer thurr away from all this stoater bludd they sat in a sunlit patch between a lilac clump and a ythicket of lupins samkim allowed arula to choose the fare she unpacked strawberry jam turnovers and blackcurrant cor brian jacques scdamandastron dial from the haversacks spreading a napkin she laid the food out thurr that do look noice first one wasp came it settled on samkims turnover until he brushed it away soon there were several wasps trying to light on the sweet jammy turnovers others buzzed and hummed around the little flask of cordial arula flicked one of the insects as it went for the jam around her mouth gurroff ee pesky wosper the wasp attacked and stung her burrhoo ee wosper stungen oi samkim flailed about at the wasps with his bow thwacking about as he punctuated each swing with angry words go away little nuisances be off with youscoot unwittingly the bow whipped into the lupins demolishing the wasp nest that was built in the forks of three stems in a trice the air was filled with maddened wasps they hummed and buzzed about the young ones heads in a maddened frenzy the two friends leapt up beating frantically at the stinging cloud of insects quick run for it before were stung to death whoohurr theym all oer the place leave oi alone wospers abandoning their meal samkim and arula dashed off among the trees pursued by an army of wasps owch yowch look for cover arula look for cover hooh ooh oi doant see nuthin but pesky wospers a burly hedgehog appeared out of nowhere and began catching wasps with a net on a stick and eating them with great relish hoho hoho lookit yew tew dont like wasps do yer samkim beat furiously at the insects as he shrieked out in panic to the newcomer who was obviously enjoying himself yaaah this is no time for chitchat mister do something the hedgehog snapped at a passing wasp and caught it in his mouth he chewed on it as he spoke tchah naught like a good crunchy waspcepting fer a big fat bee o course come on then yew tew foller spriggat they ran after him wailing and yelling in pain with the wasps still in hot pursuit spriggat stopped at the edge of a small woodland tarn pointing to the little lake he urged them into the water and plucked two hollow reeds hoho hoho never seed nothin like it in me born days critters afeared o wasps come on cullies in y go best duck under an breathe through these reeds urry now grabbing a reed apiece the two young ones hurled themselves into the water submerging themselves totally they fixed the reeds in their mouths and sucked greedily for air spriggat carried on dining off wasps impervious to stings he ate the buzzing insects by the pawful only stopping now and then to winkle out wings that were caught between his teeth come to spriggat me crunchy liddle beauties theres plenty o room for you all in me good ol tummy from beneath the clear waters of the small sunlit pool samkim and arula watched the hedgehog gorging himself on wasps until the buzzing horde thinned out and flew off back to their damaged nest when the wasps had gone spriggat hauled the young ones dripping from the pool they looked a sorry sight soaked and covered in lumps well curl me spikes lookit yew tew i wouldnt give a moldy acorn for the pair of ye see this bank mud well if you plaster it all over yselves itll stop the stingin rolling over in the sticky black mud they coated themselves with it strangely enough it relieved the stings immediately looking like two mud dollies they introduced themselves telling the hedgehog of their quest he nodded knowingly i seen that daft stoat earlier limpin an bobbin along an talkin to hisself like a worried wart no mind ol spriggatll put yback on his trail least a body could do for bringin me such a good dinner o wasps there was a slight buzzing noise from the hedgehogs stomach he gave it a sharp pat and it stopped scuse me now if yew tew will take a tip from spriggat youll set there awhile an let that mud dry hard then itll peel off an take all the stings with it brian jacques samkim and arula sat in an open patch of sunlight as the mud dried they watched the strange hedgehog taking wasps one by one from his catching net and scrunching them down as if he were at a banquet a blow from a spearbutt laid dingeye flat halfstunned he looked up dethbrush the fox and his six tracker rats held him pinned to the ground with the points of their spears the fox kicked the sword from his nerveless paws and dingeye whimpered with fright there was neither pity nor

me to do when i caught up with you dingeye gulped his throat had gone dry and he could scarce get the words out probly said to ffetch me back the fox smiled mirthlessly at his trembling victim wrong dingeye he said to fetch your head back on a spearpoint the sword swung once its blade flashing in the sunlight dethbrush wiped the blade on dingeyes carcass leave him one heads no good without the other i think lord ferahgo will be happy to receive this sword as a gift from an old departed friend come on its a long and hard trek back to the assassins camp salamandastron the battle for salamandastron was under way massed behind sand barriers and rocks the hordes of ferahgo sent flaming arrows up at the mountain vegetation and crops that had been cultivated on the crevices and ledges of the fortress were soon blackened stubble burned to the bare rock by hundreds upon hundreds of blazing shafts ferahgo stood in plain view well out of range klitch at his side from one of the high slitted rock windows bart thistledown brushed drifting black ash from his face as he notched a shaft to his bowstring murmuring to himself move you rotten blighter come on just ten paces closer and ill put one right between your bonny blue eyes wot starbob fixed an arrow to his bow and sighted on a ferret who was standing up to take a shot wastin your time barty old lad take the nearest available target like our friend down there for instance straining the bow taut starbob let fly the arrow zipped down and took the ferret in his chest he fell backwards releasing his fire arrow straight up starbob gave a grunt of satisfaction good oh i say look the scoundrels arrow came straight down and wounded that rat next to him two for the price of one not bad eh barty twanged off his arrow and turned away ignoring the death cry of the stoat below that he had hit not too fussy on this snipin game open warfares much better more team spirit in it doncha know move aside there hares they both shifted from the position as urthstripe stood at the opening he strung a massive bow and placed a quiver of arrows within handy reach each one as long and thick as a short spear the badger lord spat on his paws and rubbed them together right lets open this party up properly brian jacques salamandastron klitch sighed as he drew patterns in the sand with a spearpoint his face the picture of boredom so this is it the grand attack plan chuck a few fire arrows at the mountain then sit about and snipe at each other all season youve really outdone yourself this time old one ferahgo watched the fire arrows hissing through the air have you got any better ideas clever snout at least i got to stick the big badger with my sword the young weasel curled his lip contemptuously so you did klitch so you did now youre short one pretty little sword urthstripe pulled it out of himself as if it was a sewing needle and snapped it in half what a clever young weasel brilliant strategy on your part eh now why dont you leave things to your elders and betters klitch kept the spear ready lest the assassins paws should stray to the long knives strapped across his chest you may be my elder but youll never be my better come on lets hear about your brilliant strategy father having run out of arrows goffa decided to stand in the rear awhile with klitch he was crossing the beach exactly in line with ferahgo when a huge arrow hit him like a thunderbolt sending his body crashing into the two weasels quickly they leapt up and ran farther back scrambling behind an outcrop of rocks ferahgo laughed his blue eyes shining merrily at the narrow escape hellsteem and darkgates that thing was meant for me pity about your friend goffa klitch peered out at the dreadful sight the arrow had gone through goffa a full halflength into the sand keeping his bored look klitch leaned back against the rocks friend that dimwitted idiot he was only my lackey though id never have ordered him to save your skin come on tell me how you plan to conquer this mountain some of the more venturesome members of the vermin horde were slowly advancing closer to the mountain under the hail of burning arrows big oxeye watched them from the top of the crater seawood and pennybright were with him and all three leaned on a wooden prop which held back a pile of boulders oxeye pointed a paw straight down closing one eye as he sighted along it hmmm about two spearlengths more should do the trick come on you idle vermin move yselves righto chaps thats it all paws to the log now the three hares leaned down heavily on the wood the vermin on the shore beneath salamandastron heard the rumble from above some moved quickly others were not so alert over half of them were slain by the huge slabs and boulders that cascaded down the mountainside a cheer went up from oxeye and his comrades when they saw the effect of their avalanche yells of rage and curses arose from the attackers on the shore as they redoubled their volleys of burnј ing arrows in the late afternoon ferahgo called raptail to him the assassin winked at klitch now ill show you how i became ruler of all the southwest lands little weasel raptail send doghead crabeyes dewnose and badtooth to me oh and ask farran the poisoner to come too raptail blanched visibly as he bowed to ferahgo nobeast not even the assassin himself liked to do business with far ran the poisoner the black fox was not even part of the tp f horde he merely followed at a short distance going and comja ing as he pleased raptail trotted off to do his masters bidi ding dodging around rocks and behind sand barriers farran sat alone at the edge of the tideline watching the i waves ebb and flow raptail did his level best to keep in full ј view not wishing to be seen trying to sneak up on farran the poisoner wading into the sea he drew alongside the black f fox and delivered the message sir my master ferahgo wishes to speak with you he is v camped in the rocks north of here will you attend sir v raptails body shivered nervously as he stood staring into the pale amber eyes of farran nobeast had ever heard the brian jacques salamandas iron poisoner speak the sunlight did not glint off farrans fur it was sootblack with no luster whatsoever the pale eyes stared hypnotically at raptail from a face dark as the depths of midnight all the horrific whispered tales he had heard of farran loomed large was it true that he could kill with a long stare raptail fervently believed it was as he stood transfixed by the poisoners eyes wwwill you attend sir ffferahgo wishes to know unblinking farran stared at him a moment longer then nodded once that was enough raptail bowed so low that his snout went underwater thththank you sir he took off like a startled fawn splashing through the waves and dashing across the shore farrans sinister eyes followed his course expressionlessly slowly the black fox stood up and buckled on his belt of adderskin pouches hung from the belt small sacks made from the skins of bats what they contained only he knew moving like a silent stormcloud shadow he padded noiselessly over the sand seated at the outermost edge of his camp away from the horde ferahgo outlined his plan to klitch and the four creatures he had selected as captains siege no mad charges pawtopaw battles or outandout fightinga siege is the thing that will conquer the mountain sooner or later the badger and his hares will run out of arrows spears javelins and boulders i have him bottled up inside his mountain he cannot leave we have superior numbers and time on our side nobeast is coming to his rescue all we have to do is snipe from safety and wait him out now there is one question can anybeast guess what it is food and water klitch answered ferahgo chuckled at his sons quickness right someday you may turn out half as clever as your father food and drinkhow much have they got and how long will it last them thats the question crabeyes was an exsearat his eyes shifted constantly never staying still he held up a paw master they might ave vittles enough ter last them fer seasons to come admit ted they cant get out while weve got em surrounded but if they ave enough food n drink they could stay snug in there forever badtooth a large fat stoat agreed with him crabeyes is right master if they ave enough supplies we could die of old age waitin out ere on this shore ferahgo pawed at the gold medal on his neck his blue eyes shone happily as he unfolded his master stroke but we wont die of old age neither will urthstripe and his fighters they will die pretty soon now of something else there was a sharp intake of breath from klitch and the four captains as the shadow of farran fell across them hurriedly they moved aside to make room for him each one shivering with fear as he passed them farran chose his own place directly in front of the assassin blue eyes met amber ones as they faced each other ferahgo smiled ingratiatingly well well the poisoner meets the assassinwhat a combination but we have worked together in the past farran and i have always rewarded you well have i not the black fox merely nodded once in acknowledgment ferahgo averted his eyes knowing the danger in farrans constant stare he took out his skinning knife and whetted it slowly against a rock speaking as he did friend farran if i were to launch a nighttime attack on the mountain could you slip through the lines and find a way in farran nodded once that was enough for ferahgo good once you were inside it would be up to you to find the food and drinking water i imagine that the mountain will be a honeycomb of passages and sidecuts but you could find the larders no matter how many chambers and corridors you had to explore eh farran when you do i want everything eatable or drinkable to be poisoned with your most deadly fluids no creature is to be left alive in salamandastron farran nodded then held out a paw ferahgo understood standing alongside the poisoner he drew close lo his ear and brian jacques whispered in a voice so low that none of the others heard your fee is half the badgers treasure is it a bargain farrans nod was final the pact was sealed he gave ferahgo one long last glance then padded off silently there was a loud sigh of relief when he had gone ferahgo turned to the others now do you think my plan will work they all nodded agreement even klitch ferahgo sheathed his skinning knife then tonight is the night here is what you must do towels more towels damp them down with rosewater please brother hollyberry bustled

dumble is a scallywag v fat as a liddle frog p hes eaten so much vittles hes eavier than a hog dumble selected an apple and began polishing it on thruggs bead as he did he chanced to look back down the road dumbles eyes widened then he turned them ahead again this time singing in a low urgent voice o mista thugg dont turn around and dont you cause a fuss theres four of foxes wiv big sticks i i fink theyre followin us brian jacques solanumdostron keeping his paws in front thrugg fitted a stone to his sling lets see what these coves want then matey he halted and stood in the center of the path as the four foxes approached they were roving beggars who haunted the path waiting for helpless travelers or any easy prey that came their way two of them carried rusty swords the other two were armed with cudgels good summer day to ye mates the brawny otter greeted them the foxes exchanged knowing smiles one stepped forward top o the summer to ye yer onner whats in the avvysack thrugg grinned cheerfully at the raggedy fox four unconscious foxes with their tails chopped off who tried stealin our vittles why do you ask hee hee weve got a funny un ere mates one of the foxes sniggered another fox drew his sword testing the edge with his paw yeh wonder if es tough as vs funny thrugg twirled his sling ominously why dont you come an find out mudface the first fox saw that the big otter was no easy proposition so he adopted a whining tone now be reasonable friend were not lookin fer trouble you wouldnt begrudge four starvin creatures a bite would yer thrugg took a step toward him begrudge a starvin creature a bite not me matey you come ere an ill bite you anytime now listen you lot be off with you go an scare some crows the fourth fox pulled out his rusty sword and began swinging it yah were four to one gerrim lads baby dumble let out a terrified squeak suddenly thrugg realized that he could not fight and look after the infant escape was the only solution hold tight dumble ere we go bulling through the foxes thrugg bowled them aside as he rushed off the path into the woods dodging and ducking he skirted tree and bush with the outraged cries of his pursuers ringing behind him an idea began to form in thruggs head he put on an extra burst of speed to gain a little time the foxes stumbled and bumped into each other as they hurried into the woodlands they ran a short distance and halted thrugg was lost to sight the coward es idin somewheres yeh spread out an search well find im hee hee roasted dormouseages since i tasted that ringworm you go with splidge me an blitchh fan out the other way they had not been searching long when the one called ringworm spotted their quarry he gave a low secret whistle to the others when they came he cautioned silence pointing forward as he whispered ssshh there they are mates idin beind that there bush see the liddle brat settin on top of the avvysack sure enough the haversack and the back of baby dumble were visible above the spread of a thick clump of willowherb now lets do this quiet like sneak up an jump em yeh good idea clubs n swords ready lets go within feet of the vegetation they threw caution to the winds and leapt at the clump of willowherb stabbing and striking whack bonk thwack thud four foxes lay senseless on the ground half in and half out of the clump of rosebay willowherb seated atop the haversack which was strapped to a low sycamore branch that dipped into the willowherb baby dumble looked as if he were still perched on his friends shoulders the trick had worked perfectly the infant dormouse shouted excitedly mista thugg did ya biff th foxes mista thugg thrugg stood over the prostrate foxes twirling his heavy stoneloaded sling aye matey i raised lumps like duck eggs on the villains the big otter disarmed the foxes throwing their weapons off into the surrounding shrubbery breaking off a whippy brian jacques willow switch he revived them with a few smarting cuts come on hearties snooze times over up on yer paws each contributing a shoulder the four foxes were made to bear the haversack with dumble sitting on it between them thrugg walked behind as they trekked along the north path making sure they did not flag or lag with his willow switch by nightfall the foxes were sore hungry weary and in tears thrugg had driven them a fair distance even at double speed through a ford where pike lurked waaahahhooh the fox named ringworm bawled unashamedly a pike bit me back there it aint fair thrugg waggled the cane under his nose stop moanin mate you wont die though maybe the pike will rightyho then you scruffy bandits ad enough oh let us go sir weve ad enough the foxes collapsed weeping in the road dumble took charge swishing the cane perilously close to them he made them repeat extravagant promises never to be naughty to help other creatures and to get a good wash every night thrugg chuckled at the sight of the infant dormouse making sure each fox repeated his lines word for word the otter then took out his sling and loaded it right me lucky lads im goin to count ten then if i can still see you im comin after you we need porters for tomorrow see one two three before he had reached seven the four foxes were rapidly vanishing into the distance down the dusky path thrugg and dumble camped at the edge of the path that night beside two curiously shaped stones known to travelers as the otter and his wife because of their odd contours seated by a merry little fire they had a good supper of beechnut scones cherry cake and cider thrugg stirred the flames with a stick as he ruminated hair who knows what lies beyond the orizon tomorrer matey baby dumble also picked up a stick and prodded the fire salamandastron nodding his head seriously as he imitated his big otter friend oh harr matey might be more foxes an serpinks but you stick wiv dumble mista thugg ill take care of ya stifling his laughter thrugg tossed his warm jerkin at the infant you liddle villain ill take care of you if youre not asleep soon wrap yself in that there jerkin the quartermoon hung like a golden sickle in the summer night hardly a breeze stirred the mantle of the woodlands as the two adventurers settled down to rest by the fires glowing embers the guosssom shrew flotilla cut off down sidestreams and weaved its course along barely navigable waterways shrouded by hanging vegetation from tree bush and foliage mara and pikkle had lost all sense of direction but the voyage was soothing and the quiet waters transmitted a sense of tranquillity the young badger maid lay across the prow half asleep as she watched sunlight dappling through a tunnel of willows onto the barely rippling waters dragonflies hummed and once a kingfisher flashed past like a brilliant jewel her sense of urgency over returning to salamandastron waned as lulled by the steady dip and fall of shrew paddles she was overcome by lassitude and slipped into the realm of sleep the treetrunk boats drifted to rest with a slight bump against a bank overhung by lavender willow and rowan nordo cupped his paws and gave a short call logalogalog guosssom home only half awake mara and pikkle were escorted through a tunnel in the bankside which opened out into a welllit and spacious cave all around them shrews were bustling hither and thither carrying food from earth ovens to long shelves around the side of the cave which served as tables salamandastron i say this is more like it wot pikkle rubbed his paws together in anticipation shrew tucker and loads of it by the look of things lead on old logathing logalog and nordo seated them at a semicircular ledge immediately as they had sat down a large fat shrew accompanied by two small thin ones approached them with a scowl on his face he prodded mara and pikkle roughly youve taken our places those seats are for guosssom shrews not for ragtag stripedogs an rabbits before either of them could say anything logalog gave the fat shrew a sharp shove mind your manners tubgutt these are my friends go and sit at the other end with your pals do you hear me logalogs paw strayed to the rapier at his side nordo stood beside his father grimjawed and ready for trouble tubgutt gave them a surly glance and retreated to the seats at the other side of the table muttering something to the two thin shrews who nodded and sniggered rudely the shrew fare was excellent starting with shrimp and watercress soup then on to an admirable salad served with soft white bankcheese and after that there was a magnificent pastie of chestnuts mushrooms and leeks followed by hot spiced apple pudding the two friends did the food full justice washing it down with beakers of sweet shrewbeer logalog watched pikkle eating and shook his head in amazement witherin waterweeds where do you put it all pikkle the young hare demolished his second portion of apple pudding and licked the spoon clean no bother old logathing scoffin is me favrite sport wot rabbits cant scoff it takes a shrew to do real scoffin the loud remark came from tubgutt who was sneering openly at them across the table pikkle chuckled as he waved his spoon maybe rabbits cant scoff m fat friend but im pikkle ffolger a hare from salamandastron and ill scoff you under the table any day in the season tubgutt stood up his face dark with temper nobeast can brian jacques sojamandostron outscoff tubgutt of the guosssom pikkle turned to logalog may i logalog nodded certainly pikkle but watch out for tubgutthes sly ive noticed that he was waiting to challenge you so he has hardly touched any food pikkle shrugged well i only did a quick practice scoff mself a table that was formed from an old oak stump in the center of the cave was cleared seated at it pikkle and tubgutt faced each other as logalog stated the rules do both contestants agree to hot spiced apple pudding both the protagonists nodded and picked up their spoons logalog waved a paw to the servers as he continued it is a contest to a pawstill then bowley the cook will count the dishes emptied by each creature shrewbeer may be drunk while eating no halffinished dishes will count and no throwing food on the floor or hiding it in clothing first one unable to raise his spoon from the bowl must admit defeat make it a good clean scoff and best of luck to you both spoons ready then begin servers fought their way to the table through the throng of guerrilla shrews packing round the two contestants steaming hot spiced apple puddings were stacked at its center as hare ate against shrew tubgutt went to it in a rush spooning out three bowls of pudding in record time his fat jaws working madly as the spoon plowed up and down in a blur pikkle paced himself eating slow but big mouthfuls chewing each morsel with relish a large contingent of the shrews began cheering for tubgutt mara stood between logalog and nordo viewing the proceedings from a ledge some distance away tubgutt had downed five bowls to pikkles two nordo was beginning to look worried that tubguttlook at the speed of him hes picking up his sixth bowl whats the matter with pikkle hes awfully slow mara the badger maid merely smiled dont fret yourself pik kle can hold his own with creatures twice his size hes eating slowly because hes enjoying it tubgutt may be fast but hes no pikkle ffolger you watch back at the table pikkle licked his spoon clean quaffed down a beaker of shrewbeer and began on his third pudding absolutely delicious pud wot you must tell cook to give me the recipe old tubbyguts is enjoyin it too arent you old lad my my you are a messy eater tubbyguts with pudding festooning his chin and apple smeared across his face the fat shrew lifted his head and glared at pikkle the names tubgutt hare and ill make you sorry you ever went into a contest against me sorry old chap one could never be sorry with all this beautiful scoff about may i pour you some more shrewbeer at the end of his eighth bowl tubgutt began to slow down he put the bowl aside and reached for another bowley the cook rapped his paw with a ladle bowl not finished there still puddin in it see never mind chum pikkle grabbed the bowl from tubgutt you carry onill finish it waste not want not thats what we always say back at the mountain pikkle was becoming very popular with the shrews his good humor and impeccable table manners endeared him to them the gousssom began to cheer support for the young hare come on pik slow and easy does the trick ill bet a barrel of shrewbeer he beats tubgutt ill take that bet tubgutts eaten nine hes only on his sixth ill bet my sword the mountain hare wins hes a good un the banter went back and forth as the two contestants battled on tubgutt undid his belt and leaned back a look of disgust crossed his face as he picked up his eleventh pudding and dug a spoon halfheartedly into it pikkle now had eight empty bowls to his credit and was halfway through his ninth the incorrigible hare drank another beaker of shrewbeer brian jacques solamandostron wiped his lips delicately on a napkin and winked at his opponent good stuff this i say tubbyguts dont take that oneit looks bigger than the rest leave it for me try that little oneit only looks half full wot on his thirteenth pudding tubgutt stopped he was breathing heavily and his mouth hung slackly open the two little thin shrews fanned him with napkins and gave him a beaker of shrewbeer but he pushed it away with a flabby paw mara nudged nordo now watch pikkle really take off the young hare now had eleven empty bowls to his credit he licked his spoon shiny clean and selected a twelfth tubbyguts old pal youve gone green i must say you looked much better your other color pass another pudden will you with the spoon halfway to his lips tubgutts stomach heaved and his paw went limp the spoon clattered back into the bowl a hushed silence fell over the onlookers completely ignoring his fellow contestant pikkle polished off the twelfth pudding and chose another as he licked his spoon bowley the cook watched tubgutt carefully can you raise spoon or paw shrew tubgutt collapsed his head squelching into the pudding in front of him pikkle blinked and tuttutted at his table manners is he finished already ah well never mind tubbygutts its not the victory but playin the jolly old game that counts anybeast want to take his place a wild cheer went up from the shrews logalog laughed heartily well done pikkle i liked that little joke about anyone else taking tubgutts place good eh mara mara gave logalog a blank look that was no joke pikkle meant it look hes on his sixteenth the guosssom shrews were laughing patting pikkles back and cheering him to the echo bowley the cook held pikkles paw aloft the winner by a clear four bowls of pudding pikkle the hare from salamandastron is the champion amid the cheering and applause pikkle smiled modestly trying to pull his spooning paw from bowleys grasp steady on chaps leggo me paw will you bowley old lad its bad form to stop a fellow in midscoff covered by a blanket pikkle lay on a ledge snoring loudly mara sat with logalog and his son nordo the other shrews had retired for the night though mara had been glad to escape salamandastron she could not reconcile herself to the idea of urthstripe being besieged along with the hares inside the mountain a sudden yearning to be back there giving what aid she could caused the young badger maid to turn to the shrew leader logalog i want to thank you and your tribe for rescuing us and showing us the hospitality of your home but i am anxious to go back to salamandastron i have told you about what will be happening there so why can i not go ah in good time mara ah in good time logalog v patted her paw when you do go the guosssom warriors and i will be with you i have crossed swords with this klitch you speak ofaye and his father ferahgo the blueeyed f ones are our enemies we would wear out logboats traveling to fight against them mara nodded then why do we not go now logalog took a sip of shrewbeer from his tankard be cause i need you to do something for me listen and i will tell you i am leader of the guosssom because i am the strong est that is the only thing that keeps our tribe together without the blackstone the guosssom will follow the shrew who holds the blackstoneit is sacred to us shrews i held the blackstone from the time it was passed to me by my father who got it from his father before him it makes the holder undisputed leader of all shrews well one day when my son nordo was little he took it from around my neck as i slept i did not worry too much because nordo was a baby who liked to play with the blackstone i let him thinking that one day it would be his by right however nordo lost the stone i brian jacques took the blame on myself not wanting him to be shunned by the guosssom and since then i have been leader only by my authority and fighting skills where did nordo lose the blackstone mara could not help interrupting and how does it concern me nordo took up the story from his father you must understand our ways mara the importance of the blackstone is great in our tribe without it my father leads only by his strength if he possesses the stone then he is leader not only by his toughness but by guosssom law but let me tell you my story one of the tributaries of the great south stream leads out on to a large lake so big it is like an inland sea i drifted out there in a little logboat that my father made for meactually i fell asleep and the logboat took its own course the oars were lost overboard as i slept i drifted around on the big lake for more than two days then i sighted an island near its center paddling with my paws i made it to the island there i searched the woods looking for suitable wood to make oars so that i could row back home having no knife or sword i could not cut wood i searched all day without success when night fell i went to sleep in the woods it was like a dream i was suddenly wakened by a dreadful roar a huge white creature stood over me it was terrifying more ghost than fur or blood it had hold of the blackstone i screamed and ran off leaving the blackstone and the broken thong that it had hung from the ghost had it i made it back to my little logboat and drifted round until the evening of the next day when i was found by my father and a search party who were scouring the lake with the big logboat fleet since then no shrew has been near the big lake or the island where the ghost lives but with you along i might be able to get the blackstone i dont understand why must you have me along mara scratched her head in puzzlement logalog spoke then keeping his voice low because you are a badger and the ghost that haunts the island of the big lake is a badger also a huge white one without stripes samkim and arula sat in the late afternoon sun peeling the mud from themselves spriggat had proved correct the stings came out with the mud the young squirrel picked the last of it from his tail bush that mud is marvelous stuff arula look theres not a sting on me and scarcely a

dawn was shrouded in a curtain of drizzle though the thick woodlands offered fair protection after a hasty breakfast the three searchers set off spriggat leading them on a course that skirted the headless carcass of dingeye still following a southwest trail they pushed on until midmorning when they halted in an open sward the rain had ceased though the sky overhead was gray with rolling clouds

er tongue right young uns lets press on as soon as darkness had fallen on the previous night ferahgo put his plan into operation the horde went charging towards salamandastron chanting as they brandished their weapons ferahgo kill kill kill ferahgoooooo in the dining hall urthstripe sat with sapwood and oxeye taking supper the sounds of the war chant reached their ears oxeye sighed wearily as he put down his beaker night attack sah shall we just block all openins an sit doggo in here they cant harm us and all thats required is salamandastron a score of defenders round the crater rim we can relieve them through the night wot but urthstripe was loath to sit still while there was the faintest chance of battle he pushed aside his chair what sit in here while those scum crawl ail over my mountain never this is the ideal time to set up a few surprises for ferahgo follow me well need long poles archers and oil too have that big barrel from my forge brought up to the crater top ferahgo perched upon a low rock with klitch and crabeyes watched the masses climbing the outer rocks of the mountainous front face of salamandastron doghead the stoat captain ignited a torch and others began lighting their torches from it soon the mountain was ablaze with twinkling lights as the attackers sought to find openings in the rocks that would lead them into the mountain dewnose had led three ferrets ahead of the rest they were almost halfway up when one of them yelled over ere theres an openin a sorta window cut into the rocks they scrambled to get in dewnose leading the way evening chaps nice night to learn flyin wot bart thistledown and pennybright thrust forward with their long poles dewnose saw what was happening too late the poles hit him square in the chest and he shot outward with a scream no dont yeeeaaaggghhh together with one of the ferrets who had squeezed in the window aperture with him he went sailing into outer space all over the mountain similar flying lessons were taking place down below klitch roared up at the crowds of soldiers who were trying to scramble back down up keep going get to the top you worthless cowards he ran forward climbing upward and belaboring all about him with his spearbutt come on follow me im not scared ferahgo urged the attackers up keeping the assault centered on the seaward side of the mountain this way he hoped that farran would have a clear path on the landward side brian jacques crabeyes unslung his bow shall i get the archers firm master addlebrain the assassin pushed him aside scornfully they cant see anything to fire at wed be killing our own tell them to light more torches climb up there with em and see if you cant fire some arrows from close range into those slits theyre pushing the poles out of sapwood clad himself in old rags and climbed out on lo the mountain face the bold hare moved about freely in his disguise a weasel carrying a torch and shaking a pike climbed level with him the sergeant dispatched him with a swinging leftpaw uppercut the weasels lifeless body bouncing like a broken doll as it hit the ledges on its way down another weasel raised his spear at sapwood as he balanced precariously hoi youre not one of uaaaarrgghhhh the boxing hare merely banged his paws down on the weasels footpaws and the unfortunate spearcarrier danced painfully on empty space for a second before plunging shoreward sapwood spat on his paws and went in search of others on the shoreward rim of the crater urthstripe and oxeye were tipping the barrel of forge oil over a heap of large boulders when the barrel was empty the badger lord kicked away the wedge holding the boulders back with a loud rumble they bounced off down the mountainside and urthstripe flung the empty barrel after them with a wild laugh climbing nimbly klitch was almost halfway up the mountain a ferret named frang grabbed his paw sir whats that noise noise klitch pushed him savagely away its the sound of battle you fool keep climbing farther up a rat gave a halfscream as the first of the boulders ground him flat the flames from his torch setting him ablaze as he rumbled downward now the boulders were smashing into the topmost attackers killing them instantly and salamandastron igniting into huge fireballs as they touched the blazing torches which they had carried on ferahgos orders crabeyes and the troops who had just started their climb came dashing back down master get out of the way the captain yelled as he passed ferahgo ferahgo took one backward glance at the mountain as he fled the front face of salamandastron was lit up bright as day and rocks roared with the wind fanning their flames as the blazing boulders cracked and burst sending death and devastation widespread among the shrieking horde of the assassin above it all could be heard the booming laughter and exultant warshout of urthstripe lord of salamandastron hahahaha eulaliaaaaaa farran the poisoner slid noiselessly over the far topside of the crater without pause he made his way down and into the corridors of the mountain fortress the first door he came to he opened silently and he looked inside nothing there shutting the door he turned around to find himself facetoface with windpaw the female hare was hurrying up toward the crater top with a supply of oilsoaked arrows swifter than her eye could follow farran flicked out a dagger made from greenhart wood and thrust the poisoned tip into the side of her neck windpaw did not even have a chance to call for help she died instantly her face in an agonized grimace moving like a flickering lamp shadow farran slid effortlessly down the passage checking a cave here opening a chamber there until he found what he wanted the water barrels were arranged along one wall ten huge oaken tun vats the black fox sighed almost lovingly as he lifted the lid of one and took a sip cool and sweet rainwater and clear springwater mixedit was perfect but not for long carefully uncorking a green glass vial the poisoner went about his deadly work dividing the contents of the vial evenly between the ten barrels it was the work of a moment then he was gone slipping off down the corridor he descended a roughhewn brian jacques flight of rock stairs to the lower level farran spent considerable time checking the rooms on this level they were all armory chambers the pale eyes showed no emotion but he knew that he was wasting valuable time down the next flight of stairs he went in his search for the foodstore unfortunately every room he went into was a dormitory taking a long spiral stairway he found himself in the dining room farran knew then that the foodstore would be somewhere close by near to the kitchens it was quiet inside at the base level of salamandastron the rock walls shut off all noise from the outside the poisoner padded softly about until he found the kitchen entrance his amber eyes flickered slightly at the sight of the food laid out there for the next mornings breakfast ferahgo had never fed his army this well washing his paws meticulously the black fox seated himself and ate his fill oatcakes warm and fresh from the ovenshe spread them with comb honey and chewed them with relish washing them down with gulps of old golden cider summer vegetable pasties and beechnut crumble crusty brown bread with mountain cheesethe black fox sampled each one in turn when he had finished farran wiped his lips daintily on a napkin and set about poisoning it all having finished in the kitchen he sought out the storeroom that led off it sacks of flour vegetable racks apple boxes salad bins nut containersnothing escaped the deadly potions of farran the poisoner a scattering of powder here a few drops of liquid there it was accomplished with his evil but natural skill midmorning was cloudy but promising to clear up later thrugg and dumble had been wakened by the dawn drizzle the otter sat the little dormouse in the top of the haversack and covered his head with the flap shouldering the lot he strode off northward better on the move than sittin round gettin a wet bottom eh matey come on give ol thrugg a song t keep his paws goin anybeast on the road at that time would have marveled at the sight of the big otter stepping out with a singing haversack strapped to his back dumble sang his dormouse song theres

songs about otters matey by noon the weather had cleared white clouds scudded across a sunny blue sky on the light breeze dumble was freed from the haversack he skipped along at thruggs side enjoying the freedom of the open road the otter slowed down placing a restraining paw on his small friend whoa there shipmate whats that sittin in the road up ahead the shapeless mass lying on the path some distance ahead started moving awkwardly to one side making for the thinning forest on the right dumble skipped round thrugg and began racing toward the object dumble come back ere you liddle thick ead thrugg roared out as the infant dashed toward the thing but dumble had a good head start and plunged onward ignoring his friends shouts thrugg stamped his paws down hard several times but then deciding it was useless he gave chase it was a falcon a season fledged and of no great size the bird flopped about with its right wing hanging awkwardly as it struggled to seek shelter in the thinning woodlands at the paths east side dumble cut off its escape and squatted in front of it holding out a friendly paw aaahhh poor birdie is your wing urted the falcon halted its fierce golden eyes distending as it hissed a warning through its dangerous hooked beak kaarrhzz stan oot o mah way bairn or ill mak dead meat o ye the little dormouse chuckled and tossed a piece of candied chestnut in front of the savage creature dumble wont urt you ave some food its nice the bird hopped to the nut and devoured it hungrily thrugg arrived just then he decided dumble and the falcon salamandas tron were too close to each other for him to intervene holding his breath anxiously the otter stood to one side the bird cocked its head and squinted at him through one eye hauld yer wheesht riverdog hey canna this wee bairn no onnerstand me does he not know hes in peril ahm no a sparrow ye ken ahm a falcon when thrugg had got the meaning of the birds high northland accent he replied qh i can see

meaningfully dumble held out his paw offering the falcon more bits of candied chestnut the bird ate them gently keeping a wary eye on thrugg and talking conversationally aye ah catch yer drift were

woods ye ken twas there the crows set upon me ach theyre a sair lot o cowards ten o them it took tae bring me down thats how mah wing was breakit thrugg took a careful look at the wing rocangus stood still bravely bearing up under the otters searching paw youre got a fractured bone there shipmate still i dont brian jacques suppose one more passenger will break me old back come along with us were

cannae fly dumble stroked the falcons back come wiv us ocangus mista thugg is a good carrier yknow thrugg searched out bindweed motherwort and pine resin he made a compound and bound the injured wing using a willow twig and wild rhubarb fibers to secure the dressing there thatll do the trick once that pine resin sets firm the wort n weed will do their work dont try to move that there wing mate the more you keep it still the quicker itll heal up now young rocangus you can be our navigator which way is it to the north mountains the young falcon held the wing stiffly at his side as he pointed into the woodlands to the northeast yonder though ahm no certain sure tis different when a birds no up in the sky ye ken still dinna fash yersel well get there all right dumble refused to ride in the haversack he trotted along at thruggs side despite his pleas rocangus was made to perch on top of the haversack on thruggs back latching his powerful talons into the straps he hung on gamely if mah faither could see me now hed kick mah tailfeathers intae the woods wi ye thrugg ya great bonnie riverdog the curiouslooking trio struck northeast into the far tip of the mossflower woodlands the trees were beginning to thin out into flat bushstrewn country and by midafternoon they had covered a fair distance dumble found ripe blackberries and a tree thick with small soft pears so they stocked up on both thrugg rested awhile watching both the young creatures feeding each other the choicest berries their faces both whisker and beak were heavily stained with the purple juice salamandastron the otter hefted the pack up onto his back calling to rocangus up on yore perch matey theres plenty o daylight left yet the falcon nodded toward a thick grove of pine and spruce ahead keep your wits aboot ye thrugg thats crow territory the afternoon was hot and still thrugg cast a glance at the grove placing dumble on his left side he slipped loose his sling testing the thongs as he loaded a flat pebble into it there was no sign of crows circling in the air above the trees but the trio took no chances they traveled cautiously keeping hidden among the low brush fern clumps and any cover the land could afford giving the pine grove a wide berth they went in a curving line moving at a moderate pace not too slowly or too quickly knowing the crows would be down upon them if they betrayed their presence by unnecessary noise even dumble was aware of their precarious position every now and then he would give his friends a wink and hold a paw up to his lips as they trekked along in silence everything went well until the little dormouse stepped on a thistle wowhoo i stood onna fissle mista thrugg ouch the pine and sprucetops rustled loud cawing cut the still air and ragged black shapes came flapping out of the grove rocangus gave a shrill cry ach its crows were for it laddies the sandy bed of a dried stream formed a depression in the land ahead of them thrugg grabbed dumble by his smock and made a dash for it the running otter was soon spotted by the crows winging swiftly they came after him as he ran heavyladen for the streambed calling harshly to each other the crows zoomed down at thruggs back rocangus dealt the first one a savage rip with his curved beak as it tried to latch its claws into the back of thruggs neck whisker over tail the otter threw himself into the shallow bottom throwing off the haversack he brained a lowflying crow with his loaded sling loosing off he stone he watched another crow fall crazily amid a jumble of tailfeathers as the pebble struck it brian jacques thruggs fighting blood was up now standing tall he whirled the sling roaring out the abbey warcry redwaaaaill come on you lousyfeathered fleabags im thrugg the warrior of the waterways redwaaaaalllll little dumble tugged the thistle from his footpad seized a long stick which lay nearby and stood alongside the haversack where rocangus was perched ready with beak and talon together they sang out their battle calls im dumble from reedddwwaaaaallll ahm rocangus son o the great laird mactalon kreeegaaarr two crows landed and came hopskipping fiercely toward dumble their vicious beaks like dirty yellow daggers dumble thwacked out hard cracking the spindly legs of the first one rocangus bowled the other one over tearing madly at it with his hooked beak thrugg took several sharp pecks in his back laying one crow senseless with a hefty smack of his rudderlike tail he whirled about kicking one high in a cloud of black feathers as he thudded the loaded sling into the chest of another rocangus was scrabbling in the sand against three more crows ripping with his talons and stabbing with his beak he did not see the crow that pecked dumbles paw the little dormouse squeaked with pain and dropped his stick immediately two huge crows seized him and began bearing him aloft he hovered in the air shrieking mista thuuuuuggg with a bellow of rage the brawny otter grabbed the haversack by its straps swinging it round he threw the laden pack and smashed the two crows out of the air dumble fell did a tumble and snatched up his stick falling on the two crows he beat them mercilessly pounding beaks tails legs and wings furiously ya nasty ol crones takin dumble up inna sky the three friends fought so fiercely that they drove off the crows the birds cawed angrily perching on low bushes and performing a curious hopskip dance on the ground as they chanted krak krak yah yah killa beast eata mouse killa ookbeak salamandastron from the slight cover of the streambed rocangus stood with thrugg and dumble watching the performance have ye ever seen sich a bunch o cowards the falcon clacked his beak contemptuously if man wing was better ahd go oer there an send em weepin tae their mammies thrugg wrapped a hasty dressing round dumbles pecked paw theyll be back mate you can bet on it theyre just gettin their nerve up agin look theres more o the villains

dumbles ready redwaaaaalllh skimming low over the grass the crows came winging in to the attack thrugg blinded the first four with double pawfuls of dry sand a crow was about to land on top of his head with beak open ready to bite when dumble thrust the stick straight down its throat four crows flung themselves upon rocangus all that could be seen was an explosion of black feathers mottled with the brown ones of the falcon as they fought with mad savagery two more landed and attacked thrugg from behind again his ruddered tail came into heavy action breaking the neck of one bird the other shot backwards stunned by a kick from his backpaw dumbles stick broke across an enemy head he snatched up both halves and went at the landing crows like a miniature thunderstorm the crows were beginning to win by sheer weight of numbers they swooped in and landed in gangs upon the three friends until none of them could be seen under the mass of black feathers beaks and scratching claws dumble screamed in brian jacques pain as a beak pecked him hard between his ears suddenly thrugg could stand it no more the sound of the infant dormouse being tormented by the crows drove him into a towering rage kicking butting and punching birds he arose from the tangle with blood dripping from his bared teeth fighting his way across the dry streambed he grabbed hold of dumble and rocangus standing in front of them he hefted the laden haversack in both paws and began swinging it like some terrible engine of destruction crows exploded into the air wing over beak over tail over tip dark feathers showered the air together with beak fragments and broken claws the haversack was a thudding banging swishing blur of destruction as thruggs head went back and his mouth opened like a scarlet cavern redwaaaaaaaaallull the crows fled some hopping others flapping as they fought each other to get away from thruggs mighty retaliation as late afternoon faded into evening the three companions sat tending to each others wounds thrugg winced as rocangus dug a beak fragment from his back ouch go easy there you feathered fiend hah stop grievin planktail yell live haud still while ah get this crowclaw out o yer thick heid baby dumble was counting his war wounds two free six nine twennyfifteen wow thats a lot aye an thats a lot out there matey look they followed the direction of thruggs pointing paw halfway between the pinegrove and the streambed the land was black with crows they crowded together bke beetles in a cellar thrugg sat down with his back against the sundried bank nobeast could fight off that many rocangus were done for the falcon preened his tattered breastfeathers aye but by the crag well go oot afightin dumble searched in the sand of the streambed i wanna soiamandostron new stick to fight more crones wiv slowly the sun began sinking in the west the sky was a warm peach color with dovegray pennants of cloud showing silver underbellies heatwaves still shimmered in the distance thrugg sat awhile gazing sadly at the beauty of it all hmm it aint too bad for an old streamdog like me ive had a good innins an enjoyed meself but you two young uns i wish you couldve seen more seasons to yore string afore you ave to go still an all were all good mateys so well take a load of em with us an go out in the good company of each other dumble had found a stick he peered over the bank wrinkling his nose fearless in his babyish innocence why are all the crones quiet ocangus the young falcon winced as he settled his fractured wing right yed best hope those birds stay quiet laddie when the beasties start up their chantin again thats when theyll come for us can dumble have some squashy blackbrries an pears mistathugg thrugg undid the haversack that he had used as a flail upon the bodies of many crows the once tasty contents were squashed flat bless yer eart liddle un course you can eip yourself the otter sat with a sad smile on his face watching dumble eat rocangus touched his paw with the uninjured wing dinna worry streamdog well give yon birds a battle tae remember and sing abootthose that are left alive the last gleam of twilight was showing on the horizon when the massed army of crows began to chant themselves into a frenzy it echoed dirgelike across the deserted countryside solamandostron a halfmoon hung in a sky of aquamarine paddles dipped noiselessly into the highbanked waters as two logboats threaded their way down a tributary far from the great south stream both craft were loaded to the gunwales with guosssom shrews mara and pikkle traveled in the front vessel they had been going since dawn sailing along an intricate network of backwaters beside them logalog and nordo checked the barkcloth charts showing the route how much farther before were there nordo mara murmured sleepily we should get there by dawn with any luck get some sleep you two were running downstreamput your paddles up pikkle looked around save for the watch shrews all the others had settled down to catch some rest he patted his stomach bit of tucker wouldnt go amiss wot hows a chap supposed to sleep when the old turn starts growlin an keepin him awake thats what id like t know reaching into a sack that was stowed in the bows logalog passed two large round flat objects to the hare try these pikkle theyre shrews longvoyage hardtack biscuits they might have been baked quite a few seasons ago but theyre full of nourishment you should enjoy them oof pikkle attempted to bite into one and came away nursing his mouth nearly bust all me molars whatre these things made ofstone ill bet even old tubbyguts couldnt get his jaws around one of these things i say mara try bitin one of these go on the badger maid pushed away the proffered hardtack biscuit not me i value my teethsave em to sling at the ghost badger pikkle shuddered and dropped the biscuit it landed with a clatter in the bottom of the boat oh thanks a lot bigmouthed badger first i cant eat these bally biscuits and now youve gone an put me off sleepin for the night with your talk of ghosts bit of a bad show all round id say robbin a chap of appetite an sleep mara fell asleep to the sounds of pikkle chuntering away indignantly to himself she woke in the early dawn light the logboats were traveling rapidly downstream bumping and speeding over small rapids as the guosssom shrew steerbeasts maneuvered them skillfully along the risky waterway the high steep banks on both sides flashed by now and then nordo would call out for everybeast to duck an overhanging tree pikkle was wide awake and ashenfaced as he gripped the sides of the boat pleading for a reduced speed i say chaps be good eggs an tell the jolly old capn to slow down a bit will you whoooo all this uppin an downin speedin an bumpini feel quite queasy the shrews who were fending the banks off with their paddles made the most of pikkles discomfort by ribbing him aloud try some cold custard and cabbage for breakfast mate haha or some warm oatmeal mixed with black treacle an carrots how about a stale vegetable pastie with sour cream over jl brian jacques salamandastron pikkle lay in the bottom of the boat clasping his stomach mercy chaps shut up you shameful shrews take pity on a feller please cold custard n cabbage bloouurrpp hold tight all paws its the lake mara clasped the sides tightly as the stream took a sharp downward curve the boats shot forward on a wild helterskelter ride bows forward they plunged down suddenly an immense splash and a great bow wave drenched everybeast then the two longboats rocked gently on the broad surface of a great lake never again pikkle wailed piteously all this for a bletherin blackstone you chaps must be off your bally rockers blackstone my aunts whiskers once this hare gets his paws on dry ground hes finished boatin for good mara stared about her in amazement they were on the edges of a fantastic body of waterit was a veritable inland sea the fresh morning sunlight beamed down upon tideless waters whose only movement was the outgoing ripples set up by the logboats entry into them as far as any eye could see there was water leagues of it with no sign of island or shore on the distant horizon to the left and right of them the broad expanse was sheltered by fringed forest with trees bushes shrubs and plants dipping their foliage into the water it was vast and beautiful in its silent serenity stillness reigned everywhere logalog smiled at the badger maids wideeyed expression hows that for a sight on a lovely summer morning miss mara could only shake her head in silent admiration of the scene i say you chaps this is a bit more like it wot im feelin much better now break out the brekkers send in the scoff they breakfasted on the open lake though this time not on emergency rations there was plumcake honeyoat scones mushroom salad and sparkling new cider pikkle ate his using a hardtack biscuit as a plate as he munched he stared about well give us a clue boys wheres the jolly old island hidin logalog pointed straight out two days rowing that way after breakfast they took up their paddles and began the long voyage to the island at first maras paws felt stiff and awkward but she was soon rowing as well as anyone and joining in the lusty shrew boatsongs that helped keep the rhythm of the paddles steady pikkle stoutly denied he had ever felt sick and sang as loudly as the rest ill sing you a song of the rivero where the waters clean and clear and the long fast guosssom logboats go were the shrews that know no fear so bend your back and use those paws from gravel bank to sandy shores your cares and woes will disappear just sitting paddling here guossssssssom guossssssssom ill sing you a song of the rivero it belongs to me and you oer deeps and shallows well both go with the finest guosssom crew when other creatures bound to land will not feel half so free or grand or know the water shrews great skill so paddle with goodwill guosssssssssom guossssssssssom in the early noontide the two logboats were still out on the lake nothing could be seen on all sides save water sky and lake met on all horizons the paddles dipped steadily in and out of the water with short powerful strokes nordo noted the suns position and called a refreshment period lots of shrews dipped cupped paws into the lake and drank with relish mara followed suit gingerly but found to brian jacques salamandastron her surprise that it was cold and sweet pikkle dabbled his paws in the water i say old logathing how deep is this bally lake logalog smiled mischievously hmm let me see it comes twothirds of the way up a boat or halfway up a duck oh i see pikkle nodded understandingly now hang on a baity moment old shrew who are you tryin to fool nordo laughed watershrews always say that to landlubbers actually nobeast knows how deep this lake is though my grandfather tried to plumb it when he was logalog and he said it was bottomless pikkle turned faintly pale around the gills dyou hear that mara bottomless that means theres nothin beneath this boat for goodness knows how deep but water oh corks i knew i shouldnt have come mara smiled have a nap pikkle youll feel better hah listen to the creature better she says ive never felt so absobloominlutely awful in me liwhat was that logalog came alert what was what over there sort of a big splash pikkle pointed nordo was about to say something when logalog shot him a warning glance and shook his head oh that it was probably a fish jumping they do that a lot pikkle held on to the boats side well i wish theyd bally well stop it makes a chap nervous wot there it goes again thats no fish jumping a shrew paddler stood up behind them his normally bass voice shrill and frightened the crews of both boats shuffled their paws restlessly and began murmuring among themselves logalog banged a paddle noisily on the prow of his logboat silence back there it was a fish i saw it myself now stop that old mousewives scuttlebutt and get your lunches eaten mara looked to her left a rippling wave was building up some distance away but it was coming toward the boats she pointed that looks a bit big for one fish it must be a shoal of them one of the shrews stared accusingly at logalog you shouldnt have banged your paddle on the boat like that its heard you and its coming for us its coming i tell you from the other boat tubgutt could be heard yelling accusations its those two the badger and the hare theyve brought bad luck down on us all others started shouting as panic set in with the advance of the rippling wave toward the two boats back the way we came shrews paddle for land its the deepcoiler mates turn back let us off these boats if its the deepcoiler were all deadbeasts logalog drew his rapier rapping out commands over the hubbub silence and sit down fools or youll turn these boats over if you want to save yourselves sit tight and shut up the rippling hump of water had been building up as it approached the boats subdued by logalogs authority every creature in the boats sat silent and still paws gripped paddles tightly mouths shut tight as vices fur stood stiff on every back with little warning the sunlit noontide surface of the immense lake had become a place of horror and dread every eye was fixed on the noiseless traveling swell it was scarce more than three boatlengths from them when there was a whoosh of water and something long and scaly slapped the top of the lake both craft rose on the swell as the logboats rode the wave mara moved then craning over the side she looked down bito the translucent bluegreen depths and saw the thing as it passed underneath both vessels it was enormous she had missed seeing the creatures head but she watched in fascinated terror as the length of its body slipped harmlessly by a mere pawslength beneath the surface round and thick as the trunk of a tree dark green with slategray blotches trailing waterweeds clung to the heavily scaled mass of the leviathan rippling sidefins powered it through the water as its rfength kept on passing and passing the pointed tailtip brian jacques scdamandastran scraped the boats underside and then it was gone far down into the fathomless depths of the silent lake the badger maid breathed a long sigh of relief and mopped the beads of sweat that stood out on her nose by the rocks of salamandastron what was that nordo unclenched his paws from the paddle with a visible effort what you just saw was a monsterguosssom shrews call it the deepcoiler though nobeast has ever set eyes on it until now pikkle sat with his eyes wide as saucers and his ears rigid well lets hope we jolly well live to tell about it oh corks an catkins i knew i should never have gone sailin at least when youre on bally old dry land you can run away but stuck out here on a floatin log its a bit much you chaps deepcoiler was an old shrew tale logalog explained to mara and pikkle somewhat apologetically a story to frighten naughty little ones who wanted to go paddling alone though in the time of my forefathers there were stories of logboats and whole crews lost in mysterious circumstances out on this great lake as for myself i never believed in the thing but now i have seen it with my own eyes how can i doubt it am sorry that this peril has been brought upon you by me and my son the boats were floating side by side tubgutt snarled across dyou hear that shrews hes sorry we might all be dead meat by tonight but logalogs sorry logalog hes not a proper logalog wheres the blackstone mat should be hanging round his neck we dont have to take orders from him i say we make for the shore mutinous murmurs started arising from both crews tubgutts right without the blackstone hes just an impostor i say we elect another leader aye tubgutt for leader hell get us out of this the fat shrew stood up with a triumphant sneer and faced the shrew leader find yourself another name shrew youre logalog no more im the new guosssom leader now right all the shrews were frightened at the thought of being out on the lake where deepcoiler lurked tubgutts plan to strike for land caught on immediately rather shamefacedly they murmured agreement with tubgutt though they kept their eyes averted from logalog who had always been a good and fair leader logalog touched his rapier hilt as he gazed coolly across at tubgutt well settle this once and for all you name the time and the place shrew tubgutt quailed under logalogs stare but he put on a brave front and began blustering therell be no fighting to the death around here or on land im the newly elected leader now the moment we get to shore youre banished from the guosssomyou and your son fussing busily about tubgutt sat down and picked up his paddle hear me now as your newly elected leader i say we put about and paddle for land make one move and youre fishbait shrew mara had been moving gradually along the boat until she was level with tubgutt in the other boat she stood within easy reach of him brandishing a paddle close to his head did you hear that the fat shrew appealed to his new followers this stranger is going to kill your new leader get her shrews put the stripedog over the side she and the hare me the cause of all this trouble seize them with lightning agility logalog leapt into the other logboat and was on tubgutt his rapier point tickling the fat shrews throat mutiny and incitement to murder eh tubgutt youll face a full council of our guosssom comrades when we return home mara and pikkle helped our shrews and my son to escape the toads prison pit they are honored guests ive allowed you enough leeway tubgutt myself i dont care for but when you threaten the life of guosssom friends thats mutiny on the open waters you there and you rivakget some line and bind this rascal tight and sit him in the stern t deal with him when the time is right logalogs speedy victory over tugbutt combined with ibs tough authoritative air turned the tide in his favor the brian jacques two shrews grabbed the struggling tubgutt and tied him up logalog sheathed his weapon and turned to both crews im still logalog here blackstone or not anybeast who thinks hes shrew enough to challenge me let him do it now there was a momentary silence then a big toughlooking shrew stood up and made his way along to stand by the leader anyone who challenges logalog challenges me too hes always been fair and just to all of us nordo stood up with mara and pikkle he spoke for all three we stand with logalog an old shrew with long whiskers waved his paddle good old logalog old whatm i talkin about hes only a young snip compared t me heeheehee other voices now made themselves heard aye logalogs always been a good un i like him me too hes always played square with young an old what dyou say shrews the crews of both logboats raised a mighty cheer for logalog as he vaulted back into the boat with nordo hooray for logalog leader of the guosssom hooray i say chaps dyou mind sittin down or well all end up in the flippin drink wot wot the rest of the day passed by uneventfully the sun set over the west lakeside horizon in crimson glory as the hot summer day came to an end the shrews shipped paddles ate supper and settled down as best they could for the night lying awake in the bows of the lead craft logalog passed mara a jug of sweetmaple cordial mara i want to thank you and pikkle for backing me you especially the way you crept up on tubgutt was very brave he had a lot of the others ready to follow him i know he lost a lot of face in the contest with pikkle but out here on the water with everybeast terrified by deepcoiler they were ready to follow tubgutt because he was all for turning back fear is a great motivator it was touch and go there for a while you could have quite easily got a rapier between your salamandastron ribs back there you are a true friend mara i will never forget what you did for me the badger maid pretended to yawn and snuggle down embarrassed by logalogs praise for her oh thats what pals are for now go to sleep you old waterwalloper stilled for the night the two logboats rocked gently on the calm surface of the vast lake yew tew better keep quiet theyre just up ahead o us samkim and arula peered into the nightshaded woodlands how

burgeoning threepart moon they set off through the woodland slipping silently along amid the shadowed treetrunks and undergrowth samkim padded carefully thrilled at the prospect of regaining the sword of martin the warrior for his abbey somewhere a nightjar warbled among the foliage and a woodpigeon cooed on the breeze high in the trees aru ia s eyes twinkled in the moonlight as she waggled a hefty yew stave spriggat turned and held up his stave hush now samkim you go to the right arula you take the left i know they aint posted sentries mayaps they think themselves safe deep in these woods yew tew travel curvin inward take a good thirty long paces then stop get those staves ready an wait on my cricket chirrup good luck an good untin young uns twentyeight twentynine thirtythats it samkim halted among some junipers and peered in at the firelit camp the rats lay about wrapped in their cloaks but over by the glowing embers he could see dethbrush the fox was resting in an upright position his back against a log the sword lay close to his paw glimmering in the light of the dying camp brian jacques fire there were woodpigeon feathers and bones scattered about the young squirrel shuddered how vermin could kill and eat birdsthe very idea caused revulsion within him chrrrk at the sound of spriggats call samkim leapt forward yelling yahaa death to the vermin redwaaaaalll the cricket close

charging in waving her stave boi okey give em vinniger redwaaaaallllhooouuurrrrr at the same time spriggat dashed in and collided with a rat who had leapt up at the noise the pandemonium was total set off by a real cricket call that proved to be a false alarm the ambush went awry dethbrush jumped up to see two of his rats being belaboured by a squirrel and a hedgehog he was only halfway up when a mole with a yew stave chased a screeching rat past him counting as it went twennynoin take that ee vermin seventyleven oill wack ee fiftyfoiv sixteentwo wots next take that n that n that the other three rats milled about bumping into each other thinking they were under invasion from a much larger force dethbrush decided to escape with all speed he hissed under his breath to the three rats quick over here scatter the fire and run that way through there grabbing the sword dethbrush helped the rats scatter flame and glowing embers all over the clearing with their spears they took off through the trees running southwest after the fox blinded by smoke and burning woodpigeon feathers arula whacked away at the log where dethbrush had rested nointyseven thurtyeight oill teach ee a lessing ho urr spriggat caught the end of the stave and pulled her away it went wrong we made a mess o it quickly afore the scdamandastron woods go up in flame put out the fires swiftly they cut beaters of green juniper and lupin and set about tackling the blazes that were springing up all about the edges of the forest clearing each creature beat furiously knowing their lives depended on putting out the woodland fire hot dry summer was the worst of all possible times to be caught in a woodland blaze and once established it could devastate a whole wood burning unchecked coughing and spluttering their faces blackened by smoke eyes redrimmed and sore they fought each fresh outbreak until the flames were subdued spriggat kicked dust on a spark as he leaned heavily on arula whoof im gettin too longseasoned for this sort o game wheres samkim over here look what ive caught the young squirrel digged a limping snarling rat he had his bowstring looped about the creatures neck i must have whacked him good and broke his footpaw he didnt manage to escape with the others spriggat dealt the unfortunate rat a hefty cuff and pressed some lupins into his claw fireraiser eh dont snarl at me like that you scum take that he gave the rat another good buffet right get beating go on ah round this clearing until acres no more chance of a burnup and just let me find one spark thats all just oneill give you such a beating that uk lumps have lumps on top o them arula took the bow playing the rat on the attached bowstring like a fish on a line she kept him going around the clearing hunting for any traces of sparks they had missed exhausted samkim and spriggat sat down on the log the young squirrel expressed his disappointment well we made a right old frogs dinner of mat you must have chirruped like a cricket too early arula wasnt in po sition and i was barely ready what made you do it sprig the cricket trundled out from under the log chirruped pwice at them and waddled off angrily into the night brian jacques salamandastron samkim covered his eyes realizing what had happened oh no spriggat golloped a passing moth and began chuckling ohohoho thank ye kindly samkim tis a tribute to my realistic cricket chirrup ohohohohohahaha the hedgehogs laughter was infectious soon the three of them were doubled up pounding the log with their paws ahahahaha ooh dear and there was arula countin

apples ugh sickens me t think of it the rat tried to limp away but arula reeled him in on the bowstring until their faces were almost touching she put her head on one side and grinned insanely at him

slumped in his bonds and gave a despairing sob ґ t that night samkim dreamt of martin the warrior the spirit of red wall held both his empty paws forth pleadingly give fte back my sword samkim do not let others use it for evil salamandastron though his pale eyes showed no emotion farran the poisoner knew he was in a dangerous position urthstripe and his fighters had returned from the fray outside the mountain was strewn with lifeless carcasses and groaning wounded ferahgo had called off his horde of corpsemakers their losses were considerable though not enough to make any great dent in numbers farran crouched in a dark corner of the passage between storeroom and dining hall silently cursing the ill fortune that had caused his escape route to be cut off from his hiding place the poisoner could hear the badger lord and his hares as they entered the dining hall they talked of the battle they had won on the slopes of salamandastron sapwood i never gave permission for you to fight outside you could have been killed by those rolling fire boulders not me sir hi was well out the way by the time they started pawterpaw combat is me best style beggin y pardon but this shootin arrows hout of winder slits an rollin boulders that haint fer the like o me face t face with the enemy his wot i fancy thats the way i fights best sir i know you do sergeant from all i hear you gave a good account of yourself out therebut ask me before you do anything like that in future good fight though wasnt it sir the squeaky voice of a hare no more than a leveret reached the ears of farran indeed it was young shorebuck how do you feel after your first battle tiptop mlud i say is that breakfast laid out for us fm jolly well starvin urthstripe chuckled goodhumoredty i never knew a young hare that wasnt always hungry go to it shorebuck seeing as it was your first fight you shall be the first to take breakfast farrans pale eyes lit up momentarily he listened to the young hare intently good show thank you sir mmm oatcakes an theyre still a bit warm pass me the honey sergeant git it yself you young rip i aint waitin on you tail n paw urthstripes voice cut in again oxeye did we suffer any losses or injuries none reported sah a jolly old bloodless victory wot though windpaw never showed up at roll call after the skirmish still i suppose shes got her head down in some quiet corner that hare cd sleep on a bally clothesline the next sound to reach farran was that of a pottery bowl smashing on the floor and a chair falling over shorebuck whats the matter old lad bart thistledowns voice came through loud and urgent i say looks uke hes chokin on a bit of scone lend a paw you chaps for the first time farran showed some sign of emotion his jpaw struck the rock wall of his hiding place in disappointment he had made the mixture too strong his poison wasworking far too speedily other voices crowded in on the ibxs ears give him somethin t drink clear his throat no hold him upside down shake him and pound his brian jacques salamandastron i cant sir the pore young uns all doubled up like out of my way sergeant here give him to me shorebuck shorebuck come on young feller stand up straight stand aside chaps let seawood through hes a healer there was a momentary silence then urthstripes anxious tones rang through the dining hall whats the matter with him seawood a pause followed then seawoods voice came through he was sobbing softly hes dead young shorebuck is dead sir dead surely not cant you do somethingherbs a potion its too late cant you see sir look at the way his poor face is all twisted and his body doubled up tight an stiff its poison id recognize it anywhere shorebucks been poisoned it must have been somelhin hes eaten sir the pore liddie feller was right as rain a moment ago spot on sarge he dashed t that breakfast board like a bally young trooper after his first fight urthstripes voice boomed through the dining hall get away from that table dont touch the food ferahgo tossed his knife high in the air and caught it by the handle he was in good spirits haha whats thirty or forty creatures slain theres always more where they came from thats what soldiers are for to kill or be killed whats the matter with your face backstabber klitch sat to one side with the four captains a scowl hovering around his blue eyes the whole thing was a waste of good fighting creatures ferahgo flicked the knife it stuck in the ground near his sons paw oh dear dear friends of yours were they are you sad because they were killed in the battle klitch ignored the dagger a fraction away from his footpaw dont worry old one im not going soft i couldnt give a split acorn whether your whole horde lives or dies i just think that getting farran inside the mountain could have been done easier with a whole lot less killed doghead a stoat captain was about to agree with klitch when he saw the wicked smile forming in the blue eyes of the assassin doghead looked at the ground and kept his comments to himself ferahgo retrieved his knife waggling it under klitchs nose its not important what a wetbehindtheears weasel like you thinks my son im your old daddy ferahgo the assassin and only what i think counts around here tell him you captains wont life be easier once the badger and his bares are dead from farrans poison and were lords of the mountain surely thats worth the lives of a few ragtailed scavengers badtooth the other stoat nodded the masters right klitch if farran does the job proper then it was a good plan without another word klitch jumped up and stalked off in high bad mood ferahgo winked at the four captains its a sad thing being young and thinking youre clever like that no one can outthink the old master remember that if he ever starts talking to you behind my back ill let him live because hes my son but anyone who plots with him ill kill stone deadafter skinning them alive of course now the next move if farran shows up and says theyre all poisoned inside the mountain well hack a way in and take over the place crabeyes the rat captain held up a paw respectfully but be should have been well out of there by now master what happens if he doesnt show up ferahgo sheathed his knife and winked at crabeyes that means hes still inside there oh dont worry farran has never let me down hell poison them all make no mistake but then ive become worried over mister farran of late maybe hes getting greedy and wants all the badgers pleasure for himself badgers treasure crabeyes sounded surprised ferahgo patted his back and smiled broadly badgers brian jacques salamandastron treasure friends didnt i tell you thats why i made you captains it will be too much for one i need four good loyal comrades to share the treasure withyou four keep it to yourselves though dont tell the others when we take salamandastron ill make you rich beyond your dreams well be five kings together the assassin watched the joyous greed shining from all four faces he had them hooked his tone dropped slightly theres just one thing however farran wants all the treasure for himself the poisoner has got to be removed greed turned to apprehension on the captains faces but ferahgo had them like clay in his paws have you ever seen the treasure of the badger lords i know for a fact that the center of that mountain is packed with gold silver jewels armor swords encrusted shields and all manner of wonderful weapons just think if you owned a fifth part of all that every creature in the land would be bowing their heads and fighting to kiss your footpaws once the badger and his hares are dead all that stands in our way is the greedy one farran now i think that between five warriors like ourselves we could manage to slip a dagger in his ribs while were congratulating him on a job well done so its either get rid of the black fox or back to the life of an ordinary horde soldier four paws touched that of ferahgos were with you master the assassin watched them as they went back to their duties as captains of his horde he threw back his head eyes reflecting the summer blue sky as he laughed aloud hahahaha fools the body of windpaw lay alongside that of shorebuck big oxeye gripped his javelin tightly found her in the top corridors sari slain by a different type of poison the filthy scum stuck somethin in her neck see the mark only a tiny wound but by the swellin it looks like poison urthstripes eyes were redrimmed from tears and wrath first it was young shorebuck i watched him during the battlehe would have made a great warrior had he lived now it is windpaw often pretending to be stern but with a heart as soft as a summer dawn she always took good care of my mara but now shes gone gone and theres some dirty low vermin going to pay for this i promise you a party of long patrol hares carried the bodies down to the lower caves where they could lie until such times as proper burial could be given on the shoreline where tide meets land urthstripe sat with seawood in the empty dining hall the hare turned out a kerchief containing dead ants poisoned all of themsome from the kitchens some from the foodstore these two here from the base of the water r barrels the badger lord brushed them away with a heavy paw is there none of our food or drink that has not been contaminated with poison seawood none siror at least none that we know of whos goin to trust any of our supplies i wouldnt were facin starvation urthstripe sighed as he covered his eyes with both paws leave me alone now i must think oh just one thing make sure that none of our creatures shows themselves to ferahgo or his vermin i want them to think were all dead then well see what his next move will be sapwood and oxeye were returning up a flight of spiral stairs hewn into the rock they were making their way back to the dining hall after laying shorebuck and windpaw to their tem porary resting place in the lower caves bart thistledown grabbed oxeye by the paw what was that oxeye was quicksighted he squinted in the direction indicated its a black shadow like a wait there oxeye bounded up the stairs with an amazing turn of speed hi you there stop brian jacques salamandastran the others arrived within seconds what was it ox did you spot anything the big hare scratched his eartips funny at first i thought it was a shadow but id swear on a carrot pie that it was a black foxlong sleek vermin with funny eyes urthstripe appeared in the corridor outside the dining hall fox did you say youd seen a fox inside the mountain oxeye oxeye was still slightly puzzled er yes an no actually the badger lord was in no mood for jesting or riddles stand up straight sirears up chin in chest out shoulders back paws at an angle of fortyfive degrees to the side legfur thats better now answer my question as a hare of the long patrol did you see a fox standing correctly to attention oxeye faced front as he replied sah difficult to tell sah couldve been a trick of the light sah looked remarkably like a black fox with odd eyes sah if it was the blighter went that way to the left along the corridor end of report sah oxeye threw a smart salute and stood awaiting further orders urthstripe paced up and down musing aloud hmm quick dark and sleek like a shadow slip in and out unnoticed a fox too that doesnt sound much like a fighter more like a creature that does things by stealth a spy or a poisoner maybe sergeant sapwood clenched his paws may hi ask yer permission to find this ere creature sir but a swift plan had already formulated in urthstripes mind permission denied sergeant i want this poisoner myself but if we are to capture him we must act with all speed right heres the plan split into two groupsoxeye you take one group up to the crater top immediately keep low so that ferahgos army cannot see you i want that crater top sealed off like a bottleneck so that the fox cannot get away sapwood take the rest and follow him when you reach the top pair off in twos and start searching the mountain thoroughly from top to bottom wedge off all exits window slits and the like if you do the job correctly the fox will have only one way to rundown i will be waiting in the cave where shorebuck and windpaw are lying off you go now ferahgo had been searching the base of the mountain poking sniffing and prying all around its mighty circumference a sizable contingent headed by doghead and dewnose followed him they watched as the assassin halted at a spot on the north side and marked a cross in the sand with his dagger here see the cracks and loose boulders its a fault in the rock this is where well tunnel in hah they should have eaten and drunk their fill by now in there thirsty work heaving all those boulders about and defending a mountain against my horde the poison should be working well if i know farran klitch perched on a rock slightly above his fathers head x tunnel in seems a lot of unnecessary work when we couldfind a window slit or even attempt unblocking the main en trance thatd save a lot of digging ј ferahgo toyed with the gold medallion around his neck ft dont worry klitch my son you wont be asked to get your dirty weve got an entire horde to do the job have never heard of the element of surprise if there is anyijbeast left alive in there and they still happen to be in fighting pitm theyd expect us to try unblocking one of the entrances we will be doing the unexpected doghead dewnose inake a start here theres loose boulders and lots of wide use spears pikes knives swordsanything but keep m at it rran the poisoner knew that his mission had failed all that ijfce desired now was to leave the mountain but try as he lid the black fox was frustrated at every turn salamanstron was virtually alive with determined hares fully armed and alert they scoured every nook and cranny from the top of the crater downward farran found himself running before them down ever down whenever he turned and tried going upward he was cut off by two pairs of angry determined hares coming from each side scurrying along one of the midlevel brian jacques salamaruias tron corridors he practically bumped into sapwood turning he dashed off down a flight of stairs with the sergeants voice ringing in his ears run you poisoner were givin you more of a chance than you gave two pore ares go on keep runnin vermin in desperation farran concealed himself in a dark corner until sapwood had passed by accompanied by pennybright the ghost of a smile flitted across farrans sombre face slipping out of his hiding place he mounted the stairs only to find himself facing the lance points of bart thistledown and starbob bart tapped his lancepoint on the steps up ycome laddie lets see what youre made of wot the black fox turned and fled taking the opposite direction to sapwood and pennybright behind him he could hear starbob and bart suddenly the passage ahead of him was cut off by seawood and a hare called moonpaw drawing his deadly greenhart dagger he backed off snarling the two hares made no move to attack merely covered the bottom of the staircase so that he could not go up hugging the opposite wall farran slid past them and sped off as he descended another flight of steps he could hear four sharp lance tips tapping behind him on the groundlevel corridor farran glanced left and right two more hares were coming from the left both with arrows nocked on drawn bowstrings he ran to the right narrowly avoiding two more advancing members of the long patrol the poisoner went helterskelter down a long spiral stairway carved into the rock tripping and stumbling he staggered into the final passage leading to the lower caves farther along the way hares flooded down silently from another stairway in front of him while at his back another group came down the spirals he had recently descended the sour taste of fear rose in the black foxs mouth there was just one place left to go the large cave in front of him it was a huge roughhewn place with torches placed plentifully in wall sconces there was a pair of raised stone slabs at the far end beside the bodies of shorebuck and windpaw lord urthstripe stood waiting in the welllit chamber he was unarmed save for a wet strip of linen that had been knotted at one end farrans pale eyes watched him warily as the long patrol crowded in the cave entrance blocking any possible way out the badger lord pointed to the two lifeless creatures laid out either side of him see how you have murdered my friends fox now the time for reckoning has come you must face me sapwood provide this vermin with any weapons he needs then stand back all of you nobeast is to lay paw upon the fox nobeast save me as night fell thrugg began piling up pebbles the otter moved stiffly his whole body aching from the fight earlier that evening out on the open land the crows were beginning to stir in the cool night air one or two were trying out desultory hops and caws rocangus glanced over the bank edge of the driedout streambed his fierce eyes watching them keenly och yon birds are startin tae work theyselves up again dumble had fallen asleep he muttered to himself and turned over a full moon rose like a dull gold platter as thrugg looked up at it a dark winged shape swooped low out of the night grabbing his sling the otter launched a hasty stone at the bird it banked and circled shrilling out angrily ach ye great lumphaided riverdog can ye no see ahm a falcon rocangus cocked his head on one

into a frenzy out on the open moonlit land they hobjigged and sang raucously thrugg covered the still sleeping dumble with his jerkin as he watched them anxiously rocangus matey i opes yer pals gets here afore those birds charge us we wont stand a butterflys chance agin that mob as if on cue six falcons dropped out of the sky into the streambed thrugg gave a startled jump phew that was quick a tall imposing elder with fearsome beak and huge talons folded his massive wings and winked at thrugg aye twas an all mah clans speedier on the wing than anything in yonder sky thrugg looked around doubtfully but theres only six of you theres undreds of crows out there beggin yer pardon o course the big falcon grinned fearsomely ach dinnae apologize streamdog we were searchin for that young rip

friend there well talk some mair later sit ye down while ah deal wi yonder bunch o disgraceful birds now the cawing and dancing had increased to fever pitch and the bolder crows were beginning to hop toward the streambed laird mactalon and his clanbirds broke cover they stood in a line on the banktop and threw back their heads kreeeekah tak nae prisoners give nae quarter kreeekah as if by magic the crows fell silent and ceased dancing laird mactalon and his falcons started walking toward them with a definite warlike swagger chests puffed and neckfeathers spread wide their talons crunching

matter surely youre no frighted all the time he was talking mactalon had been advancing with the speed of a whipcrack he suddenly hurled himself into the crows in the melee that followed four crows were stretched out by the deadly beak and raking talons of the laird the other crows took to the air in an awkward flurry they were met by the five falcon warriors who hit them like thunderbolts baby dumble was awake he sat on thruggs shoulders wideeyed as crows fell from the sky like tattered scraps of dark cloth eventually the crows made it back to the safety of the pine thicket they crouched among the trees as the six falcons circled in a warlike aerial display between the solamarulastron streambed and the trees crows dead and injured littered the ground like discarded rags thrugg and dumble cheered wildly but rocangus perched miserably on the haversack muttering away ach tis a sad thing tae be stuckit here on the ground by mah eggshell it is missin oot on a scrap the like o that landing back in the streambed with his clan members the laird contracted and dilated his big goldenflecked eyes as he preened his wing feathers delicately ah wisht ye could fly thrugg battlin in the skies is a grand thing sure enough och the wee dumble is awake an all how are ye bairn dumble offered his paw please ter meetcha mista the rest of the night they spent sleeping in the fragrant heather that grew along the far streambank safely surrounded by the six falcons next morning they were on their way again trekking northeast thrugg raised his head and saw the snowcapped mountains far off pushing their peaks up at the high blue summer skies rocangus flapped his good wing lookit tis a braw sight did ye ever see stones piled so high that winter snow stays atop o them in summer dumble the little dormouse nibbled on a candied chestnut i never seed mountings wiv snow goin ter play in it when us gets there eh ocaugus snow would have been of great use to cool fevered brows in redwall abbey

you said sister nasturtium bremmun sat up with an effort faith spinney plumped the pillows and pressed him back down hush now shes asleep probly just talkin to herself pore thing that nasty ol dryditch sickness has hit her worsen any of us two hours before dawn the deepcoiler came back the first thing mara and pikkle knew of it was the scream of a lookout shrew then all was chaos the quiet surface of the lake exploded into boiling action as the huge creature broke surface between the two boats they both tipped sideways and though maras boat stayed upright the other one overturned shouts and cries of dismay rent the air as a massive head thrust up out of the lake towering over mara and pikkle it was akin to something from the dawn of time fearsome eyes and teeth aglitter the creature blew out a foulsmelling stream of air and water as it dipped toward them with open jaws yelling with fright they struck at it with their paddles nordo and logalog sprang to their assistance splintering paddlewood flew everywhere as they battered wildly at the gargantuan head hissing balefully the deepcoiler flicked out a serpentine tongue mara saw the nightmarish cavernof its mouth as the thing came at her purplishred blotched with horrific rows of serrated teeth framing it the badger maid walloped furiously at the tongue with her shattered paddle as pikkle and the others hammered at the widespread jaws and teeth the monster veered away turning salamandastron its attention upon the capsized boat and its crew the shrews shrieked as they floundered and struggled in the water fighting to avoid the lashing coils that pounded the lakewater into a bubbling lather mara could only watch in helpless horror as the scaly behemoth seized a halfdrowned shrew in its jaws two others were cruelly trapped by the convolutions of its massive body as it twisted about slamming them against the hull of the overturned boat help badger help me please with his paws bound tubgutt was bobbing about in the roiling melee buoyed up by the air trapped in his fur mara grabbed the fat shrew and hauled him aboard quickly logalog nordo and the rest of the guosssom crew drew their rapiers they leaned over the side rocking the boat perilously as they stabbed repeatedly at the gigantic bulk that thrashed about between the two logboats nordo watch out pikkie hurled himself bodily at the shrew cannoning into him he knocked him out of harms way just in the nick of time the flailing tail whipped down mightily on the boat striking the spot where nordo had stood a split second before and smashing a large chunk out of the vessels side as suddenly as it had appeared the deepcoiler vanished down into the mysterious unfathomed depths of the lake taking with it three shrews instantly the surface was restored to mirrorlike calm logalog slung out a grappling hook on a line neatly snagging the upturned boat willing guosssom paws heaved to turn the craft upright mara pikkle and some others pulled the survivors to safety some semiconscious others injured but all grateful to be alive as mara released tubgutt from his bonds nordo sized up the situation well weve lost three good shrews and the provisions from the other boat just look at the damage to our boat pikkle was ministering to those he had rescued from the water these chaps arent too badly injuredknocked about brian jacques a bit mostly bruises an cuts well live t fight another day lads tubgutt went down on all fours taking maras paw he placed it on his head im sorry i ever spoke out against you badger i owe you my life from now on i will be at your side your friends are my friends and your enemies my enemies this i swear upon my oath as a guosssom shrew mara chuckled to hide her embarrassment thank you tubgutt but i wouldnt try to outscoff pikkle again if i were you next time you might swell up and explode minutes stretched siowly into hours dawn was a long time in coming as the two boats rocked gently on the surface of the great waters throughout the night watches everybeast sat awake too fearful for sleep logalog nordo and tubgutt repaired paddles as best as they could mara and pikkle issued a scratch meal from the depleted rations other shrews tended to their injured comrades all through the long night countless worried glances were directed at the silent dark waters dreading a return attack from the deepcoiler daylight arrived in rosy mistshrouded splendor lifting the spirits of the voyagers the sun banished wreathing vapors from the lake and a cloudless blue sky heralded another glorious summer day as they paddled over the vast deep trailing lines and small nets were thrown out and they trapped a few trout fry and some freshwater shrimps these were cleaned and spread in the sterns to cure by sundrying midafternoon brought with it a cry from the lookout land ho logalog had been baling out water from the damaged boat he looked up gratefully and called back where away its an island straight forard as we go mara stood carefully on tippaw sure enough there was an unmistakable smudge on the horizon that could only be an island of some kind scdamandastron pikkle bobbed up and down at her side well blow me down with a feather is that it i say good show i dont give a frogs hoot how many ghosty ol badgers live theretake me to it anythings better than floatin about out here waitin for that blinkin deepthingy to work up an appetite again logalog scooped busily at the water building up in the bottom of the boat fligg rungle lend a paw here this is worse than i thought weve got a crack running halfway under the hull huh well be lucky to make land in this leaky tub though we might stand a chance if we bale fast and paddle even faster mara took up a paddle and moved to the prow nordo pikkle and tubgutt joined her the badger maid struck out deep and strong right come on gousssom shrews lets see what youre made of me and pikkle are only landlubbers but ill wager we can paddle the paws off you idle lot nordo grinned across at her hah did you hear that lads come on lets show these two that were the sons of the roarin shrews paddles plunged deep as the logboat shot forth like an arrow each shrew defending the reputation of the guosssom as they bent their backs and rendered a lusty paddling shanty pull boys pull o were the sons of the roarin shrews and a logboat is the home we choose o pull me bullies pull now we can stamp an we can fight an paddle logboats day and night pull boys pull i was bom in a stream on a stormy day so i jumped in a boat and paddled away o pull me bullies pull a paddles me son an a boats me wife an the open water is me life pull boys pull o i can scoff an outfight you brian jacques im the paddlin son of a roarin shrew o pull me bullies pull not to be outdone the crew of the other logboat took up the shanty and began paddling harder soon it had developed into a fullblooded race the two boats fairly skimmed over the waters paddles flashing and bow waves throwing up spray for all his girth and weight tubgutt was a powerful creature he dug his paddle long and deep laughing aloud at pikkles unorthodox but effective methods the young hare was like some crazy jackinthebox ears flopping either side as he bobbed up and down grunting hard at each paddle stroke and improvising his own shanty o im a salamandastron lad an by my reckonin thats not bad scoff chaps scoff now listen shipmates while i say id rather scoff than paddle all day o scoff yvillains scoff i dont think that id feel so sore with an apple pudden in each paw scoff chaps scoff so set me down on good dry earth ill eat an snooze for all im worth o scoff yvillains scoff on through the afternoon the two logboats raced sometimes neck and neck but mainly with maras boat in the lead owing to the formidable strength and staying power of the badger maid and her friends because of the speed they were traveling the pressure on the hull of the damaged vessel was causing water to leak in ever faster logalog and the bailing party had their paws full trying to cope with the flow but caught up in the spirit of the race they battled on saiamandastron toward evening the island was beginning to loom large rearing up out of the surrounding deeps it was a high rocky outcrop fringed on top by foliage bushes and overhanging trees the red sky of eventide silhouetted it eerily still fearful of deepcoilers reappearance the guosssom paddled on with their last reserves of strength anxious to be ashore logalogs boat had settled low in the water pikkle urged the crew on with false cheerfulness i say you shameful shrews wallop those paddles a bit faster thats the ticket keep goin chaps think of all that lovely land to wiggle your paws on the lake was close to lapping over the boats sides as they nosed into a rocky inlet logalog jumped ashore and leapt onto a broad sheiflike ledge all ashore guosssom nordo loop a line over the stern rungle get one round the bows well haul her up here and see if we can make the old tub shipshape again it was dark by the time they had heaved the damaged logboat up onto the ledge both crews sprawled about on the flat rock resting after the days labors a small fire was built and food was shared out mara and pikkle squatted around the fire with logalog and nordo they ate shrewbread yellow cheese and nuts and drank their portion of the remaining shrewbeer the guosssom leader settled his back against the cliff which reared up behind him ah well we finally made it in the morning ill search out some pine resin wood and clay to repair the boat nordo youll take a crew and forage for supplies dont stray too far though stay within hailing distance of here mara my friend i dont need to tell you what you and pikkle have to do the young hare spoke around a mouthful of cheese and nuts spot on old lad weve got to go an have a chinwag with the bally ghost i suppose honestly the things a chap has t do i dont know which is worse actually gettin scoffed by old deepthingy or bein frightened to death by a spooky spirit brian jacques mara emptied her beaker and lay back yawning no need to worry about that until morning my old pikkle get some sleep while you can tubgutt came over and lay curled up close to maras footpaws like a faithful pet dog where you go i will too ill be there to watch your back tomorrow you can rely on me the camp fell still as the fire dwindled to dying embers the only sound was that of weary shrews snoring a myriad host of twinkling stars surrounded the waning moon in the night sky reflecting into the broad still waters beneath the peace that summer darkness brings fell over the slumbering earth it was some time shortly after midnight that everybeast on the ledge was dragged into wakefulness by a long echoing howl which boomed about cliff and lake like some sepulchral knell eeeee yoooooo laaay leeee aaaahhhhhh pikkles ears stood up like two pikestaffs he leapt across to mara and grabbed tight hold of her paws hellteeth and darkgates what was that early morning shed its light over the leafy canopy of far mossflower in the southwest spriggat tugged at the bowstring fastened around the tracker rats neck stir yer stumps yew rogue weve got ter catch up with that fox mind now you play us false an ill let rula the mad mole loose on ye right me beauty forard march off they went samkim stifling his laughter as the little molemaid muttered darkly to the trembling rat hoo urr oill chop off n ee tail an stuff it up ee nose then oill fetch some woild ants an let they darnce in ee ears thats after oi poured gurt globs o sticky mud oer ee vurrmint ead o course hoo urr an hair hoo convinced that arula was truly mad the rat led them on a straight course this was confirmed from time to time as spriggat found evidence of the other five trackers and dethbrush along the way there was a short halt at midday for refreshment though supplies were running low they managed a tasty little meal of apples cheese and some halfdisintegrated oatcakes spriggat found a ready supply of insects buzzing around the surface of a small patch of marshground caked from snout to paw brian jacques in mud he wandered happily about munching gnats wasps and other winged insects mmm a very nice liddle selection ereabouts very nice the afternoon was well on by the time the rat led them up a hilly rise in the woodland samkim held the bowstring lead walking at the trackers side on reaching the peak of the hill the young squirrel tugged sharply on the string get down lie still and be quiet he commanded the prisoner sensing the need for caution arula and spriggat bellied down crawling through the loam to join him yurr wot be amiss sanken arula whispered they followed the direction of samkims paw as he pointed downhill between the thickly wooded side of the slope a glint of running water could be seen below the great south stream spriggat whispered the young squirrel concentrated hard as he sniffed the air aye thats probably it but im convinced i can smell woodsmoke and hear voices down there what dyou think arula the molemaid moved her head this way and that wrinkling her dark button nose intently ho urr youm roight woodsmoke an voices it be samkim pulled an arrow from his quiver and held it point forward at the rats throat this could be a trap if youve played us false then your seasons are finished as of now rat the tracker swallowed hard not daring to shake his head with the arrow tip stinging his gullet dethbrush wouldnt hang about layin traps he only wants to get back to ferahgo as quickly as possible i told you hed be followin the course of the south stream samkim looked across at the hedgehog what do you think spriggat the old hedgehog stood up quietly well we cant lay about ere all day i say we goes down yonder an investigates roll over mis way rat the rat complied and was promptly gagged with a mouthful salamandastron of leaves spriggat wound the bowstring under his chin and over his snout effectively securing the gag and muzzling him right ho vermin lead on slow an easylike using the trees as cover they crept down the hillside toward the stream arula drew the heavy pruning knife she had brought with her from redwall giving her loaded sling to spriggat samkim gripped the unstrung bow ready to use it as a stave as they drew closer the sounds of creatures talking grew louder though what they were saying the friends could not tell spriggat hauled the rat from the cover of an elm trunk and did a short run forward pushing him into the cover of a yew thicket peering between the polelike branches he caught sight of a group of creatures arguing heatedly in gruff bass voices the hedgehog heaved a sigh of relief pushing the rat out in front of him he called to samkim and arula its all right yew tew no need to ide theyre shrews the shrews on the streambank turned at the sound of spriggats voice before anybeast could stop him one of them dashed forward drawing his rapier he ran the tracker rat through the heart realizing what had happened spriggat dealt the shrew a hefty crack over the head with his loaded sling roaring as he laid the creature out senseless yew stupid liddle murderer couldnt ysee the rat was tied up e was our prisoner an elpless vermin yew ad no right to slay im like that samkim and arula had now caught up with spriggat instantly all three were surrounded by shrews with drawn rapiers and heavy wooden paddles a mean thinlooking shrew was shouting kill them its the rest of the foxs gang kill them without thinking samkim threw back his head and yelled redwaaaaaaalllll the shrews held still a moment surprised by the call a fat old shrew gray with many seasons pushed his way through belaboring about him with a knobbly blackthorn stick enough of this killin talk cant ysee these beasts arent brian jacques vermin stand aside get out o me way gousssom the shrew who had been struck by spriggat rose moaning as he nursed a sizable bump between his ears kill the hedgepig he tried t murder me oooohhhh the old shrew brandished his stick at the speaker one more word racla an ill raise another lump atop of the one the hog gave to ye now then you lot put up those weapons do as i say or ill lay about yer with me stick muttering sullenly they complied and the old shrew winked at samkim im alfoh the elder were a colony of guosssom shrewstheres tribes of shrews all along this stream part of the main guerrilla union we pride ourselves on being the most civilized and reasonable of all the guosssom tribes thats why we call our group a colony and not a tribe y see but i suppose any shrewband has its loudmouths an hotheads like young racla there still i dont suppose hes altogether to blame after what happened here last night a fox and five rats mounted a sneak attack here while we were half asleep they stole our best logboat an killed four of our shrews one of the dead was raclas brotherthats why he ran the rat through without stoppin to ask questions anyhow well all sit down tgather an take a bite an a sup then you can tell me your end of the story twilight gleamed on the streamwaters seated in a large comfortable cavern facing the bank the three friends related their tale as alfohs colony members sat around listening hot acorn and chestnut dip was served with arrowroot wafers a large honeyed plumcake was brought out in their honor and dandelion wine and redcurrant cordial flowed freely spriggat munched away as he longingly watched two dragonflies hovering over the stream outside when the friends had finished their narrative alfoh leaned back in his deep pawchair and nodded i saw your sword it was a most wonderful piece of craftbeastshipbadgermade id guess now my friends what to do about all this if the fox is a good navigator he will eventually make his way salanumdostron down to the sea though if hes never sailed these waters before you can take it from me hell be as lost as a fish up a mountain samkim clasped his paws across a full stomach do you think well be able to catch him up alfoh pondered the question for a moment maybe we could but there are four ways he could go down to the sea into the great lake or up one of the back creeks that leads to a dead endall of these routes we could follow and catch up with him the other way leads under the mountains no creature would be stupid enough to follow anybeast that way arula blinked whoi be that zurr alfoh took a sip of wine and explained there are rapids a giant waterfall and caves besides nobeast knows whether you would come out on the other side of the mountain or keep going down into the earth forever racla touched the lump on his head gingerly his eyes were hot and angry as he glared at spriggat im not sorry i killed that rat first thing in the morning im goin after the others the fox is mine he killed my brother alfohs paw strayed dangerously near his blackthorn stick youll stay where you are until i give the word young racla tomorrow well take the other three boats and all go together as for revenge upon the fox i think samkim has a prior claim to you he needs to retrieve the sword for his abbey now lets all get some sleep weve got a full day ahead of us at dawn a light breeze from the sea fanned the flames of a small fire among the rocks on the shore by salamandastron klitch and ferahgo watched each other in the flickering light they were arguing again klitch had scored several points and his blue eyes twinkled maliciously at his fathers show of temper yah what do you know ferahgo spat into the flames derisively i was leading a horde before you were born you wouldnt know the back of an army from its front you snotnosed little upstart the young weasel grinned happy that he had his elder upset theres only one way to find out old grayhairgive command of the horde to me at least i couldnt make a worse mess of things than youre doing ferahgos eyes blazed with temper worse mess what worse mess ive burned all their crops from the mountainside poisoned all the food and drink they have and if theyre not already dead inside that mountain now ive got a team tunneling in so that we can make a secret entrance go on smartmouth tell me what youd do thats so brilliant tunneling in klitch laughed lightly sometimes you amaze me do you realize how thick that mountain is a butterfly would have more chance trying to knock down an salamandastron oak tree when do you expect them to break throughnext week next season in ten seasons time or twenty the assassin stood upright his gold medal gleaming in the firelight come with me ill show you midnight had long gone ferahgos diggers were well advanced but the assassins confidence would have wilted had he seen what awaited him inside salamandastron several hares were listening to the banging and pounding from the outside bart thistledown grinned wryly as he leaned on his lance well twist my ears the crafty ol blueeyed villain who wouldve thought he could find the old kitchen drain outlet it was blocked up when i was a leveret big oxeye took up a heavy spear and held it poised good thing you heard the diggin an gruntin barty mlad what dyou say we dig from this end give those chaps a bit of help if theyre so anxious to come in sapwood considered this proposition then shook his head persnally him agin it meself an lord urthstripe wouldnt be too appy about us elpin vermin let em do their own diggin they should be through afore momin well just wait ere nice n quiet penny you stand by when i tips yer the wink run an fetch is lordship pennybright stifled a youthful giggle righto sarge i cant wait to see what happens when the jolly old vermin break through the two captains doghead and dewnose were working like madbeasts they had got about two spearlengths into the rock the tunnel was going to work horde soldiers lined the narrow passage passing back loose boulders and shields piled high with pebbles and shale outside on the moonlit beach others were disposing of the rubble doghead and dewnose labored hard with iron bars and spearpoints levering away at the packed mass of stone that blocked the old kitchen drain both stoats knew that their lives depended on completing the tunnel nobeast failed ferahgo together they sweated and strained to prise out a big slab brian jacques salamandastron come on mate pull weve got it im pullin owow me paws jammedwait a sec migroo get yerself up ere squeeze in there an hold that bar while dogead gets is paw loose owen ok im free now get yer spearpoint in right about ere migroo ill take care of the bar watch out or itll slide down an trap yer paws crabeyes came crawling up the tunnel and pulled their tails outside you three the master an young klitch wants to see yer they crawled backwards out of the tunnel scratched bruised and covered in dust the assassin and his son awaited them on the sands ferahgo brushed aside their salutes questioning them anxiously well how is it going are you nearly through yet doghead wiped dirt from his eyes and licked his injured paw its just like you said itd be masterall loose rock none of it solid were over two spearlengths in now shouldnt be too long before we break through ferahgo smiled scornfully his crinkling blue eyes mocking klitch that sounds like a fine mess eh young knowitall klitch looked slightly taken aback but how did you know it was possible to tunnel at this spot ferahgo scooped up a pawful of sand and held it under his sons nose kitchen debris old nutshells broken bits of potterythats how sometime or other this has been an outlet when i checked i could see it wasnt part of the original rock only stones packed in there to block it off i was right you see cleverpaws now do you think that the old one is making a mess of things how wise of you father you have found a way in klitch put on an expression of respect and kept his tone apologetic now are you going to stand there sneering at me and patting yourself on the back all night or are you going to break into salamandastron ferahgos blue eyes smiled back and his tone was equally civil raptail bateye take this ignorant infant to one side will you now guard him carefully and dont let him get hurt keep him here while his father goes to do the work of a warrior klitch is a bit inexperienced for this sort of thing you know leaving his son fuming under the eyes of the two guards ferahgo drew his daggers and rapped out orders doghead dewnose bring a single torch the rest of you get fully armed and follow us keep silent in the tunne or else the flaring light of a brushwood torch threw elongated shadows across the horde members packing up the tunnel behind ferahgo and his two captains dewnose patted the large slab when they reached the head of the tunnel theres only this big un and a bit more behind it master then we should be inside the mountain the assassin sheathed his dagger and grabbed the spear from dewnose come out of my way ill show you how its done the muscles stood out like whipcords on ferahgos lean body as he pitted his strength against the slab it moved and slid angling it across the uneven floor he struck it hard with the spearbutt cracking it in two halves pass that along and shift it out the way move yourselves the assassin went to work on the remaining rocks with ferocious strength ripping them out with his bare paws goug iag with dagger and spearpoint hastily the rocks were passed back along the lines of hordebeasts jamming the length of the tunnel throwing back a last few small boulders and kicking aside debris ferahgo halted abruptly licking the edge of his favorite skinning knife he whispered to doghead were through feel that draft of cold airthats our first breath of salamandastron keep that torch aside a moment theres sotttebeast standing with their back to the entrance now listen carefully whoever it is ill stab him and drag him through brian jacques satamandastron for you and dewnose to finish him off then were in keep silent now and ill get him with the dagger between his teeth ferahgo inched quietly forward his murderous blue eyes shining with joy as he sighted the unprotected back of the creature at the opening when it came to silent death ferahgo the assassin was the acknowledged master throwing a paw round the creatures throat from behind he locked off the windpipe and slid the blade expertly between its ribs pulling back in one swift movement he threw the body to his captains finish him off quickly then follow me doghead pushed forward spear in one paw flaming torch in the other he turned the creature over to stab itand screamed ferahgo turned he took one look gave a strangled sob of horror and shot through the packed ranks for the open beach kicking and slashing as he went the body of parian the poisoner lay on the tunnel floor the face a twisted mask of fright the mouth wedged open wide by the adderskin belt with its poison bags that urthstripe had forced down the poisoners throat thus had the badger lord dealt with the murderer of his two hares the poisoned drinking water was standing by the entrance ferahgo had made lined up in cauldrons boiling hot as they were wheeled by urthstripe tipped each one with his spearbutt sending scalding water rushing into the tunnel as he roared at the top of his voice eulaliaaaaaa the hordebeasts packed inside the tunnel fought each other madly in a vain bid to escape the contents of the cauldrons spears swords pikes and other weaponry hindered them in the darkness as the blistering hot stream gushed out welling up into a steaming wave screams were drowned amid the boiling torrent smashed against the rocky walls the bodies hurtled the length of the narrow aperture to be spewed out on to the beach moonpaw starbob catkin thistle and seawood climbed back into salamandastrons east side throwing the sacks of dandelions apples berries and roots ahead of them sapwood helped each one in as they clambered through an unblocked window hole seawood and thistle came last cautioning the

deeper than ever tonight book three destinies and homecomers thrugg and dumble had arrived at the mountain stronghold of the laird mactalon they stood shivering among the high rocks unconscious of the beauties about them the laird mactalon spread his wings wide at the snowcapped peaks the setting sun had turned the ice and snow from white to a clear pink och tis a sight tae gladden yer feathers laddie baby dumble spread his paws gazing down at his fat little stomach i dont avven no fevvers ach so ye dinna would ye no like to be a falcon mactalons wide wing patted him nearly knocking him over

spend the night there was heather and bracken piled up in a corner but the place was dreadfully cold thrugg put some of the bracken to one side the rest he placed at the cavern entrance digging flint and tinder from the haversack he soon had a small fire going rocangus was wary of flames but the sight of baby dumble seated in front of the fire wanning his paws soon had the young falcon perched between thrugg and dumble enjoying the welcome heat rocangus had some words of advice for the otter mah faither says yere going up tae see the wild king in the momin be careful thrugg auld

had conquered his fear of the fire in fact he had rather come to like it the young falcon spent the night feeding the flames with heather and bracken while thrugg and baby dumble slept peacefully in the high snowcapped mountains of the north dawn in the high mountains was a strange sight thrugg shivered as he peered into the whiteness clouds had descended upon the peaks turning the whole place into a land of cotton wool there was no sky horizon or ground save for that beneath the otters paws settling dumble into the nearempty haversack thrugg cautioned him stay put matey an keep yore head down yell be nice an warm in there the laird mactalon flew in low and hovered outside the cave a guid mornin to ye thrugg are ye ready the noo thrugg gave his sling to rocangus ready as ill ever be lead on yore lordship rocangus stood waving with his good wing watching them until they were swallowed up in the mists it was a perilous journey thrugg needed all his strength and surepawed skill sliding down glacial valleys and ascending slopes of crusted snow scaling bare freezing rocks the otter pushed on keeping mactalon in sight all the time seeking for holds in crevices thrugg dug his paws in hauling himself strenuously upward ledges with thick icicles hanging like sets of organ pipes ranged each side of him grunting and panting he watched the falcon ahead flying upward ever upward battling almost blindly through the world of snow ice and white cloudbanks the otter often slipped and slid back but he was always back on the trail immediately gritting his teeth and wiping away the perspiration that threatened to freeze on his nose and whiskers ever mindful of the infant dormouse in the haversack strapped to his powerful shoulders thrugg lost all sense of time and space as he plugged doggedly onward and upward it was at the exact moment that he thought he could go on no more that laird mactalon wheeled down through the shrouding mist guid show laddie yeve made it yons the eyrie of king macphearsome ahll be waitin here for ye when brian jacques salamandastran youre done the rest is up to ye now thrugg ah wish ye the best o fortune raising his eyes thrugg saw the eyrie swathed in clouds it sat on a rocky pinnacle strewn with heather bracken gorse thistles and branches all faded dried and dead the only living plant that could be seen sprouting through the debris was the icetor flower small delicate white starlike with bluetinged petals almost invisible in the surrounding snow but mysterious and beautiful in its mountain isolation thrugg called up at the nest in a friendly tone ahoy there yer majesty its me thrugg of redwall abbey ive come to visit the wild king himself there was a crackling of heather and twigs the nest stirred slightly then macphearsome himself flew out the sight completely took thruggs breath away he had not been prepared for something like this snow flurried around his head as the great expanse of wings flapped downward and the wild king landed in front of him it was an awesome thing to see the colossal golden eagle towered over thrugg two massive feet sinking slightly into the snow lethal orangescaled talons digging in for leverage each of the heavily feathered golden brown legs was as thick as the otters body the eagle stood rooted on them as if they were twin oaks the staggering canopy of wings swooshed noisily as the bird folded them both over his mighty back the head dipped toward thrugg lighter browngold feathers framing the wild eyes afire with hunting lights macphearsome opened his curving amber beak like two bone scimitars parting ah doant like mah breakfast comin up here tae meet me hie awa an hide riverdog ahll come an hunt for ye thrugg swallowed hard and stood his ground majesty ive not come to harm yeh its the flowers of icetor im after theyre needed by my friends at redwall abbey where theres a great sickness the eagle king clacked his beak together like steel striking rock aye so ahve heard yon mactalon flew up an told me of this yer a tastylooking beastie thrugg o redwall tell me pray why should the macphearsome gie ye his flowrs thrugg took a bold step forward and raised his voice because o king theres creatures goin to die ifn they dont get the medicine made from your icetor flowers you wouldnt want the deaths of honest redwallers on yer mind now would yer majesty a fierce smile hovered about the wild kings eyes ah care no a whit fer beasties that doant live in mah mountains ach it wouldnae bother mah mind a wee bit tell me this thrugg o redwall whit would ye do if ah refused tae give ye mah flowrs answer true now riverdog thrugg took off the haversack placing it carefully to one side setting his paws apart he stared the eagle coolly in the eye then if youll forgive me for sayin majesty id fight you for them the lives of my mateys at the abbey means a lot ter me sir the golden eagles raucous laughter set the mountain peaks ringing he flew up knocking thrugg flat with the backdraft from his wings circling and soaring in and out of the drifting mists macphearsomes earsplitting screeches of merriment echoed and reechoed until the very air was full of the sound as suddenly as he had started the wild king stopped he landed back on the snow in front of thrugg and cocked his head one glittering eye staring at his challenger och weel ahve heard everythin noo yed fight me jings yer a braw beastie arightahll say that for ye thrugg o redwall mind yer the ony livin creature ever tae stand there an say that tae the wild macphearsome yer friends must mean a great deal to ye ye bonny riverdog fight me itd mak me grieve sair tae eat ye at that baby dumble clambered from the haversack and began attacking the golden eagles leg or at least one talon of it you leave mista thugg alone ya big bully dumble fight you one of the formidable talons looped through the infant dormouses smock and he was swung aloft close to the golden brian jacques eagles huge eye name o crags whit have we here ahm scairt an affrighted for mah life ye wouldnae kill me would ye mousie dumble swung a chubby paw at the eagle king dumble knock you beak off if you

tae produce sich braw beasties ahm thinkin ahd best gie ye the lector flowrs afore ahm siain by the pair of ye the great golden eagle spread his pinions beating wildly as snow flew up all around laughing and screeching in high good humor at his own joke on the snowy crag below them the laird mactalon pressed a wing hard over his heart to stop its racing beat and sat down flat glad to be off his trembling legs the high kings strange mood had favored thrugg and dumble instead of macphearsomes wrath they were receiving the lector flowers it was a huge relief for the falcon chieftain ee oo lay lee aaaaaahhhhh again the loud haunting cry rang through the wooded heights of the lake island above their heads shrews sprang up wideeyed and quivering with fright mara detached pikkle from her paws and grabbed a paddle whatever that is it had better keep clear of us because if it comes down on to this ledge ill brain it ghost badger or not nordo piled more driftwood onto the fire it burned bright crackling sparks up into the still summer night by its light mara looked around at the ashen faces of the guosssom shrews even logaiog seemed shaken by the unearthly call the badger maid knew they were close to panic so she set about dispelling their fears hah thats an old trick to keep us awake lord urthstripe used to do things like that at salamandastron to keep his hares alert didnt he pikkle she nudged the young hare sharply he jumped ow who what oh er rather ill say old thingummy was always runnin about in his nightshirt scarin the tail off some chap or other doncha know oh yes of course he brian jacques salamandastron couldnt frighten me or ol mara here we just snoozed through it all mara backed him up watching the guosssom beginning to relax haha yes remember he terrified bart thistledown and the poor fellow fell backward into a pot of hot vegetable soup hahaha hohoho will i ever forget it chum pikkle slapped his sides as he expanded on the tale there was ol baity with the pan stuck to his bottom chargin about yellin blue murder the shrews began smiling and tittering soon they were rocking with laughter as pikkle continued with the comical incident hahahaha dearie me i tell you fellers baity was the only one among us whod never look at vegetable soup again hes eaten nothin but jolly old porridge from that day t this if ever you ask him to tell you the tale hahahaha shall i tell y wot he says heeheehee he says dont mention the taleit was cooked to a turn ohohoho tail tale cooked to a turnget it reciting stories and telling jokes the two friends continued into the night until the incident was all but forgotten logalog posted sentries on the rock ledge the fire was stoked up higher and gradually the shrews dozed off one by one mara lay watching the fire pikkle lay some distance away though he could still see his friends face in the firelight she looked sad softly the young hare called across to her i say old gel whats up y look like a wet wallflower on a windy day the badger maid sighed and closed her eyes all those stories we told pikklelies the whole lot i wish it had been like that back at salamandastron id never have left ah well lets get some sleep goodnight pikkle pikkle watched as a single teardrop oozed from his friends closed eyelid i say steady on maybe we did tell a blinkin pack of fibs but it certainly calmed down those shrew chappies look theyre fast asleep the lot othem just like we should be gnight mara ol gel happy dreams wot logalog roused them as he threw more wood on the fire it had been light for nearly three hours come on you lot roll me log are you going to doze there all day breakfast was a hasty affair of meager rations preparations for the day were mapped out by the shrew leader logalog elected to go with nordo and the foraging party saying he would search for logboat repairing materials while they gathered what food the island had to offer six shrews were to remain behind on the ledge to guard the boats and keep the fire going mara and pikkle studiously avoided mentioning the nature of their quest so as not to upset the others arming themselves with rapiers and slings and accompanied by tubgutt as promised they climbed up the cliffs to the woodlands above and struck out for the center of the island leaving the guosssom to their chores it was a thickly wooded island small birds twittered in the foliage sunlight shafted through the leaves of beech elm oak ash sycamore and cedar tracing patterns of light and shade on the pretty forest flowers carpeting the ground pikkle found a cherry tree in full fruit and they sat beneath it eating the softest dark red cherries apples and pears too grew in profusion pikkle flicked a cherry stone in the air i say this is all rather nice chaps a body could get used to this the blinkin place is a paradise look theres a sweetchestnut treebeech and hazelnut as well flop my ears if a ghost does live here he must be a blinkin wellfed old spook yowch go easy with those cherry stones mara what are you gabbling on about ffolger the badger maid looked at him quizzically gabblhv im not gabblin mdear gel just quit chuckin jolly ol cherry stones at me thats all mara indicated a small heap of cherry pits at her side ive brian jacques scdamandastran not thrown a one mine are heresee pikkle clapped a paw to his eye yowch now listen old tubthing throw one more cherry stone at me an ill squidge a cherry right on your bally nose tubgutt was a serious shrew not given to practical jokes i dont throw pips at other creatures pikkle dont blame me yowch well who theow there goes another one mara looked up swiftly and caught a glance of a fleeting grayish creature flitting through the treetops aha theres somebeast up there come on it went that way dashing between the closegrowing trunks they chased after the shadowy figure but it was a pointless exercise whatever it was had them easily outdistanced the three friends stopped in a small clearing panting from the hard run a pool of crystalclear water provided them with a refreshing drink as they drank pikkle watched the treetops reflected in the surface of the water leaning close to mara he whispered its back again the bally things watchin us from the top of that beech tree yonder what we do mara kept her face down and her paws cupped as she drank water ah yes i see it now pay no attention well let its own curiosity get the better of it look its coming lower traveling in small jerky runs the creature was moving down the beech trunk toward the ground tubgutt watched the reflection in the pool with mara and pikkle what do you suggest we do now mara its down on the grass now mara had lost the reflected picture she took a quick glance over her shoulder the creature had started moving across the clearing behind them its a squirrel the badger maid hissed to her friends when i give the word we must move fast cut it off from the trees and surround it in this clearing pikkle youre the fastestget behind it tubgutt go to the left ill go to the right that way the only place it will have left to run will be straight into this pool ready go the plan worked neatly dashing out they had the squirrel boxed in as they moved closer it backed toward the pool it was a female incredibly small and thin traces of its former red showing beneath the fur that was heavily grayed with age she stood with her back to the water baring toothless gums at them mara held out her paws in a sign of peace i am mara this is pikkle and tubgutt we mean you no harm why were you throwing cherry stones at us i could understand if you were a young playful squirrel but one of your seasons you surprise me with your infantile behavior the ancient creature did not reply she swayed from side to side seeking a chance to dash off but there was no escape likely pikkle stepped closer wagging a paw at her how would you like it if i aimed cherry stones at your bonce marm what i mean is hang it all cant a chap scoff cherries in peace in this island the squirrel opened her mouth wide and let out a long shrill call eulaliaaaaaa there followed a silence pikkle shook his head disapprovingly is that all youve got to say for yourself old lady dearie me i can see this conversations goin nowhere fast wot there was a rustling in the woodland at their backs the squirrel nodjjed with satisfaction before speaking youll be sorry you came to this island its you who are surrounded now not me a heavy crashing in the undergrowth caused the three friends to turn round two badgers came thundering out of the woods one a female as old as the squirrel but the other was a huge male white as driven snow and whirling a big knotted oak club they roared as they burst into the clearing eulaliaaaaaa pikkle and tubgutt stood openmouthed with shock but mara stood forward a tiny shrew rapier in one paw twirling a loaded sling in the other the battle light shone in her eyes i am mara of salamandastron stay out of the way old brian jacques mother you white one come a step closer and ill slay you the white badger looked for a moment as if he were going to charge forward but mara noted the fierceness dim suddenly from his face and his massive paws quivered as he stood undecided get in there and fight urthwyte the old female badger stamped her paw down angrily go on shes a mere puppy compared to you flatten her mara came forward lightly poised on ready pawpads her neckfur bristling fangs bared aye come on urthwyte youre a fine big beast lets see if you fight as good as you growl pikkle and tubgutt stood to one side out of the whole thing the confrontation was between two badgers to get in the way meant certain death pikkle however noticed as mara did that the white badger for all his size and muscle seemed unwilling to offer battle the young hare called encouragement to his friend watch him mara remember sergeant sapwooddodge and weave dont try a paw to paw with this rascal hes too big mara was still moving forward urthwyte what have we taught you the old squirrel chattered angrily kill the creature ooooh loambudd kick his tail for him good n hard as mara advanced the older badger loambudd gave urthwyte a hefty shove in the back go on you big lump fight the white badger stumbled forward into mara accidentally catching her off guard he closed his eyes averting his head as he grabbed her the breath left maras body in a great whoosh two enormous vicelike paws lifted her clear off the ground and she was pinned helpless in midair with the great white badger shouting look just leave me alone will you i dont want to fight let me be or ill squeeze you hard mara felt as though her whole body was trapped in a mighty press her eyes bulged and she fought for breath pikkle pushed tubgutt aside as the shrew ran forward drawing salamandastron his rapier the young hare set his jaw grimly as he thwacked down a loaded sling viciously on the white badgers footpaw enough of this y great bully put that maid down this instant it worked like a charm the big simple badger dropped mara in a heap as he hopped about on one leg rubbing his smarting footpaw urthwytes lower lip jutted resentfully as he muttered im not a bully shes the bully anyway why are they always trying to make me fight pikkle patted his head there there old lad its not your fault the squirrel rushed in chattering you leave him alone hare who asked you to come to our island in the first place go away and leave us in peace loambudd the old female badger went to attend to mara rubbing her ribs and patting her back until the badger maid regained her breath she was very motherly and considerate stay there mara lie back and take deep breaths theres nothing broken ashnin i dont think these creatures mean us any harm well they had me surrounded and captured the squirrel folded her paws stubbornly pikkle gave her a playful shove oh go on with you granny you started it by invadin me with bloomin cherry stones ashnin gave a cackling laugh good shot arent i never missed ye once urthwyte tugged ashnins tail complaining aloud just like a small badger babe im thirsty is it al right to have a drink the old squirrel threw up her paws in mock despair oh go on you great white tripehound but dont go drainin the pond leave some for others they all sat at the edge of the pool as urthwyte sucked in great noisy gulps of water likea thirsty babe loambudd shook her head look at him the son of one of the greatest badger warriors ever to put paw on grass ah but its not all his fault brian jacques urthwyte raised his dripping white snout from the water im hungry its well past lunchtime nin the old squirrel tugged his ear sharply tell me a time when youre not hungry you big scoffbag she turned to the three friends i suppose youre all hungry too dyou want lunch pikkle bowed gracefully and kissed her wrinkled paw feed us o beautiful one and were yours forever oh go on with you longshanks she cuffed the young hares ear lightly i can see youd take more feedin than a whole army just by lookin at yeh loambudd stood up and beckoned them follow me youll have to put a move on though i put a leek and mushroom pastie in the oven before ashnin called i just hope it hasnt burned the two badgers and the squirrel lived a short distance from the pool in a beautiful natural cave mara looked about admiringly it was spacious and well ventilated two long windows had been carved through the rock which stood like a hump in the forest flowers and trailing plants decorated the windowsills woven rush matting carpeted the cave and there were several large seats carved from dead logs these were spread with soft barkcloth covers the rock had been carved in one corner to form a fireplace and a wide oven in the center of the cave was a fine table of rock slab adorned with bowls of fruit they washed their paws in a trough by the entrance and sat round the table as urthwyte and loambudd brought the food pikkles eyes lit up and tubgutt gave a small growl of anticipation a crisp salad of fennel hazelnuts young dandelions and scallions was placed on the table followed by a giantsized leek and mushroom pastie its steaming golden crust adorned with watercress a large pitcher of cherry cordial and beakers came next with cold mintflavored springwater standing by in another jug apples baked in honey with dollops of yellow kingcup cream topped the whole thing off with a wide flat sugared plumcake standing by as an extra saiamandas tron ashnin and loambudd ate sparingly encouraging the younger creatures to have as much as they likedthough little encouragement was needed mara ate steadily but pikkle tubgutt and urthwyte went at it as though they were facing a tenseason famine while they were enjoying the food mara noticed a black stone on a leather thong hanging over the fireplace she nudged tubgutt is that logalogs famous blackstone tubgutt rose from the table going over to the stone he touched it and bowed low reverently aye this is the blackstone of all the south stream shrews urthwyte leaned back and stretched out unlooping the stone and its thong he swung it back and forth a mischievous grin hovering on his big face oh this i took it from a shrew who trespassed on our island a long time ago the little rascal took off like a shot he mustve thought i looked like some kind of ghost in the dark ha ha most creatures do yknow i used to play with this stonedrearylooking old thing isnt it you can have it if you like mara he passed the blackstone over noting with a smile the gratitude on her face the badger maid accepted the stone winding the thong around her paw thank you very much urthwyte this stone means a lot to the tribe of tubgutt and to the father of the shrew you took it from loambudd served pikkle a great chunk of pastie so thats what two boatloads of shrews came all this way for a simple black pebble on a string well i never we thought theyd come to settle herethats why we got urthwyte to sound his ghost cries last night i hoped itd frighten them off ashnin nibbled a fennel leaf watching mara with shrewd eyes but you never came here just for a piece of stone missie mara took a drink of the cool mintwater no i came because logalog the shrew leader wanted me to once he gets the blackstone back his authority as guosssom leader brian jacques will be complete then he will take me and pikkle to the sea in his logboats to help urthstripe in his fight against ferahgo ferahgo the assassin urthwytes voice roared out like thunder as he threw back his big chair and reared up a picture of massive ferocity all traces of his former gentleness gone as fury blazed from hot angry eyes set above savagely bared teeth ashnin and loambudd rushed round the table they clung to the white badgers paws trying to pull him back down into his chair he was yelling at the top of his voice ferahgo the assassin ferahgo the assassin the three friends helped to calm him down and get him seated he was shaking and trembling all over the food in front of him forgotten ashnin slipped a small quantity of powder into a beaker of cherry cordial and gave it to him here drink this all up and go outside take a nap in the clearing and youll feel better go on obediently the big badger drained the cup and shambled off out of the cave when he had gone loambudd seized maras paw urthstripeyou mentioned urthstripe is he alive mara looked puzzled yes of course he is urthstripe is the badger lord of salamandastron he is a great warrior and also a stern old guardian thats why i left salamandastron loambudd sat back in her chair shaking her head as she wiped away tears with a distracted paw urthstripe alive so that little striped babe escaped the assassin somehow tell me about him what does he look like is he as big as his brother wait tell me everything all about my grandson and about yourself too young one the badger maid related the story of her life and all she recalled of the badger lord from the time she became the adopted daughter of the mountain up until the time she landed with the shrews at the island three long shrew logboats shot out into the waters of the great south stream the dawn was gray and overcast with a warm blustery wind coming out of the northeast in the prow of the lead boat samkim arula and spriggat sat with their paddles shipped there was little need for paddling in the fastflowing current with the wind astern of the vessels arula chuckled with excitement as the sturdy craft skimmed and bobbed over the rushing waters huhurr boaten beats walken boi arf a seasons march now and then spriggat would lean to one side and snap at the odd passing winged insect huh goin too fast fer an og to catch a bite samkim crouched in the prow with alfoh together they scanned ahead for signs of dethbrush and his five trackers spray blew up into the young squirrels nostrils it was his first time on a shrew logboat and he found it very exhilarating winking across at affoh he called over the rushing stream noise this is the life eh makes me wish i was a shrew the elder nodded as he shouted back you like it good your fox would have had to come this way because of the speedy current we can follow this way until we get below the rapids brian jacques rapids spriggat gave a squeak of dismay you never said anythin about rapids where are they up there a piece alfoh nodded ahead dont worry theyll come soon enough ill pass you the word when they do frequently the shrews would use their paddles to negotiate a rock or ward off floating driftwood but the pace was becoming faster all the time and the banks shot by in a blur of green and brown as alfoh roared out directions and warnings duck your heads overhangin willows comin up arula barely made it receiving a smart clip from a branch rock to port get those paddles lined up samkim shoved hard with his paddle feeling the shock run through his paws as it struck stone he pushed and felt the boat skip out away from the rock wood stickin up midstream paddles to starboard spriggat and arula paddled furiously sighing in relief as they whizzed by a tree trunk that had stuck in the muddy bottom alfoh brought his mouth close to samkims ear no signs yet but dont worry well catch the blaggards here come the rapids now stow yer paddle an hang on tight samkim threw his paddle in the logboat bottom gripping the sides tightly as he heard alfoh yell out rapids ahead stow all paddles an hang on white water boiled up over the prow drenching samkim as the boat dipped and hurtled crazily into a mad world of foaming writhing waters at the stern two experienced shrews sculled with their paddles slewing the craft around jagged rocky outcrops arula threw herself into the bottom of the boat digging claws hiding her eyes in fright oohurr oim bound ter be a drownded mole choild afore sunset like a roller coaster the logboat tore through the rapids sometimes with water gushing over the sides other times with the hull groaning as it scraped over submerged rock ledges sterns up heads down the three vessels weaved and twisted with terrifying speed down the perilous watercourse samkim was amazed the shrews seemed to take it all solamandostron in their stride neither laughing nor looking fearful they battled away with expertise competence written all over their faces finally after one long watercourse that seemed more like a waterfall than a rapid they splashed down into a semicircular lagoon with a thick covering of foamy scum lying slowly swirling on its surface behind them the rapids crashed and roared in watery chaos dipping their paddles they began pushing on down the wide calm stream traveling easily they felt possessed of an overwhelming tranquillity after the turmoil of the rapids the sky was still lowering and overcast wind soughed softly through the sedge at the banks and margins as the three logboats forged ahead it was midday when the stream ahead split two ways and alfoh held up a paw and called out bows into yon middle bank they headed into the tongue of land that protruded at the parting of the stream leaping ashore alfoh pointed to a high giant hornbeam mollo shin up that there hornbeam tree an scout the lay o the waters a sprightly young shrew bounded forward but samkim beat him to it shrews to water but squirrels to trees my friend like a shaft from a bowstring the young squirrel shot up the towering trunk alfoh watched him in amazement arula nudged the old shrew burr owzat furr cloimen zurr ee be a gudn our sanken the giant hornbeam was so high that it was difficult to see samkim when he was at the top with the speed and agility of a born climber he whizzed back down again leaping lightly to the ground eager to deliver his news i could see them i could see them theyve taken that stream on the left alfoh leapt back into the boat lucky for them thisn on the right wouldve taken them into another waterfall and the mountain caves how far away are they samkim jumped in beside him only about two hours good paddling id say brian jacques the boats pushed off down the left fork of the stream it sloped slightly and ran straight as a die as far as the eye could see alfoh struck out with his paddle seems theyre headed right for the sea but keep your eyes peeled anyway you never can tell wi vermin the wind increased now dark cloud masses could be seen drifting over from the northeast spriggat snapped up a mayfly that had been silly enough to try a landing on his paw looks like rains goin to bucket down afore long halfway through the afternoon alfoh peered at the left bank it was heavily overgrown with willows and bushes he had been watching out for this particular place pull over here shrews thats it now back water an hove to samkim watched intently as the elder inspected the thicketed edge what is it alfoh what are you looking for alfoh slashed at some vegetation with his rapier and pulled a clump of bush lupin to one side hah i thought so look here it was a hidden side creek overgrown by bush and tree which wound its way into thick woodland alfoh ponted to recent scrapes in the clay of the bank at water level aye thats a fox for ye always one jump ahead of a grasshopper the villain knew wed follow t get our boat back so hes sidetracked off down herethough i suspect he doesnt know where hes goin to this isnt the way to the sea whurr do et lead to zurr affaloh arula peered up the dim overgrown waterway alfoh scratched his chin only one place it can lead to arula the great lake it was like paddling through a long green tunnel the water reflected the trees overhead as they crowded low and the mossy banks and everywhere was green samkim looked at the faces around him tinged by the green light apart from salamandastran the muted sound of paddles they were in a cocoon of verdant silence spriggat paddled and snacked upon various winged denizens of the hidden waterway lifting his eyes as the splash of water on the leaves above announced the arrival of the rain they ate as they went passing back oatcakes and small fruit scones preserved in honey and flower syrup arula took gulps of cooling lilac and rosewater from a hollow gourd and passed it to spriggat yurr washee flies down zurr all along the waterway there were signs that the fox had passed in the stolen boatbroken branches bruised plants and scrapes in the mossed banks the wind increased overhead howling a dirge through the treetops the banks started to rise higher and the watercourse flowed faster as it took a downward slope suddenly alfoh pointed ahead to the stern of a logboat vanishing round a bend there they are dig those paddles deep weve got em dethbrush heard the shout looking over his shoulder he called to the five tracker rats paddle for your lives its those shrews other side streams swollen by the rain began gushing into the watercourse and the stolen boat picked up speed zinging along on its downhill course to the inland lake behind it the three logboats raced to catch up dethbrushs boat tipped dangerously and took off into the waters of the great lake with a loud splash it was followed soon after by the guosssom boats now all four were in the open waters the howling northeast wind whipped the surface into foaming gray waves driven along in a wild slanting downpour of battering rain samkim wiped rainwater from his eyes shielding them with a paw as he tried to keep his sight focused on the boat ahead the storm drove it powerfully over the wavecrested waters up and down bobbed the prow of samkims boat driving deep into the troughs and being lifted high upon the crests the crew pulled with might and main brian jacques until samkim could see the back of the fox drawing closer weve got em lads dig those paddles deep with a shrew rapier in his paw the young squirrel stood balancing as far out on the prow as he could go paddle paddle you waterwallopers within a third of a boatlength samkim braced himself and took off with a mighty leap hurtling across the water with the waves almost hitting his paws he sprang across the gap between the two boats to land scrambling for balance on the stem of the foxs boat a rat raised a paddle at him but samkim ducked and thrust in one movement taking the tracker through his midriff dethbrush turned brandishing the sword of martin the warrior he advanced on samkim calling above the storm come on ill carve your gizzard to doll rags s death for you young un ferahgo lay stretched upon the rock an old cloak that belonged to him had been soaked in seawater by sickear and thrown over him to heal his scalded back he sprawled flat on his stomach feigning sleep watching the shoreline through halfopen eyes the assassin was expecting an attempt upon his life whether from klitch or some other source he knew not but he was certain of one thing injured leaders were a good target for the rebellious when his penetrating stare caught the telltale movements far out among the rocks of the shore he called sickea to him the rat was weary after nursing ferahgo all day he lolloped across and threw a desultory salute yes master can i be of service ferahgo rose slowly shaking his head no sickear youve done enough for one day you look tired expecting a reprimand the rat came to attention no master im fresh as a daisy its my duty to get you well the assassin ruffled the rats ears goodnaturedly and a splendid job youve done of it sickear my own mother couldnt have nursed me better listen im just going to see what that son of mine is up to you can have the rest of the night off come here lie down on this rock its flat and brian jacques solamandosrron smooth come on now i wont take no for an answer the rat complied somewhat hesitantly but ferahgo was right the rock was cool and smooth he stretched out on it and yawned thank you master oh its the least i could do ferahgos blue eyes smiled lovingly here lei me cover you with this cloak you wouldnt believe how soft and soothing a drop of your sear water has made it there how does that feel sickear relaxed mmmm it feels really good master ferahgo ducked down and stole off into the rocks within moments sickear was slumbering peacefully the damp cloak protecting him from the early night breezes that drifted about the darkened shoreline forgrin had sharpened an edge and point upon his sword all afternoon and raptail had driven a sharp spike through the top of a wooden cudgel they crept slowly across the rocks toward the still draped figure lying on the flat stone near the tideline of the two forgrin was the bolder he popped up from behind the rocks and bobbed down again see rap not a sentry in sight i told yer young klitch as taken charge of the rest thisll be a piece of pie youll see raptail nodded at the fox and brandished his cub listen mate im scared i dont mind tellin yer suppose ferahgo wakes up forgrin pawed the blade of his sword grinning at the rat ive sent many a beast to sleep wi this liddle beauty none of them ever woke up come on lets git it done afore yer nerve runs out altogether not even daring to breathe they stole up on the supine figure forgrin felt confident standing over the cloakdraped creature he could not resist a quiet snigger weasel yer way outta this one weasel he drove the sword downward with both paws the cloaked figure gave a gasp and went rigid raptail thudded two solid blows of his club to the covered head and leapt back is e dead mate stick im agin ter make sure oh hes quite dead theres no need to stick him any more the voice was unmistakably that of ferahgo raptail died with a faint moan as ferahgo dispatched him with his skinning knife almost carelessly in passing not even bothering to glance at the fallen rat the assassin turned to the fox forgrin was shaking uncontrollably the blue eyes looked almost jolly as they smiled through the night at him see weve killed a rat apiece you murdered sickear and i slew raptail now what happens do you kill a weasel or do i kill a fox terror had robbed forgrin of his power of speech a gurgling noise escaped his throat as he turned and ran along the beach ferahgo could throw a knife better than any creature the long skinning knife took forgrin between the shoulder blades before he had got thirty paces his eyes were glazing over for the last time as the assassin retrieved the knife oh i forgot to tell you ferahgo whispered close to his car this game ends with the weasel killing the fox sweet dreams forgrin ferahgos back felt much better as he strolled along the beach his brilliant blue eyes lit up with happiness urthstripe watched from the top of the crater with sapwood and big oxeye below them on the shore masses of torchlights were moving away from salamandastron sapwood nodded toward them hi wonder what theyre hup to now ox the big hare leaned on his spear you tell me ol chap you tell me from up here it looks remarkably like a flippin wholesale retreat wot urthstripe shook his great striped head ferahgo doesnt give up that easily he wants us to think its a retreat what weve got to figure out is why brian jacques soanumdastron why what sah why ferahgo wants us to think hes retreating by my stripe oxeye sometimes i think your brains been scrambled by all the fighting youve done big oxeye let one ear droop and grinned quite possibly sah i often think that mself shall i take a couple of the chaps an investigate the badger lord pondered the question for a moment hmm im not overfond of spyingmuch sooner have a straight battle but if we want to know what the vermin are up to suppose wed better resort to a bit of intrigue sapwood you

pennybright watched as urthstripe rolled the boulder closing the main entrance pennybrights eyes shone with admiration theres not a creature in the world as strong as lord urthstripe ill bet twenty of us couldnt budge that boulder sapwood pushed her lightly urging the young hare onward that aint nothin to some of the things hive seen is lordship do shake a paw penny we aint got all night padding silently over the sands the three hares tracked in the direction taken by the main body of the horde klitch spread his soldiers out behind them in a wide halfcircle striking flint to tinder he ignited a torch and waved it ahead of the three hares sixty more fully armed creatures filed out from the rocks fanning out into another semicircle they trotted swiftly to join up with the others completely ringing the three hares inside a wide circle that was closing rapidly sergeant sapwood dropped into a fighting crouch his eyes glittering pugnaciously nice of em to send a welcomin committee t meet us eh ox big oxeye stood back to back with him placing pennyv bright facing salamandastron life aint always true an just a villainous vermin you cant trust no doubt youve heard that old rhyme penny well

stick by me an hoxeye missie weve fought our way out of tighter c corners than thisn believe me now the circle was drawing tight klitch stood outside it his blue eyes shining triumphantly in the torchlight well well what have we here three bold warriors sent by the badger no doubt youll be wanting to fight sorry to disappoint you though oxeye hefted his spear chuckling with anticipation oh brian jacques salamarulas tron dont fret laddie buck we wont disappoint you come on now step up an taste some cold steel from salamandastron or havent y got the nerve for it you slimy little weasel klitch had been stalling for time but now he saw his soldiers had found the rope ends poking up out of the sand he gave the signal now they tugged hard and the net was unearthed from just beneath the sand with a yell they charged inward the three hares fought to keep their balance as the heavy twisted fibers of the net appeared through the sand beneath their paws in the confusion that followed sapwood yelled to oxeye were trapped see if y can get penny away from ere oxeye dropped his spear knocking the javelin from pennybrights paws as the sergeant lashed out all round at the yelling mob that scrambled forward holding the net high exerting his great strength big oxeye grabbed pennybright and lifted her bodily over his head jumping high he hurled her over the heads of the vermin and the closing net run for home gel eulaliaaaaa sapwood went down under the weight of creatures who piled in throwing the coils over him and oxeye seconds later they were clubbed senseless and wrapped in the snares of the fiber mesh pennybright hit the sand in a stumbling run a stoat managed to grab her but she bit his paw to the bone and he let go with a squeal of pain the young hare righted herself and ran flat out for the mountain the breath sobbing in her throat as she thought of her two friends lying trapped glancing over her shoulder she saw klitch and dragtail speeding after her sand flew beneath her paws three stoats were racing madly trying to cut her off before she could reach the mountain an arrow whizzed by pennybrights head and dragtaii was notching another shaft on his bowstring she swerved ducking left and right an arrow hummed viciously by clipping her ear as she went the mountain loomed large as pennybright yelled with the last of her lungpower eulaliaaaaaaa one of the stoats screeched as he went down with a javelin sticking out of him like a flagpole bart thistledown moonpaw and urthstripe came bounding out of the main entrance bart unslung his bow and fitted an arrow as he ran loosing off the shaft he sent another stoat limping off with an arrow head lodged in his paw the remaining stoat turned tail and ran off as urthstripe grabbed pennybright and swung her up over his shoulder klitch and dragtail had stopped running their quarry had escaped the young weasel hurled a stone at urthstripes back as the badger lord turned to go inside the mountain it missed and bounced harmlessly off the rocks he stood paws on hips i shouting be sure to watch the shore tomorrow urthstripe f see what im going to do with your pet bunnies hahahaha urthstripe put his shoulder against the boulder and heaved it back into place bart thistledown poured a small beaker of ј water from their meager supply and made pennybright drink v it slowly dont fret penny old gel losin a battle doesnt mean weve lost the war ferahgo watched as klitch directed his soldiers todrive stakes deep into the sand keeping his voice casual the assassin addressed his son f forgrin and raptail are both dead your little plan failed v klitch picked up a mallet and gave one of the stakes a knock oh yes and what plan was that old one ferahgo seized klitchs paw holding the mallet still the ft plan to kill me i killed forgrin and raptail h very clever im sure klitch wrenched his paw away s and went on hammering at the stake but i know nothing of any plan to kill you my plan was to take hostages and ive done that if id planned to kill you i wouldnt have failed at that either out of my way old weasel brian jacques big oxeye peered through the net holes at klitch and his soldiers driving stakes into the sand what i wouldnt give for two minutes alone with that evil little brat we fell fer that one ox sapwood rubbed his head ruefully hi wonder what theyre acookin up for us a ferret jabbed a spearbutt at him laughing nastily wouldnt yer like to know well you ave a nice sleep an youll find out tomorrer the joseph bell tolled out mournfully across a quiet summer morning mrs

abbey oh ye didnae tell me ye lived in sich a braw nest dumble the infant stumbled from the haversack wreathed in lector flowers it notta nest birdie its a habbey called redwaaaaaalllll in the island cave mara listened with amazement to the tale that loambudd told my son urthound was the strongest and wisest badger in all the southwest lands and his wife urthrun was famed for her beauty and gentleness they ruled and protected the southwest and were loved by all urthounds father urthclaw had been dead many seasons i was alone and there was trouble in the land so urthound took me in his home to live with him it was autumn and urthrun had given birth to two beautiful badger babes male twinswe named them urthwyte and urthstripe the trouble was called ferahgo the assassin and his gang of corpsemakers he was young and evil a blueeyed weasel who murdered for pleasure with an army of vermin to back him up that winter the babes were scarce one season old the snow was deep and the weather hard if i had known that ferahgo was in the area of my sons home i would never have gone out into the woodland that day to gather snowdrops but i think that my son had arranged some sort of meeting with ferahgo it was urthound who asked me to go and gather the snowdrops for his wife though i know now that he only did it to get me out of his home lest i should attack ferahgoi was a mighty fighting badger when i was younger be that as it may off i went into the winter woodlands to gather snowdrops when i returned it was to find an awful scene of ferahgos treachery the beautiful home was wrecked my son urthound lay dead murdered by the blueeyed one and his wife urthrun too was terribly slain of the two little ones there brian jacques salamandastron was only the white one urthwyte as for urthstripe i never knew what became of him did ferahgo carry him off or did he wander away into the woodlands to perish in the winter i never knew until this day when you came here mara fate sent you here to let me know that my grandson still lives i might have known it he was a tough little thing more like his grandfather fierce and warlike he must have survived somehow urthwyte is like no other he can be gentle at times but savage when needs be have told him the story of what happened many a time throughout his growing hoping that someday he might have a chance to avenge the death of his parents that winter day i fled taking urthwyte with me we wandered the woodlands for many seasons that is where we met our goodfriend ashninshe was the slave of wandering foxes i fought them off and freed her then the three of us traveled together looking for peace and a better life one summer day many seasons ago we found it here an island paradise where we lived in safety until now mara touched the old badger ladys paw why dont you forget the past and stay here loambudd because you have brought the past walking in through our door and because my grandson and i are both badgers fighting beasts besides how do you think i could stay here knowing that kin of mine may be battling for life in the lands by the big sea when you go we will go with you on the day after tomorrow pikkle looked up from his cherry cordial why the day after tomorrow marm because a great storm is brewing it will hit the lake tomorrow and nothing will be able to get on or off this island all day mara rose i must go and tell logalog so that he can pull the logboats up to safety the old squirrel ashnin spoke that would be wise the rock ledge they are camped on will be battered by heavy waves when the storm comes go and wake urthwyte he will haul the boats up to the woodlands for you tell your shrew friends to come and visit us until it is time to leavei would like to know what sort of creatures i will be traveling with to the shores of the great sea youll be goin too marm pikkle was surprised the ancient squirrel took a bow and arrows from the chimney corner i certainly will young feller ive never missed a good fight in my life im a dead shot too pikkle rubbed his head where the cherry stones had struck i can already vouch for that marm logalog and the guosssom shrews yelled in alarm when a large white badger head poked over the cliffs at them until pikkle came bounding down paw over paw on a rope panic over chaps this is old urthwotsit a pal of ours hes offered to haul the boats up to high groundapparently theres goin to be a whizzo storm tomorrow and all this ledge where youre standin will be underwater hey mara come down an show old logathing what youve brought for him mara slid down the rope without a word she hung the blackstone around logalogs neck immediately all the guosssom shrews raised their paws in the air and gave a mighty roar logalogalogalogalog one by one they filed past their leader touching the blackstone and bowing respectfully there was not a shadow of doubt who the absolute leader of the guosssom was now logalog clasped maras paws in both of his i will never forget this mara his voice shook with emotion no matter what the time day or season i am yours to command nordo placed his paws over those of his father and i also mara friend words cannot thank you enough the badger maid smiled at them both then save your words friends show me by your actions when we reach salamandastron and face the hordes of ferahgo brian jacques the white badger was a great source of amazement to the guosssom they watched openmouthed as he wrapped his huge paws around the damaged logboat bracing himself urthwyte gave a single grunt and lifted the entire vessel he carried it five paces then deposited it neatly on the trestles they had set up for its repair nordo hesitantly touched the powerful corded muscle and sinew which stood out through the badgers snowy coat by the log of my fathers boat it would have taken at least fifteen shrews to even budge one of our craft you have the strength of a giant urthwyte the big badger smiled and swelled out his chest he was a simple creature and enjoyed the adulation of the shrews loambudd brought him back to earth with a bump as she commented to nordo aye my grandson has strength that he has not used yet but he also has an appetite to match he could eat your tribe out of house and home you should try feeding him for a seasonhes a bottomless pit that one logalog knew all there was to know about boats pikkle sat watching him as he deftly set about repairing the damaged craft taking a sawedged dagger the shrew leader cut away the damp splintered wood from the boats side working with wet clay and pine pegs he fitted a neatly cut piece of oak into the space bedding it with clay and boring the wood with a redhot rapier until the pegs secured the new piece firmly taking a bubbling pan of pine resin from the fire he brushed on several thick coats rendering the whole job waterproof pikkle stood back to admire the repair i say good show wot ill bet the old boat go as fast as the day it was built now logathing logalog dipped his brush in the resin pan she certainly will pikkle my friend this pine resin is a marvelous glue they say that two coats of this around the mouth of a hare will slop him chattering and eating too much hold still now while i try it on you the entire camp roared with laughter as logalog chased pikkle round the boat brandishing the resin brush satamandastron gerraway you moldy ol shrewfeller the young hare whooped as he ducked and weaved go an try that stuff out on old tubbguts he needs it more than me ashnin leaped about cackling get him logalog that pikkle eats more than urthwyte an tubgutt put together should knowit was me who served them lunch today through the drenching curtains of stormblown rain alfoh and arula watched the battle from the logboat as it bucked and pitched on the heaving surface of the great lake only samkims nimbleness of paw was saving him from dethbrush the fox was an experienced fighter and used martins sword efficiently samkim was on the defensive seeking desperately to parry each slashing blow with his light shrew rapier the remaining tracker rats clung grimly to the side of the boat silent spectators to the duel steel clashed upon steel bobbing up and down with the stormtossed craft samkim held his weapon in both paws frantically trying to turn the everseeking point and edges of the glittering sword dethbrush pursued him along the boats length hacking and thrusting until the young squirrel was trapped up on the bow with nowhere left to go showing his teeth viciously the fox battered away forcefully at the puny rapier which stood in the way of a deaththrust from the sword with a sweeping blow he struck at the outstretched weaponand the rapier snapped off at the hilt with a metallic ping paddle ee boats over arula yelled aloud elp sanken the three logboats nosed their way across as the guosssom salamandastran paddled wildly against the mounting waves reaching instinctively as dethbrush raised the sword above his head samkim kicked out with both footpaws he caught the fox low in his stomach sending him sprawling into the bottom of the boat dethbrush pulled himself quickly upright snarling ill use your tail as a he ad plume after ive slain you the prow of alfohs logboat struck the foxs craft amidships he tottered struggling for balance as the other two vessels closed in samkim saw his chance leaping up he punched dethbrush on the jaw still holding the rapier handle in his paw a look of surprise crossed the foxs face as he plunged overboard into the rainlashed waters still holding the sword the deepcoiler came suddenly surging up from the depths like a juggernaut into the midst of the maelstrom the fearsome head crashed through the surface water rushing from it as the horrible mouth yawned agape dethbrush gave vent to a gurgling wail as the monsters jaws closed across the middle of his body and the sword fell from his lifeless paws into the water without thinking samkim flung himself headlong into the water grabbing the sword as the fox let it go arula was only inches from the deepcoilers head swinging her paddle with both paws she struck with the strength of panic belting it in the eye immediately the gigantic reptile shot back under the water spriggat and alfoh grabbed samkim by the ears and heaved him scrabbling back into the logboat without warning the deepcoiler exploded back to the surface the four logboats stood upright on their sterns as the mighty beast cleaved the water between them every creature aboard the boats was flung into the lake amid the driving gales of wind and rain the deepcoiler began its killing in the crests and valleys of the sweeping waves samkim clung grimly onto the sword for the second time in as many moments he found himself pulled to safety as arula dragged him onto the hull of an overturned boat screeching and yelling creatures hung on to capsized logboats brian jacques as the deepcoiler wreaked its savagery upon them coils of awesome thickness lashed and crashed everywhere and the gray and white foamed lake was tinged with red as rows of razorlike teeth ripped and tore at any moving thing the thrashing tail stunning killing and drowning as it whipped about in random savagery spriggat roared in pain as the deadly jaws closed on his back samkim cut a chunk from the rearing neck in front of him the creature hissed opening its mouth and releasing the hedgehog as it turned its attentions to the young squirrel samkim caught one glance of the glittering eyes as the lake monster came at him with open mouth then recklessly he drove his blade beyond the teeth and into the roof of deepcoilers mouth redwaaaaaalllllll arula and alfoh threw themselves upon samkim dragging him back as the fearsome jaws closed with a stunning clash of teeth ah three creatures fell back onto the hull in a bundle as with its customary unexpectedness the deepcoiler submerged samkim fought madly to free himself from the paws of his rescuers roaring above the storm the sword that thing has taken martins sword let me go arula and alfoh dug their paws into his sodden fur hurr yon beastie near got ee too sanken but yore safe naow out of his mind with frustration and battle lust samkim bit fiercely at the paws of his friends let me go ive got to get the sword stupid shrew blundering mole let go of me samkim did not see the paddle that arula swung at his head until too late stars burst inside his brain then suddenly he was falling through rushing darkness it was nighttime when samkim regained consciousness the rain had stopped but northeast winds were still sweeping across the lake he lay on his back at the bottom of a logboat watching winddriven columns of cloud scudding across the solamandastron face of a pale moon a cool damp cloth was pressed to his head it lessened the nagging pain which pounded in his temple samkim groaned and tried to sit upright alfoh pushed him none too gently back down be still you wild squirrel im trying to reduce the size of this bump on your skull how do you feel samkim closed his eyes and the throbbing receded slightly ooh a massive headache thats all i can feel what happened alfoh i cant remember much of what went on the shrew held a beaker of water as samkim drank slowly hmm cant remember eh well let me refresh your memory though i dont know whether youll trust the word of a stupid shrew or maybe youd like to ask the blundering mole arula leaned over her friends face and winked broadly blunderin mole ee called oi hurr hurr oi blundered ee one oer yore ead wi moi paddle sanken youm wurr loik some orful woild beastie youm said bad things bout usns the young squirrel winced as memory of the events flooded back arula and you alfoh im very sorry for what i said but it was the thought of losing martins sword like that forgive me youm a mad ol feller but youm moi best matey the molemaids homely face creased into a friendly smile arula took over the ministrations with the damp cloth as alfoh explained what had happened while samkim had lain unconscious deepcoiler went straight down and never reappeared at least not so far we lost six shrews all the rats and one boat i can tell you it wasnt much fun trying to turn three boats upright in that storm and keep you and spriggat above water at the same time samkim pushed the cloth aside and sat up where is spriggat is he all right alfoh pointed across to one of the other boats hes over there we cant really see how badly the poor creature is injured when it gets light well check up on him dont worry my guosssom are attending to him as best as they can rest brian jacques now and try to sleep our position is none too goodwe lost all the provisions and this wind is driving us along very fast though to goodness knows where theres no point in paddling or fighting against things lie back and restthats all we can do at least the rains stopped and that horrible monster hasnt shown up again it was a long night completely exhausted wet and shivering in the blustery wind they curled up in the bottoms of the speeding logboats trying to ignore waves splashing over the sides as they were rushed on through the gusty darkness samkim was the first to wake at dawn his headache had cleared up and he felt much better he lay still awhile enjoying the light warmth of early sunlight alfoh arula and the rest were still snoring peacefully as samkim sat up slowly and looked about the wind had dropped and the clouds were gone the lake was calm mirrorlike and silent and the three logboats lay side by side becalmed on the tranquil surface of the great waters ripples spread as samkim dipped his paws to drink the clear lakewater id give a whole waspnest fer a drink o that cn yew get some across t me young un spriggats head lolled against the boatside as he watched samkim drinking the young squirrel found a beaker and filled it treading carefully he stepped over sleeping shrews and the logboat wobbled slightly as he climbed across into the other craft cradling the old hedgehogs head in his lap samkim held the beaker to his lips take it easy now sprigjust small sips dont try to gulp it well how are you feeling today you old flyscoffer water dribbled from spriggats mouth as he smiled wearily yore a good young un an i dont want to upset ye samkim wiped his friends mouth why whats the matter im right sorry i cant stay much longer spriggat held feebly on to samkims paws as he spoke no be still an listen t me that there monster chewed me up like a fat juicy dragonfly dont try to turn me over an look at me back salamandasvran samkimim all broken up spriggat moved slightly screwing up his face in agony uhhhhn wish i couldve gone with me paws on good dry land taint too bad though its a fair morn an im in the arms of a friend arula and alfoh were awakened by the sound of samkim sobbing with the three boatcrews they watched in silence as the young squirrel sat rocking back and forth regardless of the hedgehogs spines samkim held spriggats limp body as though he were nursing an infant and tears coursed openly down his face onto the wrinkled old paws he said he was going to find a summer forest full of wasps and flying insects then he just smiled at me and and oh my poor old friend arula and alfoh climbed across together they held samkim and spriggat tightly letting the support of their strength flow through their paws united in their grief at the passing of a fatherly creature who had given his all for them klitch and ferahgo backed by a hundred armed vermin strode boldly across the sunwarmed sands toward salamandastron the golden badger medal bobbed on the assassins chest as it reflected the hot summer morning urthstripe watched them from an unblocked windowspace resting his huge paws on the sill his eyes locked on the shining medallion as he tried hard to recall some longgone event the two weasels sat down on the sand within hailing distance of the badger lord food and drink was placed before them by migroo and feadle and they ate and drank noisily slopping water into the sand and carelessly chewing on bread and a roasted fish from the sea spitting out bones and throwing away crusts ferahgos blue eyes held a trace of mock pity as he called out to urthstripe what a pity that you cant come and join us badger food and drink must be pretty scarce inside your mountain by now urthstripe tried hard to control his rising temper hear me scum the only thing that will be scarce will be your breath if i get my paws around your miserable neck klitch threw a clay beaker it smashed against the rocks as he shouted out contemptuously you talk a good fight salamandastron stripedog but words never won wars swiftly urthstripe brought up his longbow fitting a shaft to its string he drew it full back here this is for you little snotnose klitch leapt up pulling back his jerkin to expose his narrow chest he challenged the badger fire away go on kill me but the moment you loose your arrow you will slay two of your own creatures look out by the tideline you great stupid beast big oxeye and sergeant sapwood lay staked out upon the damp sands below the tideline and crabeyes and badtooth had spears pressed to the throats of the two hares urthstripe had to stare long and hard before he understood what was going on it was a fair distance away too far for bowshot the badger lord slacked his bowstring and withdrew the arrow what do you want nothing really klitch sucked a fishbone and flicked it away we can sit out here until you all starve to death in there and just to make things a little more interesting you can watch your two best hares get a good wash each time the tide comes in at least theyll die clean baffled rage was stamped on the striped features of the badger then tell me what you want of me what do you want ferahgo took out his long skinning knife and began drawing patterns in the sand when we first arrived here we were only after your treasure but now things have changed as you can see so now we want the treasure and your mountain too urthstripe shook his head vehemently there is no treasure weasel and as for my mountain you will never have it no matter what evil plans your twisted minds can think up you will never be master of salamandastron never do you hear me klitch chuckled nastily oh we hear you all right you great windbag but soon youll hear from your friends oxeye and sapwood when the sun dries them out and all they have brian jacques to drink is seawater then youll hear them calling for mercy screaming for a quick death whatll you do then eh oxeye shut his eyes against the midmorning sun licking parched lips he looked across at sapwood are they still parleyin up there by the mountain sap the sergeant tried to crane his head but the rope across his throat pulled tight he lay back with a sigh s no good hi cant see a thing ox but hi tell

up at him listen sonny me old weasel if that chap migroo kills us would you be awfully kind and kill him back for us i wouldnt be so cheerful if i were you klitch kicked the big hare savagely urthstripe is leaving both of you here to die weve given him until dawn tomorrow to make up his mind but by then a couple of tides will have washed over you and the gulls will be pecking at your

pawswing migroo pulled up short alarm on his face as he turned tail and ran off yelling escape the prisoners are escapin oxeyes back had sunk into the wet sand and he had difficulty pulling himself up coming free with a sucking squelch he ran to the driftwood and began tugging it into the water come on sap hurry up get this thing out to sea between them they lugged the heavy tree limb tripping and stumbling on branches and twigs as they pushed and towed it into the water scores of vermin came racing across the beach with klitch and ferahgo yelling in the rear get them stop those hares kill the two of them if you have to but stop them the driftwood was just beginning to float as oxeye pushed his friend aboard the enemy was now in the shallows racing brian jacques toward them through the rippling waves sapwood turned and grabbed oxeye s free paw i haint goin anyplace without you ox big oxeye shook his head and laughed no no sap you sail away ill hold em off have a good trip he whacked sapwood beneath the chin with the butt of the spear he had taken from feadle the sergeant lay stunned on the dead tree limb as oxeye pushed it out into the current and the waves began to recede carrying the makeshift craft into deep water a skinny ferret had outdistanced the rest he waded out swinging a sword the big hare disarmed him with a single spear thrust grabbing the ferret oxeye pushed his head beneath the waves as he called out to the advancing foebeasts his anger renewing the warrior spirit of his strength come on chaps whos next for a jolly good bath sapwood was out of reaclrof the enemy as the water bore him on a southerly curve far behind him big oxeye threw himself spear in paw at the foe crowding forward through the waves eulaliaaaaaaaa dumble sat on the edge of

that evening the tables were laid out in the orchard friar bellows faith spinney thrugann and furgle were setting out a scratch feast in honor of the two saviors of redwall dumble and the wild king macphearsome it had all been done on the spur of the moment with what food was available nonetheless it was a happy and joyous occasion perched on a specially chosen log the great golden eagle and dumble did full justice to the food from their place of honor a large basin of moles deepern ever tater n turnip n beetroot pie stood steaming in the center of the board surrounded by woodland salad yellow and white cheeses and oat farls farther out it gave way to candied acorns hazelnuts saiamandastron and chestnuts arranged around flagons of october ale three plumcakes heavy with honey stood at strategic points and between them were heaped platters of bilberry redcurrant and apple tarts with bowls of greensap milk and rich buttercup cream friar bellows had invented a special macphearsome cake comprised mainly of damson cream stiff comb honey arrowroot shortbread and glazed maple shoots it was difficult for the wild king to keep a dignified posture and satisfy his ravenous appetite so

to be lowered from the cliffs in the early dawn when a scream from the rock ledge below cut the still summer air eeeeyaaahhh its the deepcoiler logalogs face was ashen thats nordo down on the ledge urthwyte and loambudd tore into action shoving mara and pikkle aside they grabbed the lowering ropes and scrambled down to the ledge mara and logalog following them as soon as the ropes were clear like some grotesquely twisted tree trunk the reptile lay half in and half out of the water its tail trailing off into the take depths and its monstrous head laid flat on the rock ledge stay clear itll kill you all ashnin yelled down after them mara ventured forward cautiously staring into the wideopen eyes that were glazed over with a milky film its dead pikkle stood pressed against the rock face with nordo dead i wonder what killed the dreadful old blighter mara moved around the lifeless head until she could touch the cold steel that stood out from the center of the skull this is what slew the deepcoiler urthwyte loambudd lend a paw herewell get the head on its side and open the mouth between the three of them the badgers managed to push the wet scaly head on its side it was a repulsive dead weight and foulsmelling water gushed from the mouth as they prised it open urthwyte propped the jaws apart with his club as mara reached in with both paws she began tugging the steel that protruded from the skull waggled back and forth loambudd struck the pointed steel with a rock driving it downward as mara pulled and tugged with both paws setting her footpaws against the sides of the fearsome rows of teeth framing the mouth finally the object came loose and the badger maid fell backwards onto the rock ledge with a beautiful sword in her paws safamandastran a cry of wonder went up from the shrews crowding the clifftop loambudd inspected the head speculating as mara washed the fabulous weapon in the lake somebeast stabbed it in the roof of its mouth the thing must have swum off then and tried to close its jaws the brain was pierced because as it forced its mouth shut it drove the sword right up through its head killing itself the storm must have washed it up here last night sometime mara held the sword aloft it glittered and shone in the sunlight completely undamaged and sharp as any razors edge what do you think loambudd its too small for a badger but slightly too large for a shrew to wield but what a weapon the older badger inspected it the beast who carried this must have been a famous warrior this sword was made by badger skilli know i have heard of weapons like thisand nothing can turn or damage the blade pikkle plucked a hair from his tail and split it across the blade he gave a whistle of amazement well chaps i think we should all be grateful to the warrior who slew this horror now the lake is safe to sail on the guosssom raised a mighty cheer and began preparing for the voyage urthwyte scaled the cliff and lowered both boats down to the ledge then supplies were packed on board the vessels with light hearts the guosssom took up their paddles the boats were riding low in the water because of their extra passengers but two more badgers added considerably to the paddle power as they shot out across the wide lake from lake to the river and down to the sea paddling paddling onward go we the sun on the water does shine merrily as away go the logboats like birds wild and free so paddle my brother ill sit next to you a fine handsome creature a bold guosssom shrew high sky and deep water are both colored blue our boats like our friends are all solid and true brian jacques salamandastron the weather stayed fine and they pushed onward until the island was a mere dot on the horizon behind them logalog noted the position of the sun and set a further course mara could not help noticing the admiring glances everybeast cast at her sword as she paddled it lay beside her sparkling in the sunlight its beautiful red pommel stone shining above the black bound hilt with its flaring silver crosstrees the mirrored steel of the blade clear iceblue deep bloodchanneled and keenly doubleedged down to the awesomely dangerous tip it was a true warriors weapon with no unnecessary fancy bits and no sign of weakness in its design the swordmaker had forged and tempered it with one thing in mind a stout blade that would serve its owner well in battle she stared at it hard until a dizziness came over her shaking her head the young badger maid blinked and rubbed her eyes as she glanced out over the lake then back to the sword she gave a start pikkle noticed her strange behavior what ho old gel are you all right mara picked up the sword bringing it close to her face she peered at the blade until her breath misted it can you see anything in this blade pikkle the young hare took a look and shook his head no not a bally thing why dyou ask i saw the face of a mouse looking at me from the blade a warrior mouse fiercer than any fighting badger mara kept her voice low so that only he could hear pikkle let one ear droop comically you didnt eat any strange fruit or plants on that island did you i remember one time i scoffed an old preserved damson i was sick as a frog for a day and you wouldnt believe the things i saw when i tried shuttin me eyes mara jabbed him with the end of her paddle dont talk silly it was nothing like that i tell you id swear i saw this warrior mouse looking straight at me from the blade of that sword logalog had overheard mara he offered an explanation what you saw was probably the face of the shrew sitting behind you the blade was lying at an angle where it caught his reflection and distorted it what with the sunlight and the movement of the boat it couldnt be anything else mara believe me mara thought about it for a moment then nodded aye youre probably right logalog as she resumed paddling she glanced back at the shrew behind her he was an old guosssom member with a thin face one good eye and a flowing gray beardnothing remotely like the fierce hoteyed warrior she had seen reflected in the mirrored blade morning gave way to noontide they ate as they paddled traveling on without any untoward event urthwyte stood up carefully and stretched his cramped limbs turning this way and that as he rolled the stiffness out of his thick leg muscles suddenly he pointed and cried out over there to the left dark shapes in the water immediately the crews felt a chill of fear run through them was there more than one deepcoiler perhaps the monster had a mate that was seeking vengeance for the slaying of its partner logalog gave orders for them to ship paddles and be silent the two logboats lay still and quiet on the waters some of the guosssom shrews even holding their breath with apprehension when mara could stand the suspense no longer she turned to pikkle come on ffolger youve got good longsight up on my shoulders and tell us what you can see nordo and logalog steadied maras footpaws as pikkle climbed up and stretched his lanky frame cant see much you chaps fraid its too far away paddle over to the left a bit please and maybe then itll become clear logalog gave the order stay where you are in that other boatno sense in putting two craft in danger right guosssom no paddlesplashers nownice and easy long deep strokes paddle over that way still balanced on maras shoulders pikkle shaded both eyes with a paw flopping his ears over to add to the shade the brian jacques salamandostron shrews pulled well and strongly not a spare drop of water fell from their paddle blades as the logboat glided smoothly over the lake silent as a feather floating on the breeze mara stood still as the trunk of a tree as pikkle narrowed his eyes and strove to make something of the dark shapes that shimmered in the sunlight on the surface suddenly his ears stood erect and he muttered out of the side of his mouth logalog old scout youve got friends out heresomebeast is callin your name the shrew leader looked up calling my name oh yes indeed pikkle nodded shall i tell you what theyre saying he threw back his head and shouted logalogalogalog immediately logalog swung into action his deep shrew voice roaring out orders its guosssom shrews they need help you shrews in the other boat follow us bend your backs dig those paddles deep and pull logalogalogaiog the two logboats raced across the waters paddles flashing as bow waves churned up and the vessels rocked from side to side pikkle leaped down and grabbed up his paddle to match maras stroke a cheer went up from the crews of the three logboats as samkim climbed down from the shoulders of alfoh and arula the young mole patted samkims back furiously youm a roight gudd shouter sanken theym card ee hurr hurr lookit they acomen wot think ee alfoh zurr alfoh shook samkim heartily by the paw best guosssom call ive ever heard in me whole life well make a boatshrew of you yet young squirrel there was a moments pause as the five logboats met on the wide lakewaters logalog stood in the prow of his boat displaying the blackstone strung about his neck all the five crews bowed low in acknowledgment of the logalog of all the guosssom then happy shouting broke out its alfohs colony from the hillbank hey nordo you young rip hows your paddle cousin dwing you fat old rascal give me your paw bowleyhi bowley are you still poisonin the lads with your cookin forbun how are the twinsstill growing ill say they are tubgutt and theyre the image of your sister fat and idle hahahaha backslapping and pawshaking went on apace as the shrews were reunited with old friends from the great south stream samkim was lost for words he could only stand and stare at the handsomely marked young female badger holding the sword of martin the warrior in her paws stepping over the side of the boat he never once took his eyes from hers as he spoke i am samkim of redwall abbey i am mara of salamandastron they stood staring at one another until samkim found himself speaking again this time the words sprang unbidden to his lips he felt as though he was back in redwall standing before the tapestry picture images golden with motes of the dust of time floated through his mind like brown leaves drifting over an autumn evening meadow thrugg the otter dressed as a badger guardian at the nameday feast the big empty chair in great hall where once sat abbey badgers the sword you are holding belongs to redwall abbey it was once the sword of martin the warrior and it was his face you saw in the blade samkim shivered and placed a paw across his mouth not knowing why he had spoken such words he felt slightly foolish as he looked into the badgers dark brown eyes mara was mystified but she did not question the young squirrel a sense of calm and quiet happiness stole over her as she placed the beautiful sword into his paws may your sword travel safely back to its abbey samkim of redwall three gnarled apples and half a beaker of water stood on the long dining hall table in salamandastron urthstripe sat in his chair like some brooding mountain spirit and around the table were thirtytwo haresthe full complement of the long patrols urthstripes gaze roved about his fighters finally settling on pennybright take these apples and this water penny a sip and an apple apiece for you and the two next youngest in the mountain pennybright was about to object when bart thistledown nudged her forward murmuring under his breath do as your lord says pen go on dont question him when hes in this moodhes dangerous the young hare did as she was bidden bobbing a curtsy to the badger lord as she passed him the hares waited in silence until urthstripe stood his gruff voice was heavy and doomladen as he spoke sergeant sapwood and big oxeye are gone i could not make out what way they were slain but there were over a hundred vermin against them no two hares were with me longer or served salamandastron more loyally first windpaw and shorebuck and now sapwood and oxeye it has salamandastron come to this my friends his paw crashed down on the tabletop we are starved and surrounded by a vermin horde trapped inside our own fortress the booming echoes of the badger lords voice died away as he glared down at the tabletop the dark eyes becoming bloodflecked with rage his paws clenched and unclenched and a fleck of foam appeared at the side of his jaw as he pounded the table with each thunderous word my mountain held under siege by a blueeyed weasel and his brat the chair behind him clattered onto its side as he swept out of the dining hall in the shocked hush that followed bart thistledown set the chair upright and commented lightly well im glad im not a blueeyed weasel chaps yes indeed pennybright shared the water and apples with lingfur and barfle on the crater top they gulped the water down but ate the apples sparingly making each bite count chewing hungrily lingfur finished his apple first im still hungry pen phwaw what i wouldnt give for a big beaker of mountainpear cordial and a plate of hot oat scones with honey to spread thick on em barfle chewed away at the core and apple pips greensap milk id like with hot oatmeal and a whole blackcurrant pie all to myself penny closed her eyes longingly dyou remember those little cheese and onion pasties that windpaw used to bake id love to have one of those right now with a flagon of new cold cider matd been cooling in the bottom caves for two days all sparkly and light gold oh what did we start talkin about scoff for lingfur nibbled the soft wooden stalk that his apple had hung from the tree on it only makes you even worse hungry than you are now suddenly a battered and sandswept figure hauled itself brian jacques salamandastron wearily over the crater top it was none other than big oxeye alive and well cheer up young ling i never knew when you werent bally well hungry wot his familiar chuckle boomed out around the mountaintop have some pears theyre a bit hard but i dont suppose a young feedbag like you would care the three young hares gave a yell of horror at the ghastly apparition and fled down the crater steps as if a demon were chasing them big oxeye dropped the two woven reedbags he was carrying and looked down at his sandcrusted body hmph suppose if i clapped eyes on me right now id be frightened out o me wits they gathered around the table in the dining hall as oxeye related his marvelous escape hoho you shouldve seen old sap floatin off t sea like he was born on the briny with not a care in the world next thing here comes a bunch of those vermin yahoos right nasty lot i can tell you so i ups spear an slays one or three just t let em know i mean business doncha know blow me there mustve been more than a bally regiment of the stinkers they stabbed an whacked at me with cutlasses an whatnot as for me did m best to give a beastlike account of a long patrol scrapper an then i tripped and went under the water dyou know i could never swim until that moment as true as im here i tell you chaps i went under an right off started swimmin like a bloomin fish underwater just kept goin wot on an on i swam until i ran out of jolly old fresh air so i came up an there they were far away all arguin an hackin at each other like billyoh so i took a good deep breath dived an swam some moremustve done that a dozen times until i got clear away from ferahgos lot from there it was quite simple really i just rolled meself in the dry sand to give me a coat of camouflage and hoofed it back here oh i stopped off an gathered a few supplies on the way backthought you chaps might be gettin a bit peckish i say wheres his nibs old urthstripe bart thistledown pointed a paw upward probably in the forge room beatin some poor chunk of metal to a powder hes got one of his rages boilin up youd best go an report that youre alive ox oxeye popped his head round the doorway of the forge room and called out in a loud voice big oxeye sah reportin for duty sah all present an correct an quite alive contrary to popular rumor sah the forge was cold and the room deserted oxeye wandered about until he noticed one of the window apertures had been unblocked the big hare sighed with despair at the sight that greeted his eyes as he looked out of the window fully clad in badger war armor urthstripe was pounding over the shore towards ferahgos encampment brandishing his giant battle spear aloft the badger lord of salamandastron hurled out his challenge to the foe come and meet me ferahgoyou and your brat together i will fight you in pawtopaw combat or any way you choose it ends here today weasel come and meet death i am urthstripe the strong born in the dark of the moon lord of the mountain slayer of vermin eulaliaaaaaaa migroo had died beneath the spear of big oxeye so the other prisoner guard feadle was held responsible for the escape of the two captives his lifeless body hung bound to a stake in front of the entire horde ferahgo put away his killing knife and took out his skinning knife as urthstripes roars reached his ears across the beach ignoring the weasel he had just slain he sheathed the knife and issued hasty instructions crabeyes station archers in the rocks around where we fight badtooth get forty spearbeasts and be ready to strike whenever you see the badgers back klitch come with me and do as i say klitch was in a foul mood he had been responsible for the victories they had won so far but because of his youth the army was more inclined to obey ferahgo accordingly his brian jacques salamandastron father had swiftly assumed position as master of the horde klitch sat sullenly on a rock curling his lip at ferahgo huh another of your cockeyed plans itll end in disaster like all the others youll see the assassin dragged his son bodily from the rock and shook him young fool you dont know everything im going to set up an ambush for the badger just watch me and do as i tell you this will work i killed the badger lord of all the southwest lands and his wife the same way seasons before you were ever born now get yourself a weapon and follow me as the word spread around salamandastron windows and openings were unblocked the hares crowded to the viewpoints watching in dismay big oxeye had assumed command in urthstripes absence and his word was law lord urthstripe is out to settle this himself hes challenged the two weasels to double combat when they meet we must stay here out of itthis is between urthstripe and the two weasels a duel of chieftains not even the vermin of the horde are allowed to interfere in a battle of honor so stay at your posts and watch thats an order down at the tideline ferahgo and klitch stood in a smooth seawashed area of sand a semicircle of rocks at their backs urthstripe faced them raising the visor of his warhelm he tried hard not to laugh aloud with joy this was what he wanted the moment he had been waiting for ferahgo had armed himself with a mace and chain in addition to his knives klitch wore a short sword and carried a pike urthstripe leaned on the haft of his great battle spear it was half as tall as he himself was forbiddingly heavy and thick with a leafshaped blade and barbed crosstrees jutting out the badger nodded at them let us get things straight before we settle this if you win then the mountain is yours but you must let my hares leave unharmed if i win your army turns around and marches off back to wherever you came from agreed ferahgo pawed the golden medal on his chest and replied levelly as master of the horde i agree so does my son klitch swaggered about jabbing the air with his spear as urthstripe continued nobeast must interferethis is a duel of chieftains and must be fought under the rules of honor agreed agreed ferahgos blue eyes shone with fervor and sincerity urthstripe lowered his helm as he spoke the final words no quarter no surrender to the death under the midafternoon sun the three combatants closed in on each other under that same sun the creatures of redwall took their ease young ones played and tumbled on the lawn while the elders rested in the cool shades of the orchard the wild king macphearsome perched on a beech stump sound asleep in the summer heat that he seldom felt among his icy crags and mountain wilderness friar bellows nodded with admiration very good very good what a magnificent giant of a bird im glad hes sleeping because while he is hes not eating tudd spinney leaned on his stick and chuckled oh hes got a rare appetite that one but im a

that sent him rolling downhill hurr well that be all ter be sayed on that subjeck tho oi do opes liddle sanken an our rula be safe fro yes zurr safety was the last thing on samkim and arulas minds they sat in a logboat with mara and pikkle as it flashed helterskelter down a long winding stream towards the sea and salamandastron the previous night had been spent swapping life stories with their new friends so each now knew all there was to know about the other samkim and arula felt duty bound to help free salamandastron and the mossflower country of vermin faintheartedness was not their strong suit the logboats had traveled without stopping under the twin captaincies of logalog and alfoh they pressed onward creatures ate slept and paddled in shifts and sometime before dawn they had left the great lake behind steering into a long winding arm of the great south stream that traveled downhill to the open sea the paddles chunked steadily as high canyon walls swept by the five logboats and shrews in the bows watched out for rocks and warded off the tall banks with their paddles and long branches bowley the cook and ashnin passed out food from the goodly supply they had brought from the island while nordo made his way skillfully between the vessels with a compound of china clay and slippery elm bark for blistered paddle paws to any creature on land that saw them passing it would have made a curious sight five logboats stem to stern hurtling downstream laden with three badgers two squirrels a mole and a crowd of shrews roaring out a bass war shanty the guosssom shrews are off to war with our rapiers close to paw woe to him who will not go to fight the vermin foe logalog logalog logalog guosssom shrews must live or die free beneath the open sky battle on while we have breath with no fear of death logalog logalog logalog ferahgo whirled the mace and chain the spiked iron ball whistled and hummed as he closed in on urthstripes left side klitch sneaked in on the right and threw his spear at the badgers head urthstripe whirled with a roar knocking the spear aside with his own weapon as he spun in a circle catching the mace around the haft of his own spear and heaving ferahgo bodily onto the sand behind the rocks an armed band of treacherous vermin waited until such time as urthsjripe was forced to turn and present his back to them scrabbling through the sand to get away ferahgo cowered in the shadow of the badger lord urthstripe kicked the mace and chain toward the blueeyed assassin pick it up weasel klitch dashed in and slashed at urthstripes shoulder the short sword caught the badger on an open place between shoulder plate and back armor with a roar urthstripe wheeled on him thrusting at the stabbing sword with his mighty battlespear ferahgo was still down on the sand as he grabbed the mace and chain flinging it he trapped the badgers footpaws and urthstripe toppled and fell with a crash of armor klitch ran in with his sword held high but urthstripe pulled himself into a sitting position and lashed out the metalclad solamandostron paw caught klitch in the chest sending him thudding into the rocks the young weasel sobbed for breath as he looked down at his own blood oozing from the deep bruising scratches the armored paw had inflicted ferahgo seized the spear klitch had dropped and advanced on his opponent kicking free of mace and chain the badger lord came up off the sand holding his battle spear crossways like a stave they clashed and ferahgo yelled in dismay as his spear was snapped in two like a brittle straw klitch help me son help me all the fight had been knocked out of the young weasel his blue eyes flooded with tears as he nursed his aching chest dragging himself up on the rocks he spat at the ambush party stop hiding there like a pack of halfwits kill the badger ferahgo had drawn two of his knives throwing himself flat he rolled under urthstripes paws out of the way of the big spear stabbing at the badgers footpaws viciously until urthstripe leapt back and dealt him a tremendous kick the weasels body left the ground in a somersault as the ambushers came flooding over the rocks spears ready and bowstrings taut spitting blood from a mouthwound caused by the breaking spear urthstripe snarled you treacherous scum come and get me ferahgo struggled up gasping hoarsely dont shoot any arrows until im out the way so you dont want to be slain by murderers eh urthstripe roared with laughter as he went after the assassin the ranks of spears and blades closed in cutting ferahgo off from his enemy but urthstripe saw nothing in front of him but the terrible joy of battle spear flailing he bulled in among them yelling as the lust to slay foebeasts took hold of him eulaliaaaaaaaa ferrets stoats foxes weasels and rats flew everywhere stabbed by the giant spearblade hooked with the crosstrees and hammered senseless by the battering spearbutt ferahgo brian jacques and klitch danced and leapt on the outskirts of the melee shouting get him slay the badger go on get at him dont stop spears pikes and swords battered at armour and fur as urthstripe went down beneath the howling mob there was an immense roar as the badger surged up throwing bodies into the air punching kicking and biting the helm ripped from his head and his spear lying on the ground the badger lord fought insanely against the overwhelming odds down he went again blades flashed in the sunlight on the churning sands barely visible beneath the pack of yelling screeching ambushers again they shot in all directions as scored by countless wounds urthstripe rose like a mighty geyser bursting from the ground with a fox between his teeth and a rat in each paw hurling the lifeless carcasses into the mob and went at them again laughing like a beast gone mad like a pack of wiid animals they clung to him bearing him down to the sand once more limbs thrashing and teeth slashing urthstripe battled on the armor torn from him battered and dented into uselessness ferahgo and klitch hugged each other in delight anticipating the inevitable outcome blood v thunder chaps eulaliaaaaaaa twoscore wellplaced shafts thudded into the ambushers as big oxeye and twenty others came charging over the sands their javelins held short for stabbing action straight into the fray they plunged dealing death wherever their lancepoints found the foe completely taken by surprise the vermin scattered leaping for the safety of the rocksbut not before ferahgo and klitch who hid among the rocks calling out frantic commands get them dont let them escape finish the badger off six hares supported the staggering badger lord oxeye and the others backed off swiftly firing arrows into the rocks to discourage pursuit hurrying across the sands toward the mountain they ducked returning salvos of arrows and slingstones salamandastron klitch and ferahgo laid about them with sword and knife blades gel after them you lilylivered cowards come on you worthless trash charge oxeye saw them coming and broke his command into threefive shooting arrows with five behind waiting and another five behind them as one party fired they fell to the rear letting the next five loose off their arrows they fired and went to the rear leaving the next five to shoot urthstripes paws dragged twin furrows in the sand as they half carried half pulled him along big oxeye was moving slowly backwards with his archers coolly in command of the situation righto chaps fire next five ready aim pick y targets now fire well done the long patrol next five steady in the ranks there draw strings and fire the deadly shafts hissed through the air as the ambushers advanced reluctantly ferahgo sent another contingent out from the rocks to reinforce the halfhearted ambushers their arrows are nearly used uplook get after them bart thistledown muttered to oxeye as the mountain loomed large bad show this well never get urthstripe up through that windowspace he climbed out of what we do ox the big hare glanced over his shoulder sizing up the situation youd better dash back baity old lad tell penny and the others to unblock one of the big groundlevel openings off y go now ferahgo had followed his ambushers loping a short distance behind them and yelling a mixture of threats and encouragement klitch stayed behind standing on one of the high rocks he surveyed the scene before him excitement rose within the young weasel as he called the ferret dragtail to him dragtail come here see that theyve unblocked a big space near the entrance to the mountain go as fast as you can and muster the rest of the horde well never get a better chance than this to conquer salamandastron hurry brian jacques salamandastron oxeye bart thistledown and some others were having difficulties with urthstripe they had lifted and pushed him halfway through the long unblocked fissure when the badger lord began shoving backwards half demented he had partially recovered and wanted to return to the battle never trust vermin i should have knowntreacherous toads ill show them wheres my spear oxeye the hare scrabbled desperately clutching urthstripe in an attempt to stop him escaping youre in no shape to fight sah wounds n injuries an so on come inside an rest now theres a good feller urthstripe sat up on the bottom ledge of the fissure swaying as he glared groggily at his friend dont talk rubbish ox day i cant attend a battle ill ill as he crashed over unconscious oxeye had the presence of mind to tip urthstripe inside he fell backwards over the ledge with a bump landing in the groundlevel corridor willing paws gathered round to carry the badger lord up to his bed a rushstrewn rock slab in the forge room pennybright stood side by side with bart thistledown and starbob firing arrows at the advancing horde she was clearly worried oh barty whatll we do most of the rocks blocking this space were pushed outsidewe just levered them out to get lord urthstripe inside itd take simply ages to reblock this crevice bart thistledown notched a shaft to his bowstring and dropped a charging rat with unerring accuracy nothing much we can do pen hold the gap and wait further orders from oxeye hi starbob bring your bows an lend a paw over here outside on the shore ferahgos blue eyes gleamed triumphantly as he was swept along toward salamandastron at the center of his horde of corpsemakers now nothing could stop them yurr be thisn anuther o those gurt lakes no its the jolly old sea arula weve reached the sea pikkle waved his paddle in the air the logboats bumped out across a gurgling stream that spanned a short pebbly beach mara turned to her right and pointed at the distant flattopped peak look salamandastron framed against a reddening evening sky the badger mountain stood separate from the ranges to the east loambudd placed a paw on urthwytes shoulder look at it grandson thats where your brother urthstripe rules a tear gathered in the comer of the white badgers honest eye urthstripe the brother i never knew the logboats bounced as they hit the whitecrested waves logalog shouted orders as they backed water and turned the noses of the vessels into the tide beginning the wide semicircular tack which would eventually bring them to land on the beach in front of the mountain as darkness fell they paddled side by side in convoy whats that floatin up ahead alfoh called across in a gruff whisper logalog peered into the darkness as he called to his paddlers take a tack to starboard watch out for that driftwood ahead a voice rang out from the floating debris of branches if yore vermin i warns yer hi fight fer me life mara looked at pikkle in astonishment together they echoed one word sapwood the sergeant was hauled aboard he hugged mara and pikkle staring over their shoulders at the huge white badger in the other logboat to his left pikkle ducked and bobbed throwing a light friendly blow at sapwood with his remaining skill and energy the boxing hare dodged it and rapped him smartly on both ears with a leftright combination as he spoke to mara whos the big white badger over there strewth e must brian jacques be as big as is nibs urthstripe mara rummaged in a sack of provisions oh youll find out soon enough its too long a story for tonightwell need rest if were going into battle tomorrow here take this food ill bet youre hungry eh sergeant huh ungry aint the word missie hi could make a stew o me own ears an enjoy it i say sarge no need for that sort of thing wot pikkle pulled a face and shuddered tuck in and have a good supper have a nap and wake up bright n breezy tomorrow eh however it was some time before sapwood was allowed to sleep the shrewd old badger loambudd questioned him closely about what was going on at salamandastron later she held a conference across the boat sides with mara urthwyte logalog and alfoh from what i gathered off sapwood i think that my grandsons mountain is in a perilous position our help is sorely needed there when do you think well make land logalog the shrew leader watched the moonlit wake of his small fleet were running with the current and the wind is behind us if the weather holds out well probably hit the beach by dawnthough if i put on extra paddlers we could be there in the hour before daylight loambudd did not hesitate then do it right away my friend theres not a moment to lose now lets hold a war council and make plans only the rolling night waves were witness to the five logboats cutting speedily through the sea toward salamandastron grimfaced shrews dug their paddles deep keeping the boats abreast of each other as their leaders conferred urgently salamandastron had been breachedthe horde of ferahgo was within the mountain bart thistledown and his little band had fought a gallant action firing into the oncoming masses until their arrows ran out and thwacking away at vermin bodies they defended the open fissure heroically until oxeye sent seawood and ten oth salamandas tron ers to pull them out javelins clashed and slings whirled as they fought a fierce retreating action having to desert the opening and back off into the maze of tunnels that honeycombed the mountain in his forge room at the middle level urthstripe lay sorely wounded bound to his bed by restraining bandages as he hovered between life and death ferahgos corpsemakers flooded the lower corridors crowding into caves and chambersharassed by the hares who though overwhelmed by numbers fought guerrilla style popping up at intersections and appearing in the most unlikely places to loose arrows at the vermin oxeye was now in sole command of the long patrol he used all his warrior cunning and skill to contain the horde within the lower levels hares appeared attacked then vanished like smoke along the winding tunnels big oxeye used the forge room as his center of operations issuing instructions as he stayed close to the delirious badger lord moonpaw take lingfur an penny stay at the south stairwell an give em blood n vinegar ill send a relief as soon as catkin an barfle get back moonpaw took the two younger hares saluted and set off at a trot for the stairwell oxeye watched them go shaking his head despairingly as he slumped down beside bart thistledown its no good barty old lad we cant hold em back for evertheres too many of the vermin wounded and battered from his defense of the opening bart grinned iopsidedly through a halfopen eye no use shiverin over lost fur ox whatd you sooner die of old age or battle oxeye shook his head admiringly battle i suppose by the left barty youre a cool one his friend stroked a lancebutt with an injured paw cool nothinim quiverin like a jolly jelly inside but dont tell old urthstripe that oxeye took a damp cloth and bathed the badger lords heated brow urthstripe was oblivious to all about him he lay struggling against the restraining bandages muttering brian jacques badger samkim drew the sword of martin as he hurried along with the frontrunners arula waddled alongside him swinging a loaded sling automatically pikkle made for the main entrance he groaned softly as he saw the unblocked fissure yawning wide oh no it looks like ferahgos stinkin lot have found a way inside at the opening samkim held up a paw for silence hist badtooth had taken an arrow in his paw hauling himself painfully through the opening the stoat sought a soft resting place on the sand he was halfway through the opening when a huge white paw seized him by the throat badtooth gave a terrified gurgle as he was dragged out onto the rocks samkim held the edge of the sword across his throat growling viciously one false move or a wrong word and you lose your head now speak up what has happened here the unfortunate stoat gulped and whimpered out all he knew the horde are in there tryin to fight their way through the mountain pikkle grabbed him by the ear wheres ferahgo an klitch klitch is in there an crabeyes an dragtail an the rest i avent clapped eyes on ferahgo since the attack started i swear it urthwyte and samkim exchanged glances well have to take his word for it the white badger grunted he knocked the stoat senseless with a sweep of his paw looking about as if undecided what to do next samkim took charge coming up with a fast and workable solution its going to be light soonwell have to move fast pikkle tell loambudd that weve gone up the mountain to reinforce those inside if she brings the rest up through this opening we can mount a twopronged assault alfoh clapped him on the back good idea are you sure youve never done this sort of thing before young squirrel samkim shouldered martins sword with a wry grin theres a first time for everything matey pikkle was gone in a spray of loose sand strapping his salamandastron mighty club to his back urthwyte began climbing arula threw up her paws in resignation as she started the ascent burrhoo oi doant loik igh places bein naught but ee mole bohurr yur goes one cloimbin young beast dawn broke in roseate splendor over salamandastron as mara and loambudd thundered over the sands with the guosssom of logalog hard on their heels pikkle rested a moment as they surged by him eventually he regained his breath and grabbed a paddle i say chaps wait for me moonpaw was slain defending the stairwell the gallant hare placed pennybright and lingfur behind her the two young ones thrust either side of moonpaw with their lances at the ravening pack of vermin that pressed its way forward up the stairs wounded in a dozen places moonpaw yelled to the two young ones get back to oxeye quickly tell him to send reinforcements she gazed for a moment at pennybrights tearstained face dont stand there gawping young pen do as i say go on moonpaw had a doublepointed javelin wildly she broke it in haif over the head of a ferret brandishing both halves she dived headlong into the press of foebeasts yelling a last warcry eulaliaaaaaa breathlessly the two young hares sobbed out their story to oxeye he sat them down keeping his voice calm well it looks as if weve lost the lower levels sorry i havent any food or drink to offer you two sit there and rest awhile i say barty old thing howre you feelin bart thistledown flexed his paws nodding to two other hares he picked up his bow and quiver of arrows and limped off oh i suppose im about ready for another scuffle big ox come on you chapsduty calls an all that oh if i dont manage t make it back youll know its byebye barty under those circumstances youd be best movin his lordship brian jacques salamandas iron out of here an up to another chamber wot toodleoo the sounds of yelling chanting vermin stamping about inside the mountain was growing louder big oxeye threw a paw about lingfurs trembling shoulders and chuckled noisy old lot arent they in the full flood of bright morning sunlight urthwytes party neared the top of the crater alfoh was staring at something up above as he fitted a rock to his sling whirling the weapon he called out to samkim look thats a rat up there hey you the rats head was barely visible but as alfoh shouted he turned and showed himself the slingstone took him under the ear with a distinctive thud the rat screamed and toppled over the crater top instantly there was a mob of vermin hurling rocks and firing arrows down on them where did they come from who are they ferahgo could be heard yelling from the top of the mountain arula aimed a rock from her sling in the direction of the voice she was rewarded with a cry from the assassin ow my paw kill them whoever they are a shrew stood to whirl his sling but an arrow took him through the eye and he fell back dead urthwyte picked up a sizable boulder and hurled it upward taking out a rat and injuring a fox charge eulaliaaaaa the great white badger went surging forward regardless of arrows and stones samkim and arula took up the cry forward redwaaaaaallll logalogalogalogalog the shrews broke cover and began scrambling up the rocks slinging as they went klitch led a band of corpsemakers along a twisting rock passage toward the stairwell he trod scornfully on the body of moonpaw as he mounted the stairs kill kill kiiiillll standing to one side he let his attack force sweep up the stairs smiling craftily as he heard the death screams of the front rank who had walked into the range of bart thistledowns bows come on you lucky rabble its only a couple of hares rush them big oxeye picked up a longbow and arrows issuing slings and stone pouches to pennybright and lingfur he nodded toward the clamor of battle echoing up through the passage outside right hares up on y paws quicks the word an sharps the action well have to go an give oi barty a pullout his lordship be safe here until we get back young pen an you ling give me a big smilecome on now thats the ticket now yell after me as we go its the loooong patrooool eulaliaaaaa yelling like demons they sped down the passage to barts aid standing at the back of his command klitch watched as an ashenfaced dragtail came running up from the lower levels the young weasel eyed him cynically where in the name of hellgates have you been its up here you should be where the fightings taking place not down there in the peace and quiet dragtail was plainly scared and breathing heavily he hooked a paw back down at the lower levels listen to that echoing hollowly up through the rocky corridor the sound reached the young weasels startled ears logalogalogalogalog undecided as what to do klitch shrugged and smiled nervously logalog whats that supposed to mean a wellaimed arrow took dragtail through the chest as logalog mara and pikkle came hurtling along the passage at the head of a charging guosssom band with a terrified yelp klitch took to his heels fighting his way through the vermin crowding the stairwell until he was safely ensconced in the middle of the pack unreasoningly he grabbed a fox by the throat and shouted into his face nobeast told me about this the fox was about to reply when one of big oxeyes ar brian jacques rows snuffed out his life klitch looked wildly about as he moaned its a trap were trapped with a stentorian roar lord urthstripe burst through the restraining bandages ripping his huge bulk up from the bed seizing a forge hammer he lumbered off toward the upper levels from some amazing reserve the mountain ruler had dredged up his wild strength the madness of the warrior badgers was upon himnobeast could stand in his path now even despite the fearsome wounds that scarred his giant frame urthwytes party had gained the summit and now they were fighting around the top of the crater ferahgo stared at the white badger a wave of fear sweeping across him kill the white one kill him the one who slays the white badger is a richbeast twenty crowded round urthwyte as he battled furiously roaring mightily he swung his oaken club samkim forged around the crater top his sword flashing in the sunlight leaping dodging hacking thrustingwith arula covering his back swinging her loaded sling goo on sanken urr hurr make redwell proud of ee alfoh and his shrews fought valiantly with rapier paddle and sling there was no quarter given shrew and vermin alike died that day on the heights the creatures of ferahgo fought with the ferocity of despair bemused by the strange force that had scaled the mountain to offer them battle seeing his chance ferahgo sneaked up on urthwyte knowing that if he could slay the white badger the fight would swing his way urthwyte had his back to ferahgo hammering relentlessly at any creature coming into club range the assassin drew both his best knives the killer and the skinner and crouched low bunching his muscles for the spring that would carry him onto the white badgers back where his blades could feast on the unprotected neck nerving himself he made the spring in midair time seemedto stand still he heard the roar saw urthstripe appear in front of him and felt the shock as two fearsome paws caught him in their viselike grip ferahgo screamed with shock galvanized into action he began stab soamaikiastton bing with both knives plunging them into the body of the roaring badger lord the massive injuries he had formerly sustained together with the horrendous wounds of ferahgos daggers now caused urthstripes fierce dark eyes to cloud over with deathmist but his fate was not yet sealed from the deep wells of strength within his gigantic frame he called up a last mighty surge that would enable him to rid salamandastron of ferahgo crushing the blueeyed weasel to him urthstripe leapt from the top of the mountain yelling his last beloved battle cry eulaliaaaaaaaaaaaa the knowledge that he had glimpsed his lost brother for a moment hit urthwyte the look on his face caused every creature who had followed ferahgo to lose their nerves completely alfoh pulled samkim to one side leave him here get arula and my shrews down inside the mountain before he kills us all leave him here with the vermin samkim could readily understand alfohs meaning the sight of the berserk white badger hurling himself bodily at the panicstricken vermin was enough pushing arula in front of him the young squirrel followed the guosssom band down the walkways that spiraled into the heart of salamandastron pennybright hurried up from the forge room with a quiver of arrows she passed them to oxeye these are the last there are no more oxeye grinned as he fitted a shaft to his bow good gel keep slingin penny look at young ling therehes tossin rocks like a good un want some good news mdear theres a band of shrews an whatnot attackin from the lower levels listen to this oxeye shouted over the melee at the top of his voice duck v weave blood n vinegar long patrols here the sound echoed down the rocky stairwell a moment later there was an answering call jab an move give em a towsin long patrols ere too brian jacques good ol sapwood oxeyes grin spread from ear to ear knew i never sent him on that cruise for nothin lingfur looked fearfully over his shoulder sir look out theyre behind us carrying a heavy paddle and her sling arula bowed low wem not behoind ee young un usns are with ee oxeye stifled a laugh as he shook paws with the molemaid well thank goodness for that id hate to face a warrior like you young molemaid arula wrinkled her nose thankee koindly zurr pleased t meet you im sure oxeye clasped the paws of samkim and alfoh gratefully but could we leave the introductions until after the war old lads samkim immediately liked the big hare gripping his sword in both paws he took up a fighting stance and nodded that seems fair enough sir shall we charge paddles slings and rapiers waved behind samkim and oxeye as the hare tossed aside his bow and picked up a lance well said sir ready chaps then charge eulaliaaa redwaaaaall logalogalogalog taking up the call the band at the bottom of the stairwell howled their own battle cries as they charged from their end the war was hopelessly lost for the once vaunted horde of corpsemakers klitch killed the two vermin closest to him and fell flat on the stairs pulling their bodies over his to act as concealment the rocks echoed with the clangor of battle trapped and cut off on the long rambling flight of stairs the last of the horde fought with desperation but they were no match for the guosssom two badgers and the remaining hares of the long patrol mara felt herself swept along in the rush ahead of her she glimpsed samkim his face alight with the madness of battle as he fought his way through the tightpacked ranks of vermin some of whom were standing dead having no room to fall at the center of the turmoil they met the young squirrel and the badger maid a sudden silence prevailed the madness was over salamandastron stood free creatures who a moment before had been yelling and slay salamandostton ing stood weary and quiet as if shamed by the indignity of war bodies of friend and foe alike lay strewn on the rocky steps like leaves after an autumn gale the voice of young pennybright echoed hollowly round the scene of carnage oxeye sir i want to go out into the sunlight i dont want to be here oxeye stroked her ears gently as he gazed around neither do any of us young pen come on lets all go out into the fresh air as they climbed out of the opening loambudd grasped maras paw ayaaaaaaah the sound that tore from the old badgers throat was like the cry of an animal being slain she released maras paw and went rushing out the young badger maid was about to call after her when she too saw what had made loambudd cry out as fast as she could she ran after her urthstripe the strong lay with his paws still clutching ferahgo the assassin both were dead on all fours beside the two bodies was urthwyte weeping like a baby his paws bruised and cut from the wild rushing descent he had made from the mountaintop to be with his brother loambudd unlocked the dead badger lords paws from around ferahgo as she removed the golden medallion from the weasels neck sapwood and oxeye approached her and bowed low can we be of help lady she turned the assassins carcass over with her footpaw take this worthless thing and cast it into the sea it does not deserve a resting place like any decent creature blinded by hot tears mara watched as loambudd placed the medallion about urthwytes snowy neck this belonged to my father and to your father it should have been worn by your brother urthstripe it now belongs to you my grandson wear it proudly mara knelt and clasped the big battlescarred paws of the fallen badger lord words tumbled out with her tears i brian jacques came back too late now it is past the time when i could tell you what is in my heart i have ranged far and wide to be back home here with you and in that time i have slowly understood what you tried to teach meyou who were ever true to your own code of honor and duty to everybeast you were urthstripe the strong lord of the mountain so will your name be always remembered you cannot hear me now but i wish to add one more name to your title the young badger maid took both the lifeless paws and placed them on her bowed head as she spoke a single word father klitch lay still listening until the victors had departed beneath the slain bodies it was hot and airless his tongue clove to the roof of a dry mouth parched from battle thirst and the fear of discovery the silence became total oppressive like the weight of the two creatures he had slain lying on top of him pushing and kicking he freed himself from the carcasses and sneaked off up the stairs his only hope now waito gain the crater top and slip away over the east rim white his enemies rested on the sands at the west side of the mountain the young weasel took several wrong turns as he roamed the passages and upper galleries seeking an exit panic was beginning to set in fearing the return and possible vengeance of his foes klitch ran desperately some passages ended in a blank rock face others opened out into caves and chambers he padded along silently cursing ferahgos stupidity and the bumbling horde that had followed blindly on such an addlebrained enterprise licking bonedry lips with a parched tongue klitch stumbled along a passage that opened out into a cool dark cave feeling his way around the rocky walls he sobbed raggedly was there no way out of this accursed mountain no way back to the good lands of the southwest where he could terrorize the creatures that had been subdued by his father surely they would know that he was the son of ferahgo the assassin and learn to fear him as they had feared the old one salamandastron klitchs footpaw stubbed against something hollow and wooden in the gloom he hopped painfully biting his lip to keep from crying out when the pain receded he looked more closely there were several of the objects he tapped their sides barrels pulling one over klitch was rewarded by the swishing sound of dregs swilling about the top was open the young weasel smiled in the darkness maybe now his luck was beginning to change the water sloshed out of the open barrel on to the rocky floor and klitch went down on all fours and lapped gratefully at it the cool liquid refreshed him lending a new sense of purpose and resolve to the assassins son standing upright klitch squared his narrow shoulders and strode out of the cave purposefully fear receding as he mentally planned a campaign of terror that would mark his return to the southwest lands now every passage and corridor appeared light and airy and the way to the top was clear his bright blue eyes gleamed confidentlyyes this was the day luck had returned to him up ahead he could see the bright summer morning and the catwalk to the crater top an unexpected stomach twinge caused him to double up he stood still a moment until it passed straightening up he smiled there the pain was gonenothing was going to ruin his newfound luck mounting the catwalk he started to run for the crater top and freedom twice thnce he was stopped by the sudden lightning bolts of pain that lanced through him but each time he recovered and hastened upward now klitch was going slower his limbs became numbit was like wading through deep cold water the young weasel blinked why had the day become foggy and dark finally he made the top and lay down upon the edge of the crater fighting off the dizziness and agonizing lances stabbing through his body klitch doubled up and wedged himself between two rocks he would sleep here awhile until he felt brian jacques better fixed in this position he could not roll over the mountain edge as he slept nothing was going to ruin his good luck the once bright blue eyes clouded over and went dim as he slipped into an endless dark dream two days had passed two days of sadness and hard work salamandastron was cleared of the horrifying debris of war pennants waved from lances fixed in the sands of the shorelinethese were the graves of hares and shrews who had fallen in the struggle to free the mountainand farther along in an unmarked place the carcasses of ferahgos horde found their last resting place now was the time to bring light and fresh food to the rocky fortress by the sea parties were sent out to forage others worked on the slopes unblocking window spaces and replanting the mountain terraces with flowers crops and trees deep in the cellars arula had discovered a fault in the rock she supervised a band of shrews as they levered chiseled and chipped at the fissure the young molemaid had smelt water below a cold clear spring of good fresh drinking water it would make the mountain invulnerable to siege giving an endless supply of the most precious of liquids she shook paws with logalog and alfoh as they watched the spring gurgle gently through the hole they had sweated to cut into the living stone hurr hurr it baint no tober ale guddbeasts but oi wager ee taste just as gudd hurr hurr brian jacques salamandastron there remained one last sad duty to install the body of urthstripe with his predecessors samkim was requested to be at the ceremony wearing the sword of martin the warrior strapped across his shoulders he carried a lantern lighting the way for the three badgers who bore the mountain lord big oxeye and sergeant sapwood walked with them giving samkim directions to the spot urthwyte pushed back the slab to the secret cave samkim gazed around at the rock walls covered in mysterious badger carvings and pictures sapwood sniffed and wiped a paw roughly across his eyes as he peered at the last carving this ere was graven by is lordship imself see there e is an theres you lord urthwyte eres young master samkim too an the sword though hi cant read the writin my friend urthstripe carved there loambudd could however samkim held the lantern as she silently scanned the high ancient badger script when she had finished reading she turned to them this was written for me alone to read that is why i am not pictured on the wall i alone must keep the awful and joyful secrets written here until urthwyte can be instructed as lord of salamandastron there is one thing i can tell you however urthstripe my grandson wishes to rest beneath emllorwhere that is i cannot say do any of you know the lantern light flickered about the walls as they looked at each other emllor big oxeye shrugged theres no place in this mountain with such a name samkim wandered about the chamber repeating the name to himself emllor emllor at the far end of the cave the wall was smooth but blank there was no writing on it samkim ran his paw across it and leapt back in surprise look this is not stone it was a curtain made from some rough woven material pebbles and sand had been fixed to it with pine resin giving the effect of a rock wall urthwyte moved it carefully to one side an awesome sight greeted the eyes of the onlookers seated on a rock throne was the crumbling skeleton of a badger clad in full war armor the alcove behind the curtain was semicircular in shape marred by a huge boulder that bulged out on one side the writing says that isthe last remains of old lord brocktree first badger lord of salamandastron loambudds voice echoed around the cave sapwood touched the dusty mailed pawguards reverently hi bet this old lord knows where emllor is but he aint tellin us hare you sir mara stood staring at the skeleton of lord brocktree when the feeling of awe had passed she noticed something hurrying forward she examined the wall at one side of the throne his paw seems to be pointing this way look an oblong plate of copper was fixed into the rock it was green and dulled with age loambudd wet it and scoured the surface with sand until it gleamed dully bringing her face close she inspected it carefully its just a smooth metal platetheres nothing written on it they sat on the floor facing the plate oxeye turned to the entrance where urthstripes body lay waiting poor old lordship looks like youll never get to emllor mara stared at the copper plate long and hard pass me that lantern please samkim the young squirrel did as he was bid mara placed it on the arm of the throne next to the skeletal paw whos got good eyes sapwood raised his paw spose my peepers are good as anybeasts then sit right here and tell me what you see sergeant mara moved out and sapwood took her place he sat staring at the burnished metal as it shone dully in the lantern light well bob me tail i can see wordsletters i mean though i dont know what they says never learned writin too busy teachin meself other thingsfighting an samkim loambudd interrupted give him your sword sapwood can you scrape the word on the floor here certainly marm brian jacques salamandastnm it was badger script loambudd said the word triumphantly emllor loambudd placed her paw on the plate then moved precisely in a straight line across the chamber her paw smacked hard upon the rock bulge to one side of the throne give me the lantern its right here see this word carved on the boulder it is directly opposite the plate so that it reflects in the metal backwards of courselike all mirror images it is the wrong way round its not emllor its rollme urthwyte looked puzzled he began repeating the word over and over fast at first but then slower rollme rollme ro llm e r oil me roll me striding heavily over to the boulder he stretched his powerful paws to its sides grunting as he cautioned his friends stand out of the way mara knew that urthwyte was a badger of immense strength but she doubted that even he could shift such a formidable chunk of rock she was about to move forward and offer her help when loambudd placed a restraining paw about her watch him mara he will do it planting his legs square like two tree trunks urthwyte threw his weight against the boulder cords of sinew stood out from his snowy hide as the muscles of the great white badger bulged and his teeth ground together like millstones growling savagely as the blood rose to his eyes urthwyte grabbed the boulder and gouged deep at it with both paws his whole body shook and trembled with the staggering effort riveting his whole being on the boulder urthwyte let out a whooshing roar and heaved wideeyed with awe oxeye grabbed sapwoods paw by the blazin thunder hes not rolled it hes lifted the thing urthwyte stamped a full three paces before letting the huge boulder drop the thud shook the entire cavern the boulder had rested in a hole holding the lantern between them mara and samkim lay flat on the floor gazing down at the treasure of the badger lords of salamandastron pearls from the depths of the sea silver cups and gold plates and weapons fabulous arms forged by the badger lords of oldlongswords sabers rapiers strange curved swords shields spears pikes daggers and lancesmade from the most precious woods and metals lay in a glittering heap cascading over the massive sets of ancient badger armor studded with stones that shone and twinkled scarlet ultramarine turquoise amber and obsidian jet their lights reflected in maras eyes as her mind went back to the day when klitch tried to wheedle information out of her in the dunes so there is a badger lords treasure after all urthstripe was lowered down in his full ceremonial battle armor to lie there as he had wished an eternal guardian soiamaruiastron ho the good ol abbey anybeast ome redwaaaaaallll mrs faith spinney jumped up and down like a fat little jackinthebox on the north ramparts peering across the battlements each time a leap carried her that high stickle my ol spikes its

thrugg fleeing across the abbey grounds with thrugann hard on his heels swinging a twig broom you bottlenosed rogue ill give yer tea youll get a taste of this when i catch up with ye later that day abbess vale watched fondly as thrugg dandled baby dumble on his knee while he plowed his way through a buffet teatime meal specially set up on the gatehouse steps for him and his four falcon guests baby dumble told the most atrocious lies about his epic flight in the haversackhow he had rescued the eagle from some far bigger birds and how he had pushed macphearsomes wings up and down to keep him flying when he was weary thrugg and the four falcons tried their level best to keep straight faces dumble glared suspiciously about at them och yer no laughin at the bonny dumble are ye he had begun affecting a smattering of northland into his speech the wild king macphearsome perched on his favorite log in the orchard nodded his approval as the falcons circled above dipping their wings in tribute to him aye theyre a grand bunch oladdies nae doot as evening drew on dumble was carried off snoring to his bed by thrugann thrugg sat relaxing with a flagon of october ale glad to be back safe in his beloved abbey a dep brian jacques salamandastron utation of redwallers attended as tudd spinney presented the otter with a specially carved bowl and spoon of applewood the old hedgehog twirled

over those two young ones if martin says theyre coming back thats good enough for me ill post lookouts on the ramparts tomorrow as soon as its light high above mossflower woods the moon shone down over redwall and the fire burned to embers as everybeast about it dozed in drowsy contentment the sun burned through to the shores of salamandastron dispelling the wreaths of sea mist to reveal the guosssom shrews standing side by side with the hares of the long patrol all eyes were on the front entrance and a hubbub arose as the boulder was rolled to one side revealing loambudd her head garlanded in a wreath of wildflowers she was clothed in a magnificent robe of blue she stepped aside and silence fell as the procession emerged from the mountain as honored guests from far redwall samkim and arula led the line the young squirrel holding aloft the sword of martin the molemaid bearing a shrew paddle wound about with ivy behind them walked the shrew leaders logalog and alfoh green cloaks about their shoulders paws resting on sheathed rapiers then came mara and pikklethe badger maid in a decorated smock of rich autumn brown carrying a large bouquet of late roses upon a lancetip pikkle in light sandyyellow bearing a hare longbow and a quiver of grayflighted arrows ashnin walked behind them wearing a splendid cloak adorned with sea shells urthwyte was flanked by sapwood and oxeye they were the last to emerge now that urthstripe lay at rest clad in his best ceremonial armor the great white badger was wearing his brothers old fighting armor it had been retrieved from the shoreline where he fought his last great battle the armor had been restored brian jacques salamandas tron rebeaten and burnished at urthstripes forge by urthwyte himself he looked every inch the true warrior now and it shone from his eyes and face told in every movement of his giant limbs as he strode easily out in front of the assembly the sun bounced and glimmered off snowwhite fur and glittering metal as oxeye presented him with his own huge oaken club and sapwood knelt and placed his head beneath urthwyte s free paw this is my grandson loambudds voice rang out majestically his grandsire was urthclaw his father urthound and his brother urthstripe the strong he stands before you this day and for all the time until his seasons have run ruler of the mountain commander of the long patrols warrior lord of salamandastron salute urthwyte the mighty lances bows rapiers and paddles went up like a sea of weaponry eulaliaaaaaaaaaa all creatures alike yelled the mountain war cry until the very rocks rang and the clear morning air was filled with the swelling sound salamandastron had a new badger lord after the ceremony there was a meal spread out upon the shore it was good solid food but quite plain salamandastron being a warriors place even the best of cooks there could never match the skills of redwall creatures at preparing a festive board they sat among the rocks and sprawled on the sand happily sharing the homely fare arula pikkle and nordo were building a likeness of salamandastron from the seadamped sand alfoh and ashnin perched on a low rock watching them the wise old shrew smiled wistfully look at them playing at sandcastles like a proper bunch of young uns arula what about a tunnel entrance the young molemaid touched a heavy digging claw to her nose thankee zurr alfoh oill do that straightways hurr hurr arula vanished in a spray of flying sand as ashnin shook her head in wonderment they bounce right back like springy little branches thats a good thing alfoh it helps them to forget all the hardships warfare and slaying theyve been through look at young samkim sitting alone down there by the sea i wonder what hes thinking of hes been very quiet all morning samkim was staring at the logboats moored above the tideline the sword of martin lay beside him he made no move to join the others staying alone and apart from everybeast still clad in her new smock mara approached the solitary young squirrel she sat beside him gazing out at the sea pensively without looking at her samkim began to voice his thoughts it soon developed into a conversation though they both avoided each others eyes the season is dying mara i feel that summer is gone and the autumn is upon us the leaves will turn gold and brown so they will samkim nobeast can stop the turn of the seasons i think you are lonely and far from home what is redwall like in the autumn oh its a happy place to be at anytime autumn is harvest time the fruits and crops are gathered in october ale is made chestnuts are candied in honey we sit up late in cavern hole around a great fire enjoying supper and listening to the stories and songs of bygone days the mornings are quiet and misty leaves rustle in mossflower woods and you can feel the dew on the grass between your paws smell the bread and cakes being baked in the kitchens lie in the orchard on a sunny afternoon and eat a russet apple or a ripe purple plum oh yes redwall is like no other place you must love your home very much samkim aye the abbey is everything to me what about you mara salamandastron is a fine placedont you like being here the badger maid ran dry sand from the rocks through her paws it is all i can rememberi grew up with the mountain this morning i feel that i have a certain fondness for it brian jacques but i can never make it my home again there are too many unhappy memories hovering around it lord urthstripe put his mark upon that mountain the graves of creatures we knew look lonely here by the great sea and it will take a lot of healing time alone can do it though i would not be happy staying here to grow old even today i noticed the change in urthwytehe is becoming a badger lord the life here is not for me then what will you do mara where will you go i will follow my dream ah the dream you dreamed last night of martin the warrior samkim how did you know because i too had a dream martin came to me also he told me to stay apart from the others today and i would see the guardian of redwall abbey come to me is it you mara the badger maid turned and looked at him martin said in my dream that this was my destiny he told me that i will be happy at redwall happier than ever before samkim took hold of her paw so you will be come on let us go home mara of redwall though the season was well advanced abbess vale stoically refused to hold any nameday feast each day she had posted lookouts on the ramparts and they watched until torches were lit and lanterns shone with the onset of night through sunny days cloudy days and days when soft drizzle and mist hung low over woodlands the vigil continued still with no sign of samkim or arula returning sitting in the gatehouse one windy morning abbess vale and faith spinney took hot mint tea and nutscones with cream as they embroidered a bedquilt together faith took the spectacles from the end of her nose and massaged her eye comers gently my ol eyes get tired pretty quick these days vale spect itll be with standin out on yon wall all yesternoon the abbess looked rather severely over the top of her glasses faith what have i told you there are lots of younger ones happy to do lookout dutyyou have no need to be up on the ramparts in all weathers the hedgehog lady poured more tea for vale but i wants to be first to see em sides it keeps me out of dumbles way that infants become a reglar liddle terror brian jacques indeed he has the abbess nodded in agreement as she picked up a stitch everywhere i turn hes following me bullying away in his north country speech for a nameday feast the hautumn of the heagle you mean faith chuckled vale threw her paws up to her ears honestly if i hear that name once more ill tan the little villains tail the little villain in question was hatching a conspiracy together with thrugg macphearsome friar bellows and several others it had been brewing for three days secret meetings in the cellars with foremole and tudd spinney standing guard clandestine gatherings in the dormitory with brother hollyberry watching the door and whispered conferences in the orchard were becoming the order of the day at redwall dumble made the participants swear deathly oaths that abbess vale and mrs faith spinney should not know a thing until the time was ripe the kitchen fires burned late heating the ovens as extra cakes pies flans and pasties were baked to a golden turn bands of moles plundered the orchard regularly and young ones were seen coming and going muttering furtively to each other as they covered for others who wheeled great cheeses from the storerooms lugged forward big barrels of october ale and strawberry cordial from the cellars and grunted beneath mysterious bulky sacks as they strove to move them in secret around lunchtime the wind dropped and so did abbess vales head she fell asleep in the armchair by the fire faith spinney covered her with the quilt they had been working on and stole quietly out of the gatehouse the sun was breaking through scudding cloud masses as the wild king macphearsome flapped his wings and did a short run the golden eagle nearly collided with faith as she came out of the gatehouse he pulled up short and stalked off huffily to the start of his intended launch faith followed him sorry your majesty did i disturb your exercises salamaruiastron macphearsome sniffed the air hopping from one foot to the other och no wee lady ahm just off for a stretch o the wings ye ken mah fithers need a guid wind rufflin em swaying from side to side he dashed forward and launched himself into the air faith shook her head in bewilderment as she watched the huge bird soar gracefully whatever you say im sure dearie me i wish i could understand one single word from that birds beak hollyberry watched from the sickbay window explaining the scene to foremole who was sitting on a bed tucking into a huge wedge of yellow celerystudded cheese hes about to start his second run nowhold on hes talking to faith spinney i cant hear what hes saying there he goes up into the air faiths looking up and saying something lets hope macphearsome hasnt given the game away to her foremole wrinkled his nose missus spinney doant unnerstand heagly burds theym cant talken propply doant ee wurry zurr berryolly the five shrew logboats were on a broad open expanse of the great south stream mara sat side by side with samkim paddling steadily as well as any two shrews the badger maid could hear arula telling pikkle of redwall feasts as they sat paddling in the prow of the boat opposite pikkle kept interrupting with what could only be described as groans of delight at the mention of each fresh dish yurr an then they takes the meddyo cream an whoo my growlin tummy dont tell me let me guess they take the jolly old meadowcream an spread it thick over the damson pudden an chuck lots of those candied chestnuts on

back water ship paddles bows n slings at the ready guosssom mara looked up to see a massive bird of prey beating its wide wings close to the water as it sped towards the logboats swiftly she brandished her paddle in the air as samkim drew his sword and stood by her logalog roared out further orders dont fire until it tries to attackit may not be hunting the great bird soared over them brushing mara and samkim with a wingtip as it mounted into the air and wheeled in a circle ach yer braw beasties the noo but if ye fire one arra ahm acoming doon tae mak ye regret it pikkle put down his paddle and scratched his ears what in the name of the crazy cuckoo is the chap burbling on about can anybeast tell me alfoh placed a paw across pikkles mouth wait i think hes trying to tell us something the bird certainly doesnt mean us any harm or hed have attacked by now hi you up there were the guosssom shrews who are you and where are you from the golden eagle dived screeching like a siren redwaaaaaaaalllll samkim leapt up waving his sword as he yelled out the reply redwaaaaalllllll the eagle wheeled slowly then flapped off at a leisurely clip turning off north to follow the course of another channel samkim quivered with excitement as he picked up his paddle did you hear that mara come on guardian paddle im sure he wants us to follow him what do you say logalog the shrew leader took up his paddle i think youre right hes certainly traveling in the right directionthat branch stream will make a good shortcut now i come to think about it right lets follow the bird up

missus spinney would you please get in the cart thrugg stood with the harness about his shoulders and the little green abbey cart stood waiting on its four small wheels abbess vale and faith spinney had been roused when it was barely dawn and hustled out of gatehouse and abbey dormitory by tudd and sister nasturtium they stood hastily dressed on the lawn thrugg looked over his shoulder at them

and hobbled across the lawn waving his stick stir yore stumps now good redwallers theyve gone lets get busy the sun heralded the day palely at first but gradually bursting through into a heavy golden autumn radiance faith spinney looked up at the dark evergreens and golden brown leaves turning crisp on the boughs the dappling patterns of light and shade through the foliage making her blink as they trundled along oh well weve got a fair n pretty day for whatever it is were supposed to be adoin of vale the abbess folded her paws into the wide habit sleeves violets and saxifrage my paw theres

sup salamandas iron per and slept through the early evening on the banks of the stream two hours after midnight logalog had disguised the five boats with branches and fern for safekeeping he roused them and they broke camp lighting lanterns they struck off into the depths of mossflower samkim and arula led watching the dark shape of macphearsome whenever it could be seen above the treetops arula drew in a deep breath booharr smell at sanken tis loiken the smell of ome samkim sniffed gratefully i know what you mean arula mara plucked a sycamore leaf peering hard into the woodland trees

theres a scrap of tucker about old gel its bally ages since we had supper im starvin in the same hour of dawn that the cart left redwall the travelers emerged from the woods onto the path though the going was easier there were many who were weary from marching all night the irrepressible pikkle kept everybeast going by improvising a silly ditty id give my left ear an raise a cheer for a plate of woodland pie and as for a pudden if it was a good un id give my best right eye id give a paw to get my jaw around a fat fruitcake for a dumplin stew my tail could go too i mean for goodness sake if i

they chanted aloud redwall logalog redwah guosssom redwall logalog redwall guosssom abbess vale rubbed her eyes and looked about suspiciously it was midmorning and they were still bumping along the dusty brown path in the cart she rapped on the side sharply thrugg where are you taking us i havent been this far for seasons but i recognize the country were well past saint ninians thrugg muttered something unintelligible under his breath and quickened his pace faith spinney awakened suddenly eh whats that mdear whats a logalog the jolting of the cart was not doing much for vales mood logalog i never said anything about a logalog what are you chunnering on about faith spinney faith held up a paw stop please mr thrugg sssshh listen thrugg halted the cart all three creatures listened carefully

reckon a gossen is vale whos making al that noise anyway a large smile was spreading across the abbesss face she leaned over and patted thrugg on the back its arula and samkim i know it is forward with all speed thrugg charge salamandastron as they rounded the bend samkim saw the cloud of dust approaching and heard the rattle of the cart ever vigilant logalog yelled out to his shrews bows and slings ready somebeast is coming this way fast but samkim and arula had recognized thrugg and the occupants of the cart who were standing up cloaks flying in the breeze its the abbess and mrs spinney and thrugg good old thrugg come on arula they dashed off toward the oncoming cart faith spinney could be heard crying shrilly oh my dears its samkim an arula oh my spikes oh those young rascals oh see
