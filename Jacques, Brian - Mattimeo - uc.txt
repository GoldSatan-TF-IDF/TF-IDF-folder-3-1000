high noontide sun beat down on orlando the axe the mighty badger strode the far reaches of the western plains blind to the beauty of the flowercarpeted grassland which had turned green to gold orlando the axe was following the fox the badger wiped a huge dusty paw across his eyes sun gtinted off the massive doubleheaded battleaxe slung over his shoulder his home lay plundered behind him there was nothing left there except desolation and loneliness orlando the axe was following the fox two sunrises ago he had passed the strange fox and his band they had given him a wide berth as he trudged to the foothills of the mountains seeking food and the small rock plants which his little daughter auma loved so much orlando eared no living creature he had passed by the fox not thinking that he had left a dear trail back to his den the following morning he had returned home laden with food and rock flowers auma was gone his home was smashed and broken orlando the axe was following the fox three winters ago his wife brockrose had died leaving him to rear their little badger cub auma was the most precious dung in orlandos life he taught her of the seasons the plains and the mountains now he had turned his back on those same mountains and plains with only one thing in his mind to find his daughter and the creature who had taken her orlando the axe was following the fox striding the wide spaces the badger let a fearsome rumble start to build deep within his cavernous chest a terrible sound that grew into a howling roar of pentup rage and anger it rebounded to the mountains across the sunlit plain as he shook the battleaxe aloft with one paw his eyes narrowed to red bloodshot slits which changed the whole world crimson in front of him orlando the axe was following the fox book one slagar the cruel from the diary of john churchmouse historian and recorder of redwall abbey in mossflower country we are dose to the longest day of this season the summer of the golden plain today i took up my ledger and quill to write it was cool and dim in the quiet of my little study indoors with a restless spirit isat quill in paw listening to the merry din outside in the sunlit cloisters of our abbey i could no longer stand the solitude that happy sound of revelry drew me outside yet there was still my recorders duties to catch up with taking ledger and quill i went out up the stairs to the top of the outer wall directly over the warriors cottage which is the gatehouse at the threshold of redwall abbey what a glorious day the sky painted special blue far the summer had not a cloud or shadow anywhere the hot eye of the sun caused bees to drone lazily while grasshoppers chirruped and sawed endlessly out to the west the great plains stretched away shimmering and dancing with heat waves to the distant horizon a breathtaking carpet of kingcup and dandelion mingled with cowslip never had we ever seen so many yellow blossoms abbot mordalfus named it the summer of the golden plain what a wise choice could see him ambling round the corner by the bell tower his habit sleeves rolled well up panting as he helped young woodlanders to carry out forms for seating at the great feast our eighth season of peace and plenty since the wars otters swam lazily in the abbey pond culling edible water plants small hedgehogs and moles were around the back at the east side orchard i could hear them singing as they gathered ripening berries or collected early damsons pears plums and apples which the squirrels threw down to them from the high branches pretty little mousemaids and baby voles tittered and giggled whilst choosing table flowers some making bright posies which they wore as hats frequently a sparrow would thrum past my head carrying some morsel it had found or caught the foremole and his crew would arrive shortly to dig a baking pit meanwhile the bustle and life of redwall carried on below me framed at the back by our beloved old mossflower woods high green and serene with hardly a breeze to stir the mighty fastness of leafy boughs oak ash elm beech yew sycamore hornbeam fir and willow mingled pale dusty dark and light green hues the varied leaf shapes blending to shelter and frame the north and east sides of our walls only two days to the annual festivities i begin to feel like a giddy young woodlander again however being historian and recorder i cannot in all dignity tuck up the folds of my habit and leap down among the merrymakers i will finish my writings as quickly as possible then who knows maybe ill stroll down to join some of the elders in the cellar i know they will be sampling the october ale and blackcurrant wine set by from other seasons just to make sure it has kept its taste and temperature correctly especially the elderberry wine of last autumns pressing you understand of course that i am doing this merely to help out old friends john churchmouse recorder of redwall abbey formerly of saint ninians afternoon sunlight slanted through the gaps in the ruined walls and roof of saint ninians old church highlighting the desolation of weed and thistle growing around broken rotted pews a small cloud of midges dispersed from dizzy circling as slagar brushed by them the fox peered through a broken door timber at the winding path of dusty brown which meandered aimlessly southward to meet the woodland fringe on the eastern edge slagar watched silently his ragged breath sucking in and out at the purplered diamondpatterned skull mask which covered his entire head when he spoke it was a hoarse rasping sound as if he had received a terrible throat injury at some time here they come get that side door open quick a long coloured cart with rainbowhued covering was pulled into the church by a dozen or so wretched creatures chained to the wagon shaft a stoat sat on the drivers platform he slashed at the haulers savagely with a long thin willow withe gee up put yer backs into it me beauties the cart was followed by a rabble of illassorted vermin stoats ferrets and weasels garbed the same as their comrades who were already waiting with slagar they wore broad doth sashes stuffed with a motley assortment of rusty daggers spikes or knives some carried spears and curiouslooking singlebladed axes slagar the cruel hurried them along come on shift your hides get that door back in place quick the driver jumped down from the cart theyre all here slagar he reported cept fer that otter he wasnt strong enough to carry on so we finished im off an chucked his carcass in the ditch then covered it with ferns the ants an insectsll do the rest the hooded fox gave a badtempered snort so long as you werent spotted by any creature news travels fast in mossflower weve got to stay hidden now until vitch gets back the twelve captives chained to the wagon shaft mice squirrels voles a couple of small hedgehogs and a young female badger were in an emaciated condition one of them a squirrel only a few seasons old moaned piteously water please give me water the stoat who had been acting as driver swung his willow cane viciously at the unfortunate squirrel water ill give you water you little toad how about a taste of cane eh take that slagar stepped on the end of the cane preventing the stoat swinging it further halftail you idiot what dyou want slaves to sell or a load of dead flesh use your brain stoat give the beast a drink here scringe give em all a drink and some roots or leaves to eat otherwise theyll be fit for nothing the ferret called scringe leapt to do sugars bidding halftail tugged at the willow cane to free it from slagais paw the hooded fox held down harder so the stoat could not budge it now then halftail me bucko i think youre getting a bit deaf lately i thought i told you to keep inside the woods with that cart halftail let go of the cane aye and so i did wherever possible he said indignantly but have you tried hauling a cart and twelve slaves through that forest out there slagar the cruel picked up the willow cane the hood coming tight about his jaws with a sharp intake of breath you forget yourself stoat i dont have to try hauling carts im the boss around here when i looked up that path a short time ago i saw you coming up the center of the road as if you hadnt a care in the world bold as brass in broad daylight do you realize that a sentry could have seen your dust from the top of redwall abbey halftail failed to recognize the danger signals yah whaf s the difference he shrugged they never saw anything slagar swung the cane furiously and halftail screamed in agony he huddled down against the side of the cart unable to avoid the rain of stinging cuts showering on his head shoulders and back ill tell you the difference slimebrain the difference is that you dont talk back to me im the leader youll learn that or ill flay your hide to dourags sugars voice grated harshly with each slash of the whipping willow whaaah mercy ooh owow please stop no more chief sugar snapped the cane and threw it scornfully at the stoafs heavily welted head ha your hearing seems a little better now cut yourself another switch that ones worn out the masked fox whirled upon his band of slavers they sat in cowed silence the silken hood stretched around his face as he leaned forward that goes for all of you if anyone ruins my plan that creature will wish hed taken his life swiftly with his own paw by the time im through with him understand there was a murmured growl of assent slagar climbed up into a ruined window frame he sat gazing in the direction of redwall abbey scringe bring me some decent food and a flask of wine from the cart he commanded the servile ferret ran to obey his master threeclaws station yourself outside at twilight keep an eye peeled for vitch coming back the weasel saluted righto chief the afternoon wore on peaceful and golden now and then a small dust devil swirled on the path with the summer heat slagar ran a paw tenderly over the silk harlequinpatterned hood smiling beneath it as a plan of revenge against redwall revolved slowly in his twisted mind vengeance had kept him going for a long time now sometimes he actually savoured the burning lances of pain that coursed through his face knowing the day was approaching when he would pay back those he considered responsible for his injuries a beetle trundled out of the pitted rotten woodwork of the window frame slagar the cruel pierced it neatly with a single claw watching the insect writhe in its death throes redwall heeheeheehee the foxs laughter sent shudders through every creature present mattimeo mattimeo cornflower wrung her paws distractedly she took one last look around cavern hole before climbing the stairs to great hall it was quiet and cool in the abbeys largest room shafts of sunlight multicoloured from the stainedglass windows lanced downwards etching small pools of rainbowhued light on the ancient stone floor the mouse wandered outside murmuring beneath her breath as she bustled along where has the tittle snip gone this time i wonder oh matti youll have me grey before my time john churchmouse was climbing rather stiffly down from the west wall stairs with his book and quill he almost bumped into cornflower as she crossed the grounds afternoon maam my my you look busy cornflower sat upon the bottom step and heaved a huge sigh she fanned her whiskers with her paw busy isnt the word for it mr churchmouse ive spent the last hour looking for that son of mine you havent seen him by any chance the kindly recorder patted cornflowers paw there acre dont you worry your head maam if your tittle matti is anywhere hell be with my tim and less young rips they were supposed to be helping brother rufus to write out place names for the table ha there he is now hi rufus seen anything of tim tess or young matti lately brother rufus strode across shaking his head he waggled a scroll of birchbark parchment at them both ruined he exclaimed just look at this list theyre supposed to have written i cant possibly use any of this forplace settings look abbot mordalfus speltwithone b basil stag hare youd think that was simple enough oh no theyve spelt basil bazzert and put an v on the end of stag john churchmouse pulled forth a kerchief he blew his snout loudly to disguise the laughter that was shaking him hmm yes ahaha scuse me well that wouldnt have been my tess you know shes quite good at the spelling brother rufus rolled the parchment tightly if s that little mattimeo hes the ringleader i know you may not like that cornflower marm but its the truth his voice was shrill with frustration cornflower nodded her head sadly yes im afraid i must agree with you brother rufus matti is becoming a real problem i darent tell his father half the things he gets up to john churchmouse peered sympathetically over the top of his square eyeglasses maybe itd be better to do so if youll excuse me for saying young matti will have to start growing up sometime if he ever hopes to become the warrior of red wall like his father matthias mattimeo will have to start behaving responsibly instead of going about like a spoilt brat if youll pardon the expression maam cornflower stood up i know exactly what you mean mr churchmouse but we may be judging matti a little unfairly after all he does have quite a lot to live up to being the son of redwalls warrior besides practically every woodlander within our walls has spoiled him since the day he was born both john and rufus nodded their heads in agreement the awkward silence which followed was immediately broken by a band of small creatures headed by a young mole who waved his digging daws wildly cumm yurr quickly gennelrnice asten ee li matti be aslayin vitch do urry even though the little creature was speaking in the quaint and complicated molespeech they understood the urgency of his message where where they cried take us there quickly the group dashed around the south abbey gable taking the shortcut to the east grounds cornflower picked up her skirts narrowly avoiding collision with a baby hedgehog brother rufus was out in front jess squirrel was first on the scene she had been up an apple tree in the orchard with her son sam when they heard the screams travelling from bough to bough swift as a bird in flight jess dropped to the ground and set about trying to separate the two creatures locked together on the grass they rolled kicked spat and bit furiously sam dropped down to his mothers aid they grabbed one each and held them apart as they did the crowd arrived mattimeo was panting heavily he tried to break free but jess shook him soundly by the scruff be still you little ruffian or ill tan your hide she warned him sam held tight to the other mouse vitch who looked more like a rat small though he was vitch was not struggling he looked quite relieved that the fight had been stopped john qmrchmouse strode firmly between them now then whats all this about eh he called me a skinny little rat he said i was not a warriors son he pulled my tail and he jumped on me and bit me and silence every creature present froze at the booming growl of a huge grey female badger constance the mother of all redwall stood high on her hind legs towering above mem folding her front paws judiciously she glared down at the two small miscreants vitch is it well vitch you are a newcomer to our abbey but that is no excuse for fighting we are peaceable creatures at redwall violence is never the answer to a quarrel what have you got to say for yourself the ratlike mouse wiped a smear of blood from his snout it was mattimeo he whined piteously he hit me first i wasnt doing anything i was just vitchs faltering excuses faded to a whimper under the badgers stern gaze she pointed a blunt paw at him go to the kitchens teu friar hugo that i sent you he will set you to sweeping floors and scrubbing pans i will not have fighting in the abbey nor whimpering whining and trying to put the blame upon others brother rufus take him along see he delivers my message to friar hugo properly vitch looked as if he were about to dodge off until brother rufus caught him firmly by the ear and marched him away come on young vitch greasy pots and floor scrubbing will do you the world of good owowooch leggo you big bully vitch protested youre pulling my ear off when vitch had gone constance turned upon the other culprit jess had released mattimeo he stood shamefaced kicking at a dump of turf looking down at his paws he did not see the nod which passed between his mother and constance cornflower was giving her silent permission to the badger mattimeo was in for a dressingdown son of matthias the warrior look at me constance commanded sheepishly the young mouse gazed upward until he was staring into constances unblinking dark eyes the onlookers stood silent as the matriarch gave the young mouse a piece of her mind mattimeo this is not the first time i have had cause to speak with you i am not going to ask you for an explanation because in this case i do not think you could justify yourself vitch is a newcomer hardly arrived here you were bom at redwall you know the rules of our abbey to live in peace with others never to harm another creature needlessly to comfort assist and be kind to all mattimeos lip quivered he looked as if he were about to speak but the badgers stern gaze silenced him today you took it upon yourself to attack another creature who is a guest in our home constance continued her voice an accusing knell you the son of my old friend matthias the warrior who fought to bring peace to mossflower mattimeo i will not give you any tasks to do as a punishment the sorrow and worry you cause your mother and the shame you bring down upon your father are the penalties that will rest on your own head go now and speak with your father mattimeos head drooped low as he stumbled off tess tim and sam squirrel kept silent they knew that every word constance spoke was the truth mattimeos middle name should have been trouble the new moon was up it hung like a freshminted coin in a still cloudless sky of midnight blue moths fluttered vainly upward only to drift spiralling down to the grasscarpeted woodland floor the trees stood like timeless sentinels somewhere a nightjar serenaded the soft darkness threeclaws was alert at his sentry post he spied the figure of vitch approaching and gave a low whistle the undersized rat looked up wheres slagar and the others he asked threeclaws pointed with his dagger inside the church whaf ve you been doing to yourself keep your snout out of my business fatty said vitch dodging nimbly past threeclaws into the church weasels and a few ferrets and stoats lay about sleeping on the floor slagar sat with his back against the painted cart he scowled at vitch you took your time getting here what in the name of the fang kept you vitch flung himself wearily on a tattered hassock washing dirty pots and greasy pans scrubbing floors and generally getting meself knocked about slagar crouched forward never mind all that i put you in there to do a job when is the feast to begin oh that one more moonrise then the early evening following right did you fix the bolts on the small north wallgate asked slagar of course that was the first thing i attended to theyre well greased and fit for a quick getaway you can keep that redwall place slagar im not goin back there again oh whys that vitch the foxs voice was dangerously gentle huh it was hard enough tryin to pass meself off as a mouse that young one wotsisname matty something he smelt a rat right away i had a fight with the little nuisance hes strong as an otter then i was pulled up by a big badger she gave me a right old teliin off peaceful creatures my front teeth i was lugged off and made to scrub dirty pots for some fat old cook he had me up to my tail in greasy dishwater standin over me and makin me scour and d ah shut your trap and stop snivelling rat this little mouse was he called mattimeo son of matthias the warrior aye thaf s him but how do you know slagar touched the red silk skull cover baring his fangs viciously never mind how i know hes the one well be taking away with us him and any others we can lay our paws on vitch brightened up maybe ill get a few minutes alone with mattimeo after we make our getaway when hes chained up good and proper slagar watched the small rafs face approvingly ha youd like that wouldnt you heehee like it id love it vitchs eyes shone malevolently the fox leaned closer vengeance thats the word i tell you rat theres nothing in the world like the moment when you have your enemy helpless and you can take revenge vitch was puzzled i cant imagine a little mouse like that being able to hurt you sly one what did he do that you seek revenge upon him slagar had a faraway look in his eyes and beneath the mask his breath hissed roughly it was his father the warrior that big badger too in fact it was all the creatures at redwall who hurt me the little one was not even born then but i know how they all dote on him he is the son of their warrior the hope of the future i can kill a lot of birds with one stone by taking mattimeo you couldnt imagine the agonies theyd go through if he went missing you see i know the woodlanders of that abbey they love their young and theyd rather be made captive themselves than have anything happen to their precious little ones this is what wul make my revenge all the sweeter suddenly vitch stretched a paw towards slagars masked face did they do that to you is that why you have to wear a mask over your head why dont you take it o aaaarrrggghh slagar seized vitchs paw and bent it savagely backwards dont you ever dare put your grubby paw near my face again or ill snap it dean off and make you eat it rat now get back to that abbey and keep your eyes open make sure you know exactly where that young mouse is at all times so that i can put my paw on him when the moment arrives he released vitch and the small rat huddled on the ground sobbing slagar spat on him contemptuously get up misery guts if youre still lying there in a moment youu feel my sword that really will give you something to moan about vitch picked himself up slowly and painfully next moment he was sent hurtling by a kick on the behind from slagar gam get yourself out of my sight you snivelling snotface vitch departed hastily leaving slagar to take his ease once more the cruel one lay back all thoughts of sleep banished by one word which echoed around his twisted mind like an eerie melody revenge matthias the warrior of redwall stood with his back to the empty fireplace cornflower had gone out early to help with the baking golden morning sunlight streamed through the windows of the small gatehouse cottage glinting off the dewy fruit piled upon the table there was a pitcher of cold cider some cheeses and a freshbaked loaf set out for breakfast but matthias lacked the appetite to do it justice and stared miserably about the room it was neat and cheerful which did not reflect the warriors mood there was a knock on the door come in please he called straightening up the foremole entered tipping the top of his black velvet furred head with a huge digging claw he wrinkled his button nose in a wide smile that almost made his bright tittle eyes vanish gudd morn to youm mattwise yurr uz motes be diggen a cooker pit r day mayaps youud loik to elp matthias smiled fondly he patted his old friends back knowing the mole had come to cheer him up thank you for the offer foremole unfortunately i have other more serious business to attend this morning hmm that sounds like it in the next room just getting out of bed will you excuse me my friend hurr hurr ee be a roight laddo yurr young mattee doant wack im too ard naow foremole chuckled and left to join his crew matthias had been far too angry to deal with his son on the previous afternoon so he sent him straight off to bed without tea or supper now the warrior stood facing the bedroom door watching the tousled head of his son peer furtively around the door jamb seeing his father he hesitated come in son the warrior curled a paw at him the young mouse entered gazing hungrily at the laden breakfast table before turning to face his father sternness had replaced the previous days anger on the warriors face well what have you got to say for yourself mattimeo m sorry mattimeo mumbled i should hope you are m very sorry mattimeo mumbled again foremole said i should whack you what do you mink m very very sorry t wont happen again dad matthias shook his head and placed a paw on his sons shoulder matti why do you do these things you hurt your mother you hurt me you hurt all our friends you even get your own little pals into trouble why mattimeo stood tonguetied what did they all want he had apologized said he was very sorry in fact he would never do it again jess squirrel his mother constance they had all given him a stern tellingoff now it was his fathers turn mattimeo knew that the moment he set paw out of doors he would be spotted probably by abbot mordalfus and that would mean another stern lecture matthias watched his son carefully beneath the sorrowful face and drooping whiskers he could sense a smouldering rebellion resentment against his elders turning to the wall over the fireplace matthias lifted down the great sword from its hangers this was the symbol of his rank warrior of red wall it was also the only thing that could command his sons total attention matthias held the weapon out here matti see if you can wield it yet the young mouse took the great sword in both paws eyes shining he gazed at the hard black bound handle with its red pommel stone the stout crosstree hilt and the magnificent blade it shone like snowfire edges sharp and keen as a midwinter blizzard the tip pointed tike a thistle spike once twice he tried to swing it above his head both times he faltered failing because of the swords weight nearly father i can nearly swing it matthias took the weapon from his son with one paw he hefted it then swung it aloft twirling it whirling it until the air sang with the thrum of the deadly wonderful blade up down and around it swung coming within a hairsbreadth of mattimeos head turning matthias snicked a stalk from an apple sliced the loaf without touching the table and almost carelessly flicked the rind from the cheese finally matthias gave the sword a powerful twist into the warriors salute bringing the blade to rest with its point quivering in the boor admiration for the warrior of redwall danced in his sons eyes matthias could not help smiling briefly one day you will be the one who takes my place son you will grow big and strong enough to wield the sword and i will train you to use it like a real warrior but it is only a sword mattimeo it does not make you a warrior merely because you carry it weapons may be carried by creatures who are evil dishonest violent or lazy the true warrior is good gentle and honest his bravery comes from within himself he learns to conquer his own fears and misdeeds do you understand me mattimeo nodded matthias grew stern once more good i am glad you do will not whack you i have never laid a paw on you yet and do not intend starting now however you attacked little vitch and you must pay for that one way or another at first i thought i should refuse you permission to attend the celebrations matthias watched the shock and disbelief on his sons face before continuing but i have decided that you may go providing you run straightaway to the kitchens there you will ask friar hugo to allot you double the tasks he gave to vitch yesterday when you have finished working for the friar you will offer to help your mother with the gathering of flowers until such time as she decides to free you of your task is that clear mattimeos face was a picture of disbelief he the son of the redwall warrior working never before had he been asked much less ordered to carry out abbey tasks the young mouse considered himself the inheritor of his fathers sword and duties as such he was firmly convinced that he was above any type of panscrubbing or daisygathering even constance knew that she had sentenced vitch to hard labour but even she did not dare tell the future champion to dirty his paws with menial chores besides vitch would be finished with his tasks by now he could stand about and gloat at the sight of his enemy ordered to perform double the work and more matthias watched his sons face now was the testing time would he behave like the spoiled little creature who had been indulged all his life by the abbey dwellers or would he show a bit of character the young mouse swallowed hard nodding his head ill do as you have asked dad matthias dapped him heartily on the back good mouse thats the mark of a warrior in training obedience off you go now morning sunlight stencilled the high window shaped in soft pink relief on the sandstone floor of great hall as mattimeo passed through on his way to the kitchens he felt the fur on his shoulders prickle slightly as if some beast were watching him from behind turning slowly he faced the west wall no creature was there the hall was empty save for the picture of martin the warrior upon the redwall tapestry mattimeo often had this same experience when he was alone and near the large woven cloth he drew closer standing in front of the magnificent armoured mouses likeness martin the warrior looked big and strong he held the famous sword easily in his right paw a smile upon his broad honest face and behind him the images of bygone enemies fled in fear as if trying to escape from the tapestry the young mouses eyes glowed in admiration of his hero he spoke to martin not knowing that his father matthias had done the same thing when he was young i could feel you watching me martin im just on my way to do penance in the kitchens but you probably know that i didnt mean to disobey my parents or cause them unhappiness you can understand that cant you i had to fight vitch because he said things about my father he thought i was scared of him but i am the son of a warrior and i could not let him insult my family if my father knew the truth of it all he would not have punished me but well hes my father you see i cant explain things properly to him youre different martin you understand how i feel mattimeo shuffled his paws on the stones beneath martins never changing expression you know sometimes youre just like my father look im sorry ill try to be a better mouse i promise not to fight or get into any more trouble or worry my parents again he turned and shuffled sulkily toward the kitchens muttering as he went i wish there was another great war then id show em huh theyd be glad of young mice that could fight then i wouldnt be sent off to scour pans theyd probably have to give me a medal or something like that thј smile upon the face of the tapestry warrior seemed to be gentler as the immobile eyes watched the small habitdad figure descend the steps of cavern hole friar hugo was absolute ruler in the vast kitchens of redwall he was the fattest mouse in the abbey and wore a white apron over his habit hugo always carried a dockleaf in his tail which he waved about busily fanning himself rubbing it upon a scorched paw or holding it like a visor across his forehead as he peered down into steaming bubbly pots mattimeo stood by awaiting orders whilst hugo checked his lists issuing instructions to his staff of helpers mmmm let me see thaf s six large raspberry seedcakes we need four more brother sedge quickly take that pan of cream from the flames before it boils over you can add the powdered nutmeg and whisk it in well sister agnes chop those young onions and add the herbs to the woodland stew er whats this ten flagons of cold strawberry cordial thatll never do we need twice that many here young matti nip down to the cellars and fill more flagons from the barrels ambrose spikes down there so you wont need the keys though the cooking smells were extra delicious mattimeo was glad to be out of the steamy heat and bustle of the kitchen for a while he saluted the friar smartly and ran off dodging mice hedgehogs voles and squirrels all carrying trays pots platters and bowls the abbey cellars were peacefully dim and cool unwittingly mattimeo surprised old ambrose spike the cellar keeper was pouring a bowl of october ale blowing the froth from the top before he drank as he dipped his snout mattimeo said scuse me please friar hugo said i was t the ancient hedgehog choked and sneezed spraying mattimeo with ale as he whirled around pahcoochawww dont sneak up on me like that young matti hold still a moment will you ambrose drained the bowl regaining his composure he stared at the froth lying in the bottom of his sampling bowl harr wunnerful though i do say it meself no creature brews october ale like the spike family now what can i do for you mousey friar says ive got to fill more flagons of strawberry cordial sir oh right barrels are through in the next section ambrose told him the ones marked pink flagons against the wall as go in careful now dont disturb the little casks of elderberry and blackcurrant wine or theyll go cloudy as mattimeo wandered into the next section he was hailed psst matt ssshhhh over here it was tim and tess and sam squirrel mattimeo tippawed over what are you three doing down here tess churchmouse stifled a giggle we slipped past ambrose while he was dozing come and have some cold strawberry cordial if s scrummy the trio had prised the bung from a barrel that lay on its side they used long hollow reeds as drinking straws dipping them down into the liquid and sucking up the sparkling icecold strawberry juice tess gave mattimeo a straw and he could not resist joining them cold strawberry cordial becomes sickly when drunk too freely matt tess tim and sam soon found this out and they lay back awhile and rested later the two churchmice and the young squirrel helped mattimeo to fill the flagons together they bore them up to the kitchens ambrose spike raised his snout from a bowl of nutbrown beer as they passed through his cellar mmmm s funny there was only one of em here before he muttered friar hugo was working flat out now there was still more than enough to be done before the feast you there billum mole

friends along to the larder i want two small white cheeses flavoured with sage two large red cheeses with beechnut and rosemary and one of the extra large yellow cheeses with acorn and apple bits be very careful how you roll the extra large yellow dont go knocking any creature down or breaking furniture the four chums dashed off whooping hurray were going to roll the cheeses abbot mordalfus cut a comical sight for so dignified a figure he was up to his whiskers in fresh cream candied peel nuts and wild plums friar hugo dusted off the abbots face with his dockleaf as he passed ha there you are alf well hows the special redwali abbof s cake coming along old mordalfus chewed thoughtfully on some candied peel very well thank you hugo though i still suspect it lacks something what dyou think hugo dipped his dockleaf into the mix and tasted it hmmm see what you mean alf if i were you id put some redcurrant jelly in to make it look more like an abbots cake doesnt hurt to cheat a little after all youre only going by abbot saxuss recipe and that s a matter of taste yes put more redcurrant in and well name it redcurrantwall abbot alf cake the abbot dusted flour from his paws smiling proudly what a good idea hi there matthias where are you off to the warrior of redwall was carrying two fishing lines and bait dodging a pair of moles who scurried past with a trolleyful of steaming bilberry muffins he called across dont you remember abbot we were supposed to be going fishing in the abbey pool for our annual centerpiece mordalfus dapped a floury paw to his brow goodness me so we were ill be right with you my son matthias peered about in the activity and bustle friar hugo have you seen mattimeo indeed i have matthias the young fellers a great help to me haha ive sent him and his pals to roll cheeses out thatll keep them busy constance badger is the only one large and strong enough to deal with a big yellow cheese and ive told them to roll one out hahaha id love to see how

says that hes been on a long patrol over the west plain and hasnt had decent food in three sunrises oh he also said to tell you hes appointed himself official sampler matthias and abbot mordalfus left the kitchens with all speed friar hugo was speechless at the news but only momentarily his fat little body puffed and swelled with indignation almost to bursting point as they hurried across great hall hugos outraged squeaks followed them what never im not having any retired regimental glutton feeding his face in my kitchens oh no why the skinny great windbag hell eat us out of storeroom and larder before sunset then fur forbid hell meet up with that ambrose spike and start sampling the barrels well have to tell the young ones to cover their ears when those two get to singing their barrackroom ballads and wild woodland ditties oh my nerves i dont think ill be able to stand it cornflower and mrs churchmouse were carrying a bundle of roses across the abbey grounds the blooms ranged from white right through the shades of yellow intermixed with lilacs pinks carmines and crimsons to the rich dark purples suddenly they were confronted and relieved of their burdens by a lanky old hare whose patchworkhued fur defied description his swaying lop ears twitched and bent at the most ridiculous angles as he bowed making a deep elegant leg to the two mice allow me laydeez wot wot two handsome young fillies totin all this shrubbery doesnt bear thinkin about eh he said gallantly basil stag hare at yservice gels hmmm my my is that cookin i smell ha old hugo burnin somethin tasty

kitchens soon hahahahohoho cornflower gasped heeheehee oh my ribs did you see the way he dropped the roses when he smelt food haha hes a stomach on four legs that feller mrs churchmouse chortled foremole and his crew looked up from the roasting pit they were digging wiping paws on fur and blowing soil from their snouts they chuckled and slapped each others backs i hohurr hurr ee be a champeen scoffer that un oi never seed narthin so ungered atop or below soil ee froiyerli wack im proper wi ladlespoon on mead youm see if ee doant hurrhurr resounding with the noise of busy creatures and laughter mixing with the smell of woodsmoke and cooking aromas the sunlit afternoon stretched into warm windless eventide turning the red sandstone abbey walls a rosy hue with the speckle of golden dust motes drifting lazily on the rays of the setting sun slagar sorted the odd jumble of performers clothing from the bed of the painted cart throwing appropriate outfits to the chosen actors of his travelling troupe fleaback bageye skinpaw youll be the tumblers share that lot out between you but chief fleaback protested and no complaints dyou hear here give me those yellow pawsocks you huh you can have em they look daft theyre supposed to look daft thickhead slagar explained i said no complaints come over here hairbelly youll be the balancer try this on oh and dont forget to put the ball sticky side down on your nose otherwise if fall off lets see how you look arr chief i was the balancer last time can i do the rope tricks this time no you cant leave that to wartdaw hes best at it oh im fed up with this already hairbelly grumbled look this tunic doesnt fit me besides i cant sing slagar was upon the unlucky weasel dagger drawn youll sing a pretty tune if i tickle your eyeballs with this blade bucko listen all of you one more moan from anyone and ill dump the lot of you back out upon the road where you came from you can go back to being the starving tramps and beggars you were before i took the trouble to form you into a proper slaving band now is that understood there was a subdued mutter slagar dropped the knife and grabbed a sword i said is that understood there was a loud chorus of ayes this time as the silken hood was beginning to suck in and out rapidly denoting slagas mounting temper hairbelly was a little slower than the rest still unhappy with his role as the balancer if s still not fair though chief he piped up youll probably only be standing about watching tomorrow night while we do all the work slagar seemed to ignore him for a moment turning to the cart he whipped out a swirling silk cloak it was decorated with the same design as his headcover and the lining was black silk embellished with gold and silver moon and star symbols twirling it expertly he threw it around his body leaping nimbly on to a row of pews then slagar spread his paws wide in a theatrical gesture will be lunar stellaris light and shadow hither and thither like the night breeze presiding over all lord of mountebanks now you see me he dropped out of sight behind the pews calling and now you dont the audience strained forward to see where he had hidden himself slagar was gone from behind the pews suddenly as if by magic he reappeared in the midst of his band right alongside hairbelly haha lunar stellaris lord of light and dark but to those who disobey my word i am slagar the cruel master of life and death before hairbelly could blink an eye slagar had run him through with his sword the stricken weasel stared at slagar in surprise and disbelief then he looked down at the sword protruding from his middle and staggered as his eyes misted over slagar laughed an evil brutal snigger take this fool outside and let him die there we dont want his blood in here now any one of you scum that wants to join him just let me know the morning of redwalts feasting dawned misty at first light abbot mordalfus and matthias had fished since the previous afternoon having had little luck in daylight they elected to continue until such time as they made a catch tradition dictated that a fish from the abbey pool must grace the center of the festive board in bygone years they had been lucky enough to land a grayling but this year there were few out of respect for the graylings they had let two fine big specimens slip the lines fishing doggedly throughout the night in the hour before daybreak they struck a mediumsized carp it was a fine battle the small coracleshaped boat was towed round and round the waters ploughing through rushes and skidding across shallows mordalfus was an experienced fishermouse and he plied all his skill and guile remembering the time when he was plain brother alf keeper of the pond helped along by matthiass strong paws the carp was fought and tackled diving and tugging leaping and backing until it was finally driven into the shallows blocked on by the boat and beached on the grassy sward warbeak the sparra queen was up early that day she roused the sparrow tribe who lived in the roof of the abbey when she spied the activity at the pond warbeak say sparras help matthias and old abbotmouse matthias and mordalfus were glad of the assistance tired wet and hungry they sat breathing heavily on the bank warbeak whew thank goodness youve arrived matthias saluted his winged friend and her tribe the abbot and i are completely tuckered out what dyou think of our fish the fierce little bird spread her wings wide plenty big fishworm friend matthias my warriors take urn to fatmouse friar he bum um fish good sparra tike fishworm we eat plenty at big wormtime as the sparra folk towed the carp off in the direction of the kitchens abbot mordalfus turned smiting to matthias good friends our sparrow allies though why everything is worm this or worm that ill never know can you imagine hugos face when warbeak tells him to burn fishworm good matthias shook pond droplets from his paws if s just their way of talking abbot sometimes i wonder who is the harder to understand a sparrow or a mole mordalfus glanced up the sun was piercing the mists casting a rosy glow over the world of mossflower with die promise of a hot midsummer day from the bell tower the sounds of the abbey bells pealed merrily away calling the inhabitants of redwall to rise and enjoy the day constance the badger ambled down to the pond and beached the coracle with one mighty heave whoofl if s going to be a real scorcher she remarked my word tittle tim and tess are certainly energetic listen to them ringing the methusaleh and the matthias bells still we mustnt waste the day theres so much to do before we can sit down to feast this evening matthias yawned and stretched well im for a swift forty winks and a bath after all that night fishing it you realize the abbot and i have been stuck in that boat since yesterday noon right mordalfus constance held a paw to her muzzle ssshhh hes fallen fast asleep good old alf the abbot was curled up on the grassy bank snuffling faintly still tackling the carp in his dreams matthias smiled parting his friend gently aye good old alf i remember him taking me on the pond for my first fish it was a grayling as i recall hmm i was even younger than my own son then ah well none of us is getting any younger as the seasons pass huh im certainly not the badger snuffled neither is alf but im not sure about you matthias sometimes i wonder if youve aged at all you go off and get your rest now and ill see to our angling abbot here constance quietly scooped the slumbering mordalfus up on to her broad back and trundled slowly off in the direction of the abbey dormitories on his way over to the gatehouse cottage matthias spied cornflower and mattimeo carrying flower baskets and pruning knives he waved to them we landed a beautiful carp ive got to have a nap and a bath cornflower tied her bonnet strings in a bow oh im glad you caught a good fish dear ive left your breakfast on the table well see you later mattimeo is so kind guess what hes promised to help me all day with the flowers matthias winked cheerily at his scowling son what a splendid fellow he is cornflower ill bet it was all his own idea too as the morning sun rose higher redwall came to life a team of young hedgehogs and squirrels sang lustily as they carried firewood damp grass and flat rocks to the baking pit which the moles were busy putting the final touches to digm sides noicen square jarge gaffer pat yon floor gudd an flattish loik yurr youm old your counsel loamdog oi knows wot oim adoin ho urr be you

hmm long time since i baked a carp brother trugg bring me bay leaves dill parsley and flaked chestnuts oh and dont forget the hotroot pepper and cream lots of cream an otter lingered near the carp licking her lips at the mention of the sauce ingredients hows about some fresh little watershrimp for a garnish friar she suggested thafd make prime vitties the fat mouse shooed her off with his dockleaf be off with you winifred ive counted every scale on that fish er if youre going for water shrimp ill need at least two nets full for a decent garnish the bee folk had been extra productive and kind in this summer of the golden plain and honey was plentiful it dripped off the symmetrical combs in shining sticky globules jess squirrel and her son sam were storing it in three flat butts the dear the set and the opencomb type much favoured by squirrels from the cellars came the slightly offkey sound of singing a quavering treble from basil stag hare backed by the gruff bass harmony of ambrose spike o if i feel sick or pale what makes my old eyes shine some good october ale and sweet blackcurrant wine id kill a dragon for half a flagon id wrestle a stoat to wet my throat id strangle a snake all for the sake of lovely nutbrown beer nuhuhuhut broooowwwwwnnnnn beeeeheeeyer upstairs in the vegetable store mrs lettie bankvole was remonstrating with her young offspring baby rolio he

instant cover your ears and help me with this salad i wallop a snake wiv a old rock cake rollo go and play outside and stop listening to those dreadful songs strangling dragons and swigging beer where will it all end mattimeo was finding out that roses had sharp thorns for the second time that day he sucked at his paw nipping out the pointed rose thorn with his teeth tim churchmouse had gone off shrimping with the otters tess stayed behind out of pity for the warriors son here matti you stack those baskets on the cart for your mum ill arrange the roses for you youve got them in a right old mess mattimeo winked gratefully at her thanks tess im about as much use as a mole at hying with all these flowers i never thought it would be such hard work then why did you volunteer for it i never volunteered he explained dad said i have to do it as part of my punishment for fighting with viteh tess stamped her paw oh that little rat if s so unfair it was he who provoked you into that fight look mere he is now over by the tables having a sly snigger at you mattimeo saw vitch leaning idly on a table he sneered and pulled tongues in the young mouses direction mattimeo felt his temper rising ill give him something to stick his tongue out at in a moment he muttered under his breath ill throttle him so hard if stick out permanently tess felt sorry for her friend pay no attention to him matti hes only trying to get you into more trouble it was difficult for mattimeo to ignore vitch now the rat was wiggling a paw to his snout end at his enemy the young mouse straightened his back from the pile of baskets right thaf s it ive taken all i can stand of his insults quickly less dodged past mattimeo and ran towards vitch who was still grimacing impudently angrily the young churchmouse picked up the first thing that came to her paw it was a pliant rose stem look out vitch theres a great big wasp on your tail she cried out urgently stay still ill get it startled by tesss warning cry vitch obeyed instantly turning and bending slightly so she could deal with the offending insect there was no sign of a wasp behind vitch tess swung the rose stem surprised at her own temper but unable to stop the swishing descent of the whippy branch it thwacked down hard across vitchs bottom with stinging speed swish crack yeeehoooooowowow the rat straightened like a ramrod leaping high in the air he rubbed furiously with both paws at the agonizing sting cornflower came hurrying over oh dear the poor creature what happened tess the young churchmouse looked the picture of innocence though she felt far from it blushing deeply she stammered an excuse oh golly vitch had a wasp on his bottom but i couldnt brush it off in time i think hes been stung vitch was thrashing about on the grass tears squeezing out onto his cheeks as he rubbed furiously at his tender rump cornflower was genuinely concerned oh you poor thing dontrubit youll make it worse go to sister may at the infirmary and shell put some herb ointment on it for you tess show him where it is please scrambling up vitch avoided tesss paw and dashed off sobbing tess turned to mattimeo aaahhh poor vitch it must be very uncomfortable she said her voice dripping sympathy mattimeo tried hard to keep a straight face indeed it must if s a terrible thing to be stung on the bottom by a churchmouse er wasp i mean cornflower put her paws about them both yes of course now you two run off and play there may be other wasps about and i dont want either of you stung come on matti lef s go watershrimping with tim and the otters tess suggested great ill race you over there one two three go cornflower shaded her eyes with a paw as she watched them run what a lively young pair she said aloud mrs churchmouse arrived carrying a pansy and kingcup bouquet yes but you watch your matti hell let her win hes very fond of my little tess bless them thats the way it should be cornflower nodded smiling it was late afternoon on the common land at the back of saint ninians slager had marshalled his band of slavers threeclaws the weasel and bageye the stoat stayed inside the ruined church together with the wretched little group of slaves who had been manacled to a running chain they were to await the return of slagar and the others that night now the sly one reviewed his force they were dressed as a band of travelling performers none looked evil slagar had seen to that every ferret stoat or weasel had a sifiy grin painted on its face with berry stain and plant dyes and all wore various types of baggy comical costume the fox swept up and down the line adjusting a ruffle here affixing a false red nose there dressed as the lord of mountebanks slagar the cruel looked neither comical nor amusing there was a mysterious air about him hooded and caped in swirling patterned silk which showed the black lining of the moon and stars motif at every turn right listen carefully throw down any weapons you are carrying right now his voice was a warning growl flatly dangerous there was an uneasy shuffling the slavers were apprehensive of entering the abbey without weapons slagar paced the ranks once more last chance when say throw down your weapons i mean it next time i walk around i will search you and anyone carrying a weapon anyone i dont care who ill kill that creature with his own armoury ill gut him right here in front of you all now throw down your weapons there was a clatter knives hooks swords strangling nooses daggers and axes fell to the ground like a sudden shower of april rain slagar kicked at a sawedged spike wartclaw gather em and sling em into the church until we get back the rest of you form up around the cart ten in front pulling the rest at the sides and back shoving well take the path nice and easy now travel at a steady pace thatll bring us there in the early evening as they trundled along the path the sly one said to his minions leave all the talking to me i know these creatures and i can handle them nobody talks is that clear i dont want any loosetongued addlebrain blowing the gaff by mistake if anyone speaks to you then pull a silly face smile and turn a cartwheel act the goat youre supposed to be a travelling entertainment so look amusing if they ask us to share their food which they probably will then mind your manners and dont go piggin it down take a slice or a portion of whatever and pass the bowl to your neighbor if theres ladies present then be polite and offer them the food first before you start wolfin it down your faminefed gobs be friendly with the little ones and keep your eyes out for any likely looking youngsters straightlimbed sturdy dont for the claws sake recognize vitch youve never set eyes on him before right any questions fleaback held up a paw er howll we know when the moment is right chief ill tell you dunderhead halftail was a little puzzled but how will you know slagar the sly one looked at him pityingly because theyll be asleep nitbrain how will you know that theyre all going to go asleep together at the same time halftail persisted slagar patted his belt pouch dont worry ill see to that oh and after weve put on our performance dont drink anything whatever you do when you are sitting at the table you can drink what you like but not once youve left the table to perform dun huh huh hu skinpaw laughed oafishly yer goin to drug em arent you chief slagar looked down from his perch on the cart ill drug you if you dont shuttup rurniphead halftail piped up again but if we drug em all whaf s to stop us taking over this redwall place ourselves the sly one nodded i was wondering when somebody was going to ask me that one well ill tell you i think the place is bad luck others have tried and failed and i mean real warriors not like you dithering lot no all i want is slaves and revenge a mere pawful of rabble could never hold a place like that youll know what i mean when you see the big badger or the otters they really know how to fight theyre not afraid of death if their precious abbey is threatened and were going in there unarmed halftails voice sounded shaky of course we are halfwit the fox said sarcastically you can bet theyll search us and we wouldnt last a second if they found arms on us that matthias the warrior would go at us like a thunderbolt matthias the warrior is that the badger halftail asked no hes a mouse haha a mouse skinpaw sneered yes a mouse but you wont laugh when you see him that ones a born warrior he has a sword too and i think its magic a magic sword hoho i might just borrow that for meself halftail howled stop the cart slagar commanded immediately the cart ground to a halt the silken mask puffed in and out furiously with savage temper dont dare touch that sword its magic is only for the redwall mice theres probably a spell on it it would be the death of us stick to the slaving do you hear me if be bad enough stealing his son but if you follow my plan well get away with it there was an ominous silence dust rose off the path where the cart had stopped the slavers looked doubtfully at one another the unspoken question hanging like a rock in their mouths steal the son of such a warrior so that was slagars revenge a fearsome warrior with a magic sword strong enough to protect a whole abbey who told you to stop come on stir your stumps and get this cart moving slagar told them they pushed and pulled with mixed emotions do as youre told and ill make you rich slagar egged them on with his sly tongue you all know me slagar the cruel the sly one nowhere is there a cleverer slaver than me i am the lord of doubledealing and my plan will easily confound an abbeyful of honest woodlanders theres not a stoat weasel rat ferret or fox among them theyre too noble for their own good theyll never find us i will have my revenge on redwall and you will all be rich when we go to sell them where none can follow scringe the ferret asked the question dreading the answer as the words tumbled out wherell we sell the slaves chief he swallowed hard and wished he had not spoken in the kingdom of malkarissm a moan of despair arose from the slaving band slagar was talking of the realm of nightmare nadaz the purplerobed voice of the host led a party of mackrobed rats up from the depths of the underground construction the causeway steps wound their way around the sides of the abyss from the green misted deeps to the broad torchlit ledge the blackrobes halted and nadaz came forward until he stood before the statue of malkariss sometime in the distant past it had been carved from a column of limestone which stood near the brink of the ledge the thick column was the result of stalagmite meeting stalactite and it reared from the ledge to connect with the high arched cavern ceiling it was carved into a monstrous effigy of a white polecat with teeth of rock crystal and eyes of the darkest black jet the torchlights from a large wheelshaped chandelier illuminated the terrifying idol nadaz bowed his head and began chanting malkariss ruler of the pit lord of the deep and dark i am nadaz the voice of the host to which your servants hark hear me o ruler of eternal night whose eyes see all we do king of the void beneath the earth we bring our pleas to you speak nadaz tell me that my kingdom is ready malkarisss voice was a labored hiss which echoed around the rocks as it emanated from between the unmoving crystalline teeth of the statue the purplerobed rat stretched his daws in supplication lord malkariss the rocks will not haul themselves nor will they be cut into blocks to be laid one on another four more slaves have died of late we need more workers strong young woodland creatures who can labor for many seasons nadaz stood awaiting his masters answer not daring to look up at the awful glittering jet eyes are there no more new captives lying in my cells lord the cells have stood empty for a long time now what of the longtails at the river have none passed this way none lord who dares to climb the high plateau and risk the pine forest hmmmm then you must carry on with what you have and work them harder get word to stonefleck tell him to watch for the masked fox he has been gone two seasons now there was a prolonged silence the torchlights flickered and winked from the flecks of mica and crystal which studded the cavern walls as the blackrobes stood impassively at the head of the steps waiting upon the voice of the host finally nadaz bowed malkariss i hear and obey turning he swept through the ranks of blackrobes leading them back down the causeway steps they were soon lost in the green mist that arose from the depths from below there came the sound of chiselling and hammering the scraping of great stones being dragged and the crack of whips intermingled with the weak anguished cries of young woodland slaves imprisoned beneath the earth into a life of forced labor the statue of the immense white polecat stood alone in the torchlight a sigh emanated from the mouth aaaaanhhhh my kingdom at redwall sporting events for the youngsters had been going on since early afternoon matthias woke refreshed he sat on the west wall steps with john churchmouse abbot mordalfus basil stag hare and old ambrose spike they drank cider and watched the antics of a young mole trying to shin up a greased pole to retrieve the bag of crystallized fruits from its top the little fellow was over halfway up further than any had got and the watchers on the steps yelled encouragement dig your claws in gilly youll make it take it easy old lad a bit at a time thaf s the way stay still stay still oh hes slipping gilly slid slowly earthward his face a picture of longing gurr sloidy owd greasepole ee be loik tryin r rassle wi a damp frog o shame on oi ee camdys still thurr they applauded loudly good try young un well done constance the badger came ambling over towards them as she passed near to the greased pole young sam the squirrel moved like lightning he dashed a short way bounded on to constances back sprang up on her head and gave a mighty leap it carried him over the top of the greased pole he snatched the candied fruit bag as he went without a backward look i say was that fair constance blinked owlishly gilly and sam sat laughing on the grass sharing the fruits between them the young mole patted sam with a greasy paw as he stuffed a sugar plum in his mouth hun hurr baint nuthin in ee rules agin it no zurr look out gangway here come the runners on the second lap of the abbey grounds the runners came by tess churchmouse in front by a whisker and a tail they sped by jockeying frantically to be among the front runners on the last lap john churchmouse puffed at his pipe between chuckles shes a one for the running my young tess is mattimeo came dashing across wearing a coronet of dripping duckweed on his head look what the otters gave me won i won he shouted streamsleek a powerful young otter followed in mattimeos wake along with a group of young creatures the otter slouched down on the steps shaking water from his coat crimp me sails but he did that matthias three circuits of the pool on a log i had me course well charted to keep up with him the warrior mouse handed streamsleak the cider flagon and ruffled his sons damp back well done marti youd better let that duckweed tiara dry out a bit before you wear it though balderdash spoils of war wot basil stag hare said through a mouthful of summer vegetable pastie you wear it young feller me bucko twas honorably won tim churchmouse came round from the south side of the abbey carrying baby rollo bankvole on his back look everybody this ruffian has just beaten me to first place in the sack race they laughed aloud as baby rollo flew a small paper kite on a string that he had been given as a prize by cornflower basil stag hare took the infant upon his knee he gave him a drink from his cider beaker and a bite of his pastie right rollo you young rip lets hear you sing for old uncle baz wot rollo willingly obliged piping up in his gruff baby voice fight a flagon an drink a dragon gizzard a lizard an split his blizzard ride a spider for good ol cider gooooood oooooold tidentrrrrr suddenly basil deposited the infant on the steps and shot up to the west ramparts mrs lettie bankvole was seen bustling across from the gatehouse doorway where she had been folding napkins for the table ooh you villainous lopeared troublemaker just let me get my paws on you and ill make you sing a different tune basil stood on a battlement peak trying to reason with the furious mother of rollo but madam i can assure you the little chap composes his own verses jolly good too if you ask me top

inventive little wretch must remember that verse what was it strangle a mole with a great big marrow talented young blighter wish wed had him in the old fiftyseventh foot fighters mess as the bells

peace in red wall so sing from dusk to dawn and let the abbey bells ring the sun will bring the morn and still we will merrily sing the sweet sounds floated out fading on the warm evening air as every woodlander and redwall creature hastened to take their place at table for the longawaited feast such festivity there never was eight long trestle tables had been laid in a sprawling octagon covered in the finest white linen overlaid with pastelhued mats of woven rushes intricate flower arrangements trailed nightscented stock roses pansies kingcups jasmine lupins and ferns at the junction of each table places were set out and named in neatly printed small scrolls each of which doubled as a napkin bowls of hot scented flower waters steamed fragrantly awaiting the advent of sticky paws there was no top table or concession to rank and the humblest sat alongside the greatest squirrels rubbed paws with mice otters rubbed tails with voles and moles tried not to rub shoulders with hedgehogs everything was perfect except for the food that was beyond mere words salads of twelve different types ranging from beetroot to radish right through many varieties of lettuce and including fennel dandelion tomato young onion carrot leek com every sort of vegetable imaginable cut shredded diced or whole these were backed up with the cheeses arranged in wedge patterns of red yellow and white studded with nuts herbs and apple loaves were everywhere small brown cobs with seeds on top long white batons with glazed crusts early harvest loaves shaped like comstooks teabread nutbread spicebread

fanning himself with the tailheld dockleaf he regained his breath abbot the fish prayer if you please the eating stopped all sat in reverent silence as mordalfus spread his paws over the carp and intoned fur and whisker tooth and daw all who enter by our door nuts and herbs leaves and fruits berries tubers plants and roots silver fish whose life we take only for a meal to make there was a loud and heartfelt amen from all the abbot gave the proceedings over to hugo and the fat little friar cleared his throat ahem my friends this year i have created for you a dish known as carp capitate you

excellent merely by the sight and aroma knowing that when i actually taste it i will be lost for words a cheer went up at the abbof s gallant pronouncement hugo fanned himself furiously with pleasure

slagar the cruel knocked upon the door of redwall abbey o slagar turned to the group at the cart they had been watching him banging fruitlessly upon the main gate theyll never hear you chief wartdaw ventured well have to think of some other way to distract them slagars paw was numb from hitting the woodwork we you mean me dont you here skinpaw sing that song halftail get that little drum from the cart and beat it scringe theres a flute in the cart see if you can get a nine out of it skinpaw was the only one of the slavers who had actually been in a travelling show filling his lungs he began singing the song of strolling performers in a cracked voice lalalalalalala we travel from afar derrydown dill over vale and hill we camp beneath the stars lalalalalalala good fortune to you sir the strolling players bring to you magic from everywhere skinpaw shrugged at slagar chief thaf s all i know ive forgotten the rest the sly one swirled his cloak impatiently then sing it over and over again you two try to pick up the tune on the flute and drum the rest of you tumble about in the road and join skinpaw on the la la la bits slagar kept his eye against a joint that was slightly open in the solid gate timbers the entire troupe went through the routine several times slagar waved his paw encouragingly at them keep it up louder louder i can see theyve heard us theyre coming across the grounds keep it up keep going the hooded fox leapt aboard the cart crouching he covered himself with a pile of old coloured wagon sheeting there was a scraping of drawbars and bolts and the door opened partially as matthias came out onto the path followed by constance the badger and ambrose spike they stood awhile watching the performers then matthias called out hey there what can we do for you send em on their way scruffy bunch of ragbags ambrose spike snorted ambrose dont be so ill mannered constance nudged him sharply we can at least be civil to travellers leave the talking to matthias and myself slagar bounded up in a whirl of coloured cloth leaping over the edge of the cart he landed on the path twirling his cape this way and that happy midsummer eve to you my lords he said doing his level best to keep his grating voice light and cheerful you see before you a band of strolling entertainers foolish fellows and peaceloving buffoons we travel the roads merely to bring you songs stones tumbling and leaping comical antics to amuse you and your families where do we come from no creature knows except i stellar lunaris master of the moon and stars the fox whirled round and round showing the fining of his cape the silk shimmering and twinkling in the hot summer twilight on the dusty roadway constance relaxed slightly only a band of travelling players her keeii old eyes checked the ditch that ran west of the path for signs of others hidden there it was clear before he could be stopped ambrose spike called out and what will it cost us this magical entertainment slagar stopped the cloak revolving and spread his paws a crust from your grand table maybe a drink of cool water and the safety of your abbey walls so that my friends and i can sleep without fear through the night oh do not worry good creatures we will sleep upon the grass out here if you fear us matthias the warrior of redwall stepped forward rubbing his paw across the red pommel stone of the wondrous sword he carried sheathed at his side we fear no creature redwall buried its foes many seasons back stay here a moment i would talk with my friends the trio drew back into the gateway where groups of curious revellers had left the table and were peering round the gates well what dyou think warrior constance asked in a low voice they look harmless enough to me even though they are led by a fox matthias pursed his lips hmm the rest are weasels stoats and ferrets nothing that we cant cope with theyd be outnumbered at least fifteen to one inside redwall and they dont seem to have any hidden army waiting to spring out in ambush on us i think they look ragged but harmless enough behind them the young ones were eagerly craning their necks calling out excitedly hurray clowns and tumblers oh can we see them constance look theres a magic one ooh see his cloak vitch was leading the youngest in a chant we want to see we want the show basil stag hare pushed his way though to matthias he was chuckling indulgently and waving his ears for silence steady on chaps haw haw a jolly old concert party wot dont be an old stick in the mud constance let the blighters in as long as they dont pull rabbits out of hats constance shook her big striped head from side to side doubtfully the chanting broke out even louder finally she winked at matthias and nodded to the hooded fox oh all right come on then you youngsters move aside and let me open the gates otherwise these tumblers wont be able to get in the young ones gave a great cheer slagar was impressed with the long tunnel of arched sandstone it denoted the massive thickness of the abbey walls the travelling troupe looked around at the great abbey of redwall standing in its own grounds the magnificent alfresco feast lit by the flames from the baking pit this was a place of riches and plenty they were patted down by abbey dwellers searching for arms slagar shook his head sadly alas these are untrusting times we live in abbot mordalfus bowed courteously merely a precaution friend the feast is far from over yet kindly come and sit with us at the table there is plenty for all the silken hood quivered as slagar wiped away an imaginary tear such hospitality and kindness thank you sir my friends and i will repay you by putting on an extra special performance for you and your good creatures as they moved over to the table nobody noticed vitch slip a small scroll to slagar the sly one secreted it beneath his voluminous cape wartclaw crept up behind skinpaw with a jug of water poised to throw at him a ferret named deadnose who stood facing skinpaw was juggling three balls unaware that wartclaw was about to drench skinpaw with the water the youngsters squirmed with glee as they shouted out look out hes behind you who what did you say skinpaw wrinkled his false red nose and grinned a silly grin ooooh look out hes behind you deadnose dropped one of the balls he was juggling skinpaw bent to pick it up at the exact moment that wartclaw flung the water from the jug at him the youngsters roared with laughter as deadnose was drenched instead of skinpaw scringe darted in with a large floppy wooden clapper he swung it and smacked wartclaw across the bottom with a loud comic slap wartclaw whooped with surprise dropped the jug and stepped in it by accident getting his paw stuck inside they ran off with wartclaw hopskipping clumpetty thump the jug fixed on his paw while scringe followed up whacking his bottom with the clapper all the inhabitants of redwall laughed merrily abbot mordalfus held his sides as he chuckled to basil ohohoho i knew that juggler would get drenched hahaha oh look the rednosed fellow is eating one of the juggling balls hee hee hee it was an apple all the time ohahaha hawhawhaw silly old blighter i say the weasel chappies trying to eat the other juggling balls ooohoohoo theyre real wooden ones spit em out old lad y ll break your teeth slagar was prancing about the tabletops giving out paper butterflies to the young ones they flew just like real butterflies nobody noticed that every time he passed a jug flagon or bowl a little powder was dropped into the drink skirting the back of the gathering slagar stood behind the flames of the baking pit and threw a pawful of powder into the fire it caused a whoosh of green flame to shoot upward leaping across the pit the sly one seemed to materialize out of the middle of the emeraldcoloured flames stellar lunaris lunar stellaris i am the lord of mountebanks is there one among you named ambrose spike aye thats me over here but how did you know my name the lord of moon and stars knows all ambrose spike you are the keeper of the cellars and your october ale next season will be even better than before well im

dreadful songs the sly one cocked an ear hark is that the voice of mrs lettie bankvole mother of baby rollo mrs bankvole was flabbergasted oh haha yes thats me but how did you know mr stellaris gather round gather round good creatures of redwall abbey i will tell you of secrets known only to the lord of mountebanks but first you must drink a toast to the two who caught the big carp your abbot and your warrior two of the noblest most brave creatures that ever lived fleaback skinpaw wartdaw scringe and the rest dashed around the tables chuckling heartily and tickling little ones behind the ears while filling up every beaker and bowl foremole stood up on a bench yurrs to mattwise ee wurrier an yurrs to habbot dalfuzz gudd elth gennelbeasts beakers and bowls clinked together as the toast was drunk slagar threw another pawful of dust into the fire this time it rose up golden and smoking in a column as he called out in an eerie voice stellar lunaris fortuna mandala hark to me all creatures mattimeo was fascinated by the magic fox he put his cider down and watched with rapt attention now the fox had taken off his flowing silken cloak he held it up and swirled it in front of him slowly at first then getting faster and faster chanting as he did see the stars see the moon penned around by blackest night see the diamonds red and purple silk and fire and blood and light see them turning ever turning like a great mandala wheel spinning as the fire is burning what is false and what is real t from somewhere near mattimeo could hear mrs churchmouse gently snoring he tried to fix his eyes on the swirling cloak as it turned from diamond patterns to starstudded night skies the foxs voice droned on and on until finally mattimeo could no longer keep his leaden eyelids from drooping he fell asleep across the table full of good food well entertained and completely happy the day dawned humid and grey soon huge dark cloud masses bunched in a lowering sky occasionally cut through by forked lightning flashes over to the west thunder rumbled dully from the far horizons of the golden plain then drops of rain each one as big as a beechnut began falling constance the badger was wakened by the wetness combined with the scream of distress from baby rollo mama all around the badger red wall creatures were wakening groaning and stumbling about in the heavy downpour matthias held his throbbing head with one paw as he shook constance quickly lets get them all in out of the rain was that somebody shouting a moment ago mama mama wake up constance came fully awake as thunder boomed out overhead and the scene was lit by a branch of forked lightning if s baby rollo over by the north wallgate hurrying through the battering thunderstorm constance and matthias dashed to where the little bankvole sat crying by the small gate low in the sandstone wall he was shaking the still form of mrs lettie bankvole mama oh mama please wake up im getting wet the warrior mouses head began to clear with the rain cornflower over here take mis little one inside we must find out whafs been going on here cornflower scurried off carrying baby rollo in her paws as she shielded him from the wet with her body there there little rollo you come with me matthias and constance will see to your mama basil stag hare dashed to join them a skinny bedraggled figure in the rain oh me poor old head hello whafs up you two constance sat by the pitiful bundle on the grass wiping rainwater from her eyes shes dead matthias who could have done this matthias had his forehead flat against the wall rain mingled with the tears that filled his eyes who else but that rotten fox and his venomous gang i was taken in fooled oh the filthy cowards how could they murder a helpless creature like mrs bankvole from behind the open walldoor there came a faint moan matthias straightened up quickly and rushed towards the door as it swung back john churchmouse staggered out from behind the door blood flowing from his temple where an ugly cut ran a jagged line from ear to ear matthias caught him holding him up against the wall in the pouring rain john are you all right what happened the churchmouse wiped rainwater and blood from his eyes he was obviously in deep shock reliving the horrific events that he had witnessed stop stop them get back mrs bankvole no no come on hugo got to stop them blood cant see wheres hugo wheres hugo t he collapsed senseless against matthias constance stepped in sweeping the unconscious churchmouse up with a single paw ill get john inside winifred cover mrs bankvote with a tablecloth for the moment matthias basil see if you can find friar hugo the big badger hurried off through the curtain of rain with her burden the warrior mouse and the hare searched frantically around the grounds in the increasing downpour friar hugo where are you hugo come on old lad call out if you can hear us winifred the otter bumped into matthias as he rounded the bell tower no sign of hugo she asked none at all winifred he must have followed them out of the grounds hi basil come on lef s search the woodland outside the gate the rain made loud splattering noises as it burst upon the tree canopy visibility was bad with rising mist in the woods matthias searched in the loam beneath bushes behind trees and among ferns nearby he could hear basil muttering through the deluge come on hugo you old panwalloper show self i promise ill never raid your kitchens again cross m heart and hope to starve winifred the otter shook water from her sleek coat as she bobbed up and down hoping to catch a glimpse of hugo in the distance she checked with matthias i dont think a fat little mouse like hugo could have travelled further than this perhaps wed better make our way back to the abbey and search the grounds more thoroughly she suggested suddenly matthias went rigid listen can you hear something winifred a muffled noise came to them through the rain the otter pointed over there quick they crashed though the undergrowth to the place where the sound came from it was basil stag hare he was crouching on the wet ground hugging something to him and sobbing brokenly matthias felt a huge lump like a lead weight in his chest as he knelt beside the hare winifred turned away unable to look the fat little redwall cook lay limp and dead unaware of the rain that beat down upon the favourite dockleaf his tail still held in its curl tears coursed openly down basils cheeks as he hugged the still form hugo old lad what did they do to you winifred knelt with her friends silently she began brushing the loam and soil rrom the sodden habit and once spotless white apron of the beloved little friar then without warning she broke down and began weeping like a baby he never did harm to a living creature why this why basil stood slowly his legs shaking as he held hugo in his paws permission to carry my old friend back to his abbey matthias remained kneeling on the ground his fur saturated by the ceaseless rain permission granted basil winifred will you tell them ill be a little late back to great hall the warriors voice trembled as he spoke as matthias watched his friends depart he picked up the dockleaf that had fallen from friar hugos lifeless tail and pressed it to his lips in silent remembrance of his friend inside the great hall of the abbey a large brazier had been set up and lit steam rose from the fur of all the creatures as they rubbed themselves off on rough towels sister may from the infirmary moved among them giving out doses of herbal medicine many sat on the stone boor clutching their heads tightly to relieve splitting headaches matthias strode in followed by basil stag hare he clattered his swordblade against a sandstone column to gain attention abbot constance winifred jess squirrel warbeak sparra foremole and you basil follow me down to cavern hole the rest of you stay inside keep diy and warm and look after those who are not well a semblance of order was restored in great hall hot soup was being made in the kitchen warm blanketswere distributed by brother rufus and sister agnes sister may and mrs churchmouse tended john churchmouse in the infirmary while cornflower took charge of baby rollo down the steps in cavern hole matthias sat at the big table with the others he looked around well did any creature see what went on last night can anyone shed any light on this terrible thing want straight answers no guesses please there was silence then the abbot said we will have to wait until john churchmouse is recovered sufficiently to talk the only other two witnesses to what went on are no longer with us there was a stunned silence as the enormity of events sat like a heavy stone upon the little group jess squirrel stood up slowly ill go to the infirmary and see how mr churchmouse is faring basil livened up thaf s the ticket jess action thafs what we need now where do we start the abbot folded his paws into his wide sleeves at the beginning basil i think we all know who did this shocking thing harr boi okey we do zurr foremole growled twas they rascally durtbags foxes an the loik theym magicked us f sleepen magicked my aunties tail winifred the otter snorted that was a powerful sleeping draught we shouldve known not to trust a fox should never have let em in matthias banged the tabletop hard enough no accusations or blamelaying please now you say that we were drugged by a sleeping draught well that makes sense i remember the fox asking us to drink a toast he coutd have slipped herbs or powders into the drinks any time at all while we were watching the entertainment ambrose spike had walked in his stickles rose stiffly aye thats what he did the scummy toad then he started twirlin that cloak thing of his round and round i couldnt keep me old eyes open there were murmurs of agreement me too if s the last thing i remember aye we were mesmerized i tell you lunar stellaris my back paw colossal cheek more like it wot foremoles ground logic took over hurr but wot worr ee arfter thats the question matthias sighed heavily we dont keep treasure or precious things that could be looted theres only the sword and our great tapestry i have the sword and i know our tapestry soil hangs in great hall ive seen it with my own eyes this very morning so what was he after warbeak the sparra queen shook a wing they um worms must come from the northlands all bad in north they go back that way open little wormgate in north wall basil seconded warbeak v y know i believe youre right old thing when the bally rain stops chuckin down ill try and track em huh fraid there wont be much to track after this downpour though i think the brothers and sisters should take stock of everything just in case there is something missing the abbot suggested foremole would you get a burial detail of your moles to dig two graves next to each other basil perhaps you could see what you can find around that small north wallgate the rest of you when the rain stops please help to bring the tables and stuff back in wed best get the abbey back to normal running as soon as possible matthias stood up resolutely right thaf s it then i think ill take a walk up to the infirmary and see how john is sister may and mrs churchmouse cautioned matthias to be silent as he entered the sick bay john churchmouse lay pale and still but breathing evenly how is he matthias whispered mrs churchmouse smiled alive and recovering thank you matthias john opened his eyes slowly and looked around matthias pressed his head back to the pillow as he tried to rise take it easy old friend just lie there but if you feel like talking perhaps you could tell us what you remember of last night nobody knows what went on at the feast tears beaded in johns eyes friar hugo and i had full cups already so we didnt let them pour us more ale poor mrs bankvole was too busy looking after her baby to join in the toast matthias theres no doubt about it you were all drugged even then hugo and i were half hypnotized by that fox with the cape when we saw what was going on we ran after them and tried to stop it all three of us the friar mrs bankvole and myself but what did go on what were they after john matthias had an awful feeling in the pit of his stomach as he asked the question the churchmouse broke down sobbing our young ones matthias they took my tim and tess sam squirrel cynthia bankvole and your mattimeo an icy claw gripped matthiass heart the words echoed from the doorway where cornflower stood with baby rollo mattimeo gone impossible im sure i saw him with the others out there in the rain wasnt he with you matthias tim and tess he was with tim and tess yes thaf s it my tim and tess oh you saw them mrs church mouses voice was tinged with hope matthias slammed his paw against the wall anger and frustration etched upon his face we were still half drugged the rain was sheeting down you could not have seen them you must believe what john says he saw them being taken what fools we were not to realize it before now cornflower was still shaking her head refusing to accept the fact jess theyll be with jess downstairs all wrapped in blankets and drinking hot soup youll see cornflower stop theyre gone believe me but by my sword til bring them back i swear it baby rollo was hidden by the aprons of cornflower and mrs churchmouse as they hugged each other and wept john raised his head little cynthia vole and sam squirrel too they took them all he said sadly sister may began bathing johns wound she dabbed away the tears that fell upon his brow poor jess whatever will we tell her dearie me little cynthia is an orphan bless the mite what will become of her what a cruel and heartless thing to do those wicked beasts stealing our young ones away what badness matthias put his paw about cornflowers shaking shoulders he was numbed thoughts of his son raced through his mind the stern lecture he had given him the double tasks now he was gone it was as if half of his heart had gone too he loved mattimeo who would do kttle things that reminded him so much of himself and cornflower poor cornflower even now she was trying to be brave comforting mrs churchmouse matthias held her tighter dont worry cornflower ill bring our son back ill bring them all back nothing can stop me doing that hell be back in his own bed in the gatehouse cottage soon youll see mrs churchmouse went to tend john and sister may slipped off to break the sad news to jess squirrel cornflower took rollo over to the infirmary window she stared out at the rain i wont be going back to our gatehouse until mattimeo is back she declared ill stay at the abbey and mind rollo matthias nodded silently as cornflower dried her eyes and sighed oh mattimeo i hope no harm comes to you my son poor mattimeo baby rollo spread his paws wide his face as sad as cornflowers pore timeo goned aaaahhhhh matthias joined them at the window staring out into the rain sorrow and pain mingled with the cold lights of rage and vengeance in his eyes mattimeo did not know at first whether he was awake or dreaming the tip of his ear itched initatingly but it was as if there were leaden weights on his limbs he could only raise his paw halfway then the other paw would start to come upward as if pulled like a puppet on a string from far away he heard unpleasant sniggering and a loud swishing noise crack the young mouse arched his back in agony as a searing pain lanced across him his eyes opened with shock he saw vitch swinging a long thin willow cane the second blow caught him low across the flanks stung by pain and rage mattimeo tried to leap up and teach the little rat a good lesson but he stumbled falling backwards with manacles clanking around him he was chained vitch laughed nastily and raised the whipping cane slowly come on spoilt baby little abbey pet what are you going to do now eh again and again the cane rose and fell striking the young prisoner indiscriminately in his excitement vitch was jumping about as he wielded the thin willow haha theres no silly badger to stop me now is there i wont have to scrub floors and dean saucepans now take that and that and th he danced in too dose under the stinging rain ot blows mattimeo saw vitchs paw step within his reach crossing both paws tightly the young mouse tugged hard bringing the little rat crashing down mattimeo bit butted and belabored away at his tormentor with the slack of the chain help help murder hes killing me vttch screamed in panic threedaws the weasel hauled them roughly apart he kicked mattimeo down and flung vitch against the far wall hells teeth stop screeechin and shoutin will you whaf s going on here vitch was quivering with indignation you stop shoving me about threedaws slagar said i could take my revenge on that one when we had him chained up the weasel looked at him disgustedly huh you werent makin a very good job of it were you from what i saw mis mouse was givin you a good hidin vitch dashed forward swinging the cane ill teach him a lesson he wont forget this time threedaws caught the cane and pulled it from vitchs grasp then grabbed the struggling rat firmly by the neckfur no you wont snotnose im in charge while slagars not here theres to be no noise see we dont want any creature whos out searching to hear anything now you just behave yourself or ill lay this cane across your back rat vitch slumped against the windowsill snivelling but he obeyed the weasels order mattimeo looked about there were others chained up around the walls mice squirrels hedgehogs all of them young creatures he saw tim and tess and sam squirrel chained against the far wail fetters clanking he waved to them sam tim tess how did we get here he asked silence there halftail the stoat shouted and pointed a dagger warningly at mattimeo shuttup mouse youve been told once save your breath youre going to need it for marching when halftail moved out of earshot a young badger chained next to mattimeo whispered thats halftail watch him hes a cruel one my name is auma from the west plains whats yours mattimeo son of matthias the redwall warrior oh so youre the one that slagar was after slagar yes the sly one the hooded fox auma explained this lot are a band of slave traders though where theyre taking us i dont know ooh where am i take these chains off me boohoohoo i want to go home boohoohoo it was cynthia bankvole she had just awakened chained to the other side of auma threedaws came hurrying over he thrust his villainous face right up against cynthias tearful whiskers one more peep out of you missie and ill really give you something to cry about now cut out the whimpering cynthia was struck dumb with terror slagar came bounding in through the broken south window the silken hood plastered wetiy against his muzzle he shook himself vigorously showering rainwater about him by the claw if s bouncing down in torrents out there still all the better for us if we get going fast then therell be no tracks to cover they wont know which direction weve taken on the other side of the leaf that lot at redwall will have been wakened by this downpour so we cant afford to hang around the false trail to the north should keep them busy for a while deadnose and fengal have taken the cart up that way then theyll circle around and meet us in the forest south of here bageye lounged in a pew what if they dont chief suppose they miss us that wood out there is a big place know the face beneath the hood seemed to grin well hard luck on them if ii mean bigger shares for all of us bageye had to think about it for a moment then he gave a slow smile oh aye huh huh so it will a long running chain was brought out and the prisoners were made to stand as it was run through their manacled front paws and locked at either end mattimeo found himself standing between auma and tess tim and sam were behind them slagar paced the line checking links and shoving the captives into place satisfied that everything was in order he pulled forth a strangelooking weapon and began twirling it about it was a short wooden handle from which ran three braided leather thongs and at the end of each thong hung a round metal ball they whirled and clacked sharply as he manoeuvred them expertly i am slagar the cruel you are my slaves now the silk sucked against his face as he spoke when i say walk you walk if i say run you run if i decide you may live then you will live if i take it into my head that you may not live then i will see to it that you die if ever you should get the chance to escape or make a run for it my little toy here will bring you back the fox swung the weapon and hurled it flailing viciously it wrapped itself around an oak upright at the end of some pews the three metal balls slammed hard into the timber snapping it off like a dead twig as fleaback retrieved the weapon slagar shrugged carelessly at the captives if you had any back legs left at all after my little toy hit you id have to dump you in the nearest ditch because a slave that is crippled for life isnt much use to anyone mattimeo swallowed hard the cruel one clearly meant every word he said slagar turned to his aides threeclaws halftail we strike south keep em moving fast i want a day and a nighf s forced march to put as much distance as we can between us and redwau wartclaw tornear bring up the rear if it stops raining then cover our trail use your canes if they start hanging back or turning the waterworks on right quick march the door was pushed aside as the straggling column made its way out into the torrents of rain that shook the leaves of every tree in mossflower woods it was early evening and the rain hammered down relentlessly abbot mordalfus stood with sister agnes on the site of the feast the roasting pit was a mass of soggy black embers mordalfus threw a scrap of parchment into it this was how the fox knew all about us he explained it was little vitch who wrote all the information about us we gave him a home and he was a spy in our midst john churchmouse saw him running with those ruffians when they fled sister agness whiskers shook with indignation the little hooligan to think that we took him in sheltered and fed him and thaf s how he repaid us by spying and noting it all down for the fox young mattimeo should have given him a bit more of what he gave him in the orchard father abbot thats what i say i agree with you sister the old mouse sighed sometimes violence can be fair when it is used as a chastisement against badness is that brother sedge waving to us from the abbey come sister there may be some news for us as they walked over to great hall the matthias and methuselah bells rang out they were out of sequence and not tolled with their usual vigour agnes pointed to the bell tower that will be cornflower teaching baby rollo to make our bells speak how good of her shes keeping little rollos mind off his mother he still doesnt know shes dead sister agnes wiped a tear away with her habit sleeve in great hall matthias was drying himself off in company with basil stag hare warbeak and several of her sparrow scouts the abbot shook a stern paw at them where did you go off to without as much as a word to me matthias tossed the towel aside wearily weve been up the north road warbeak and her sparrows flew ahead of us but the rain was too heavy so there are no tracks basil blew droplets of rain from his whiskers tchah bally old rain theyve either travelled up that road a lot faster than we thought they could or else cut off east into the woodlands or west out onto the plains couldnt make out a confounded thing with the old skyjuice pouring down like that warbeak fluttered her wings irritably they worms no can travel fastern us with cart to pull we catchem you see abbot mordalfus gathered up the wet towels so they could have travelled anywhere in three directions from the road one thing is certain no creature can track them in this rain so what can we do thunder rumbled outside a vivid lightning flash streaked across the windows of great hall basil twitched his ears miserably no signs of this little lot lettin up old sport he said to matthias were really at sixes and sevens laddie cant sit around and twiddle our paws and cant get out and trackem matthias wiped his sword dry gritting his teeth angrily track them or not we cant let them get away with our young ones the abbot folded both paws into his wide habit sleeves well bury our dead and think hard while were doing it ambrose spike and cornflower kept baby rollo at their side as they tolled the bells that evening the sky was leaden purplegrey and rain poured ceaselessly as the procession of redwallers marched solemnly to the burying place dressed in his ceremonial robe the abbot stood over the twin graves at the foot of which two weeping willow saplings had been transplanted tearfully the woodlanders passed in single file each leaving a small memento to their fallen friends a young mousemother and a fat little friar some brought flowers others carried offerings of fruit and nuts or a treasured object they thought might please a pawworked purse a carved wooden ladle a dockleaf made from green felt matthias stood alongside mordaifus dressed in his full armour bearing the sword together the warrior and the patriarch intoned the prayer for those who would rest forever in the abbey grounds suns that set as seasons turn flowers grow and wither yet who can say what flame may burn friends that we have known and met look into the young ones eyes see the winter turn to spring across the quiet eternal lake ripples spreading in a ring the rain continued unabated as they filed back to the abbey leaving foremole and his crew to replace the earth gently over their fallen companions supper was served in cavern hole many had no appetite for food matthias least of all yet he forced himself to eat his fill so did cornflower as she fought back tears for her son and tried gallantly to cope with baby rollo eat up come on all of you the warrior mouse urged his companions in a tight voice theres nothing to be done except eat and store energy night has fallen and soon we must rest but first thing tomorrow i will choose a rescue party rain or no rain we strike norm again i will make that masked fox wish that he had never arrived at our gates and we will bring our young ones back home to redwall where they belong rain slashed down through the bushes and trees drenching slaves and slavers alike tess churchmouse stumbled against mattimeo and fell heavily into the chumedup mud causing the line of chained prisoners to come to a bumping clanking halt halftail scurried up swinging his cane gernip up on your paws you tittle backslider mattimeo threw himself forward catching the stinging blow that was aimed at tess auma lent a paw to help the churchmouse up you come quick back into line and keep going if s the only way to stay out of trouble the badger advised her between them mattimeo and auma hauled tess upright and shunted her forward thanks for your help friend mattimeo said the young badger shook rain from her striped muzzle listen ill give you a tip to pass on to the others dont let the running line drag hold it in your paws like this not too tight and give yourself enough slack to move easily that way you wont be tripping up so often mattimeo gratefully passed the information to his friends it worked well however mattimeo was growing impatient with cynthia bankvole she was constantly weeping stumbling and dragging at the fetters why am i being kept prisoner and made to march through the rain and the wet like this she wailed piteously ive never harmed any creature look my habits all muddy and soggy oh why dont they let us sleep im so tired mattimeo could stand it no longer oh stop snivelling and whining cynthia he snarled angrily youve dene nothing but moan and cry since you woke today tess churchmouse interrupted his illtempered tirade mattimeo dont speak to cynthia that way im sure your hither wouldnt talk to another creature like mat mattimeo tugged the chain rebelliously well how am i supposed to talk to her shes nothing but a whining nuisance and another thing why have i got to be like my father all the time because you are the son of the red wall warrior weak ones may look to you for defense and protection tess replied in a level tone cynthia isnt as strong as you and she doesnt realize the danger were in no one has ever treated her in this cruel way before and to add insult to injury you start snapping and shouting at her i know shes only a silly little vole but that doesnt entitle you to be nasty to her mattimeo was dumbfounded tess was right of course but she had no reason to start shaming him within hearing of the others he was about to start a justifying argument when vitch strolled up swinging his cane with a malicious grin on his face come on you dozy redwall lot keep marching be strong like mattimeo after all hes the one you can thank for all this slagar wouldnt have chanced within a mile of your precious abbey if he hadnt wanted to steal the famous warriors son ha just think youd all be sleeping safe and dry tonight in your dormitories if it werent for matt the brat tim churchmouse ducked under a whippy aspen branch he caught hold of it swung it forward and let it go suddenly it swiped vitch across the chest sending him sprawling in the wet grass the undersized rat sprang up think youre clever dont you he said his voice dripping hatred let me tell you something to cheer you up me and slagar took care of the stupid fat friar mrs bankvole too and that dozy tether of yours haha we did them good and proper killedem you wontbeseeingthemanymore ignoring his chains tim sprang forward dragging die others with him he was on top of vitch biting through his ear before any creature could stop him you filthy lying little ratscum ill kill you tim shouted slagar halftail and some others came bounding through the rainy curtain and flung themselves into the fray laying about viciously with their canes trying hard to pull the furious tim oft vitch mattimeo sam tess and auma hurled themselves into the melee kicking and scratching madly even cynthia vole managed to get a few nips in it did not last long finally overcome by slavers the captives were beaten back into line slagar blew mud and stormwater through the mouth aperture of his silk mask as he prodded the cane hard against mattimeos chest you started this youre the troublemaker well ill teach you a lesson you wont forget before youre much older vitch lay in the mud holding his ear to staunch the flow of blood he pointed at tim it was that one he tried to bite me ear off i was only walking along mindin my own busi the masked fox struck the raf s outstretched paw with his cane ive told you once before ratface now stop slobbering down there and get up on your paws or youll find yourself chained in line with these others for long weary hours the slave line staggered and stumbled through the rainbattered forest mattimeo and his friends took turns napping as they marched each keeping the other moving straight as they snatched a small respite brambles tore and tugged at their saturated habits which dung tightly about them making an extra burden to carry chain manades rubbed and wore cutting through fur to sore and chafed limbs paws that had been accustomed to soft abbey sward soon became raw and pierced by thorns stung by nettles caked with mud and drenched in rain they staggered onward no one was allowed to walk the slavers drove them hard and fast dogtrotting through woodlands and speeding up when passing through open clearings slagar was anxious to get as far from redwall as possible while the rain kept covering their trail dawn broke over the column sullen greyblack skies rumbled thunder occasionally flashing forked lightning and keeping up the remorseless deluge of rain slagar shielded his eyes as he looked upward truth to tell he was as weary as his slaves or slavers having to lead run up and down the length of the line all night and keep a constant vigil against trouble breaking out he signalled to wedgeback well rest for a while string em out between that beech and the big oak yonder keep them under that low fringe of shrub growing between the trees better feed em first the captives were thrown an assortment of edible roots and plants water was everywhere so there was no need to dish it out after the lines were wound around the two broad treetrunks the captives were allowed to slump down half sheltered from the driving rain they lay exhausted beneath the low bushes mattimeo was jerked roughly out of his slumber as the chains were loosened come on mouse on yer paws the chief wants a word with you the young mouse allowed himself to be dragged half awake and pawsore by wedgeback and threedaws slagar sat awaiting him in a makeshift den at the base of a big spruce come in mattimeo you two get about your business i have something to tell our little friend which concerns only him and me wedgeback and threedaws departed slagar leaned back the silken hood quivering and twitching as he watched his captive through the twin eyeslits come and sit here mattimeo he said his voice sounding almost friendly try to keep your eyes and ears open i dont want you dropping off to sleep just yet im going to tell you a little true story so pay attention the dusty path outside redwall abbey had been churned into mud by constant rain gloomy puddles and stretches of water lay in the depressions of the road matthias pulled his hood up over his ears and signalled to the party waiting at the threshold of the main gate in the watery dawn light we march north overhead the sparra patrols took off into the driving rain matthias jess squirrel and mrs churchmouse headed the march mr churchmouse was still too unsteady on his paws to be in the vanguard with the others who had lost young ones to the fox basil stag hare joined them still nibbling breakfast from a haversack tied about his narrow chest reminds me of the great rains ten seasons ago or was it eleven filthy stuff rain isnt much fun to drink either sooner have october ale any day matthias could not resist a smile despite the seriousness of the mission stop chunnering you great old feedbag and get tracking for signs what er righto sir no sooner a word than a sniff quicks the word sharps the action eyes front and all that progress was painfully slow the ditch to the west and the ftatland one side of the path had to be searched the path itself and the woodland fringe on the opposite side were carefully scrutinized whether it was the continuous rain or the oppressive sky matthias could not tell but an air of hopelessness seemed to pervade the search at midmoming they left the path to shelter beneath some trees on the woodland side squatting to share bread and cheese passing a canteen of blackberry cordial from one to another the atmosphere was decidedly suppressed as they crouched gazing out at the western plain the horizon lost in a veil of rainwater listening to the ceaseless pitter patter of raindrops on woodland leaves each creature had his or her own reelings of sorrow grief loss regret or just puzzlement as to why this sudden misfortune had been visited upon their peaceful red wall home as always basil was first to shake tilings up the gangling hare bobbed back upon the rainy road once more wallopin weasels he cafled whats all mis layin about under the trees like a load of saturated stoats nllin your faces like a pile of moonstruck moles squattin there with your great jaws flappin like frogs at a flychasin come on lef s be havin you form up here chins in chests out shoulders straight paws at the correct angle to the fur of the hindlegs last one in lines on a fizzer jump to attention like this basil leapt high into the air landing squarely on splayed hindpaws no sooner had he hit the path with a squelch man he shot into the air again with his face squinched tight in pain yowchaballyhoop quickly matthias was at his side basil what is it are you hurt the hare held up a hindpaw hurt im bally well near speared to death old lad take a gander at me flippin paw will you ive been skewered by a tree trunk matthias inspected basils hindpaw hmm its a large splinter quite deep too ha splinter the retired regimental hare puffed his cheeks out indignantly splinter ysay my life if thats not an enemy spear or at least a rusty dagger stuck in there m names not stag hare sir matthias tried to keep a straight face righto basil hop over onto the grass under the trees here jess lend a paw will you youre good at getting splinters er tree trunks out the rest of you carry on north up the path well catch up with you as soon as weve dealt with our wounded warrior here mrs churchmouse hefted a copper ladle she had brought along to deal with the slavers right form up and follow me search both sides of the road and the path as well see you three later basil shook his head in admiration thats the good old style you give em mud and vinegar marm just like my old mum used to give me yowch whatcha doin jess tryin to hack me old paw off keep quiet you big baby the squirrel snorted matthias hold him still while i dig this splinter out hold steady now i think ive got the end of it ahoo ahah easy there old treewalloper oohooh treewalloper ill give you treewalloper you flopeared foodbin be still here it comes aha gotcha jess drew forth a long sharp wood splinter now suck your pad and spit out awhile then ill tie a few dockleaves round it what dyou make of this matthias matthias peered closely at the splinter blue paint its got blue paint on it ill bet a bushel of acorns to a cask of ale if s from that cart see the trouble and pain i go to findin clues for you buffers basil sniffed nobly i say chaps is that a piece of torn cloth on that bush behind you jess bounded over and retrieved the scrap of material indeed it is red and yellow just like that covering the fox ducked under as we came out of the abbey gate they investigated searching deeper into the woodland heres a broken branch rain never did that some barks been scuffed from this willow here look axle grease on the long grass matthias straightened up thats it they did pass this way cutting off the road and striking east through the forest if we hurry we may catch them up before night they cant travel fast in woodland pulling a cart but what about the others cant spare the time to fetch em im fraid besides theyd wander all over the show and hold us up youre right basil we can deal with the fox and his band if we take them by surprise lets leave a message at the roadside for mrs church mouse and the others in case they come back looking for us here ill write on this haversack with some charcoal and well stand it on a stick by the side of the path capital wheeze laddie buck right forward the buffs and dont worry about b stag hare esquire it takes more than a splinter to keep a good scout down yknow a short while later the trio had struck off east into the wet woodlands of mossflower mattimeo sat in frightened silence as slagar undid the drawstring of his silkpatterned harlequin headcover watch little one before i begin my story you must see this with a flick of his paw the fox whipped off the hood the young mouse swallowed hard it was the most horrifying sight he had ever witnessed sugars head was that of a normal fox on the left side his right side was hideous only the eye was alive and unwinking in the dead half of the sly ones face the rest was scabrous furless flesh with the side of the mouth twisted upward into a fiendish grin greenish gums and yellowed teeth hung out of the frozen jaw and the skin beneath showed a mottled black and purple hanging in folds loose and lifeless mattimeo was revolted but he could not tear his eyes away from the awful sight slagar laughed a short breathless cackle which trickled damply from the dreadful mouth look at me arent i the pretty one mattimeos stomach heaved queasily hhhow did that happen he gasped slagar hid the injured side of his face by holding the silken hood to it a long long time ago or thaf s what it seems like anyhow it was before you were born iwasa wandering healer fox me and my mother sela the vixen knew many secrets of healing arts and the herbs nostrums potions and remedies of the forest eight seasons ago your redwall creatures fought a great war with the rats from the north it was woodlanders who betrayed my mother to the rats they speared her and she was left to die in a ditch i was wounded and captured by those at redwall they held me prisoner in a room called the infirmary oh they said it was only until i got well but i knew better a prisoner is a prisoner no matter what they call the place where they keep him from his freedom and deny him liberty so one afternoon while your fathers precious creatures were about their business i escaped haha no creature can keep me locked up for long he continued as payment for my troubles i took some baubles from redwall with me silly little things bits and pieces as i ran from the abbey i was stopped by some silly old mouse some buffer called methuselah so i killed him it was no great fight his head cracked the wall and that was that i was forced to flee for my life with that great badger and a horde of woodlanders behind me deep into mossflower i ran i knew it well in those days there was a hiding place a small cave beneath the stump of a tree and i hid there if i had not been forced into hiding i would have escaped unharmed anyhow there i was hiding while half of the stupid redwall creatures crashed around mossflower trying to find me i did not know that there was another creature in the darkness of that little cave with me but there was it was a serpent a huge adder i must have touched it in the darkness because it struck and sank its fangs in me right here slagar pointed to his disfigured face just under the jaw any other creature would have been instantly slain he boasted not me though i must have lost consciousness because when i awoke it had dragged me through the forest to its lair i was in burning agony deep paralyzing pain somewhere near me i could hear the snake sleeping silently i dragged myself away from that terrible snakes lair and out of that place of death i hid out in mossflower for two seasons all the autumn and winter i lay in a den treating myself with every herb root cure poultice medicine and nostrum i knew sometimes the pain was so great that i thought i must surely die but i kept myself alive with secret remedies known only to healer foxes magic passed on to me by my mother combined with the thought that one day i would grow wefl and strong enough to take my revenge upon redwall kept me alive better than herbs i stayed alive to wreak vengeance upon those who had caused this injury to me to make them weep bitter tears for my pain with a quick movement slagar donned his hood and fastened the drawstring you lie mattimeo protested the creatures of redwall would never hold or imprison an innocent creature who had harmed nobody our infirmary is for the sick not for captives you have not mentioned my father what harm has he ever done to you the sly one leapt up kicking mattimeo hard silence who are you to dare talk to me i am slagar the cruel my revenge is against all redwall and your father is the very symbol of all it stands for he even robbed me of my revenge against the serpent by killing it with his magic sword he will learn the meaning of pain not a bodily pain as i have suffered no this will be a far more worrying agony the loss of his one and only son halftail take this slave back and chain him with the others as mattimeo was led away slagar called after him tell your friend the squirrel that you have talked with the son of sela the young mouses friends had not slept they lay half in and half out of the pelting rain miserably wondering where mattimeo had been taken suddenly auma nudged tim pointing to the two figures that materialized out of the downpour they breathed a sigh of relief seeing it was mattimeo with one of the guards haiftail pushed them aside roughly as he linked the young mouse back onto the running chain move over you lot make space here your little pals back they wriggled back as far under the bushes as they could it was a bit drier there tim tess auma and sam listened intently as mattimeo related slagars story when he had finished sam gave them the real version of what had happened that night long ago i remember what took place m and tess wouldnt they were only tiny infants and you werent even born then but i was a season and a half old though i couldnt talk much i could see and hear well enough if that fox is the son of sela then his name is chickenhound or at least it was then he and his mother were traitors posing as healers they acted as spies for the rats but they tried selling information to both sides like all traitors they were discovered the rats speared him and his mother and left them in a ditch sela died but chickenhound was only wounded he dragged himself to redwall so we took him in and cared for him he repaid our hospitality by stealing a sackful of the brothers and sisters possessions and murdering old methuselah our recorder chickenhound ran away and was never heard of again until now mattimeo lay back in the damp grass what a pity that the snake didnt finish him off hes still a sly fox but completely insane the snake poison and his desire for revenge have twisted his mind until he actually believes his own story and really thinks he is in the right threeclaws poked his ugly head under the bushes at them hoi get to sleep in there and no talking or ill lay a cane across your backs tiny streams leapt and gurgled rivers overran their banks the rain poured relentlessly down on mossflower woods rattling off the leaves slopping in the undergrowth spattering summer flowers until they bent their heads under the weight of water beneath the shrubbery between the oak and the beech trees the young prisoners chained on the slave line slept fitfully knowing that in a short time they would be brutally roused and forced to march again midafternoon found matthias basil and jess still striking east into mossflower they were constantly finding evidence that the cart had travelled in this direction such as crushed leaves broken branches and bruised bark but mathias noticed that basil did not look too pleased with the situation whaf s the matter basil were on the right trail arent we the lanky hare pawed rainwater out of his left ear shaking his head oh were on some sort of trail old mousemate but theres quite a few things im not happy about doncha know one is this infernal rain i was built for dry sunny flatlands not great soppin forests then theres this cart theres supposed to be a band of slavers with at least three captives though id say a bunch more if theyd been out robbin young uns doesnt it strike you as peculiar that there are very few pawtracks about weve only seen the odd one or maybe two at the most now they cant all travel in the cart cos theres nothin to pull it except themselves got me and if they were pullin it an walkin alongside it thered be a lot more tracks of pawprints mud churned up and so on matthias agreed with basils shrewd observations youre right of course that suggests two things either were walking into a trap or if s just a ruse to lure us away from the real trail that the fox and his band have taken just then jess squirrel tumbled down from a sycamore she was holding a paw to her mouth for silence ssshh i was climbing a few trees to get my bearings and guess what ive spotted the cart up ahead where matthias asked about half a short march away on the bank of a stream there doesnt seem to be any beast with it though no sign of our young uns matthias drew his sword lets go carefully they may be somewhere about so keep low jess you lead the way silently as rain mist the three slid through the trees and bushes their senses alert ready to spring into action at the turn of a leaf matthias grasped the great sword of redwall tight in both paws holding it upright he peered across its doubleedged blade hoping fervently for a single glimpse of slagar the masked fox crouching low they skirted a small grove of evergreens the falling rain covering any slight pawnoise that was made jess quietly blew raindrops from her whiskers as she beckoned them to stop see over there to the left of the rowan tree sure enough there stood the cart its gaily painted wheels and sideboards spattered with mud and scratched by branches over the top they could see the coloured canvas lying heaped upon the cart bed waitin orders sah what do we do now old scout basil murmured matthias weighed up the situation well weve got it covered from this side and the streams at its back lefs just lie here a moment and keep our eyes open for any signs of life signs of life say no more old warrior chops that bally canvas on the old cart is movin there was a muted growling noise from the cart bed as the canvas twitched and bulged matthias issued orders jess you take the right basil the left ill go in front and center careful now if it is anything dangerous then be sure to give me room for a good swordstroke come on the warrior mouse gave basil and jess a moment to slip off and take up their positions then he stood upright and walked silently to the cart sword held at the ready basil and jess arrived at opposite ends of the cart at the same time as matthias arrived in front of it taking up a stance with the deadly blade held ready for a thrust and slash the warrior mouse nodded to his companions simultaneously basil and jess grabbed opposite ends of the canvas and swept it off with one sudden heave matthias bounded onto the cart with a mighty leap swinging the sword and roaring redwaaaalllv at the last moment matthias swung the sword away it struck the iron seatbar sending sparks showering as a fat little otter lay in the cart with his bottom in the air and his head covered by both paws strike me rudder i didnt steal your rotten old cart i only wanted to play on it shiver me masts i aint messed it up or broke nothin on me affydavet i avent he shouted in a continuous babble having said his piece the otter bounded over the side of the cart towards the river but jess leapt with him and caught him by the scruff of his neck the sword had sprung from matthiass smarting paws upon impact with the metal and stood quivering in the earth a hairvbreadth away from basils injured paw matthias jammed his paws into his mourn sucking furiously he did a small dance as vibrating pain lanced through them jess shook the fat little otter soundly be still you little wretch or ill run you up a tall oak and drop you off the top basti sniffed disdainfully stepped around the sword and confronted the captive a little water pirate eh right laddie name rank and number quick as ylike now and no fibs whaf re you doin in that cart wheres your slaver band got to whaf ve you done with our young uns speak up you blinkin rapscallion the small otter reached behind him and tickled jess suddenly she let go of him with a whoop he looked at matthias and nodded towards basil stow me oars es a funny rabbit thatn talks nice though matthias and jess burst out laughing at the creatures impudence basil stalked off towards the stream muttering to himself in a huff funny rabbit indeed no manners at all these waterwallopers shouldnt be surprised if his mothers tattooed and chews shrimp a lot matthias sat down in a dry spot under the cart and beckoned to the otter cmere young un come and talk to me ive got a son about your age come on youve no need to be frightened the little fat otter laughed he flung himself under the cart and kicked at the axles and wheel spokes heehee this is bettern playin on top of the cart he giggled my names cheek

rattled a twig around the wheelspokes im fine jeff how are you jess was about to grab the young otter and teach him some manners when matthias gave her a wink and signalled his haversack mmmm im about ready for a late lunch what dyou say to a vegetable pastie and a drop of cider jess jess opened her pack i think ill have a bilberry muffin and some cheese basil undid his haversack er lessee i fancy a few slices of nutbread and some candied chestnuts yes that should be just the ticket they pulled out the food and began eating with much munching slurping and satisfied sighs cheek reached for a candied chestnut but basil slapped his paw im ungry the little otter said giving them what he thought was a pitiful look basil licked crumbs from his whiskers so youre ungry eh thats funny i thought you were cheek cheek attempted a halfgiggle hhee no i mean i want food matthias nibbled the end of his pastie ah good were acting sensible at last right information first food later cheek eyed the food longingly well them two weasels i was tellin you of they said to each other lef s dump the cart here and get back to the others that was fengal of course then deadnose he says tttght mate im sick

stag hare and that squirrels called jess aye and dont you forget it young rip come on tuck in cheek went at the food like a savage wolfpack what he couldnt swallow he packed into his cheeks like a

the warrior mouse agreed cheek sprang from underneath the cart and spread his paws wide if s stopped rainin ows that for good information basil clapped his paws together absolutely tophole cheek old lad top marks for ingenuity matthias i think we need a brainy feller uke this if were to get anywhere what dyou say the warrior mouse picked up his sword aye top marks for sheer cheek well come on then sir seeing as youve no mum or dad but behave yourself the sky had ceased its weeping over mossflower grey clouds started rolling back to reveal a powderblue vault above and warmth began seeping through to dry the woodlands as the sun continued its journey into summer white feathery steam rose in banks off trees grass flowers and shrubs as the four companions stepped out on the track the two weasels had taken toward evening mrs churchmouse led the members of the original search party back through the main gates of red wall abbey she made her report to constance and the abbot showing them the empty food bag they had found on the road we travelled north until midday then we turned back for matthias basil and jess wondering what had become of them when we reached the spot we had rested at in the morning we found this abbot mordalfus turned the bag over and read the wording that had been written in charcoal east thro woods signs of cart b s hare constance inspected the bag good theyve found tracks if ever there were three who could follow a trail fight an enemy and bring the young ones back if s matthias basil and jess mrs churchmouses lip quivered oh i do wish i could have gone with them just to see my tim and tess again constance patted her paw there there dont upset yourself we all would have liked to have gone with them though you had more right than most those three wont rest until the young ones are safe youll see why one day pretty soon now i wouldnt be at all surprised to hear banging on the gate and find matthias basil and jess standing there with the young ones looking hungry as hawks and ready for supper why dont you go and see how baby rollo is hes been asking after you and cornflower will have a nice bowl of mint tea waiting for you look in on mr churchmouse too youll find hes a lot better mrs churchmouse sniffled a bit then smiled thank you constance you are so kind and thoughtful my my just look at all the mud and wet on these clothes id better go and put some niceclean dry ones on when mrs churchmouse had departed constance turned to the abbot gone east eh she mused seems funny taking the north road and then turning east why didnt they just leave through the east gate and go direct through mossflower it would have got them to where they were going a lot quicker if they really were travelling east the abbot sat forward in his chair exactly if they really were travelling east i dont like it constance foxes were ever the sly ones who can tell what goes on in the mind of a thief and a trickster i am not at all happy about this whole affair though ive no doubt that matthias basil and jess will sort it out and win through eventually but suppose they are following a false trail what could we do about it the big badger shrugged we are in redwall they are out there somewhere goodness knows where mossflower is a big country the abbot touched a paw to the side of his head they are the doers we are the thinkers do not forget this abbey was built by doers but it took thinkers to conceive the plans i agree father abbot but how do we go about helping them by thinking the abbot rose from his chair and picked up a lantern sleep my old friend dreams are a good starting place dream and think of redwall of matthias and our friends of the young ones taken captive and of the evil ones who hold them in bondage come and see me in the morning we will breakfast together and tell each other what we dreamed and thought constance smiled the old abbot made it all sound so simple but the best answers were the simplest when all was said and done the evening sun sank slowly in the west as the bells tolled out over redwall heralding the calm after the storm with the passing of the rains hot sunlight lanced through the upper foliage and white steam tendrils curled and wraithed climbing between the golden sunshafts to escape on the warm thermals mattimeo grunted with exertion as he pulled his paws from a morass of earth and leaves which the dragging limbs of the column were laboriously pounding into thick mud chained paws warm soggy habits and the driving canes of the slavers gave little relief to the caravan of young animals the running chain snagged between branches got caught around bushes and tripped them when they least expected it sam caught a quick drink of water trickling from the broad steins of wild rhubarb and he managed to grab a pawful of cloudberries as he passed signalling to the others where they grew so they could follow his example auma munched the pitiful repast as she conversed with tim in low tones ive lost all sense of direction all i know now is whether if s night or day she remarked tim trudged stolidly on were travelling south where to i dont know ive been watching the signs my parents taught me to look for if ever i got lost in the woodlands moss on trees the position of the sun even the earth down this way is different more stones in the soil you can take my word for it auma south it is mattimeo joined in the conversation i know were tired and worn out but pass the word along keep alert for the chance to escape slagar and his band must be as weary as we are tim shrugged how are we supposed to escape chained together like this cynthia bankvole listened to them talking and began to get very upset please dont escape and leave me here i couldnt bear it mattimeo ground his teeth together dont worry cynthia if we escape well take you with us oh no leave me here cynthia begged slagar would catch me and beat me and break my legs and leave me to die in a ditch id be too afraid to escape mattimeo was about to ask cynthia just what it was she really wanted when he checked himself hush now cynthia tess soothed her dont you fret we wont make you do anything you dont wish to do listen theres probably a whole army from redwall out searching for us who knows they might not be far behind us auma became excited of course mattimeos father is a great warrior ill bet hes gathered all his fighting friends together and is hot on our trail i know my father will be searching though hes a plains badger and im not too sure whether he knows his way about in woodland mattimeo shook his head reprovingly at tess whos being unkind now eh tess dont you realize weve had a couple of days heavy rain not even basil stag hare could follow our trail through that and were well dear of the redwall area now another thing id like to bet that slagar has laid some sort of false track to put them off the scent youre only raising vain hopes by talking of things like that well any hopes better than none tess sniffed a stoat called badrag strode past them waving his cane come on come on less gabbin and more marchin you tot the faster you march the quicker youll get to rest move yourselves now step lively he carried on up the line urging others on when he was out of earshot sam spoke up i think mattimeo is right we should be trying to help ourselves and not waiting for others i know therell be a big search party out from red wall but itd take a miracle to find us in this deep woodland after all that rain the only thing id say is do the sensible thing dont try any silly moves and if any creature sees the chance of an escape let us know so that we can organize it properly cynthia was right when she said what slagar would do to anybody he caught trying to escape vitch darted through the bushes he caught sam a glancing blow which was partly softened by the young squirrels bushy tail you talk too much squirrel talkings not allowed between slaves another word out of you and ill whack you proper sams eyes narrowed and he growled dangerously at vitch the undersized rat swung the willow cane at him with a lightningfast move sam snatched the willow withe and snapped it he flung the broken cane at vitch his teeth showing white and sharp one day im going to get free of these chains rat sam vowed when i do all the canes in the forest wont stop me getting you thaf s if i dont get him first mattimeo interrupted vitchs nerve failed him he dashed off up the line yah you wont get loose where youre going he called back the rat ran straight into slagar the fox cuffed him soundly and threw him to the ground stow the noise addlebrains the rest of you get the prisoners between those two big firs over there and secure the line chain threedaws come with me i saw something interesting a while back wartclaw you and no badrag are in charge feed that lot and keep em quiet be ready to travel the moment i return got that aye aye chief the captives found good dry grass to lie upon it was nearing sunset now and songbirds were shrilling their last plaintive tunes before nightfall cynthia bankvole found some dried moss which they stuffed between the manacles and their limbs it was comforting and soothing tim shared some wild fennel and green acorns he had gathered on the days march auma lay with her chin on her paws staring into the forest ahead of them she was very tired and thinking of nothing in particular when she found herself staring into the eyes of a large frilled newt the creature winked at her with his flat moist eyes little stripedog all chained up sillybeast why dyou lettem do that to yer he asked weve been captured by slagar and his band who are you auma whispered urgently as she called the others with a wave of her paw mattimeo prodded cynthia keep an eye on the guards lets see what this fellow has to say the newt crawled a little closer lying low to keep his bright red underbelly from showing names scurl droptail too clever to lettem chain me up see em pass here before fox an weaselfellers scurl can you help us mattimeo tried hard to keep his voice calm the newt blinked and wobbled his crest why scurl help you sillybeasts not lendin yer my keys scurl got many keys special keys open any lock hes got keys tess murmured to mattimeo so scurl could not hear we must try to borrow them mattimeo licked dry lips then spoke earnestly to the newt scurl you must realize our position were in danger we might never see our homes again you must lend us in your keys i promise we wont keep them we only want to borrow them for a moment the newt dosed his eyes and shot his tongue in and out as if he were in deep thought then one eye opened wotchergot cummon wotchergot ey ifll cost you oh yes cost you scuds keys dont borrow fer nothin no no sam nodded thats fair enough scurl wait there a moment will you they huddled together whispering what do we use to bargain ive got nothing mattimeo said auma produced some pressed blue flowers theyre mountain flowers my father used to find them for me they might not be worth anything but theyre pretty bet hes never seen mountain flowers tim spat something out and dried it on his habit sleeve my lucky green stone though if s not brought me much luck im always sucking it look if s quite flat mattimeo looked from one to another anything else

the long grass far from where the chainedup captives could reach him they could see the red flash of his underside as he danced and pranced about sillybeast sillybeast trusting me made you think i had a key stupid you clever me scurl has pretty gifts for free angrily auma tore up a huge sod of earth and flung it with all her strength qumph it struck scurl knocking him flat the crested newt lay for

night forest whaf s all the shouting about here slagar and threeclaws stood over the captives between them they had a small hedgehog threeclaws stooped to manacle the hedgehog to the running chain i said whats all the noise about slagar repeated tim grunted wearily oh nothing really that great lump of a badger was rolling over in her sleep and pulling me about on the chain slagar kicked at auma well you wont have to worry about sleeping right now were marching again a groan arose from the prisoners threeclaws ignored it and glanced across his shoulder into the woodlands come on lef s get moving we can be well away from this place by morning he said slagar called vitch you and browntooth stop at the rear and cover the tracks i dont want that hedgehogs family knowing which way weve gone sleepily they ploughed onward through the nighttime woodland a crescent moon above winked at them through the softly swaying treetops mattimeo caught a glance of tess she was brushing away a tear tess whaf s the matter the little churchmouse sniffed and dried her eyes oh if s nothing only that seasonday present was the last thing i had to remind me of mum and dad and red wall do you think well ever

was so pleased he shouted o jubilation but you can call me jube id dearly hate to be this slagar fox when my family catches up with him and these rascals for the first time in a long while the friends found themselves chuckling at the young hedgehog he seemed quite unconcerned that he had been made captive looking on it as only a temporary measure until his family caught up with the slavers mattimeo dearly wished he could share jubes optimism cheek the young otter was never still he kept bounding ahead of jess matthias and basil and running back to chide them come on itll be the middle of next season before we get anywhere the way you plod along basil sniffed and shot a frosty glare at cheek out of mway scallawag were following a trail and youre jumping over the pawprints see matthias here and here id stake me reputation theres two of em weasels probly cheek wrinkled his whiskers impudently oh for goodness sake i know that ive found their weapons up ahead jess grabbed cheek by the paw where why didnt you tell us huh cos you never asked me thaf s why youre always too busy tellin me off tdont run come here go there jess released the young otter right show us they ran behind cheek as he bounded and scampered between the trees in the early morning sunlight suddenly he stopped and pointed matthias was hurrying forward when basil pulled him bock as his paws began sinking steady on old chum if s a bally swamp now then young feller mladdo see the danger of dashing ahead the warrior hopped to the firm ground aided by basil wait ill cut a long branch and well fish those weapons back it was the work of a moment for matthias to lop off a long larch branch jess held tight to cheek as the young otter fished the weapons onto solid earth they stood looking at the shattered spear and the curved sword which had been snapped clean through the center of its blade basil gave a low whistle of amazement as he turned the ruined weapons over with his paw blow me down what sort of creature has the strength to do this he wondered matthias tossed the larch branch like a spear it hit the bogland and disappeared like a stone in water well whoever it was there were two weasels who were so terrified that they ran the wrong way yukk cheek shuddered what a horrible way to die swallowed up by a swamp aye basil stag hare nodded grimly though twas all the villains deserved hmm doesnt help us much though if wed got to those two stinkers first we might have found out exactly where they were heading for now the bally old trails completely cold matthias silenced his companions with a wave of his paw ssshhh dont say anything just listen what can you hear basils ears twitched this way then that he faced south with his whiskers aquiver battle fighting some sort of old ruckus goin on over that way i think the warrior mouse unloosed the great battle blade from its back sheath cheek stay behind jess and basil come on lef s take a look throughout the night abbot mordalfus had tossed and turned on his simple bed in the dormitories above great hall sleep had eluded the old mouse with the arrival of dawns first light he rose and crept quietly between the sleeping ranks of woodlanders ambrose spike snored gently pausing to snuffle and mutter in his dreams as the abbot stole past him and carefully lifted the doorlatch the rising sun flooded through the high east windows sending a cascade of golden light to wash the west side of great hall turning the old red stone to a dusty rose pink mordalfus stood facing the wall allowing the warmth to caress his back through halfdosed sleepweary eyes he looked upon the figure of martin the warrior at the center of the huge tapestry bold and fearless swaying slightly on his paws the abbot spoke quietly to redwaus first warrior its not easy for the body to sleep when the mind is working all night the hours pass like seasons tell me my friend who never grows old where are the answers to be found it is a peaceful and glorious morning in the slimmer of the golden plain who would think that evil is abroad on a day like this redwall is safe yet it is in great danger if the future of its young ones is threatened help me to help matthias which way will he go what paths must he travel where is the hooded fox and his band bound for i am the abbot but at heart i am only brother alf the pondkeeper at times like this the burden of our abbey and its creatures is too much for my old back to bear mordalfus groaned slightly as he sat down upon the floor an ancient mouse in his nightshirt the rays of the warm sun caused his eyes to droop lower as he strove to concentrate upon the picture of martin the warrior gradually the likeness began to waver and sway in front of mordalfus was it martin he was gazing at or was it matthias though it looked a lot like young mattimeo strange the tricks that two tired old eyes can play on their owner his head drooped lower now he had no need to look up at the tapestry for martin was right in front of him from far away as though it were through the mists of summers long dead and gone the warriors voice came softly across the roof of time seek the founder in the stones where die little folk go father abbot im surprised at you sleepwalkin in your nightshirt eh what who mordalfus came awake to find constance the badger shaking him better not let sister may catch you dressed like that or shell dose you with herbs against the cold come on old feller up on your paws now the abbot rubbed his eyes with shaky paws as he allowed constance to stand him upright constance oh its you ooh im stiff couldnt sleep a wink all night so wandered down here at dawn to have a word with martin the badger chuckled as she escorted the abbot to breakfast at cavern hole yes i often have a word or two with our warrior myself though he never says anything to me still its a comfort sometimes to think that hes probably listening the abbot halted after cleaning his tiny spectacles on his sleeve he donned them looking over the tops at the badger ah but he spoke to me just before you woke me constance felt a cold prickle along the back of her neckfur indeed and what did he have to say to you seek the founder in the stones where the little folk g was that all every single word i wonder what martin meant by that constance mused so do i friend lefs have breakfast and think about it ambrose spike and brother rufus had prepared the breakfast the abbot and constance took their place at the large table with other redwallers gossip flowed freely as bowls were passed to and fro butter oatcakes fresh fruit cinnamon toast honey and pitchers of fresh cold milk in the bell tower baby rollo and john churchmouse had begun tolling the twin bells cornflower passed toast to mrs churchmouse your john is a far better teacher than you or i listen baby rollos actually pealing in time with him she remarked mrs churchmouse toyed with the toast and honey if take them some time to be as good at it as my timntess though poor mites i do hope that fox isnt making them suffer a tear fell into the bowl of milk alongside the little mousemother cornflower put a brave face on what those two rascals if i know anything theyll have him run ragged the things these two get up to with my matti and sam squirrel seek the founder in the stones where the little folk g silence fell upon the table ambrose spike turned to the abbot funny thing to say what does it mean constance shrugged we dont know martin the warrior spoke to the abbot a short while ago and thaf s all he said seek the founder in the stones where the httie folk go mordalfus stood up im going to get dressed see if any of you can make head or tail of it it may be a message to help us find our young ones winifred the otter shook her head but matthias basil and jess are out looking for them they must be far away by now supposing we did find any clues how would we let them know when we dont even know where they are constance wagged a toast crust thoughtfully good question ive had an idea the rain has cleared now and the weather is good so why dont we send warbeak and the sparra warriors out there are enough of them and if they fly off in different directions following the general path matthias took surely they must find them sooner or later cornflower poured milk for herself sooner i hope mrs churchmouse got up busily from the table a look of resolution had replaced the sadness upon her face well at least we can be doing something instead of sitting around moping and leaving it ail to matthias basil and jess everybody search hunt seek high and low try and find something out about martins words what were they seek the founder in the stones where the little folk go constance repeated a short time later cavern hole lay deserted paws sounded upon stairs doors slammed walls were tapped and all round redwall abbey voices echoed seek the founder in the stones where the little folk go v though the captives were hurried along the going became easier thick forest gave way to grassy clearings and rocks were much in evidence now with here and there a large stony hill rearing out of the woodlands as they marched mattimeo and his friends were able to gather fair quantities of cloudberry and pennycress supplemented with hard pears and crab apples slagar was becoming more cautious forever watching ahead and detailing guards to cover their tracks from the rear vitch caught up with threeclaws whats the fox watchin out for more slaves the weasel curled his lip at the undersized rat what hes lookin out for is his own business and none of yours noseywhiskers you just keep your eyes on those prisoners ha youre only sayin that cos you dont know yourself vitch sneered bet you dont even know where were going slagar had heard vitch he stood still until the unsuspecting rat caught up with him then the sly one stepped on the rats tail stopping him short so you want to know where were going eh vitch the rat gulped and shrugged nervously er no not really the silken mask sucked into a hideous grin then thaf s good vitch good because its no use asking this thick shower of tramps and scavengers they dont know only one creature knows where were going me when we get these slaves to their destination youll either end up very rich or very dead if you keep asking about things that dont concern you slagar strode off leaving vitch dumbfounded but thankful that he had only received a verbal reprimand for his curiosity did you hear that mattimeo whispered to jube have you any idea where were going the young hedgehog nodded south thaf s the way that slave caravans always go my dad an mum said if s evil in the south we never go there shortly before noon they were in sight of two hills slagar called threedaws and halftail well camp in the canyon between those two hills take the slaves up to the south end of it theres flat rocks with a river running through the middle stake them out there awhile feed em and let em sleep ill stay up this end of the gorge with bageye skinpaw and scringe on top of that hill to the left i want to see if were being followed if i signal you then move this lot south quick as you can well catch up with you later two stoats called badrag and browntooth walked alongside mattimeo and the others sam and auma began secretly baiting them the squirrel and the young badger yawned loudly and stretched whoooyaawhhh im almost asleep on my paws auma what about you whuuuyyaaaah never mind us sam what about these poor guards theyve had their lails run off marching and looking after us youre right there badger badrag rubbed his eyes and yawned havin to break camp and march in the middle of the night keepin you lot goin takin orders off slagar sam nodded sympathetically aye not much of a life is it browntooth stubbed his paw on a rock ouch when are we goin to stop and get a decent sleep an something to eat thats what id like to know if s a shame auma clucked understandingly thaf s whatitis look why dont i mind that big clumsy spear you sit down on that rock and rest for a while sam youll mind browntooths old rusty sword for him wont you sam smiled at browntooth of course anything for a friend you slip me your sword and go and get yourself a little rest with badrag the two stoats were nearly taken in until s la gars voice called harshly from the head of the column badrag browntooth stop yammering and get those prisoners moving come on liven yourselves up badrag spat on his paws and rubbed them into his eyes as he quickened the pace think youre clever dont you tryin to get us in trouble with the chief browntooth snarled at sam and auma move along there come on get those paws trottin you slackers matthias was first at the scene of the battle with jess close behind him twelve hedgehogs were attacking a badger nipping and bulling from all sides with claw tooth and spike the badger was a huge male even bigger than constance he carried a large doubleheaded battieaxe but he was only using the long woodenpoled handle to ward off his attackers time and again they would charge hurling themselves at the big badger with savage grunting noises but still he did not use the battleaxe made squealing hedgehogs were tossed high into the bushes by long powerful sweeps of the handle and now and again he would lash out with his paw causing them to ball up and roll away regardless of the size and obvious danger of the badger the hedgehogs continued to fight him aggressively they were strong fighters one of them an old male would call out at intervals you great stripy varmint give us back our jubilation or well spike you dead so we will the badgers patience was wearing thin but his great strength was unabated as he bared his teeth and yelled back what in thunders a jubilation youre all mad get back or ill use this axe properly on my oath as a warrior i will matthias jess basil and cheek stood on the outskirts of the fight completely ignored the warrior mouse turned to basil there seems to be something wrong here woodlanders dont usually fight each other this way maybe they know something about which way the fox has gone im going in to break it up keep out of the way young feller basil told cheek right matthias me old scout lead on matthias jess and basil leapt into the fray placing themselves around the badger the warrior mouse brandished his sword and roared out a redwall a redwall basils voice joined matthiass bloodnvinegar mudnfur up and at em jesss voice joined them both treetops and timber redwaullli immediately the fighting ceased the big badger and the twelve hedgehogs looked in surprise at the newcomers basil stag hare took charge steady in the ranks thah chaps right listen out now all fightin an skirmishin to cease forthwith otherwise this blighter herell chop you into bits with the great sword of redwall now whats all the jolly old tizwoz about eh the badger added his voice to those of the hedgehogs as they all began talking at once he stole our jubilation rubbish ive never even seen a jubilation yew great stripy ot liar liar yourself dont you call her a liar or ill break that there atchet over your skull so i will id like to see you try it spikebottom ooh exyou ear wot e called me dad never mind wot e called yew sticksnstones wont break our bones you just give us back our jublation badger matthias struck the steel axehead with his sword blade the sound rang out like a bell restoring silence again the warrior mouse pointed at the badger with his sword one at a time you first the badger leaned upon his axe haft his powerful chest heaving my name is orlando the axe i come from the western plain my daughter auma was taken by siagar and his slavers and i was searching for her when all these mad hedgehogs attacked me without any reason the old male hedgehog began dancing excitedly harr so thats it siagar an his varmints i mightve knowed it hes the one as stole our little jubilation matthias pointed the sword at the hedgehog who are you and what is jubilation the hedgehog waddled forward he was the most untidy creature with leaves flowers roots and creepers stuck to all his spines til tell yvho i am young feller he said im jabez stump this heres my wife rosyqueen and these are my ten daughters ive got a son too splendid liddle og name of jubilation at least i did have a son till that thievin fox passed this ways matthias bowed i too had a fine young son stolen from me by siagar i am matthias the warrior of redwall abbey allow me to introduce my friends this is jess squirrel champion cumber and tree jumper her son sam was also taken by siagar along with three others from our abbey two churchmice and a little volemaid that young otter is cheek both by name and by nature and last but not least basil stag hare retired regimental scout and foot fighter basil made an elegant leg at yservice sah well well it seems that we all have a reason to catch up with that foul blot slagar i suggest we join forces actually we lost the slavers trail and wed be terribly glad of any help you could give us wot tt e badger hefted his huge axe a sound proposition i need help more than any beast im hopelessly lost in these woods and it was only by chance that i came this far bear in mind though ill te extremely useful when we catch up with these slavers orlando accentuated this last remark by testing his axe blades on the side of his paw jabez stump and his brood drew to one side and had a whispered debate then the hedgehog returned and offered his paw so be it we search together matthias basil jess and orlando linked paws with jabez together rosyqueen pointed the direction south thaf s the way the slavers always travel though no one knows what lies beyond the great southern plateau but afore you travel you must eat with us the stump family lived in a great hollow beech tree that had fallen on its side they were not very strong on table manners immediately the food was set out the ten husky daughters threw themselves upon it and had to be beaten off by their father to make room for the guests matthias and his friends thanked them politely and carried their portions of woodland stew acornbread and cider outside because of the lack of room in the hollow log they sat on a grassy sward eating and watching the incredible scene inside rosyqueen hit out indiscriminately with a heavy wooden ladle as the ten daaughters fought bit licked the stewpot stole bread from each other and genrally created uproar in the limited space bless their earts jabez stump laughed the s all fine big maids wi ealthy appetites you should see my liddle jube though he can outspike the lot othem when es at ome hoho its a lifetimes work keepin this lot fed it is that by now the hedgehogs had finished the food and were starting to eat the soft wooden casing that formed the walls inside the log rosyqueen belabored them furiously until they spilled out onto the sward tumbling and fighting for leftovers so much so that matthias and his friends were hard put to finish their meal in peace jabez stump tossed his soup bowl to one of them to lick as he stood up dusting his paws right then we about ready to start trackin they set off south with rosyqueen and the ten daughters waving a cheerful goodbye you find them liddle uns now dyou ear aye and bring us back some weasels to bully if we aint ere when you returns if be cos weve etten the log an gone asearchin for another goodbye as jabez was making his goodbyes basil stag hare whispered to matthias and orlando some blighters watching us from those bushes to the right orlando moved casually in the direction of the bushes leave this one to me but before the badger could move any further jess squirrel was past him like a reddish streak she flew into the bushes with a mighty leap and engaged the watcher the foliage shook and trembled as the bushes thrashed noisily with the vigor of jesss attack and there were panicked cries from the shrubbery lemmego lemmego ow ouch eek gurgh youre hurting me jess emerged from the bushes dragging scurl the great frilled newt by his comb oho dont you worry sloppyskin ill hurt you ill tear you in pieces and feed you to the stump family if you dont tell me where you got my champion climbers tailring from she threw scurl roughly to the ground completely surrounded the cheating reptile stared wideeyed at orlando jabez basil and matthias using all his agility he tried to make a swift escape but the sword that buried itself in the ground at his nosetip and the immense war axe that thudded to earth a fraction from his tail warned him in no uncertain way that these creatures were warriors not young woodland captives and they meant business scurl swallowed hard i can splain ill tell you everything matthias flicked the swordpoint against the frightened newts pulsating throat thats my sons habit cord youre wearing i think you had better tell us everything now baby rollo was singing again seeker flounder inner stones oho i know where da lickle folks go cornflower was searching along the ramparts of the eastern wall the old redstone was warmed by the sun and shaded by the quiet green heights of mossflower she looked around distractedly baby rollo hush we wont find anything with you singing aloud like that its very distracting rollo gave her a winsome smile he held a paw to his chubby face ssshhhh stracting he echoed cornflower could not help laughing at the infant vole go on with you you rascal why dont you pop down and see mr spike in the cellars and lend him a paw hell probably give you a drink of nice cold strawberry cordial rollo sang lustily as he made his way down the wallsteps seeker flounder inner stones i catch a rat an break his bones give mr spike a good hard strike for good ol strawhawhaw beherreeee corjulllul he tottered momentarily on the bottom step but was caught firmly by winifred the otter who happened to be passing by in the nick of time gotcha you villain oof youre a great lump of a baby bankvole hi cornflower no luck i think were all in the same boat come down off there if s getting too hot to be searching now lets go and have lunch theyve put out a picnic spread on the grass as cornflower and winifred sat with their backs against the abbey wall they were joined by foremole yurr missis oil just seed lil rollyo agoin off downt cellars hurr hurr ambrose be anappen due for a rude awaken oi shouldnt wunner the meal was simple fresh summer salad cold cider and gooseberry crumble with nutmeg cream foremole munched thoughtfully wrinkling his snout and blinking his eyes a lot hurr gotten uz proper flummoxed as yon puzzle nor a one yet a cummen up wi no dues cornflower passed him the cider if s difficult i agree but we must find the solution soon if we are to help matthias if s hard to know where to begin seek the founder in the stones where the little folk go do we begin by seeking out the stones the founder the little folk or all three baby rollo came running towards them with a small canteen of strawberry cordial tied about his fat waist winifred laughed look out heres the terror back again ill bet mr spike gave him what he wanted just to be rid of him while he takes his nap they carried on eating and discussing the riddle baby rollo sat between cornflower and foremole continually butting in and trying to show them something he had in his paws winifred patted the baby voles head yes yes very nice rollo but please dont interrupt cant you see were talking rollo would not be put off he cut a comical figure muttering away as he wriggled his paws this way and that as if trying to hold on to something cornflow lookit see lookit he persisted cornflower fed him on a piece of gooseberry crumble and wiped his face on the corner of her apron drink up your cordial like a good little vole now rollo please dont speak with your mouth full remember your manners oh dear what is he so excited about rollo opened his paws wide gurgling at the insect that ran backwards and forwards across them lookit lil folkses all three stared in amazement the infant was showing them something they had not thought of so far if s an ant of course the little folk thaf s what methuselah and old abbot mortimer always called ants the little folk yurr clever lil rollyo guddbeast young zurr tell us where you found him rollo pointed a paw with the ant still roaming across it mista spikes cellar across the lawn they hurried into great hall down the stairs to cavern hole through the small corridor at the far side and down the sloping ramp into the wine cellars ambrose spike lay snoring gently an empty jug beside him at a nod from foremole they tiptoed past the slumbering hedgehog and followed baby rollo through the dim cellar he led them to a tun barrel of preserved damsons a huge old oaken affair which had stood there longer than any creature cared to remember there was a crack between the staves where the withe had perished causing a slight leak rollo pointed to the floor where a tiny pool of the dark sticky juice was congealing ants busily collected the sweet residue trooping in a continuous column lookit see lil folkses cornflower dapped her paws in delight good vole rollo come on lets follow them and see where they the procession of ants marched busily along hugging the wall deeper into the cellars where they took a right turn following an old passage wait a moment winifred said ill go and get a torch its very dark in here they paused watching the line of ants industriously plodding along with other ants passing mem on their way back to the juice winifred returned and the light from the blazing faggot torch she held aloft helped greatly they continued down the old passage which twisted and turned dry dark and musty the light revealed a heavy wooden door barring the way the ants however marched straight on under the space at the bottom of the door between them the others tugged on the tarnished brass ring handle the door opened slowly its iron hinges creaking rustity this frightened the ants they dispersed breaking the continuous trail be still and quiet now give the little folk time to settle cornflower advised they waited until the ants had forgotten the intrusion upon their line and continued progress they were in a small cavelike room full of forgotten barrels tools and old benches the ants wove a tortuous path around crumbling and broken casks firkins and butts across the room to another passage which was little more than an unpaved tunnel with baby rollo still leading they crouched and followed the going began to get steep this looks like some kind of disused working maybe a mistake in the digging plans of the foundations that was left abandoned cornflower remarked burr could be missus foremole called from the rear oi baint been yurr afore wem agoen uphill by moi reckernen oi spect they arnts knows where they be bound tho sometimes old roots got in their way with often a boulder they had to climb over their heads scraping the earthy roof above both cornflower and winifred began to wish for the sunny warmth of the afternoon above ground rollo was too excited to think of other things he followed the line of ants eagerly foremole who was used to the dark underground places followed stolidly in the rear they finally emerged into what was neither a room passage or cave it was a low dim area supported by stone columns with a wall blocking the way at the far end the torchlight showed the ants were climbing in between the mortared spaces of the lower courses until three layers up they disappeared into a crack between two of the heavy redstone blocks winifred went to the place and held the torch up well thats where theyre going but im afraid wed have to be the same size as an ant to follow hello whats this look rollo and cornflower rubbed dust and dry earth away from the surface of the larger of the sandstone blocks until lettering was revealed aha its the very foundation stone of redwall abbey let s see what it says constance exclaimed she urged winifred to hold the light closer as she read aloud upon this stone rest all our hopes and efforts let redwall abbey stand for ever as a home for the peaceful and a haven for woodlanders in the spring of the late snowdrops this stone was laid in its place by our champion martin the warrior and our founder abbess germaine may our mnters be short the springtimes green our summers long and the autumns fruitful they stood in silence after cornflower had read the beautiful inscription the history and tradition of redwall laying its kindly paw on each of them foremole broke the silence with his mole logic aroight you uns bide yurr awhoil oill goo an fetch ee diggen teams this be a job fer mole skills when he had gone they sat gazing at the stone in the dwindling torchlight it was winifred who voiced their thoughts whafll we find behind the wall i wonder the late afternoon sun shimmered and danced on the broad waters of a deepflowing stream that ran through the rockshelved floor of the canyon between two hills gratefully the chained captives drank their fill before lying down to rest on the sunbaked stone wedgeback the stoat sat nearby he glared at them pointing menacingly with his cane right you lot heads down get a bit of sleep while you can and just let me hear one move or murmur from any of you by the fang ill have your tails for tea as the stoat moved off he slipped on a wet patch of rock jumping up quickly he wagged the cane again remember what i said eyes closed lie still and no chainclanking or youre for it most of the other prisoners stretched out so they could be alone but mattimeo and his friends huddled doe together the young mouse lay with his head against sams tail and as hey rested they whispered quietly among themselves wonder if old ambrose spikes down in his cellar having a snooze among the barrels aye dyou remember that day we sneaked down there and drank the strawberry cordial out of his barrels with hollow reeds do i haha good old spike wish i had a beaker of mat cordial right now hmm or a big apple and cinnamon pie with fresh cream poured over it or maybe just some good fresh bread and cheese auma gave the chain a slight tug oh go to steep you lot youre making me hungry right now i wish i had a bowl of my fathers mountain foothill stew full of leaks and potatoes with gravy and carrots and onions and huh were making you hungry i thought your father was a warrior they arent usually good at cooking no but my father orlando is though he told me never to tell any creature in case they thought he was getting soft but he always cooked wonderful things for me to eat spose it was cos i never had a mother or at least i cant remember her there was silence as the young captives thought of their own parents mattimeo began to wish that he had never caused his father and mother any trouble he looked down at his chains and resolved that if ever he got free and returned to redwall he would be a good son matti are you asleep tesss urgent whisper broke into his thoughts no tess what is it ill tell you but you must keep calm when wedgeback slipped and fell he lost his little dagger you know the one he always carries tucked in the back of his belt ive got it mattimeo tried to remain still but his senses were alert great well done tess do you think we can use it to open the locks of our chains ssshh not so loud im sure of it ive just opened mine if s only a simple twirl lock and the dagger point works perfectly stay still ill get it to you tim and the others had heard tess good old tess this is the chance weve been waiting for well have to leave it for a bit i can see the slavers lying down in the mouth of a cave over there wait for a while until theyre asleep mattimeo felt tess sliding the dagger slowly under his outstretched paw he slipped it up his habit sleeve yawning loudly he turned over and huddled up so he could inspect the weapon it was a small doubleedged blade that ran to a sharp point mattimeo inserted it into the keyhole of his paw manacles and twisted a few times the simple mechanism gave a small dick and opened and he had one paw free it was only the work of a moment to open the other he raised his head carefully and looked over towards the guards but they were not yet fully asleep auma can you and jube keep an eye on those guards and let me know when you think theyre well asleep tim im going to pass you the dagger work quietly try not to rattle the chains mattuneo if s all very well getting our chains unfastened but there are seven of us where will we go tess worried besides i cant see seven escaping from here without some noise mattuneo unfolded his plan listen all of you theres only one way we can go and ifs the best way straight into the river we can slide off the bank one by one there must be an overhang if these rocks are anything to go by we hide underneath an overhang maybe upriver going south slagar will think we have tried to go in the other direction towards home besides we cant be tracked if we stay in the water we must find somewhere to hide under the bank and stay there when all the fuss dies down theyll have to continue to where theyre going when theyre gone then we can come out and make our way back to redwall agreed so it was agreed the escape plan was to be carried out with matthiass sword point at his throat and orlandos axe resting delicately upon his tail scurl told the best story that his agile mind could think up they be woodlanders scurl tried to helpem please be easy with your longblade warrior mouse see slagar and his villains with slaves so i say to me i must helpem helpem but no good weasels drive me off stoats ferrets chase scurl i could not help woodlanders matthias relaxed the sword point a fraction where did you get all these things robe rope seasonday gift tail bracelet blue flowers the creatures that gave them to you three mice a squirrel and a young badger are they all alive scurl nodded vigorously oyes oyes woodlanders all alive i throw food to them when slagar not watching they give me these and say tell others to follow us oriando watched the crested newt he did not like or trust the creature think carefully lizard the big badger said in a low dangerous tone because if i think that you are lying then you have seen your last sunset which way did they go scurl swallowed hard ssouth straight south his voice was little more than a nervous whisper as he pointed the direction oriando and matthias looked to jabez stump the hedgehog nodded he speaks truth he confirmed jess squirrel gathered up the possessions that her son and his friends had parted with and stuffed them into her backpack ill keep hold of these if youve been telling the truth you can have them back when we return this way if you havent then well find you anyway and make you wish youd never been born with basil and cheek in the lead they strode off south through the woodlands leaving behind them scurl the frilled newt who without a moments hesitation started running north hoping that the grimfaced searchers would never again cross his path towards evening the shadows began lengthening above the treetops oriando spotted twin hills tracks heading straight there old lad basil said reading his thoughts betcher the jolly old young uns are somewhere up there right now wot cheek had begun to adopt basils mannerisms he struck a pose and tried hard to waggle his ears oh wot wot definitely old feller lef s jolly well follow the jolly jolly old rascals wot wot a hefty cuff from orlandos blunt paw sent the impudent young otter head over tail mind your manners waterdog dont make fun of your elders and betters silently and with great care they approached the twin hills that reared from the forest floor in the failing tight matthias and orlando with weapons drawn in the lead cheek rubbing his head as he followed up the rear with basil slagars keen eye had picked them out he lay on the summit of the hill watching their progress a cunning idea forming itself in his fertile mind bageye skinpaw and scringe watched the masked fox they too had seen the searchers and were anxiously wondering what their leader would do about the warlike warriors who were getting closer by the moment slagar turned to them his good eye glinting evilly from the mask as it sucked in and out with his excited panting right heres the plan listen carefully now i want no mistakes scringe run down and tell threeclaws and halftail to march the prisoners into that cave at the foot of this hill make sure they leave plenty of tracks then march them straight out again cover the tracks coming out and head them south at full speed bageye skinpaw you come with me well move further along this hilltop until were above the cave theres plenty of boulders and rocks lying about well make a great heap on top of here right above the cave bageye and skinpaw looked quizzically at slagar but they knew better than to ask questions even if they did not understand slagar the cruel gave orders to be obeyed not questioned slagar led them along the crest of the hill giggling wickedly to himself tonight he would have all the fish in one net and his revenge would be complete they would die slowly oh so slowly late evening shades turned the stones of redwall abbey to a dull crimson the last rays of the sun sending slender slivers of ruby and gold from behind a purpleblue cloudbank beneath the ground constance sat holding baby rollo as they watched the foremole and his team working expertly to remove the great foundation stone they had bars wedges and timber props besides chisels and hauling ropes the mole leader gave directions as he scuttled here and there surveying the job youm afinisht chiselen thurr rooter aye thatll do et zurr jarge set they wedgins in gaffern oill sloid these yurr greasy planks under youn rooter set they ropesnooks int stone stay adear missis an moind yon hinfant a large solid implement which the moles called a gurtpaw had been set up it was a strange affair resembling a sideways block and tackle the busy mole workbeasts attached the ropes to a big round treetrunk bobbin and began cranking a long stout beech handle baby rollo gazed wideeyed he whispered to winifred the otter what they doinr hush now littie un and watch see the slacks bein taken up on those ropes the more they work that handle gradually the ropes tightened and began to creak and strain the massive stone block moved a fraction and its base was now resting on three flat wellgreased sycamore planks the moles began shouting in an even chant yurr she coom hurr she doo yurr she coom eave mole crew the founders stone began sliding out of the place where it had been set long ages ago it moved at an angle leaving foremole room to scurry in and jam two upright sections of green pine as props look rollo see the big stone is moving cornflower was almost dancing with excitement ants dashed this way and that stone ground against stone rope hawsers creaked and groaned as the mole crew chanted their rockmoving song with baby rollos gruff little voice singing in time with them more props were brought up as the stone block slid ponderously forward leaving a large square hole in the wall ceasenalt moles the job be dun foremoles announcement set his crew to leaning and panting against the gurtpaw their tongues lolling out as they passed a canteen of cider from one to another the mole leader stood to one side and bowed low thurr it be gennelbeasts take they torcher an ave a gudd viewen insoides smiling happily winifred and cornflower congratulated the motes well done foremote thank you team you did work hard we could never have moved such a stone without you if a mole could have blushed it would have been the foremole he and his crew stood about awkwardly kicking the loose earth with their blunt digging paws hurr bless ee marm it wurr a nuthin glad to be o survice with cornflower in the lead they made their way through the hole the torch was guttering low winifred bade them stand still moving around the walls the otter found dried brushwood torches in rusting metal sconces she touched each one with her own torch as she passed and she soon had the whole place illuminated it was a large square rock chamber with an earthen floor in one corner there was a massive anthill reaching halfway up the wall they skirted it taking care not to disturb the little folk cornflowers breath caught in her throat at the sight that confronted them it was a beautiful redstone statue of a wise old mouse sitting on a simple chair of wrought stone one paw upraised the other holding open a stone book which lay in her lap winifred gazed at the kindly old face it had a wrinkly smile small square spectacles perched on the end of its nose and drooping whiskers which gave it a homely look by the fur she seems to be watchin us i wonder who she was cornflower instinctively knew thaf s old abbess germaine the designer of redwall im sure of it she looks so peaceful and gentle sitting there foremole brushed dusty earth from the base of the statue lookit yurr he called in the flickering torchlights cornflower stooped to read the inscription carved on the base plinth germaine first abbess of redwall i came from home to find a home the seasons were good to me here i will rest with the little folk winifred nodded in admiration thats how it should be she looks a nice old cove sirtin there with her specs an her book foremole mounted the base and ran heavy expert paws over the statue creatur oo carven thisn were a maister mark moi word it be a gurt piece o work hurr yes indeed cornflower agreed looktheres even a little stone ant crawling up the pages of the book but what are we supposed to be looking for winifred shrugged slowed if i know seems weve gone to a lot of trouble just to find a wonderfully carved statue very nice but not much help they began searching the chamber carefully from earthen floor to stone ceiling checking each stone in the walls without success ho hurnrrun cornflower yawned i think wed better leave it for tonight and come here again tomorrow it must be late night now come on baby rollo or well miss supper come down here you little terror the infant bankvole had climbed up on the statue he was sitting on the knee of the abbess alongside the stone book she held in her lap winifred went after him he tried to wriggle away but she caught him and lifted him off the statues lap as she did rollo grabbed at the replica of the tiny stone ant crawling upon the open pages of the book much to winifreds annoyance it came away in his paw naughty rollo ooh you little scallawag youve broken the lovely statue rollo held the stone ant up to show winifred that he had not broken it there was a copper pin beneath it which had been holding it in place upon a small hole drilled in the stone pages not broke win look moind ee missis the team mole gaffer pawed cornflower swiftly to one side and threw himself flat at the foot of the statue when baby rollo had picked up the stone ant on the copper pin something happened to the book which lay sloping downward from the lap of the abbess germaine the pages of the book which looked for all the world like a solid slab cunningly carved to represent a block of pages slipped a thin section slid out from the block and fell towards the floor luckily gaffer had noticed it beginning to move and the fragile tablet of stone landed on his soft furred back as he lay beneath the statue fortunately it was not damaged patting him gratefully on the head cornflower reverently picked up the delicate tablet in both paws well saved gaffer this is what we were looking for who would have thought it a stone page from a stone book covered in writing too o auma lifted her head slightly and nodded to mattimeo if s now theyve all dozed off we must go now the dagger had been passed from paw to paw and one by one the captive companions had freed themselves from the manacles they looked towards mattimeo waiting upon his lead willing himself to move carefully the young mouse gripped the dagger blade between his teeth and summoned up all his courage rising slowly to a crouch he edged forward along the sunwarmed stone of the riverbank keeping a wary eye upon the sleeping slavers bit by agonizing bit he crept along until he reached the water now he had to be extra careful not to make a splash that would waken their captors lowering himself gently into the smoothflowing waters mattimeo caught his breath sharply as his body dipped deep below the warm surface into the cold undercurrent holding the rock ledge to keep from being swept away downstream he nodded towards sam the young squirrel stood boldly upright and moved straight into the water with a quiet confidence he waved a paw at cynthia bankvole who shuddered and huddled down against the rock whining i cant do it well be caught and theyll beat us im scared mattimeo gritted his teeth against the dagger with impatience as he snarled against the blade move cynthia move come on youre holding the rest back auma gave her a gentle shove murmuring quietly hurry now theres a good little vole youll never see home again if you act frightened the mention of home set cynthias trembling paws in motion she stood hurriedly dashed forward tripped on some loose manacles and fell headlong into the water with a splash mattimeo and sam grabbed her stifling her mouth with their paws to stop her screaming out in panic the escapers froze vitchs eyelids flickered and a weasel lying by him grumbled in his sleep as he turned over auma let out a low sigh of relief the peace had not been disturbed the slavers slept on tim and jube went next followed by tess and auma the remaining slaves on the bank lay chained and asleep none of them would have had the courage or nerve to attempt escaping they had been captives far longer than mattimeo and his friends and they had seen slagar deal with captured runners it was not a pretty sight the escapers stood in the stream with the water lapping almost to their chins in the fading light mattimeo glanced up at the darkening sky gratefully the twilight would aid them and it would soon be night holding paws and staying close to the bank the friends pushed their way upstream to the south it was heavy going the surface of the river was deceptively calm belying the cold tugging undercurrent wet habits weighted down by water soon made it even harder for the redwallers and they were grateful when mattimeo pointed to an overhanging rock ledge he pressed forward moving slower because of the depth and behind him he could hear his friends breathing hard through their nostrils as they followed in his wake the rocky overhang was an ideal hiding place they chose a spot where silverweed and purple loosestrife bloomed thick drooping over the soiltopped rock ledge to mingle with arrowhead growing from the shallows it provided a perfect curtain crouching low at the rear of the underhang they nodded silent congratulations to each other back along the bank all hell suddenly broke loose with the return of scringe come on you lazy lot up on your paws slagar says youve got to hey look at these loose chains halftail threedaws raise the alarm theres been an escape escape escape the prisoners have escaped search every nook and cranny they cant have gone far escape escape browntooth ran slapbang into threeclaws the weasel held the tender end of his

the slave lines he grinned wickedly that redwall lot the female badger and the young hedgehog hoho i wouldnt like to be in your fur when slagar gets back oh no not the redwallers halftail groaned slagarll have our guts for garters if that lot have gone missing specially you matey youre supposed to be in charge threeclaws held his throbbing nose indignantly who me not the way i heard it bucko

vitch browntooth into the water and search that river vitch stood his ground defiantly huh who are you to be giving orders im not going into any rotten old river who can tell how deep it is besides if

browntooth or ill tie you in a sack with rocks and toss you in there myself with a fine show of moody bad temper vitch began lowering himself gingerly into the water followed by a resigned browntooth yah i suppose well have to do it if the rest of you are too scared to get your paws wet the undersized rat muttered aloud scringe grabbed a passing weasel scared whos scared me and skinpaw wid search downstream you and browntooth look upstream and well show you just whos scared wont we mate skinpaw looked decidedly unhappy but tried to put a bold face on ha we certainly will you go first scringey underneath the rock ledge upstream tim churchmouse heard every word he turned to mattimeo whatare we going to do theyre searching the river tess plucked a hollow reed and bit the end off it look remember we lay under the abbey pond breathing through reeds like this last summer when constance was looking for us mattimeo pulled a reed and bit the end oh yes wasnt that the time you cut up one of friar hugos best tablecloths to make a tent sam squirrel blew through a reed to test it if i remember rightly that was you matti no time to argue though lets give it a try holding on to each other and the rocks on the riverbed they submerged dosing their nostrils and using their mouths to breathe through the hollow reeds it worked perfectly vitch dung tightly to browntooth in the center of the river as they waded neckhigh against the flowing current it was cold and deep browntooth shook he rat away from him gerroff what are you tryin to do drown me go and search that side of the bank ill take a look at the other side they couldnt hide in the middle of a river look let go will you or well both be swept away huh youre not soft are you baggybelly this side is full of overgrown ledges and your side is nice smooth bank well you can nibble your daws fattie im not going so there browntooth forded his way toward the smooth bank do what you like runt when slagar gets back ill tell him that you wouldnt search the river properly and well see what he has to say about that snitch telltale gabbygob vitch waded over towards the ledge calling back insults mattimeo could dimly make out the raf s paws through the debris vitch was churning up from the riverbed as he waded the young mouse held his breath as the paws came slowly doser another few steps and he would tread on aumas back the badger huddled with the water waving through her coat unaware of the impending danger as her eyes were shut tight mattimeo made a sudden decision it was risky but worth a try he struck out swiftly at the raf s paw with the small dagger yawchooch glubglub help vitch thrashed about in the water losing his balance as he tried to dutch his injured paw swallowing water he floundered about for a moment then galvanized by pure terror he grabbed the overhanging plants and scrambling furiously hauled himself over the rock ledge up on to the bank aargghh browntooth dont go near that ledge mate theres a big pike under there look it bit me owowowow vitch rocked back and forth trying to staunch the flow of blood by stuffing the injured paw into his mouth browntooth waded hastily across avoiding the ledge he found a part of the bank where he could easily get out of the river well they wont be under there or anywhere up this end if theres pike in the water are you sure it was a pike mate maybe it was one of those giant eels with poison teeth i shouldnt suck it if i were you vitch spat out hurriedly and rubbed his mouth hard forgetting the stabbed paw in his panic splurr yurgh whaf do supposing that ive swallowed some browntooth lay flat on the rocky ledge trying to peer over and get a glimpse of the monster oh youll soon know if you turn purple and green and start s wellin up thatll put a stop to your impudence eh beneath the ledge auma could take it no more the air from thestraw was not enough for her and she broke the surface blowing hard and sucking in breath whooaar browntooth leapt backwards regaining his paws he trotted off to join the rat cor did you hear that vitchey youre lucky you werent eaten alive it sounded like one of those giant things they talk about that lives in the bluesea place hoho im not stopping round here mattimeo and the others broke the surface beneath the ledge gulping air gratefully they listened to the cries of the rat and the stoat receding down the bank maybe i wont turn purple and green maybe it was just a sharp rock are you kiddin bucko i never heard a rock sound like that then it must have been a pike they dont have poison teeth do they i wouldnt know ive never been bitten by one hew dyou feel i feel all right cept for my paw ooh it really stings and it wont stop bleedin look cold and numb as they were the comrades beneath the ledge tried to stifle suppressed giggles scringe had the remaining captives chained and ready to march he shrugged in resignation well if they cant be found then they cant so much the worse for us when the boss finds out right lef s march them into that cave over there men out again and continue south wedgeback and badrag you cover the tracks coming out but leave the ones going in hmph sounds a bit silly whaf ve we got to do that for badrag grumbled because thats what slagar ordered numbskull now get moving darkness had fallen when matthias and his search party reached the foothills of the gorge orlando looked about in the still night brandishing his axe i dont like it matthias the badger remarked neither do i friend but weve got to take the chance we cant afford to wait until dawn they may know were following and have pushed on ahead basil stag hare pulled cheek back as he tried to bound forward i agree with you old scout got to take the chance wot faint heart never found fair young uns then wed best stick f gether in case of a trap jabez stump cautioned jess squirrel chattered her teeth angrily trap ill give them trap if i lay paws on the filthy scum matthias silenced them with a wave of his sword keep your voices down sound echoes in a place like this well push forward fast and see if we cant spring our own ambush but jabez is right stay together a halfmoon threw its pale light down into the hilly canyon making eerie shadows as it played with the breeze stirring the stunted trees that grew amid the rocky foothills matthias marched silently in the lead the fur at me back of his neck rising stiffly with the feeling of hidden danger orlando dropped to the rear and walked with a sideways shuffle checking behind them as he gripped his huge war axe low on its haft ready to swing eke a deadly scythe at any back stabbers perched high on the tor of the hill beside a large mound of rocky rubble slagar whispered to bageye where are they now can you see them tiie stoat nodded i can make out the shape of their group theyve entered the canyon now see by those juniper bushes and theyre heading this way the cruel one pulled the eyeslits of the silken hood wide around his eyes ah yes thaf s our little friends all right now keep perfectly still and have those poles ready to paw when i give the order follow my lead skinpaw crouched behind slagar with his paw resting on the long pole that was lodged beneath the rocky pile without looking back slagar hissed get your scurvy paw off that pole you idiot i dont want even a speck of dust to fall and betray our position the weasel withdrew his paw swiftly down in the canyon cheek made a bound forward jess grabbed him by the tail where are you off to little waterdog its a river see the moonlight glinting off it lemme g basil wagged an admonitory ear at the garrulous otter steady in the ranks there young cheek this is no time to go swimmin where dyou think you are at an otters divin gala jabez cast around by the rivers edge they camped here for sure see some of the damp pawmarks are still visible now lef s see where theyd be movin from here the untidy hedgehog rummaged about snuffling and grunting quietly there yonder cave is the perfect place to stay the night matthias peered at the dark cave entrance silhouetted against the lighter hillside scree in the thin moonlight youre right jabez the good thing about it is it looks as if theres only one way in or out well get as close as we can then rush it be careful how you strike in there we dont want to injure any young ones cheek you could come in useful there do you think you could get the captives out of the cave away from the battle the otter withdrew his tail from jesss paw and gave a salute of course i promise you theyll be safe matthias basil nudged orlando very good topnote wot our cheek shaped up like a proper warrior to that i knew in me heart there was somethin good about that young rip i was right give him somethin positive f do an he turns up trumps mentioned in dispatches cheek mladdo orlando turned to matthias his eyes beginning to glint red the masked fox is mine warrior only if you find him first friend agreed what are we waiting for not a thing lef s go the great sword of redwall and the battleaxe of the western plain swung aloft like twin cold fires in the moongleam redwaaaaaalllll eulaliaaaaa mossflowerrrrrr give em bloodnvinegar three things happened at once the searchers war party thundered into the cave swinging and yelling seven fugitive heads popped up out of the water at the sounds of their parents and friends three pairs of enemy paws heaved the poles upwards sending a landslide of earth rock scree and soil hurtling downwards over the mouth of the cave beeswax candles glimmered late in cavern hole cornflower winifred foremole and baby rollo sat at table with the abbot and constance the slim stone tablet lay on a folded towel to prevent any damage over a supper of mushroom soup apple and celeryskce hazelnut bread and hotspice herb beverage cornflower had related the strange tale not forgetting the part baby rollo had played abbot mordalfus shook his head in wonderment marvelous you found the tomb of our founder abbess germaine thanks to baby rollo sometimes the gift of an inquisitive nature to the young can be greater than that of the wisdom which comes of age i trust you put the stone back when you left foremole tugged his snout respectfully hurr deed oi did zurr shem all shut in again naow pity id have loved to see it just once mordalfus sighed constance indicated the tablet with an impatient paw please can we get on with this what does the writing say on the stone winifred threw up her paws in despair it says nothing blow me sails theres only a lot of funny scratches on it the abbot studied the strange marks focusing through the small square spectacles perched on the end of his nose wonderful amazing a perfect example of ancient loamscript constance scratched her headstripes loamscript what in the name of fur and feathers is loamscript tut tut constance mordalfus said without taking his eyes from the stone tablet i see you have forgotten all the history lessons you learned as a young one who was your teacher and what were you told about the beginning of redwall history constance frowned she drummed paws on the tabletop and looked at die ceiling for inspiration it was not too long in coming er er it was sister garnet no it was methuselah ah yes good old brother methuselah haha he used to look at me over die top of his glasses just the way you do abbot i remember he often tweaked my whiskers if i dozed off on a sunny afternoon at lessons in the orchard ah but that was more seasons ago man i care to remember the abbot smiled fondly at constance then let me refresh your memory you dozy badger redwall abbey was founded after the war of the wildcats by martin the warrior who came from the northlands and abbess germaine who travelled with a band of woodland mice from a place called loamhedge apparently they were driven from there by some sort of plague old methuselah had a book written by one of germaines followers in loamscript now as i remember there was only one other creature who was clever enough to learn loamscript from methuselah a tittle churchmouse named john cornflower sprang up what you mean john churchmouse our recorder the abbot folded his spectacles away into his wide sleeve chuckling the very same cornflower do you think you could go and rouse him winifred picked up the snoring form of baby rollo from his chair ill come with you the otter volunteered its time this bundle omischief was tucked away for the night they hurried off to the dormitories john churchmouse came down with cornflower and winifred he nodded almost apologetically to those around the table couldnt sleep see dont sleep much these nights thinking of my tess and tim and wondering if matthias and the others have found them yet mordalfus slid the tablet across to him sit down john heres something that may help to bring your young ones back its written in loamscript can you read it john stroked his whiskers well ifs a long time since i read any loamscript many many seasons ago haha that was when methusaleh used to tell me about this sleepy young badger in his dass what was her name now constance tapped the table with a blunt paw never mind prize scholar get on with it john winked at cornflower righto ill give it a try could i borrow your glasses please father abbot i left mine by the bedside with the abbots spectacles perched upon his nose the churchmouse picked up the stone tablet and moved a candle nearer to help him his lips moved silently and he stroked his whiskers a lot sometimes shaking his head or nodding it knowingly he traced the strangeshaped writing finally he placed the tablet down on the table cupping his chin in his paws he stared dreamily off into space five voices inquired aloud with impatience well oh ah yes sorry funny how it all comes back to you isnt it hkyou know when i first looked at the stone ft didnt mean a thing to me it might well have been written in butterflyese then suddenly it was clear as a stream in spring the abbot leaned forward until his nose was near touching that of the churchmouse john you can be a singularly annoying creature at times would you please read us the translation now immediately john adjusted the glasses coughed and began reading through the seasons here i lie neath this redwall that we made solve the mystery you must try graven deep it will not fade somewhere twixt our earth and sky birds and gentle breezes roam there a key you might espy to that place i once called home take this graven page and seek what my words in stone could mean what cant fly yet has a beak mixed up letters evergreen two bees two ohs one sea one tap and weary without a leave me now to my long rest good fortune on your way around the table they sat in silence awed at the beauty and mystery of the ancient verse until cornflower shifted her chair noisily and destroyed the mood thank you mr churchmouse very pretty im sure but what does it all mean constance rubbed her weary eyes it means weve got a long complicated riddle to solve not tonight though im all for sleeping at this late hour john churchmouse returned the abbof s spectacles ill second that if s all very exciting but i think wed best sleep on it tomorrow morning will bring dear minds with a fresh approach the abbot rose slowly stretching and yawning tomorrow morning then out in the orchard where theres sun and shade goodnight all after they had gone cornflower remained sitting at the table with the stone tablet in front of her carefully she turned it this way and that studying the curious loamscript tracing it carefully with her paw some secret instinct deep inside her said that there was more to the thin stone slab than john had discovered in the writing but what a massive slide of earth soil shale and scree mixed with huge boulders that had torn away a section of the hillside from top to bottom lay squarely across the cave entrance trapping matthias and his friends tight inside the cavern on top of the hill slagar and his cohorts were surprised and shaken by the scale of the landslide they had caused clouds of choking dust arose in the silvery moonlight around them bageye and skinpaw buried their faces against the earth scared to move the masked fox lifted the bottom of the hood and spat gritty dust he was about to howl his triumph at the night sky when mattimeo and the escaped captives heaved themselves from the water and dashed towards the mound of debris with shouts of dismay slagar grabbed bageye and skinpaw by their tails and dragged them swiftly back down the opposite side of the hill ow ouch leggo chief arrgh yer pullin me tail off the cruel one cuffed them soundly about the ears silence idiots where did they come from where did who come from mattimeo and his lot theyre down there now trying to unblock the cave entrance i never saw em chief you wouldnt muckbrain you and your crony were too busy kissing the ground they musf ve escaped well go down there and round mem up eh chief blockhead theres not enough of us to capture em all theyd scatter away like a shot how could three of us catch seven of them idiot listen ill stay here and keep an eye on mem you two get running and catch up with the others tell threedaws and halftail to chain the rest of the prisoners up and stay with em men bring the rest back here do it quietly and well surround our little friends down there so none of them will escape a second time righto but what if they manage to dig their friends out of that cave while were away dont talk rubbish slagar sniggered nothing on earth could move that lot it isnt a cave any more if s a grave now get going and bring the rest back here quickly when you get back lie low stay silent and wait until i gve the signal bageye and skinpaw trotted off into the moonlit forest slagar ripped off his patterned silk headmask and breathed deep his mutilated face twisting into an insane smile as he listened to the young ones on the other side of the hill trying desperately to reach their parents and friends through an impenetrable mass of earth and rock inside the cave the dust had settled matthias felt about in the inky blackness until he found his sword all around him there was spluttering coughing and conrusion the warrior mouse wiped dusty earth from his mouth and called out is everybeast all right all right steady on old sport a feller can hardly be all right when hes buried up to his middle in rocks and whatnot the warrior mouse groped about slowly in the dense gloom stay where you are basil dont move well get you free now are the rest of you safe and unharmed id be all right if this hedgehog didnt keep a bumpin into me cheek the otters grumbling was cut short by orlandos rumbling growl then stay still and stop bobbing about youve run into me twice here whose bushy tail is this mmmmm ooohhh what hit me matthias moved to where the voice came from jess are you all right i think so a great slab of something got me from behind no damage done though it just knocked me flat for a moment or two what happened kaaachoo jabez stump sneezed i dont think this hillside would stand still for ages then suddenly decide to slide one night for no good reason seems to me as if weve been lured into here and trapped matthias and ortando had crawled over to where basil lay buried and were trying to dig him out the old hare bore up bravely helping them where he could i think youre right stump old lad ha heres a pretty thing a bunch of seasoned campaigners caught like shrimp in a barrel wot ill bet a salad to a soupbowl it was old slyboots the masked thingummy what dyou say matthias say keep still basil orlando can you put your back to this rock and push it away from him one of you grab his paws and start pulling while i dig the loose stuff away cheek sprang forward and tugged basils paws with gusto heave ho old sir hare out you come now yaggh beastly young blighter youre standin on me ear orlando put his strong back against the rock that was trapping basil he gave a mighty grunt as he threw his weight against it grrumph thats it hurry now i cant hold this much longer jabez and jess helped cheek as matthias dug furiously they gave a good long heave basil popped out like a cork the big badger let the rock go there was another cloud of dust and a rattling of pebbles as the heap of hillside rubble settled basil stamped his paws experimentally bit stiff an all that still workin hunky dory though well what a load of old ninnies we are eh lettin ourselves get bamboozled like that lef s not start blaming ourselves matthias cut in sharply what we did seemed a good idea at the time the thing now is how do we get out of this fix has any creature got flint or tinder to make light jess squirrel wiped a paw across her brow not a very good idea matthias havent you noticed if s getting quite warm in here that means were using up the air if we start making fire well use it up double quick and suffocate orlando slumped back against the cave wall youre right jess those slavers meant this to be our tomb and theyve done a good job of it worse luck give me a moment or two to rest then ill see if theres any possibility of digging our way out or at least making a small hole so that fresh air can come in if s this dark i cant stand not bein able to see anything all hot an covered in dusty muck with a whole hillside on top of us i cant even see me paw in front of my eyes cheeks voice sounded close to panic basil patted him firmly now men young otter mlad chin up theres nothin to get in a funk over when i was with the border patrol we were in lots of tighter places than this one wot never say die cheek ha ill betcha well be out of here before the nights over dont worry young waterdog youll be wallopin about in the river by tomorrow night cheek sat close to basil and waited while jess and orlando took first shift to dig a way out of the landslide around the friends the air seemed to grow darker and heavier as they lay trapped in the bowels of the hill on the outside mattimeo scrabbled furiously at the loose shale and earth alongside auma the others dodged around the heap trying to find a likely spot to dig auma grunted and strained as she tried to dislodge a huge boulder it was my father orlando the axe she told mattimeo id know his battle cry anywhere oh please let him be all right mattimeo stopped digging for a moment as he watched the loose earth slide swiftly in to take the place of the boulder auma was moving i saw my father and heard him too even in the night i think i recognized jess and basil there were a few others too but it was all over too fast to see who they were bah were getting nowhere like this look every time you dig out a bit the earth slides in and fills the gap again cynthia bankvole sat down and let the loose earth run through her paws its no use what can we do against all this it would take ten teams of moles a full season to move all this earth and some of these boulders look as big as a cottage sam squirrel shouldered her roughly aside doesnt matter my mums in there so weve got to keep trying come on cynthia up on your paws and get digging jube look about for a big branch or something i can use as a lever against these rocks auma called out how are you doing matti mattimeo straightened up not very well i suggest we all dig in the one spot tess came hurrying over look ive found some flat slatey pieces theyll do to dig with dawns first light glimmered in the east a soft rosy glow dispersing the night from the deep greenery of moss flower woods the sun rose steadily drying the dew from leaf and flower as the young woodlanders dug wearily in the shifting mass of debris slagar lay on top of the gorge watching them as he murmured keep digging my little slaves tire yourselves out so that you wont run and dodge i can see my slavers threading their way through the forest yonder theyll soon be here dig away you young fools youll never see your friends or parents again in the summer peace of the beautiful old redwall abbey orchard a group of creatures sat taking alfresco breakfast among the fruit trees abbot mordalfus presided let us put our minds together friends if we wish to help matthias and our young ones we must solve the riddle of this poem the abbot tapped the stone tablet where does the poetry end and the dues begin john churchmouse put down his bowl of mint tea and placed his paw in a very certain manner between two lines of verse right there im sure of it listen through the seasons here lie neath this redwall that we made solve the mystery you must try john tapped his paw down decisively there right there i couldnt sleep for thinking about it heres where the real clues begin graven deep it will not fade somewhere twixt our earth and sky birds and gentle breezes roam theres a key you might espy to that place i once allied home the abbot toyed with a slice of apple i think youre right john in fact part of the answer leapt out at me as you recited those words it was the line that went to that place i once called home right if this was written by old abbess germaine then the place that she called home before she built redwall was loamhedge however that was all so far away and long ago in our history that the location of loamhedge had been forgotten long before my time and that of many abbots and abbesses before me john nodded agreement of course old loamhedge that must be the place where the fox is taking our young ones there or somewhere in the loamhedge area i can recall asking brother methuselah where loamhedge was but even he didnt know how are we supposed to find it cornflower pointed at the stone tablet obviously the answer is in the rhyme because it says take this graven page and seek what my words in stone could mean surely thats a start burr scuse me rnarm oi thinks it be afore that even somewhere twixt our earthnsky burds an gentle breezes roam whurrs that thafs where we might espy the key accordin to that there ambrose spike chuckled best look about for a key floatin round in midair silly i calls it john looked severely over the top of his glasses silly it may sound but its a serious business spike no need to get huffy dear mrs churchmouse interrupted hastily lef s all look up and see what we discover between earth and sky winifred otter summed it up in a word treetops they sat looking at the treetops mrs churchmouse was just beginning to regret her foolish idea when cornflower said the top of our abbey maybe a slow smile spread across the abbots face very clever cornflower what better place for our founder to leave a due than at the top of the very building she designed so im looking up at our abbey tell me somebeast what am t looking for the answers came back something graven deep words in stone something that cant fly but has a beak how about mixedup letters evergreen two bees and two ohs what does an oh look like well i know what two bees would look like john churchmouse banged his beaker upon a wooden platter quiet quiet please all this shouting is getting us nowhere cornflower will you kindly stop baby rollo playing with that stone tablet cornflower sat upon the grass with rollo who was running his paws over the slim stone mrs churchmouse tried to pacify her husband dont shout dear im sure rollo wont harm it cornflower was shaking with silent laughter john was not amused im sorry but i fail to see whats so funny about it cornflower im not laughing at you john im laughing at baby rollo here we are puzzling our brains out and rollo has found the answer again where right here on this stone cornflower explained come and look i didnt notice it until i watched rollo passing his paws over the writing watch him youll see he stops his paw every time he finds a letter in green the abbot hurried over to watch rollo by the fur youre right cornflower good baby rollo mixed up letters evergreen come on little one show me your eyes are better than mine john get that charcoal and parchment take the letters down as i call them out to you obligingly rollo began dabbing at various letters with his chubby little paw mordalfus relayed them to john churchmouse first one letter b second one letter b ambrose spike scratched his snout will somebeast tell me what in the name of acorns is going on here two green bees letters graven in stone i always thought bees were yellow and brown the abbot looked skyward patiently come here ambrose let me show you look at the poem can you see that certain letters have been filled in with green vegetable dye right ive just given john the first two they are letter bs not actual bees see here are more green letters it was still all a bit above ambrose he stared at the letters shook his head and trundled off huh ive got work to attend to in the cellar i cant hang about playin word games you cant drink stone messages but good october ale thafs a different matter you lofd look sick without my casks of berry wine mark my words john churchmouse glared over the top of his glasses at tile retreating cellar keeper now where were we two letter bs whaf s next abbot two letter os john wait i think roho has found more yes theres a letter c well done young un any more baby rollo was enjoying himself he waved his paw dramatically stabbing it down as the abbot called out the letters he indicated take these down john t a p w e r and a letter y there ive translated the old letters pretty well is that the lot rollo the infant waved to them and pursued ambrose to the wine cellar aye thafs it cornflower chuckled what have we got john b b o o c t a p w e r y twelve letters in all though theyre fairly well jumbled i cant make head nor tail of it why couldnt abbess germaine have written what she meant dearly the abbot stood up and stretched because then it would not have been a secret those letters are the key once we get them in the right order well know what the next move is to be in the darkness of the cave orlando choked and coughed as he sought wearily about until his paw touched matthias listen friend orlando said keeping his voice low so that the others would not hear i dont know how much rubble has fallen across this cave mouth but i think we both know if s far too much for us to move were becoming weaker matthias the air is running out in here i keep feeling dizzy and wanting to lie down to sleep matthias clasped the big badgers paw same here orlando but dont let the others know young cheek will only panic and basil will start jumping about trying to dunk up schemes to get us out i know its hard but well just have to sit here and try not to fall asleep do you think theres anybeast outside the only ones i can think of are slagar and his gang wed be in no condition to fight them even supposing we could get out i wish we had a strong mole with us aye and if wishes were fishes thered be no room in the river for water im sorry matthias i was only thinking aloud pay no heed to me orlando its this terrible darkness the heat and the lack of air and this confounded dust in me ears laddie budd basil you were listening to us say no more old lad say no more backs to the wall and all that i say i dont suppose anyones got a bite to eat stowed on em even young cheek managed a faint laugh trust you to think of food at a time like this mate sony basil we left the supplies outside so they wouldnt hamper us in the ambush jess squirrel called from the far side of the cave jabez stump yawned some ambush eh weve got ourselves rightly scuttled you mark my spikes best thing is to sit quiet think hard and breathe light a gloomy silence fell as they acted on the hedgehogs good advice mattimeo dug and scrabbled wildly at the huge ever moving landslide the sun was reaching its zenith and the digging was becoming more heated and futile grunting with exertion he straightened up and passed a paw across his brow as a pile of loose earth rattled around his ears mattimeos quick temper snapped he seized a pawful of pebbles and flung them at tim who was digging higher up the pile by the fur cant you stop loading muck down on top of me every chance you get mattimeo grumbled tim straightened up sony sonys not good enough mattimeo snorted just watch where youre chucking that stuff will you tess passed mattimeo a broad leaf containing water she had scooped from the stream here drink this and cool down well get nowhere yelling at each other mattimeo dashed the leaf from her paw his face livid with anger its all right for you to talk your father isnt buried in there is he where in the name of the claw has that hedgehog got to its going to take him half a season to find a branch so we can lever these rocks out over here little hero weve got your friends over here bageye and skinpaw had jube and cynthia tied by their necks on a rope still flushed with temper mattimeo grabbed a chunk of rock come on auma sam lef s charge them they had reached the lower edge of the rubble when slagars voice rang out mockingly behind them my my arent we the bold ones go ahead try it mattimeo whirled about to face slagar and half a dozen others who had circled round to join him they were all heavily armed the young mouse still driven by rage haded a rock slagar dodged it easily and drew out his fearsome weapon the three leather thongs whirred as he swung them in a circle the metal balls at the ends of the thongs dacking together viciously the masked fox pointed at less churchmouse drop that rock mouse any of you runaways make a move and ill smash little missies skull to a pulp never miss tess dosed her eyes tight and clasped her paws together run mattimeo run for your life back to redwall bring help go on do as she says slagar sniggered with glee after ive killed her ill kill you to slay the warrior of redwall and his son in such a short time would make my revenge complete the rock fell from mattimeos open paw hot tears sprang to his eyes as he hung his head in defeat they were roughly herded together by bageye and skinpaw the rope was looped about the neck of each of the mends as bageye bound their paws in front with thongs slagar nodded towards the south woodland fringe right lef s go oh you can take your time now theres nobody following us anymore hahahaha auma made a strangled noise halfway between a growl and a sob dragging the captives with her she fell back upon the huge mound of rubble and began digging furiously it took all the slavers to drag her off beating with canes and rope ends they bludgeoned the little group off along the south trail through the summer woodlands realization of what had taken place hit sam squirrel like a bolt and tears trickled from his eyes they all cried all except mattimeo his eyes were dry jaws denched tight he strode upright ignoring all about him but slagar never once did his gaze leave the figure of the masked fox slagar dropped back a pace to talk to skinpaw how far off are the others he asked within two marches of the great cliffs ive told them to wait at the foothills until we arrive chief good it shouldnt be too difficult to catch them up what are you staring at mouse you should have killed me back at the canyon mattimeos voice was flat and contemptuous slagar eyed the bold young mouse and shook his head ive killed your father his sword is buried with him thaf s enough for one days work you i will let live to suffer mattimeo stopped marching his friends stopped also the young mouses eyes were hard with scorn then youre not only a cowardly murdering scum youre a fool because from now on i live with one purpose only to kill you slagar was taken aback by the determination and loathing that emanated from mattimeo he glared savagely at him trying to frighten the young mouse into submission mattimeo glared back completely unafraid he was a different mouse altogether snatching the willow cane from skinpaw the cruel one struck out lashing mattimeo several times the cane snapped slagar stood shaking breathing hard through the silken mask mattimeo curled his lip defiantly he had not even felt the blows get yourself another cane and try harder halfface skinpaw bageye keep this one marching up front with you move mattimeo was dragged off to the front of the column slagar marched behind visibly shaken glad that he could not feel the young mouses eyes boring into him from behind though the missing young ones were uppermost in the minds of all the redwallers they tried to carry on with abbey life in a normal fashion keeping a brave face on things by going about their tasks in a cheerful manner afternoon tea in cavern hole was served amid a great buzz of excitement copies of the twelve letters discovered by baby rollo had been distributed and there was a prize of a pink iced woodland plum and spice cake baked by the abbot himself john churchmouse was strongly fancied to win it though abbot mordalfus was having a serious try being the proud maker of such a cake he wanted to keep it and admire it awhile baking was the father abbots latest accomplishment ever since the making of his redcurrantwall abbot alf cake he had been longing to try his paw at cakemaking again the moles formed a joint crew and they sat scratching their velvety heads as they gazed at the twelve letters bbooctapwery burr all oopside backways if n you arsken oi hurr quit talken an get thinkin jarge or youll never win yon pinkice cake cornflower had joined up with baby rollo and mrs churchmouse winifred brother sedge and ambrose spike sat together in various corners of the room small groups kept hard at it trying to solve the mystery of the twelve letters every once in a while some creature would approach the abbot with a possible solution mordalfus in his position as judge looked each one over with a discerning eye hmm baby power to be sorry sister may as you see theres only two letter bs in the puzzle and youve used three next ah winifred lets see your entry coop water byb what in the name of acorns is that supposed to mean no i cant accept that one ah john well now well see who has won my beautiful cake john churchmouse peered expectantly over the top of his glasses as the abbot read out his solution cot abbey prow strange words john have you any reason for your answer john polished his glasses looking slightly sheepish not really abbot i tried several combinations but this looked the most likely mordalfus put johns entry to one side well who knows well keep it as a possibility thank you john thank you abbot er have you tried to solve it yet no f think it only fair that i stay as judge however if it isnt solved tonight then you can be judge tomorrow and ill have a try then we gorrit we gorrit baby roflo ran forward waving a parchment he stumbled fell scrambled up and placed the crumpled entry in the abbof s lap the kindly old mouses eyes twinkled as he lifted rollo onto the arm of his chair youre a clever fellow rollo did you solve this all by yourself cornflower and mrs churchmouse winked at the abbot of course he did we couldnt have done without him mordalfus nodded wisely well lef s see what youve got abbey top crow ha now this really looks like something we can investigateabbey top crow eh good well done baby rollo not to mention your two helpers of course i think the cake goes to the three of you cornflower mrs churchmouse and rollo went into whispered conference finally emerging with the decision that everyone be given a small slice much to the delight of all after tea the abbey dwellers gathered on the sward in front of redwall shading their eyes they gazed up to the high roof queen warbeak and her sparra warriors were circling the spires turrets and crenellations at the abbof s request there was not long to wait shortly warbeak came zooming down at great speed and perched on a windowsill to make her report round top of roof fourbirds fourbirds she told them the abbot could hardly suppress his excitement what sort of birds how high where the sparra queen dosed her eyes remembering the locations and types of bird backa roof hawkbird this side gooseflier other side owlbird that side crowbird all wormbird stone you see cornflower took a few paces back and pointed upwards i can see a wild goose carved this side can just make it out look it leans outwards with its wings spread funny ive never noticed it before the abbot settled his paws into his wide sleeves there are a great many things about redwall that we do not know it is an ancient and mysterious place the longer i live here the more i see how everything our ancestors built into it has a story or a reason it is all part of the mossflower tradition and history the goose is facing west towards the sunset and the great sea that is the way they travel each late season i think the hawk must face north it is a warlike bird and the northlands were always troubled by war the owl i guess will face east to the dense forest and the rising sun that only leaves one way for the crow to face the party walked round to the remaining side of the abbey john churchmouse adjusted his glasses and pointed south the crow points south what cant fly yet has a beak the crow made of stone of course weve found it if only jess or sam squirrel were here they could climb up and investigate it queen warbeak puffed out her feathers why squirrel climb sparra fly me vestigate um crow stone the sparra queen was off like an arrow from below she looked like a small black speck as she hovered around the crow statue which protruded from the high eaves warbeak did not stay long she fluttered about then winged down landing with a sprightly hop on the gravelled path much wonnsign go this way go that way up down round round just as i thought john churchmouse groaned theres writing on the statue but sparrows cannot read at all mordalfus nudged him hush john we dont want to offend queen warbeak shes doing all she can to help well j ust have to think of a way to get a copy of that writing down here warbeak watched them talking she knew what they were discussing cocking her head to one side she winked her fierce bright eye how you do that sparra no can carry mouse too wormfat too big sparra no read um wonnsign like old mouse abbot do with book plenty problem the abbot stroked his whiskers thoughtfully indeed it is queen warbeak but we must help matthias teach those birds to do a rubbin ambrose spike stepped forward with parchment and charcoal sticks ive often done it meself on some of the old barrel carvins in the wine cellar pretty patterns they got carved on em cornflower clapped her paws together of course thats the answer im sure queen warbeak could rub over a parchment with charcoal if her spanas held that parchment fiat upon the writing here give me a moment or two with warbeak im sure i can teach her with no sense of night or day it was impossible to tell how long they had been trapped inside the cave the air had become thicker more rancid and hotter matthias felt his head throbbing with pain he tried to stop his leaden eyelids closing in sleep and all around him he could hear the shallow ragged breathing of the others he had tried talking to them several times but it was little use they were all in a deep sleep approaching a state of coma gripping the handle of his marvelous sword tightly he tried to concentrate on a way out there was little hope they were entombed in a cavern of virtually solid rock with a massive slide of earth and stone sealing the entrance the warrior mouse could stay awake no longer he leaned back against the gently heaving bulk of orlando and let his resolve drift at first it was quite a peaceful feeling save for the lack of air which made breathing difficult and painful but gradually his senses began to numb and he breathed shallowly in short pauses as blackness enveloped him the warrior mouse began dreaming he was in the great hall of his beloved redwall abbey sunlight streamed through the high windows in a coloured cascade filtering through the stained glass weaving patterns on the cool stone walls matthias was walking towards the long tapestry he knew where he was going to see martin the warrior yes there he was the great founder warrior and champion of redwall standing proud in the center of his tapestry matthias was not at all surprised when martin stepped out of the woven cloth and confronted him he went forward to shake paws with martin but the figure backed away his face was scowling and he picked something up from the floor it was orlandos huge bartleaxe matthias was shocked martin advanced upon him and prodded the axehead into his side it nipped him painfully ouch martin its me matthias why are you attacking me martin jabbed matthias in the side again this time calling out in a loud accusing voice why do you sleep warrior you must save your son and his friends matthias tried to reach his sword to defend himself as martin thrust at him again but his paws felt lifeless they hung limp by his sides he winced with pain as the great axe seared his side again a warrior who sleeps in time of danger is no warrior but a coward ouch stoppit matthias awoke to find he had somehow rolled off orlando and was lying on the head of the axe each time he moved it dug painfully into his side sitting upright he rubbed the spot realizing it had all been a fevered dream but it was also help and a warning from his fellow warrior spirit forcing himself upright he held the axe by the twin blades and by staggering about in the dark he located the blocked entrance with agonizing slowness he pulled himself as high as he could up the sloping hill of debris until he was at its topmost point breaming hard sweat starting out all over beneath his habit matthias began probing the rubble heap with the long axe handle pushing and shoving laboriously he felt the long axe haft sink into the hill sometimes it struck a rock but with a bit of manoeuvring he thrust it past the obstacle almost the full length of the haft was buried in the pile with a final effort he gave one last painful shove and fell forward as the haft buried itself entirely slowly wearily he started waggling the shaft by pushing the twin blades from side to side then very carefully he began withdrawing the axe from the hole he had made with painstaking care sliding the axe back until it came all the way out matthias knelt pawdeep in the rubble hardly daring to draw breath like the first kiss of sun upon ice in spring he felt it on his whiskers fresh air tears of gratitude flowed freely through the dust upon the warriors face cool dean fresh air and a shaft of daylight poured in thank you martin thank you for our lives my longdead warrior friend scrambling down off the heap matthias located basil rubbing the hares limbs and tugging at his ears he pummelled and massaged as best he could it took quite a while before there was any response then basil soon proved he was his old self owch ooch steady on laddie tchah whyd you wake me i was halfway through a leek and lettuce pastie and just gettin ready to demolish a summer salad as big as a house huh couldve done it too if you hadnt come along i say my old heads burstin it mustve bin that cask of elderberry wine me and old spike drank together haha i got more than him though bigger swallow see matthias ruffled basils ears gratefully come on up on your paws you old glutton see to young cheek while ill deal with jess if take three of us to bring orlando round i hope he hasnt stopped breathing altogether it took them a considerable while to wake the others fortunately they were all still alive though orlando gave them a few anxious moments and heads still ached however they were uplifted and heartened by the small flow of fresh air and the shaft of daylight that penetrated their tomb finally orlando sat up nursing his head ooh ive got a headache big enough for ten badgers i never knew fresh air could taste so good though if s like drinking from a cold mountain stream in midsummer steady on old chap dont start talkin about cold drinks if s more than a body can stand doncha know why i remember the best drink i ever ha mmmmfff jess had stifled basils reminiscences with her thick furred tail she held up a paw for silence ssshhh listen in the sudden stillness they could faintly hear noises from outside cheek danced up and down theres some creatures out there im sure of it they listened intently sure enough faint sounds filtered in with the air and light through the hole jabez stump voiced his feelings could be friends or mayhap they could be enemies orlando stood in the shaft of light who cares as long as we get out of here friend or foe we can sort out later matthias picked up his sword decisively orlando is right we must get out of here now we must take a chance if s a double risk because we may destroy our air supply are you with me there was an immediate call of agreement taking orlandos axe matthias tied his swordbelt to the end of the handle then he gave it to basil here youve got the longest limbs old fellow push that through the hole and waggle it about to attract attention taking the battleaxe basil shinmed up the rubble and pushed the improvised pennant into the hole darkness fell as the light was blocked out cheek whimpered a bit then tell silent all that could be heard was basil grunting with exertion as he strove to gain attention waving the handle to and fro by means of twisting the twin axeheads round and round anything happening yet basil jess squirrel called out hopefully cant tell yet jess wait i think someone has hold of the other end yes theyre pushing the axe back oof steady on think id better pull the handle back in so we can parley through the jolly old hole with thingummybobbins whoever they are matthias scrambled up beside basil luckily the hole was still open even slightly wider when the axe handle was withdrawn matthias put his mouth close to the hole and shouted hello out there were trapped can you help us out they waited from outside came the faint sound of many voices they seemed to be squabbling and arguing one voice came clearly to them down the narrow aperture it was gruff and commanding who are you state your name and tell us if you are of the guosim matthias leaned back and gave a sigh of relief the guosim thank goodness theyre friends orlando climbed up the rubble beside matthias and basil guosim who in the name of stripes are they careful what you say matthias cautioned the big badger leave the talking to me guosim are the guerilla union of shrews in mossflower they can be very touchy and argumentative and everything they do is governed by their own union rules and laws keep quiet now and let me be spokesbeast if you are the guosim then let me talk to your logalog matthias called down the hole several voices came back at him who are you how do you know we have a logalog are you a friend or foe there was a scrabbling noise and more sounds of dispute this time the voice that came through was strong and louder than the rest out of my way give me room stand back i say hello down there i am the logalog what do you want of me even in the urgency of the situation matthias could not help smiling as he answered logalog you old bossywhiskers its me matthias of redwall the reply was a gruff chuckle well crumble my cake matthias you old swordswinger i should have known that redwall accent ha youre in a pretty pickle no mistake dont worry friend ill soon have you out of there but first ive got to settle a small dispute out here some of these shrews seem to think they know more about guosim rules than their logalog leave it to me ill soon straighten them out meanwhile you just sit tight well need digging tools and rocks and timber for shoring this rubbish keeps sliding and moving if ii be a tricky task but dont worry ill have supper ready for you when we haul you out of mere how many are you six altogether logalog a hedgehog a badger a young otter jess squirrel and basil stag hare what that old scoffin windbag im sorry i mentioned supper basils ears stood up indignantly i say steady on you scurvy little logfloater scoffin windbag indeed jess squirrel stifled a giggle id say he wasnt far wrong there eh matthias it was late afternoon when the shrew digging party broke through the friends had sat in darkness most of the day listening to digging and shoring interspersed with orders and arguments suddenly they were showered with rubble as a small head broke through framed by light flugg stop bickerin and pass me that branch there that ought to do it hello cave dwellers im gum the best digger the guosim have got some say my granddad was a mole orlando thrust forward a huge paw and patted the shrew well gurn i cant tell you how glad we are to see you im orlando the axe hmm big feller arent you i hope this tunnels wide enough to take you youd better go last orlando smallest first it was a painstaking and bruising operation as one by one the friends were attached to a rope and forcibly pulled through by scores of shrews orlando waited until last the tunnel caved in behind him as he was hauled and tugged along the makeshift rescue shaft in the early evening sunlight matthias and his friends laughed and splashed in the shallows of the river as they bathed away the dust and dirt of their imprisonment sunlight clean air fresh water and the sight of green growing things combined to make them realize how lucky they were to be alive even jabez stump chuckled happily as he splashed water into the air hohoho ifn my old family could see me now ifs many a long season since this beast risked a bath i can tell you later that evening they sat around a shrew campfire eating oatbread baked on flat rocks and drinking fresh river water with herbs crushed into it matthias told logalog all that had taken place from the night of the feast celebrating the summer of the golden plain up to the incident of the cave the shrew leader shook with rage slavers the slime of mossfiower treacherous murdering rogues our guosim scouts have heard reports in mossfiower since the end of spring about that masked fox and his dirty crew im with you and your friends matthias well track em and put an end to their evil trade taking young ones from their homes and families i tell you it makes my blood boil just to think of it basil had been munching his oatbread and gazing around the shrew camp scuse me old logathing i know its not unusual for you shrew fellers to argue a bit but by and large you usually stick together so tell me what is that small group over there sittin on their own around a separate fire for the old campaigner wondered logalog sniffed and threw a dead root on the fire oh that lot theyre trouble basil particularly that young feller skan hes been challenging my leadership lately if all come to a head tonight when i announce our new plans when it does id be grateful if you could keep your friends out of it matthias no offence but this is guosim business matthias nodded as you wish logalog anyhow ive no desire to be caught in the middle of a shrew argument ive seen em before but please dont let us be the cause of your trouble you freed us from the cave and we are thankful for that we can carry on our hunt alone old friend the guosim leaders eyes were bright and fierce matthias we are going with you and that is final mossfiower needs to be kept free of evil if woodland families are to live in peace it is no less than our duty to help as for the coming trouble you leave that to me logalog took out a round black stone from his sling pouch and stood up a smile hovered about his face momentarily besides lifes not much fun to a shrew without trouble the slavers caught up with the main party two hours after nightfall mattimeo and his friends found themselves locked and manacled back on to the slave line they slumped down wearily tired and sore and hungry none for you escapers little vitch sniggered evilly as he fed the other slaves slagar said so a taste of real hunger make you a bit more obedient slagar says that when hes got a bit more time hes going to deal with each of you personally especially you little redwall pet heeheehee mattimeo bared his teeth and went into a crouch vitch hurriedly backed off and left them alone they looked around trying to take stock of thir surroundings in the dark of night one thing was obvious they were camped in the foothills of an immense cliff range the huge high plateau reared up behind them blocking out the nighttime sky sam craned his neck backwards as he gazed up i wonder how were supposed to get up there jube lay back dosing his eyes well find out tomorrow on an empty stomach too they lay down to sleep but mattimeo sat up staring in the direction of slagar less watched him he was different older tougher and something else she could not quite put her paw on mattimeo what is it she asked youve changed since we were recaptured the young mouse patted tesss paw if s nothing tess go to sleep im sorry i got angry at tim today in fact im sorry for a lot of things perhaps you were right when you said that i should be more like my father maybe if s a bit too late now but im certainly going to try from now on redwall must live on through martin my father and me i was born the son of the redwall warrior sword or no sword and that is what i intend to be to myself and most of all to you and to my friends it was then that tess churchmouse realized mattimeo was no longer the wild and wayward young mischiefmaker he had always been sitting next to her was a mouse who looked tike martin and matthias despite the fact that they were captives in a strange place she felt suddenly safe and protected in his presence the young one had become a warrior cornflower abbot mordalfus foremole and queen warbeak were in the gatehouse cottage it had long gone midnight but they sat around on the hearthrug with the parchment before them it was covered by the markings of the charcoal stonerubbing taken from the stone crow high on the south wall of the abbey the sparra queen preened herself proudly verree good eh sparra no missee thing get all um wormsign hurr hurr that youm ave clever ol burdbag foremole congratulated her the father abbot

tell see the badger and the bell face the lord who points the way after noon on summers day death will open up its grave who goes there none but the brave the abbot nodded wisely if s a lot dearer now this is a crude map and a poem that tells a bit more than the last one in fact if s a key to the rhyme that was found beneath the abbey cornflower was puzzled how so father abbot the old mouse tapped his paw upon the design in the bottom corner there thorn shout thafs only north and south mixed up a jumbled shout as in walk straight to a jumbled shout cornflower smiled as recognition dawned of course it means go due south foremole wrinkled his nose whoi didden oi think o that if youm awalken south then sun must be asetten in dexteree where is dexteree it was the abbots turn to look puzzled

now oh father abbot if only we could get this information this map and poem to them right now they mean very little to us sitting here in redwall but to my matthias why he might be able to see the very places the map and poem tell of indeed the abbot shrugged sadly not only that but it tells the exact route and even clues to the dangers they will encounter the woodland trees the water when to cross it the longtails the place where stones fall and make no sound if s all here badgers heads bells lord of mossflower cornflower you are right if s about as much use to us as a snowfall in summer but to them then you make oopee all sparra fly all sparra much kmg fly plenty find um my friend matthias with old kmgears and treejumper we find you see cornflower was taken aback queen warbeak i dont know but how the sparra queen hopped onto the mantelpiece and cocked her head to one side jauntily no worry warbeak queen sparra warriors do what me say matthias redwall all good to warbeak and sparra folk we do this for you for you splendid for a mouse of his many seasons the abbot did a surprisingly agile leap up onto his paws i will rouse brother sedge sister agnes brother rufus sister may together with myself and john churchmouse they should be able to copy the map and the poem several times over before first light i take it you will want to leave at dawn queen warbeak the sparrow bowed gravely first wormlight oldmouse abbot all sparra fly south outside the gatehouse window other ears were listening a large magpie dacked his beak together in satisfaction and took off for the woodlands beyond the abbeys north wall booktwo general ironbeak matthias and his friends watched in silence as logalog held up the black stone in one paw and addressed the shrews seated on the river bank in the quiet summers evening members of the guosim you have heard the tale matthias of redwall and his friends related to us there is evil abroad in mossflower this we already knew savers the masked fox and his band have captured young creatures even now they are marching them south so what has this got to do with us the shrew named skan interrupted logalog turned on the insolent one silence skan do not show your bad manners by calling out while i hold the stone at a council meeting if you wish to say anything then wait until i have finished and it is your turn to hold the stone this is the rule of the guosim skan sniggered and muttered something to his cronies standing boldly he faced logalog if s a stupid rule like all your silly guosim customs i am a tree shrew and ill talk when i feel like it immediately a hubbub and argument broke out on both sides orlando pawed his axe he made to rise but matthias warned him sit still friend leave this to logalog the shrew leader restored order by raising his voice above the rest logajogalogalog listen to me shrews the creatures of redwall have always been our good friends if we were hungry if we were hurt if we were sick the brothers and sisters of the abbey would help us without question it is our duty to help them now i say we go with matthias and his companions we will fight the slavers and rescue the young ones are you with me there was a loud shout of agreement from the main body but skan and his followers stood to one side silent and sneering logalog walked stifflegged to where skan stood the shrew leader thrust his face dose to the young usurper his hackles bristling dangerously and you skan are you for the guosim or against it guosim huh skan said scornfully though he avoided logalogs eyes a pile of old fuddyduddies making outdated rules and regulations why should me and my friends get ourselves slain or injured sorting out the troubles of others i say we mind our own business logalog smiled coldly so it has come to this you have been pushing and prodding me for quite a while now skan perhaps you would like to be the new logalog of the guosim well now is your chance lef s see if you fight as bravely as you talk come on skan knock this council stone from an old fuddyduddys paw the shrew leader stood in front of the young rebel holding out the stone for all to see he looked relaxed though his whole body was tensed like a steel spring skan stood half a head taller than logalog for a moment it looked as if he were about to do something then he saw the light of battle in the shrew leaders eyes and his nerve failed him he turned away yah who wants to be bothered with the guosim im away to roam free and do as i like come on shrews skan and his group of followers marched off into the fading light there was an audible sigh of relief throughout the shrew camp the main body who were with logalog sat back and relaxed amid a general chatter of conversation orlando nudged matthias hes not short of courage your friend logalog that skan was bigger and heavier than him by far do you think he could have beaten him matthias smiled knowingly logalog may be small but hes the fiercest shrew warrior ive ever seen though hes no bully like skan the rest of the guosim know this logalog is a good leader hes as wise as he is brave logalog came and sat with them he clapped matthias on the back sony about that old redwauer though its none of your fault skan and his pals have been niggling at me all season and it had to come to a head sooner or later ah well at first light tomorrow well follow the fox hes travelling south my scouts have cut his track several times over the past few days slagar rose silently while the rest slept he made his way quietly through the camp and across the foothills until he was at the base of the gigantic cliffs which stretched away in both directions as far as the eye could see drawing out his leatherthonged weapon he twirled it until the metal balls dacked together loudly in the still night air there was an answering rap from the top of the plateau as if two rocks had been banged sharply together slagar the cruel smiled beneath his silken mask he looked up and saw the two rope ladders uncoiling themselves as they fell from the heights giving each of mem a tug to make sure they were secure the fox stole off back to the camp and his slave line the peace of a warm summer night lay over mossflower it was a peace that would not last general ironbeak perched in a great cedar which stood near the northern woodland fringe close to redwall in mossflower country on the bough beside him the crow mangiz watched golden dawn light flooding from the east on a lower branch three magpie brothers quickbill brightback and diptail awaited the raven generals orders in the trees to either side of them a small army of rooks were gathered basking in the mild summer weather it was a welcome change for all the birds respected ironbeak as a shrewd commander he had given them victories and kept their bellies full and he was the most feared fighting bird in all the far cold northland general ironbeak had led his fighters from the bleak places of the north to this new territory and they marvelled at the warm weather the vast green forest with its cool shade plentiful water and easy foraging they sat in the lower terraces of the foliage content in their new surroundings but ready to fly at ironbeaks bidding the raven general relied upon the word of his seer the crow mangiz he seldom arrived at any decision without first consulting him today was different during the night quickbill the magpie had made his report apprising the general of the latest news from redwall now ironbeak and mangiz perched side by side their eyes half closed not looking at each other as they talked arrah it is as i said my general the great redstone house is only a smallflight from us you heard quickbill soon the sparrows will be gone and there will be none to give warning against us the raven blinked as sunlight caught the corner of his eye my good right wing mangiz it is as you foretold truly the redstone house is a wonderful place tell me more of it the impassive crow ruffled his neck down into dark breast feathers the sparrows fly south my visions told me this where they go i do not know grakk that need not concern us the roofspaces will be unguarded and we can take care of any old ones or nestlings that are left below on the ground there are many earthcrawlers a great stripedog hedgepig waterhound and mice wearing robes there are no warriors or fighters to do battle with ironbeak came alert as the distant sounds of the matthias and methuselah bells tolled out a new day in die summer of the golden plain listen mangiz the bells are welcoming us it is a great thing to have a redstone house with bells arrakl the only time before this that i heard a bell was upon the northlands great waters it was on a ship that sank in a great storm i never knew that houses had bells what else does your vision tell you about the redstone the seer crow shut his eyes tight the place has big lands enclosed by a wall enough food grows there to feed the whole northland and there is a pool with fishes in it take my word it is a place of plenty ironbeaks bright eyes shone yagga well told my mangiz you are seldom wrong quickbill take your brothers and watch the redstone house do not be seen when the sparrows are gone report back here grubdaw ragwing take sentry duty the rest of you keep low and hidden rest awhile my fighters the three magpies dipped their tails in salute before winging off through the trees amid a ruffling of feathers and scratching of talons the others settled down to enjoy a rest in the warm summer morning ironbeak shuffled restlessly along the maple bough he was clearly impatient we have travelled far together my general mangiz said soothingly wait now the great redstone house will soon be yours you will conquer it from the top downwards walls were built only for earthcrawlers we will arrive like silent arrows from the sky patience ironbeak the raven leader settled down reassured this is a good land to be in mangiz it is not cold like those northlands and the redstone house will be mine it was your visions that first saw it if you say the signs say wait then we wait cornflower and mrs churchmouse stood on the south ramparts keeping tight hold of baby rollo as he waved and shouted the bells pealed merrily while the sparra folk of queen warbeak flew south across the woodlands in the cloudless blue morning constance and the abbot cheered as lustily as any at the brave sight the sparra queen circled the abbey once then dipping her wings she dropped like a stone taking up a zinging flight as she brushed by the creatures on the battlements we find um you see we find um she called warbeak flew high shooting like a speeding arrow into the vanguard of the feathered squadron soon they became dark specks which rapidly disappeared into the distance over mossflower john churchmouse flexed both his paws and massaged the back of his neck wearily as he descended the wallsteps with brother sedge whew well thank goodness thats over maybe we can catch up on a little sleep now eh sedge brother sedge grubbed charcoalstained paws into his redrimmed eyes aye its straight up to the dormitory for me john it certainly takes it out of you sitting up all night drawing maps and writing poems i just hope that one of those birds finds matthias and the others id hate to think that we worked in vain john stretched wearily ho hum well theres at least twelve copies and theyre all carried by trusty sparra scouts if they cant find them nobeast can i wonder whaf s for breakfast breakfast indeed john churchmouse mrs churchmouse rutted airily as she passed by youve done nothing but eat all night still i suppose you could find room for some nutbread blackcurrant cordial and elderberry pancakes before you sleep the day away john leaned wearily against the abbey wall hmm spose so dear ill be in soon tell that baby rollo to save a pancake or two for me basil certainly taught him how to deal with the rations the little nosebag he wiped his grimy paws on his habit and blinked owlishly s funny i could swear i saw a magpie above the west wall just then did you see anything sedge brother sedge stifled a yawn oh come on john lef s get breakfast youre seeing things there hasnt been a magpie ever recorded in this neck of the woods the morning wore on with the gentle pace of red wall life three magpies winged their way low and slow to the maple at the north fringe that same morning saw matthias and his friends marching shoulder to shoulder with logalog and the shrew army south through the trees upon the trail of slagar orlando stopped in a clearing and pointed ahead with his axe is that a cloudbank on the horizon or some sort of landrise they halted and gazed in the direction he was pointing matthias shook his head could be anything what dyou think logalog the shrew leader shaded his eyes that must be the great south cliffs ive heard of them but the guosim have never wandered that far south before well lef s press on and see for ourselves i reckon we should make them by late evening if we march at the double a short meal break was taken for shrew oatcakes and water keeping the cliffs ahead as a bearing the searchers set out at a fast double pawstep slagar had split his band in two half in front and half behind the slave line as they began the ascent of the rope ladders hanging down from the top of the plateau the masked fox snapped out instructions listen you lot keep your paws tight on those rungs dont look up or down if s a good drop even from halfway up these ladders you wouldnt live through it so if you want to reach the top in one piece then keep your wits about you threeclaws you go first to show em when you reach the top make sure the prisoners are well staked down until i get there stoneflecks waiting up there do as he says right get going mattimeo climbed stolidly trying hard to keep some slack in the running line to make it easier for tess and cynthia who were on the rungs below him auma climbed steadily she was above mattimeo young jube would slip now and then accidentally kicking the badger on her head but she toiled upwards without complaint tim was above jube and sam was the top climber being the more experienced he chanced a look below when they were over halfway up the drop was dizzying even for a squirrel the other slaves were way below treading nervously on each separate rung as they were chivvied along by the slavers come on dozypaws or youll feel my cane up you stupid creature dont look down hey you get a move on up there ow you great lump youre treading on my paws it was midafternoon by the time they reached the giddy heights on top of the cliffs at first no creature noticed the big rat who sat watching them from a rocky outcrop it was only when he moved towards them that they could distinguish him stonefleck was grey and dirty white with black markings he could lie still anywhere and be taken for a rock a ground shadow or part of the scenery he was large for a rat and not given overmuch to talking and he carried a heavy bow and a wellladen quiver of arrows threeclaws was taken aback stonefleck seemed to materialize out of the rocks wheres the masked one the raf s voice was flat and toneless hell be here soon are you stonefleck the rat did not reply he seated himself at the cliffs edge and awaited the arrival of slagar looking for all the world like a boulder perched on the brink of the plateau the slave lines were staked to the ground by pegs mattimeo and the other captives sat regaining their breath after the long climb which had been made doubly difficult because of manacles and running line the slavers surrounded them panting hard from their exertions over the cliff edge mossflower sprawled away into the sunlit distances tess stared out hopefully somewhere out there was their beloved redwall abbey though it was too far away to see the little churchmouse comforted herself with the thought that her mother and father if they were alive would probably be going in to afternoon tea in cavern hole she brushed a tear of homesickness from her eye and sniffed slagar was last up he nodded to stonefleck is this all you brought the rat asked indicating the captives the silk mask pulled in and out against the cruel ones face as he breathed heavily its enough rat theyre all young strong and healthy if you wanted more you should have tried climbing down from here and catching them yourself ill speak to you later first ive got business to attend to wedgeback get yourself over here who me the stoat pulled a paw at himself who dyou think numb brain the weasel behind you come here sugars voice was tight and dangerous nervously wedgeback looked round at his companions they seemed to be intent on minding their own business nobeast wanted to see what was about to happen falteringly the stoat made his way over to the cliff edge where slagar stood waiting the masked fox seized a pawful of wedgebacks soft belly digging his claws painfully deep he pulled the frightened stoat forward until he was breathing down the terrified creatures nostrils a slight breeze rippled the silken hood mask slagar had never looked more scary the stoat gulped aloud his face a fraction from the slitted eyes slagar was actually smiling wedgeback old friend let me tell you something when i leave you in charge of the prisoners it means that you have to guard them carefully and let none escape bbut sslagar i hush ssshhh the cruel ones voice was deceptively soothing dont interrupt if s bad manners youve got a lot to learn wedgeback pity you wont have time though where was i oh yes you know the trouble we went through to get those creatures from redwall abbey yet the moment my back was turned you let them escape didnt you the stoat was almost incoherent with tear slagars daws were piercing his belly and he felt totally helpless i didnt know they were ggoin to scape honest slagar began slowly turning wedgeback so mat the stoat had his back to the cliff edge he was teetering on the brink but they did escape no thanks to you i caught them again theres no room in my band for blunderers wedgeback youll have to go wedgebacks eyes rolled wildly ill go slagar i promise ill never come back again please dont hurt me just let me go as you wish my friend goodbye slagar let go of the stoat at the same time giving him a slight push the luckless wedgeback vanished over the edge of the heights with a scream of despair dumbstruck at the horror of the callous killing he had just witnessed mattimeo shuddered turning his head aside he clasped tess and cynthia who buried their faces in his robe slagar peered over the cliff edge at the broken carcass on the rocks below stonefleck joined him his face still impassive as he pointed to a small group making thenway through the foothills look fox shrews do you know them slagar peered hard at the group they were just arriving at the rope ladders momentarily they recoiled with horror at the sight of wedgebacks corpse cupping his paws round his muzzle slagar called down to them who are you and what do you want the answer came floating faintly up on the warm afternoon air i am skan and these are my followers i have information for slagar i am slagar the fox called back down bring your iriends up here skan use the rope ladders while the shrews made their way up the cliff face slagar held a silent conference with his band they nodded at his plan the masked fox laughed quietly and his followers were panting with exertion as they pulled themselves on to the plateau at a signal from slagar the slavers pulled the rope ladders up while his followers sat about on the clifftop regaining their breath skan spoke to slagar whew what a time weve had we ran all the way following your trail through the woods we havent stopped or eaten a thing today listen theres a whole army coming after you logalog and his shrews they rescued matthias and those others from the cave dug em out slagar was surprised what you mean to tell me those redwall creatures are still alive skan wiped sweat from his brow phew oh yes very much so in fact theyve joined up with the guosim thafs the shrews you know and together theyve vowed to track you and your band down and slay the lot of you the fox stroked his silken mask pensively hmmm well thafs nothing new theres lots of creatures would like to slay me by the teeth of hell thought id buried those redwallers for good but why should you dash all the way here to tell me this because i want my revenge on logalog and his stupid guosim and you can help me oh i see slager nodded you and your friends have broken away from the shrews due to some sort of bad blood is that vtr skan narrowed his eyes something like mat but thaf s my worry not yours the thing is now for us to join together and defeat them together we can be a strong force slagar helped skan up and put a friendly paw about his shoulders what a good idea skan however i have no need to fight with anybeast following us see the ladders have been pulled up theres no way we can be attacked were completely safe up here skan looked angry and puzzled but what about me and my followers slagar chuckled well you can climb down and fight mem yourself if you wish or you can stay up here with the shrew was crestfallen i thought youd want to fight them and be rid of them i suppose well have to stay here and join up with your band were too few to face them alone slagar signalled to his crew and they began forming a semicircle around the shrews who were standing with their backs to the cliff edge the slavers were heavily armed right its a deal then skan slagar said well let you join up with us not with my band of course but with my slave line the fox suddenly grasped skan in a headlock reliev ing him of his short sword which he held at the shrews neck surrender your weapons slagar snarled at the shrews or he dies and you lot go over the edge you traitor you scum we came here to warn you skan spluttered so you did slagar laughed scornfully you were prepared to sell your own kind out let me tell you skan when it comes to doubledealing theres nobeast better at it than slagar the cruel chain em up weeping with frustration the shrews were disarmed nd chained to the slave line fe teaching across auma pinned skan to the ground with a hefty paw at his throat give me the right answers turncoat or youre dead my father is orlando the axe that mouses father is matthias of redwall the squirrel has a mother named tf and the young hedgehog there his fathers name is abez are they alive and well skan gurgled and spluttered until auma released him yes yes theyre alive and an old hare named basil and a young otter too though i didnt get his name mattimeo and his friends laughed with delight and ffefief auma gave skan a mighty pat on the head that completely stunned him haha theyre alive oh i do feel better now us the evening bells tolled out across the countryside at redwall it was a windless summer twilight not a leaf stirred on branch or bough the earth and grass were still warm from the hot afternoon the abbey dwellers ceased their daily tasks and went indoors for the evening meal mole cooks had baked a traditional taternturnipnbeetroot deepernever pie there was fresh fruit and cream mint wafers and cider a garland of yellow flowers graced the table center in honour of the season none of them knew that murder had been done that day when the sun was at its zenith general ironbeak and his raiders had flown up as high as they could hovering on the high thermals far above redwall then they quietly plummeted down four by four they came each bird entering under the high eaves from a different point the general led the secret attack swiftly and silently dealing death to the few old sparrows and iate nestlings who were unable to fly the dreadful deed was accomplished with quiet efficiency ironbeak and his birds were seasoned warriors mangiz perched in the crossbeams next to his general while the rooks searched through the pitifully empty sparrow nests one cackled harshly ironbeak swooped down and felled him with a savage peck silence the great redstone house is not yet ours i do not want those creatures below to know we are here quickbiil and his brothers will bring in food soon when night falls until then you must all be still and make no noise he flew back to perch with mangiz but the crow seemed somewhat disturbed ironbeak noticed his seer was not his usual self what is it my mangiz are you having more visions he asked no the strange thing is that my vision is clouded the eye within my mind has been blurred since we came here today whatever i try to see becomes difficult it is an earthcrawler a mouse dressed strangely he carries a sword and seems to bar all my visions ironbeak closed his eyes do not worry mangiz maybe it is a good omen mangiz clacked his beak doubtfully we will see my general oops a daisy up the stairs to bed with you htderouo mrs churchmouse chased after baby rollo but he ducked beneath the table and began singing i wrestle a fish upon a dish cut off his ead while hes in bed an take a rat an make him dead for goooooood ooooooold cideeeeeeemtnr sister may and cornflower helped mrs churchmouse they scrambled under the table and chased rollo out into her waiting paws gotcha you little monster now off to bed with you no no dowannago dowannagorrabed please rollo be a good fellow tell you what if i come up with cornflower and sister may and we sing songs then will you go rollo chuckled until his little fat body shook yep yep singa singa song f rollo the three mouse ladies took the infant bankvole up to the dormitory on the floor above great hall where he was dutifully put into a cot after several songs cornflower held a paw to her lips ssshhh hes asleep come on quietly now rollo opened one eye he watched them tippaw out as soon as the door was closed he pulled his nightshirt above his paws and scrambled out of the cot halfway down the stairs sister may heard the dormitory door slam mercy me the little rogue has escaped quickly they bounded back up the spiral staircase reaching the landing in time to see rollo climb another curving night of stairs cornflower stamped her paw down hard back to bed baby rollo this instant rollo turned and giggled then he waved to them mrs churchmouse heard a slight noise on the stairs above rollo and was about to call out to him suddenly a large raven poked its villainous black head round the spiral and seized rollo by the nightshirt in its wicked beak the little bankvole screamed aloud as he was dragged backwards up the stairs darkness had fallen when matthias and his newfound army reached the foothills they were forced to camp there for the night until morning light revealed their position shrew fires glimmered and the chatter and noise of the argumentative little beasts made matthias wish logalog had never offered the help of the guosim the warrior mouse sat alone on the brow of a small rise then he was joined by orlando and jabez stump the hedgehog nodded towards the cliffs rearing high overhead puzzles me as to ow any creature ceptin a bird could get to the top of there youre sure they went mis way basil stag hare sauntered up out of the darkness sure you could bet your summer spikes on it old lad theyve scaled the bally heights all right though how they did it beats me one clue though ive just stumbled over the carcass of one of those stoat fellers either he thought he could fly or he missed his paw hold ugh nearly put me off msupper it did it must have been pretty grim to banish thoughts of food from your mind basil matthias chuckled the question is how do we get up there tomorrow orlando tested his axe blade against his paw and when we do get up there dyou think theyll have laid some sort of trap maybe the fox is waiting until were halfway up to start hurling rocks and boulders down on us thats a chance well have to take matthias shrugged though i dont think slagar knows were alive hell probably press on to get his captives to their destination wherever that is the old hare squatted down beside matthias i picked up the tracks of that young shrew skan and his cronies this afternoon they were making for this point well ahead of us i think the bally old fox knows were still alive and kickin one way or another the warrior mouse unbuckled his sword and lay down in the grass well know tomorrow rest now mattimeo and his companions on the slave line were being driven hard and fast evidently there was to be little rest that night slagar and stonefleck led the column before they set out the masked fox had addressed them tonight you must move swiftly and silently i tell you this because there is no other way stonefleck here will guide us he knows the paths to take when we reach the forest there is danger so be silent travel fast and you will come out unharmed now get moving it was difficult going they were forced into a stumbling dogtrot the chain manacles and the heavy slave line were a great handicap for the prisoners surprisingly the slavers helped them all they could sam was baffled matti tess why havent they got the canes swinging usually we get beaten and bullied but all of a sudden theyre being almost nice to us auma caught tim as he stumbled theyre not shouting and yelling at us either id say they look pretty frightened themselves theres a forest up ahead jube called back to them in a loud voice dyou suppose that has something to do with it please dont shout or youll get us all killed drynose the weasel guard had an almost pleading whine to his voice the forest when they reached it looked eerie and forlorn in the dim light old gnarled trees spread their knotted branches wide and low there was little grass on the floor and no flowers were to be seen anywhere mattimeo saw the withered and bleached skeleton of a rat dangling from a bough halfway up a tree and there were other bones too scattered here and there throughout the branches the young mouse decided to keep quiet about them no sense in panicking his friends chained up as they were ive noticed those bones too auma whispered in his ear wed best keep quiet if anybeast gets attacked if probably be us who have no chance of making a run for it bending low to avoid hanging branches they pushed onward as fast as possible following slagar and stone fleck occasionally mattimeo could hear guttural noises up in the trees and now it seemed that everyone had sported grisly remains hanging in the boughs though no creature made mention of it tess churchmouse shuddered she had never been in such a sinister place catching up with mattimeo she grasped the back of his robe and clutched it tight the young mouse patted her paw in the darkness dont be frightened tess he whispered well make it theres nothing to be afraid of hold tight and look straight ahead tess was comforted by his quiet confidence marching half the night pawsore and exhausted they carried on driven by fear of the unknown stonefleck nudged slagar he pointed ahead to a break in the trees the forest was thinning at that very moment browntooth the stoat who was marching pn the left flank of the slave line received a sharp jab in the eye from an overhanging branch which halftail had brushed to one side the springy branch swished back into place just as the unfortunate stoat drew level with it the spell of silence was broken by his screams arrrgh owow me eye me eye slagar broke into a fast sprint shouting as he went run for it follow me to the shore to the shore the slavers dashed off leaving the captives to fend for themselves they ran tripping and stumbling scrambling over their fallen comrades in an effort to get out of the woods pick up the rope keep in line run as fast as you can mattimeo shouted to the slave line help the others if one of us falls were all done for they went pellmell pulling their stumbling comrades up with the line as they ran and the back runners were virtually dragged along suddenly the air was full of harsh cries and a number of dark shapes descended upon them it was a fierce onslaught on slaves and slavers alike the screams of the injured echoed round in the forest auma felt sharp claws strike back at her back she bared her teeth snapping at the thing that was attacking her help help eeee caught by several of the strange attackers skan the shrew began to rise into the air he screamed and kicked for dear life tim and mattimeo felt the slaveline straining and dragging them back as skan was pulled upwards auma turned and grasped the rope in her teeth aided by tim and mattimeo she tugged sharply skan fell to earth with a bump but even this quick action had not saved him auma seized the limp form and swung it across her broad back rushing from the forest they found themselves on the broad shores of a wide river it glimmered and waved in the starlight stagar stood by a broad trench covered with boughs urging diem on come on in here hurry gratefully they threw themselves under its protection most of the slavers had already arrived and they sat shivering and breathless slagar was the last to enter scringe vitch cover each end of this trench he ordered keep yourselves awake and keep an eye on those woods threeclaws did all the slaves make it all except skan the shrew hes had it chief then unchain him and sling his worthless hide out what about you lot are you all right anybeast missing halftail two of ours chief browntooth and badrag i saw em go meself it was orrible screamin an kickin they were by the claw what are those things that attacked us stonefleck squatted impassively the painted ones he said his voice flat and matter of fact slagar moved aside as two slavers carried the dead skan out look at that a good slave lost to those devils out there ifs just as well browntooth got taken id gut him myself if he was here screaming and yelling like that auma rubbed a paw across her bleeding back painted ones ive never heard of them before quiet back there slagar paced the slave line you lot can have a long rest ifs too late to cross the river now well have to wait until tomorrow night right stonefleck the rat strung his bow selecting an arrow from his quiver he poked it through a gap in the boughs which covered the trench and fired straight up into the night sky the arrow gave a shrieking whistle as it sped upward there was a moments silence then an answering whistle from an arrow fired on the other side of the river stonefleck unstrung his bow tomorrow night slagar my rats will be waiting baby rollo screamed the raven had him tight by the nightshirt and he wailed in terror as the big bird tugged and pulled shaking its head fiercely from side to side cornflower and mrs churchmouse momentarily froze with horror at the awful sight but not little sister may she went immediately into action rushing to the stairs she sprang up and grabbed baby rollo at the same time sinking her teeth into the ravens foot which she bit clear through to the bone the bird promptly let go of his prize he gave a loud agonized squawk and fell flat upon the stairs rollo yowled sister may screamed and they both rumbled down the spiral staircase cornflower and mrs churchmouse dived in clutching sister may and little rollo they hurried downstairs towards cavern hole all four shouting aloud help help strangers in the abbey help like a great grey furred juggernaut constance came bounding out of cavern hole closely followed by winifred the otter john churchmouse and foremole between them the three mice gasped out the story of what had happened rollo had got over the fright quickly he kept pointing a chubby paw over his back to show them all the tear in his nightshirt where the big bird had seized it constance wasted no time she got the little group safely back to cavern hole and issued emergency orders brother trugg sound the alarm bells winifred ambrose foremole brother sedge gather staves and light some torches we must find out more about this strange bird cornflower tell the abbot where we have gone the rest of you stay down here dont go wandering off alone torches shone on the darkened spiral stairway as constance led the party they had searched the dormitories the sick bay and all the firstfloor passages and were now on the secondfloor staircase which led to tiie gallery overlooking great hall foremole went snuffling along to an old side staircase a straight flight which ran up to the disused chambers on the east wing of the third floor he held up a paw and called out yurr over yurr lookit oi found a faint trace of bloodspecks spattered the bottom steps constance held up a torch to investigate the shadows leapt back to reveal a large raven standing on the top stair together with a crow and six rooks boldly the badger climbed the stairs until she stood one step below the intruders who are you and what are you doing in our abbey constance demanded never one to mince words the crow strutted forward imperiously i am mangiz he seer general ironbeaks strong right wing bow your head and show proper respect when you speak to me stripedog constance promptly batted mangiz beak over tailfeathers in one mighty sweep of her powerful forepaw then with a roar she charged in among the rooks ironbeak and his fighters retaliated instantly they were on constance pecking scratching and tearing winifred and ambrose ran to her rescue belaboring furiously they whacked away at anything feathered with their stout staves the fight did not last long ironbeak and his fighters were driven back by the fast onslaught of the redwallers they retreated to a boxroom slamming the door and locking it from the inside constance shook blood from her muzzle as she banged on the door you in there ironbeak or whatever you call yourself get out of this abbey and take your birds with you we do not allow trespassers at redwall the reply was instant and bold yuggaw i am general ironbeak greatest fighter in all the northlands this is my redstone house and i will slay you all if you do not leave the abbot came hurrying up accompanied by brother dan and sister agnes he motioned constance to be silent though the badger was obviously fuming with temper she bowed to the abbofs wish the old mouse rapped lightly on the door hello in there i am mordalfus abbot of redwall im sorry if theres been a misunderstanding we mean you no harm we are a friendly order of creatures if you wish to stay the night then you may we have food and treatment for any creature who is sick or injured hello can you hear me this time it was mangiz the crow who replied general ironbeaks word is the law this place is his now we are in your roof spaces and there are many of us all seasoned warriors from the north there were some sparrows when we arrived but they have all been slain you too will be slain if you do not leave the redstone house the abbot shook his head sadly as constance pulled him gently away foremole struck the door with his staff yurr burdbags redwall be ours better wurriers than youm as rroid to take it offen us an failed mizzuble so they ave there was no sound from the other side of the door winifred shouldered her stave sounds as if theyve gone wed best get back to cavern hole and decide what we are going to do there was a loud hubbub and clamor in cavern hole and sleep was forgotten sister may was the heroine of the hour after cornflower and mrs churchmouse told how she attacked the big bird singlepawed to rescue rollo sister may was a simple and modest mouse well mercy me i may be only the infirmary sister but i couldnt let that great bully harm our rollo she told them poor little mite he was frightened clear out of his wits and so was i do you know im still not sure it was me who attacked that bird there was general laughter and a rousing cheer for sister may foremole and constance were whispering together in a corner when the abbot banged a wooden bowl upon the tabletop quiet quiet please well eight seasons of peace since the great war and now one summer strewn with trouble first the fox and his band now this several voices called out if only matthias were here yes hed know what to do r matthias basil and jess would soon sort those birds out mump constances heavy paw shook the table silence listen to your abbot she ordered foremole raised a paw scuse oi me an moi moles got wurk f do may us be scused zurr i the abbot looked over the top of his spectacles certainly foremole now the rest of you listen to me wherever matthias is now or jess squirrel or basil im ibm they would wish us to get on with this problem and help ourselves there was a murmur of agreement abbot mordalfus continued his address thank you i must say a word regarding sister may what she did tonight was very brave aye twas that ambrose spike piped up maybe shes after our warriors job instead of mindin that old infirmary sister may blushed to her whiskertips oh what a naughty thing to say mr spike when order was restored the abbot continued perhaps ambrose is right maybe we do need a warrior in a situation like this can anyone suggest a suitable candidate the call was unanimous constance constance the badger stood up first i suggest you afl bed down here for the night it doesnt look too sate up in the dormitories at the moment if you must leave cavern hole let winifred or ambrose know do not wander about alone especially out in the open i will sleep on the steps between here and great hall tonight tomorrow well decide what to do about the raven and his crew there was a great bustle of activity some of the infants thought it great fun to be sleeping in cavern hole and they made blanket tents from the edge of the table to the floor constance sat on the steps with the abbot and ambrose what do you make of all this constance im at a bit of a loss to say abbot they must have been watching the abbey because they wouldnt have found it so easy to occupy the roofspaces with queen warbeak and all her warriors at home aye now if s up to us to make em see the error of their ways and send em packin gurt cheeky birds in the roofspace general ironbeak held a conference with mangiz krah the big stripedog is dangerous ironbeak the hedgepig and the waterhound too we underestimated these earthcrawlers mangiz they will have to be taught a lesson aye tomorrow will be their dying day vowed the crow oh you are bleeding my general ironbeak was glad he had been alone when sister may attacked him it would not do for his fighters to see their leader vanquished by a small female mouse he shook wood from his talon yaah it is nothing a scratch as you say my mangiz tomorrow will be the dying day of these earthcrawlers post sentries at the eaves and watch for quickbill and his brothers bringing in supplies dawn was long past at the foot of the high cliffs matthias and the searchers had reached the cliffs after dark and ever since daybreak they ranged far and wide everywhere they were faced with sheer inward curving expanses nowhere was there a way up to the plateau it was just before mid morn ing when matthias sat on a small mound with basil and cheek the old hare shook his ears mournfully bollywoggled thafs what we are old lad flummicated blow me theres no way to the top of that cliff unless we sprout wings we need a big ladder thaf d be better than wings cheek sniggered impudently and ducked basils paw jabez stump marched up with a huge brown owl waddling behind him matthias meet sir arry the muse the owl bowed gravely and blinked his enormous eyes matthias bowed courteously in return good morning sir harry i am called matthias warrior of redwall this young otter is cheek by name and nature last but hot least allow me to present basil stag hare retired scout and foot fighter basil made an elegant leg ah yservice sah but why are you called the muse the owl struck an artistic stance why pray do you suppose im master of poetry and prose no equal have i in field or wood no creature a smidgeon a fraction as good and if you need a poet why heres one to choose this owl sir harry the muse oh bravo bravo sir well said basil applauded him loudly matthias leaned on his sword well said indeed unfortunately we are not looking for a poet at die moment sir harry the owl blinked in a dignified manner then tell me what you need someone to perform a deed a mummer perhaps or a singer of songs a champion a lighter of wrongs a companion maybe to stand at your side for my talents are varied and wide were looking for some creature whos too modest for words haha cheek anticipated basils paw this time and dodged to one side matthias nodded towards the difftop we need someone who can get us up there sir harry preened his feathers averting his eyes from matthias cake have you any cake you didnt talk in rhyme then vhy matthias smiled because this is business verse is for conversation and pleasantry business is business straight speaking matthias spread his paws opening his eyes wide in imitation of the owl business for goodness sake perhaps we can find some cake maybe my friend we will bring to you a shrewcake baked by a shrew at first sir harry looked undecided then he stamped his talons and clacked his hooked beak in approval not bad not bad at all at least it made me smile for a warrior id say quite good you have a certain style matthias sheathed his sword wait here sir ill be back in a short while then we can talk business the warrior mouse set off in search of logalog and his shrews basil cleared his throat noisily and faced sir harry i beg you listen to me im a fellow spirit you see i was once considered a champion poet i just thought youd like to know it cheek tittered and avoided basils paw in the same instant sir harry turned his back and delivered a cutting line i beg i implore you sir stick to being a hare basil twiddled his ears huffily hmph some chaps wouldnt know a rhyme if you chopped it up and served it with custard in a bowl stick to being a hare huh matthias reappeared with logalog the shrew leader was carrying a flat white cake its sides oozed honey and dark specks at its middle were definitely some kind of dried fruit baked into it he presented it to sir harry ј the owl looked it over dubiously he pecked at the cake made small noises of approval then gobbled it up greedily crumbs of shrewcake still dung to his beak as he nodded in satisfaction excellent didnt look like much but it tasted wonderful how many more of these have you got matthias shrugged as many as it takes the guosim are good cooks all they need is a small fire a thin slab of rock and their own ingredients but first i want to know more about that plateau is there a way up of course there is sir harry snorted spraying crumbs over cheek nothing moves around here that i dont know about i watched the fox and his band taking a slave line up there yesterday there are rope ladders on the top they pulled them up so you couldnt follow how many shrewcakes in a batch eighteen logalog told him that many good ill fly up and drop the ladders down but dont ask me to do any more i stay well clear of the toplands normally if s a strange world too much death sir harry did a short ungainly run and took off into graceful flight he cirded and wheeled then flew up to theclifftop logalog called the shrews together issuing orders to the two on cooking duty basil and matthias marshalled the rest into lines ready for the ascent jess squirrel watched the top anxiously look out stand back here come the rope ladders she reported bumping and unfurling their way down the cliff face the twin ladders unravelled stopping just short of the place where cheek stood jess sprang on to one scuttling up with all the agility of a champion climber calling out as she went wait there ill go to the top and make sure all is secure sir harry came winging down he stood counting the shrewcakes as the cooks laid them on the grass to cool satisfied the total was correct he turned to matthias our business is concluded youve paid me what im due the journey ahead is perilous good fortune go with you jess waved all clear from the top matthias and logalog mounted the rope ladders and began to climb good luck and good earing to you sir harry the warrior mouse called back i hope we meet again the poetic owl bit into a shrewcake he burned his tongue on the hot liquid honey but carried on eating and muttering those that venture upward are only the brave and insane though i hate to predict from the path that youve picked i doubt that well meet again matthias was too far up the rope ladder to hear he was intent on reaching the plateau regardless of what lay in store foremole and his crew erected a barrier across the corridor next to the firstfloor dormitory the industrious creatures had brought lots of special mole equipment with them and they began laying a surprise for any intruders who ventured down the spiral staircase towards the barricade foremole smiled and chuckled as he supervised yurr jarge lay it on goodneavy across yon stairs rooter youm sprinkle aplenty stonedust oer the top hurr slap er on gaffer doant be stingy with it ho arr oid dearly loik to see anybeast put paw or daw atop o that liddle lot shaking with glee the moles stood back to admire their work the bottom six steps had been liberally smeared and coated with a thick layer of blackmole tunnel grease and rockslide burgoo mixture a combination which often proved invaluable to tunnelling moles when they encountered immovable stones over the top of this was sprinkled a fine layer of sandstone dust to the casual eye it looked exactly like a normal sandstone stair fine blackened tripwires had been stretched across the stairwell on the seventh and eighth steps immediately in front of the barrier facing the stairs two green saplings were fixed in wall torch brackets bent back and held by a restraining rope between them was tied an old blanket loaded with a mixture of stones soil and a special vegetable compound mainly stinkwort and wild garlic pounded together with dogs mercury plant foremole covered his nose as he patted the huge catapult gently ahurr hurr wem woant ave to lissen for em after mis rooter wiped tears of merriment from his eyes boi okey we woant eell smell em a gudd days march off hurt hurr outside on the grass in front of the abbey constance was covering for the mole activities with a decoy any creature who could twirl a sling or fire an arrow was brought out to help ironbeak and mangiz had come out onto the bell tower roof with some rooks they basked in the warm morning sun watching the pathetic attempts of the fighting squads below ambrose spike marched up and down in fine military fashion with baby rollo in tow twirling a tiny sling right troops heres the drill i want to see how many decent archers and slingthrowers we can raise baby rollo echoed the last words of each phrase flingthrowerse can raise now when i give the command fire and sling away at the bell tower but mind keep an eye on those missiles what goes up must come down go up mus come down be careful you dont get a stone on your head or an arrow in your paw narrow in ypaw just a moment sister may point that arrow the other way please marm otherwise youll end up shooting yourself in the nose shooten inner noses ambrose raised his paw redwall defence volunteers ready aim fire most of the stones and arrows did not go even a quarter of the way up the bell tower they fell short clattering off the solid masonry of redwall abbey general ironbeak was amused at the puny efforts of the creatures below he sat enjoying the spectacle while his birds danced jibingly upon the roof cawing and cackling insultingly yawa hey earthcrawlers were up here qnvhawhaw what a bunch of ninnies look at that old mouse hes slung himself on his back cahaha please shoot me look im standing with my wings spread to make an easy target rakkachak see that baby mouse he tossed a rock up and it came down right between his ears ironbeak paced the stone guttering hopping neatly on to a gargoyle spout fools why do they waste their energy like this mangiz who knows my general maybe it is anger at the death of the sparrows which drives them to do this ha idiots some too young others too old none trained in the way of the warrior true ironbeak there is only the big stripedog who is dangerous how can they hope to defeat us like this kaah you worry too much mangiz let them waste their energy it is a fine summer day and the sun will grow hotter we will stay here and let them try to redouble their efforts when they are tired out we will strike i have a plan listen my fighters when you see me spread my wings then dive as fast as you can and go in pairs kill if you must but try to pick one or two up i want to see what the others do if we are holding some of them hostages maybe then they will see it is no use trying to defy general iron bong boom clang bongggggg the matthias and methuselah bells directly beneath the bell tower roof tolled out vigorously the noise was deafening to ironbeak and his birds separated from the bells by only a single layer of slates taken completely off guard they flapped off in all directions cawing loudly below in the belfry cornflower and mrs churchmouse heaved and tugged furiously on the bellropes their paws leaving the floor at each recoil bongdingboomclangbangbong ironbeak was last to leave the roof he tried calling to his warriors but his voice was lost in the clanging melee with his head resounding to the metallic cacophony through to his very beaktip the raven flapped off heavily into the air john churchmouse clapped ambrose upon the back thatll teach em to laugh at our army eh my old spike constance opened the abbey door come on inside im dosing the door now i hope we gave foremole and his crew time to set their surprise up with his head still ringing from the bells ironbeak flew under the eaves to the roofspace in a black rage mangiz take four with you and see if you can pick up any lone stragglers outside the rest of you follow me get that roof trapdoor open quickly well fly inside to the upper gallery and beat them to the stairs beat what chairs chief the crow had not recovered his hearing properly ironbeak buffeted him flat with a hefty wing blow i said beat them to the stairs antbrain now get that trapdoor up and follow me halfway across great hall abbot mordalfus bumped into constance the badger glanced up dust she exclaimed theyre opening up the ceiling trapdoor quick clear the hall let s get upstairs by the way abbot well done with the bells as they pounded up the stairs the abbot called to constance i thought the bells were your idea i knew nothing of it until i heard them ringing well whoever it was they struck just the right note hahaha both parties reached the barricade area at virtually the same time the red wallers stopped behind the barricade ironbeak could not fly on the spiral stairwell so he came hopskipping round the stairs in front of his fighters and hit the first tripwire unable to stop himself and being jostled from behind he injured his dignity and his bottom by hying to pull back and slipping heavily upon the grease it was utter confusion feathers beaks claws and wings massed in an insane jumble as the warrior birds tried to stay upright on the curving stairway they slithered and bumped slid and collided slipped and cracked wings talons and heads together black slimy grease pounded into a gritty porridge and the stonedust was everywhere each time a bird tried to regain its balance the situation worsened yggah leggo youre pulling me over gerroff youre all slimy whoops yafcfairr youre breakin me wing get your greasy claws off me take that yugg muy beaksh fulluv greash on the other side of the barrier the redwallers danced with glee they imitated the scorn the birds had heaped on them from the bell tower roof cawhawhaw what a bunch of ninnies whaf s the matter cant you stand on your own two legs ill say he cant his pals standing on them for him ha ha ho ho come and getus were over here its not far to walk yurr ello greasybeak ow do you loik a taste o molegrease foremole waved a sharp knife aloft geodown flat naow gennelbeasts yurr she goos he severed the catapult rope with a single slash chaos was added to confusion the huge slingload shot forward flattening birds who were trying to stand rocks soil and rotting vegetable matter pounded in a torrent upon the floundering birds the evilsmelling compound enveloped them completely defeated the birds slithered messily up the stairwell ironbeak tried to spit the evil concoction out as he thudded and bumped his way up sometimes slipping back a stair often falling heavily against the walls all around him his warriors suffered the same predicament floundering cursing and skidding they beat an ignominious retreat with the laughter of the redwallers ringing in their heads hahaha wash that little lot off hope youve got a birdbath up there hohoho heeheehee i suspect foul play ironbeak supported himself against the wall yaggah youve signed your death warrants he threatened the moment you set paw outside well be waiting on the rooftops you will be slain without mercy yah go and boil your beak general pongo it was a long hot day in the crowded trench the suns rays baked through the covering of boughs as slaves and slavers alike tossed and turned in the cramped conditions only stonefleck sat calm and motionless slagar wiped his paw round under the silken face mask if it gets any hotter well roast maybe we should have tried to cross the river before dawn eh rat you would have been caught out on the open water in daylight that means death slagar scratched moodily in the sandy soil your mob jt had better be ready as soon as the sun sets stoneflecks expression did not change they will be mattimeo moved restlessly in his sleep dreams of the dark forest they had left echoed through his mind matthias and his friends ate as they marched across the plateau with the shrews logalog pointed out the slavers tracks nice and clear still travelling due south orlandos face was grim aye the fox didnt suppose wed be following him basil shaded his eyes i say that looks like a gloomy old forest were heading towards any more shrewcake left jess absentmindedly passed him one its a pine wood i dont like the look of it nor do i jabez stump agreed just a feelin in my spikes i spose but it looks as if if s sittin there awaitin for us cheek laughed nervously ha ha old doomngloom funny i havent got a feelin in my spikes maybe cos i dont have any basil slapped him heartily on the back thaf s the spirit cheek mboy chin in chest out good straight back and a stiff upper lip wot look out pine trees here we come the woods looked deceptively dose even though they stepped out briskly it was past noon when the party arrived at the beginning of the pine fringe logalog called for cooks to make a meal well eat and rest awhile here because we wont be stopping once we get among those trees well do a straight march through until were dear of them is that all right with you matthias good idea logalog a rest and some food will set us up nicely and well be fresh for the march a short while later they formed up into dose marching order weapons at the ready they set off into the trees with logalog and matthias up front while orlando and basil guarded the rear the first thing that struck them was the absence of daylight filtering through the thick foliage of the dosegrowing pines then the complete awesome silence of the place no use trying to look for tracks among these thick pine needles on the ground and that strong scent from the trees blocks out everything logalogs voice was muted and hollow waaah look up there logalog grabbed the wideeyed shrew who had called out what are you shouting about skeletons bones cant you see them hanging in the trees its a warning wed better go back orlando came rushing forward bones are bones shrew nobeast is turning back they cant bite you see the badger whirled his axe and crashed it with stunning force deep into a tree trunk the reverberation of the mighty mow caused bones to come clattering down to earth orlando tugged his warblade free dead bones never harmed anybeast now get marching suddenly a series of earsplitting screams pierced the stillness and the trees about them began shaking as if moved by a mighty wind several shrews fell cut down by sharp wooden lances matthias dodged to one side as a lance buried itself in the ground by him help heeeeelp cheek gave a strangled cry and began rising swiftly into the trees hauled up on a thin braided noose looped expertly around his body logalog acted swiftly he fitted a stone to his sling whirling it he loosed it among the lower branches a mall thin creature painted all over with green and black vegetable dyes fell senseless to the earth the trees were five with hundreds of other creatures chattering and creaming swinging nooses and jabbing downward with sharp wooden lances basil plucked up a fallen spear and hurled it back matthias crouched drawing his sword as jess squirrel bounded up jess theyre some kind of treedimbers cant you do anything the little savages they dont seem to have any language just screaming and growling theres hundreds of em matthias and they mean to kill us the warrior mouse swung his blade at one of the painted ones who had ventured too low worst thing we could do is to make a run for it besides theyve got cheek the shrews are holding them off with slingstones but that wont last orlando thundered past them roaring he struck trees left and right with his axe jarring the savage beasts out of the branches shrew daggers made short work of them but for every painted one that fell it seemed there were ten to take its place the air rang with the snapping of branches and the screams of the painted horde above it all cheek could be heard sobbing loudly help save me basil dont leave me heeeelp the old hare was leaping and kicking out with his long dangerous limbs anybeast that got too dose was knocked out instantly chin up cheek old lad im doin me best he called encouragingly amid the rain of javelins that hissed down and the stones that whizzed up into the pines jess squirrels teeth began to chatter madly her eyes grew red with battle light and she was far bigger than any of the strange attackers savages cannibals tree freaks she shouted here matthias theres only one way to settle this i think ive spotted their leader that little brute over there look at him screaming and dancing away tike a mad thing hes sending another lot in against us im sure thafs the chief lend me your sword theres only one thing this crazy tribe will understand grabbing the sword jess swung skilfully aloft she was like a dusty red streak of lightning any foebeast standing in her way was hacked aside the painted leader saw her coming he screamed at the others and pointed to jess but she bulled her way through scattering the painted attackers like ninepins the leader hesitated a second to see if she had been brought down that seconds wait cost him dear as he launched himself off the bough jess landed next to him she seized him by the tail and hauled him roughly back grasping him by the ears jess gave a strong heave and held him kicking and dangling then she swung the sword in a glittering arc shouting redwall redwall the savage chief held fast by the ears with the great sword flashing in front of his eyes gave one loud piercing squeal immediately all activity halted the small green and black painted beasts crowded the branches and packed the boughs uncertain of what to do one or two of the bolder ones began edging forward until jess swung the sword as if to strike the captive leader gave a series of angry screams so they fell back and remained still basil paced up and down using a broken lance as a swagger stick quick thinkin jess that stopped the tittle devils ydeserve a mention in despatches for that wot jess glared about her fiercely it wouldnt do any good mentioning any tiling to this horde of hooligans they dont have any recognizable language screams and squeals are their only way of communication how do we get out of this if s like having a serpent by the tail basil turned to matthias shes right y know were caught in a bloomin old standoff the moment she lets that chap go well have the whole silly tribe down on our heads matthias had been thinking furiously he whispered to logalog before shouting up to jess see if you can make them understand that we want to trade their leader for cheek leave the rest to me ive got an idea and with a bit of luck it might work jess went into a series of mimes she pointed at cheek then pointed to the ground holding the leader at paws length she let the sword hang loose by her side the performance was repeated several times before the leader realized what she meant screeching and growling he pointed at cheek then to himself when theyre both free what then orlando whispered to matthias weve broken the standoff but they wont let us walk unharmed through their territory there was a clicking scratching sound from the shrews surrounding logalog matthias watched anxiously until logalog winked at him all was ready matthias took a deep breath stay dose together when we have to move try not to turn your backs on the painted tribe right jess let their chief free theyre releasing cheek the young otter scrambled free of the rope and made a hasty decent bumping and tripping he half tell half climbed out of the tree jess gave the leader a slight push and vaulted neatly down returning the sword to matthias there was a pause as the maddened creatures bunched to attack logalogalogalog the shrew leader leapt forward with a blazing pinewood torch in either paw grinning and showing his teeth he made as if to touch the heavy pines that oozed resin all round him for the first time the painted ones showed fear they chattered and screeched wildly bounding high into the trees at the sight of fire logalog shook the torches in their direction haha desperate measures call for desperate remedies my friends he called youre frightened of the flames arent you one move and ill burn your forest and you with it matthias orlando and basil started the column marching south come on logalog matthias urged i think they understand what we mean jabez cheek get those extra torches from the guosim and stay close to logalog dont let the fire go out backing and shuffling they made their way southeast through the dark pinewoods grateful for the light of the torches progress was slow matthias could not see the painted ones but he knew they were in the trees above following every step of the way night had fallen by the time they had made their way out of the pines to the shores of a great river there was plenty of wood about at the forest edge so logalog and his shrews made a huge bonfire laying in a good supply of wood to last until dawn the strange tribe of painted ones had retreated back into their pine forest but matthias took no chances sentries were posted a meal was prepared then they sat about on the bank discussing the days events while deciding how to cross the river the next day further south down the river mattimeo and his friends sat at the center of a huge log raft surrounded by slavers two thick ropes connected the ferry to the far shore slagar watched them rise and dip in the waters your rats pull strong and well stonefleck we will soon be across the deadpan expression did not leave stoneflecks face i have more fighters at my command than leaves on the trees fox look behind you on the shore over there your pursuers have made it through the pinewoods they must be brave and resourceful we will see just how brave on the morrow my army could do with a bit of fun slagar gazed into the darkened waters thats if they make it across the river the confines of cavern hole became oppressive to john churchmouse although his wife actually enjoyed the close community chatting with cornflower and looking after baby rollo preparing breakfast with the brothers and sisters john slipped out quietly his recording books and pens in a satchel over his shoulder he slid past constance who was sleeping on the stairs crossed great hall and installed himself on a corner window ledge it was a peaceful little niche where he often sat to write and morning sunlight flooded in warming his face john opened his recording book as he gazed out at a corner of the orchard watching three magpies flap off heavily until they were out of his vision by the fur those cheeky birds had a nerve occupying the abbey roofspaces and now filching supplies from the very orchard that the redwallers tended so lovingly the mood for writing left john he dosed the book and climbed down from the sill help would be needed in the kitchens there was a disturbance at the top of the stairs between great hall and cavern hole john broke into a run the satchel bumping at his side the crow they called mangjz bowled him flat as he flapped off into the air towards the upper galleries constance blundered into john and tripped she sat up shaking her paw at the bird scum kidnapper you filthy brute she shouted john stood up dusting his habit off whats happened constance what is the matter bad news im afraid john youd better come down into cavern hole this concerns you the churchmouse followed the badger anxiously the creatures who were up and about gathered round constance as she flung three scraps of material down upon the table look at this the abbot picked them up scraps of material what are they constance ground her teeth together angrily pieces of cornflower and mrs churchmouses aprons and a fragment of baby rollos little habit theyve been captured by the birds abbot mordalfus shook his head in disbelief impossible surely they were here last night werent they did anybeast see them foremole shrugged ma ap but maybe not oi niver thought of alooken for em john churchmouse dashed his satchel to the floor my wife captured by those filthy birds where have they got her he made a dash for the stairs and was stopped by winifred and ambrose the churchmouse struggled furiously let me go theres no telling what those murdering savages will do to her john churchmouse be still ordered mordalfus come and sit by this table sir come on do as i say you arent doing anybeast a bit of good behaving like mis let us hear what constance has to say john looked up in suprise it was seldom that the abbot spoke harshly to any creature the fight went out of him and he allowed ambrose to lead him to a chair mordalfus turned to the badger constance tell us all you know of this incident please father abbot theres not a lot to tell im afraid yesterday cornflower and mrs churchmouse were in the bell tower rollo must have joined them later well when i called all the creatures in and shut the abbey door i musfve locked them out they probably didnt hear me calling theres no entrance to the abbey from the bell tower so they must have tried later to cross the grounds those birds caught them in the open the crow said that they took them to the roofspaces general ironbeak wants to see us outside at noon sitting in a corner of the dimly lit roofspace cornflower and mrs churchmouse tried to make themselves as unobtrusive as possible keeping baby rollo quiet and still general ironbeak and his birds had returned from their dust bath on the path outside redwall it had done little good and in the end they had resorted to wallowing in the brackish ditchwater to rid themselves of the sludge which dung to their feathers it was not a great improvement the stench still dung to them ironbeak glared ferociously at his captives yaggah you and your friends will pay dearly for this insult cornflower covered baby rollo with her torn apron you great bully you deserve all you got mangiz had not been caught by the trap on the stairway and he stayed slightly apart from his general turning his beak to avoid the unpleasant odor kraah silence mouse at noon you will get all you deserve you should be pleading with the mighty ironbeak to spare your miserable lives mrs churchmouse eyed the crow with distaste we would never grovel to ruffians like you slay us if you want but you wid never conquer redwall abbey brave words are like empty eggshells you will beg when the time comes mangiz predicted rollo peered out from under the apron genral pongo he said making a face silence keep that small one quiet or we will kill him now oh shut your beak you coward cornflower called out indignantly killing infants is probably about all you scavengers are good for mangiz was about to reply when ironbeak silenced him mangiz enough we do not argue with mousewives mrs churchmouse rummaged in her apron pocket and found some dried fruit she had been using in the kitchens she gave it to baby rollo and sat with her paw about him i wish your matthias were back hed know what to do she whispered he certainly would but dont worry your john and constance and the abbot will see we come to no harm its rollo im concerned about they can do what they like with me as long as they dont harm a hair on that babys head mrs churchmouse stroked rollos tiny ears yes mess him cxyou remember when your mattimeo was this size my tim and tess werent much older and they were a trio of rascals i can tell you cornflower smiled aye but we had happy times with them i hope wherever they are now that theyre safe and well theyll all come marching back up that road one fine day i know it then the enemies of our abbey will rue the day they were born stoneflecks army was indeed a large one mattimeo had never seen so many rats they swarmed through the bushes trees and hillocks of the far shore efficient and silent every rat carried a bow and arrows and they gathered in groups each under a leader who took his orders from stonefleck the commander the captives were secured among the trees but mattimeo could still see the river he sat with tim and auma listening to stonefleck and slagar conversing let us see if your pursuers can make it across the river slagar they are a determined band but they have not met my longtail army yet all they have had to contend with is a few slavers i have a slave line to worry about the cruel one sniffed open warfare is not my business besides you have a mighty army aye and every one of them an expert archer i could deal with those woodlanders using only a quarter of my force huh then why dont you slagar challenged him because i never leave anything to chance are you going to stay and watch just to make sure your enemies get slain no i will carry on south if your army is as good as you boast i should have no need to worry about being followed threedaws form them up into line weve got a full days march ahead mattimeo and his companions were jostled and prodded by vitch say goodbye to your father and his friends mattimeo they will be dead creatures before this day is through the rat taunted him the young mouse did not allow himself to be baited by vitch even though his heart sank at the thought of his father and the rest being caught out on the open water by tiie huge rat army that lay in wait on the shore of the river he took a deep breath and smiled carelessly at the undersized rat your master slagar could not kill my father neither will stonefleck and his vermin the warrior of redwall has proved himself before now against rat armies and he will live to free us when that day comes you and i have a score to settle ill be looking for you vitch as they were herded away through the trees mattimeo allowed himself one last backward glance at the far shore beyond the river shimmering in the morning sunlight though he could not see his father he murmured under his breath martin keep him safe the sounds of axe and sword had been ringing through tile pine fringe since dawn many of the trees at the edge had not been able to take proper root in the loose sandy soil of the banks and some were only half grown orlando swung his mighty axe with long powerful strokes often felling a tree so that it took one of its weaker neighbors down with it matthias had cast his habit aside he slashed and hacked at the branches of each felled tree trimming it so that cheek basil jess and jabez could roll it down to where logalog was in charge of raft construction flugg bring those ropes over here logalog ordered gurn soak that moss well and mix it with soil i want good caulking that wont leak garr i need that trunk over here you others help him there was little the guosim leader did not know about watercraft logalog was a ferry shrew the son of ferry shrews he watched the flow of the river pointing out his course to basil well take a wide sweep upriver then ill bring about in midwater and land us on the other shore somewhere about there see that way well be going due south again basil dipped one ear aye aye capn as you say bear in mind old feller that i wasnt cut out for a nautical career ill have to have a substantial meal first no use bein watersick on an empty tummy wot it was early noontide before the raft lay completed in the shallows logalog folded his paws and shook his head bit rough matthias best i could do at short notice matthias passed him apples and shrewcake shes a stout raft logalog i couldnt ask for better i know youll use all your skills to get us safely across what are you so worried about young cheek the otter stroked his dry nose if s er well er dyou see well if s the water matthias ive always been a bit frightened of it oh the odd stream and woodland pool arent too bad but look at the size of that old river i never saw anything so big and fastflowing in mossflower basil flung an apple core into the river haw haw well ive heard everythin now a bally otter whos frightened of rivers curl my whiskers thaf s a good un now now basil jess chided the scoffing hare youre not too fond of the water yourself if s bad form to make fun of another creature who feels the same basil relented and flung a paw around cheek righto point taken jess here young otter mlad what say you and i stay together in the middle of the raft we can hang on to each other and get into a fine old blue funk together eh jabez stump trundled aboard the raft ah well we cant hang about here all day theres a river to cross you comin aboard warrior matthias sheathed his sword and leapt onto the floating logs keep your heads down when we reach the other side no telling whaf s waiting over there he warned logalog grasped the forked branch which served as a tiller all aboard cast off on shore poles ready riverward bring her round steady as she goes were under way the raft bobbed and swayed out into the current blue waters reflecting the skies above rushed and danced to white foamy peaks spraying into the breeze the eyes of stoneflecks rat army watched eagerly from the far bank as the little craft started its journey towards them general ironbeak landed skilfully on the path in front of the main abbey door he tucked his wings away neatly parading up and down with a swaggering gait the door swung open and constance and the abbot stepped outside followed by john churchmouse the abbot nodded civilly good afternoon do you wish to go inside ironbeak cocked his head on one side eyeing them boldly yflggar what i have to say can be said out here earthcrawlers i hold the upper claw today maybe if you had killed my fighters and me on the stairs yesterday instead of playing your silly little games you would have been the victors it is too late now we meet on my terms mordalfus tucked his paws into the wide habit sleeves then speak what is it you want of us complete surrender old mouse i am sorry but that is impossible the abbot replied nothing is impossible if you hold dear the lives of your creatures we have lost brothers and sisters before now aye but that would have been without choice the general pointed out step forward a bit and look up to the rooftop of this redstone house the three friends walked out onto the path shading their eyes they looked up ironbeak gave a harsh cry and waved one wing the three captives were forced to the roof ege where they could be seen john churchmouse groaned aloud constance stood dose to him and whispered courage john well get them back for you trust your abbot let him do the talking the tiny figures high above swayed in the breeze skirts billowing out as they kept hold of baby rollo who was waving cheerily karra high isnt it general ironbeak preened his wing feathers as he spoke oh not to a bird but to an earthcrawler it is as if your head were bumping the clouds if s a long way down too if you dont hit the sides or bounce off a few gutters who knows you might even smash through one of those low roofs imagine all that happening to a baby mouse there wouldnt be much left to tell the tale when he hit the ground john churchmouse bit his lip until the blood trickled to his chin the abbot disguised his true feelings and shrugged carelessly then as far as i am concerned you have our surrender but not completely unfortunately i am only the voice of one and this abbey belongs to us all not just me we must have a little time to consider your offer then a vote will have to be taken ironbeak raked the path fiercely with his talons i will have your complete surrender now the abbot sat upon the path plucking a blade of grass he sucked it shaking his head i am very sorry but it is not my decision throw the captives from the roof if you must all our creatures are not present and it is not possible to give you a firm decision right now we need time to discuss this and take a ballot ironbeak kicked gravel left and right realizing that if the captives were slain his bargaining power was lost you say you need time how much time earthcrawler he demanded oh at least three sunsets that is too long how do i know you are not planning something the abbot looked old and frail and he smiled disarmingly general you give us too much credit what could we do against you in the space of three sunsets we are not warriors we cannot fly like you birds we are only earthcrawlers besides you hold the captives what better insurance of our good behaviour the raven signalled mangiz to have the captives taken into the roofspaces two sunsets not three he clacked his beak decisively two sunsets and no longer mordalfus stood up and bowed gravely thank you ironbeak you shall have our answer two sunsets from now the raft was proving successful though the water hammered it hard in midcurrent it held together admirably logalog was in his element manoeuvring the tiller as he shouted out orders above the rush of the waters the long poles they had used for punting were now useless as a means of propelling the craft and they relied upon the steering skills of the shrew leader matthias stood at the forward end scanning the other shore basil and cheek hung on to each other for dear life with jess jabez and orlando near to paw surrounded by shrews who packed the floating deck to its edges they were past the midriver point when matthias made his way across to logalog how is she handling oh fine matthias fine logalog said airily as you can see weve sprung a small leak or two but nothing to worry about ill make for that spot over there if s a curving inlet and the water looks almost still so it must be bypassed by the main center current are you all right not worried about anything not exactly worried just keeping my eyes ears and wits about me matthias admitted that shore looks a bit too peaceful for my liking ha anything that looks peaceful is exactly to my liking stonefleck stood with his back to a rock on the open bank completely disguised by his strange coat in his paws he held a bow with an arrow notched on its string coolly he watched the raft looming larger knowing that his formidable army was waiting bows at the ready for its leader to fire the first arrow basil relaxed his grip on cheek ha were not bad sailors after all young cheek cant you feel the water gettin smoother not so much of that infernal bobbin up and down like a ducks bottom thats as may be basil but i wont feel easy until me young paws are on dry land again the otter said nervously lookit that logalog shrew hes enjoyin it all i bet hell be sorry to leave this raft stand ready with those poles logalog called to the shrews seated at the outboard edges well be into still waters soon a hissing volley of arrows speeding like flighted death cut down the six shrews who stood grasping the poles they toppled lifeless into the water immediately the shore was alive with innumerable rats unleashing arrows one after another into the unprotected creatures on the fiat raft deck taken completely by surprise there was only one course of action open to matthias ducking and dodging flying shafts he yelled overboard everybeast overboard stay on the river side of the raft keep low there was a mass scramble making the raft tilt perilously matthias logalog and jess unfastened their slings all around them the shrews leapt into the water dinging to the side of the raft furthest from the shore the three friends launched slingstones at the attackers but they did little good arrows still poured back at them like spring rain logalog jess get off the raft hurry matthias shouted urgently the squirrel and the shrew did not stop to argue they abandoned the heeling raft and took to the water matthias went last stonefleck looked at the sky twilight was arriving he signalled a ceasefire wait theyre in the water now lefs watch the sport before we open up again but pick off any loose ones that you sight the rat army packed to the waters edge gazing at the bobbing raft an arrowslength away basil spat out a mouthful of river water as he clung to the side of the raft ambushed he said disgustedly where in the name of fur and claw did that mob spring from theyre no slouches with those bows orlando if i could reach them with my battleaxe id show them im no slouch the filthy assassins ouch what was that there were shouts and screams from the shrews ow ive been bitten ouch ow me too owooh im bleeding matthias gritted his teeth silence be still its probably just a shoal of small fish jess changed places until she was by matthias owen its like sitting on a beehive she complained cheeks got more sense look hes still on the raft a shrew who had been bitten tried hauling himself out of the water he took an arrow between the eyes another shrew tried swimming away from the raft two arrows sank him the rats were sniping from the bank at anything that popped up or moved cheek lay sprawled flat in the center of the raft ignoring matthias come off that raft cheek youll be shot matthias said sharply no fear lie low and ding tight thats what im going to do im not going into that river basil sucked up water and spat it at the young otter you tittle nuisance come off that raft sir off i say he ordered matthias felt tiny teeth bite his tail he kicked out and was bitten again leave him basil lefs think of some way out of this the raft is drifting towards those rats duck theyre firing again more volleys of arrows followed for the first time in a long while stonefleck allowed himself a tight smile of satisfaction weve got them theyre sailing towards us keep up the arrows those who arent eaten will be shot i want no captives were not slavers leave that to slagar jabez stump was being bitten on his unprotected paws i cant stand much more of this the hedgehog winced whats to be done hold the raft tight logalog called out try backing water we might just tow it off into the main current again and get washed away from this lot they tried as hard as they could and the raft backed off slightly if s heavy going cheek will you get off that raft were towing your weight down here matthias said crossly cheek lay flat dinging tighter to the deck as arrows whizzed over him in flights no go way leave me alone orlando lost his temper he took the battleaxe by its head and made a mighty sweep at cheek with the long handle darkness had practically fallen and the young otter did not see the axe handle craning it struck him a blow and pushed him off into the water with a loud splash yah gerroff you great stripedo splash cheek could not deny his birthright he was an otter through and through as skillfully as any fish he cut through the water surrounding the rah appearing alongside basil the hare looked at him suspiciously youre chewing young master cheek where are you hidin the food cheek smacked his lips little fishes the rivers swarmin with em mere must be millions taste lovely though id have got into the water sooner if id known wasnt eoin to be afraid and all mis food was here with mat he disappeared beneath the surface and began filling his stomach with the finny delicacies cheek was biting back on shore stonefleck rapped out orders to one of his captains light some flaming arrows shoot at the raft hurry or theyll paddle it out of our reach tell the others to get the ferry going see if we can get doser the rest of you keep firing the rat captain looked quesnoningly at stonefleck but surely theyll be eaten by the fishes stonefleck fired off an arrow before replying if s the otter i forgot about that one hell eat those fish like a pig at acorns but theres far too many fish for him to eat chief the waters alive with em the captain argued fool once those fish sense theres an otter in the water theyll stay away from that area then those creatures will be able to paddle the raft out into the mainstream current i want to finish it here tonight not in the morning a nights march down the bank now get about your business matthias heaved a sigh of relief whew at least those fish arent biting so much cheek popped up beside him yum yum youve got me to thank for that orlando ducked him back under with a big blunt paw stop gabbing and keep scoffing you to thank indeed you mean youve got my axe handle to thank and dont think you wont taste it if you dont keep those fishes away young otter the night sky was cut by the light of a flaming arrow which shot through the dark to bury itself in the side of the raft jess put it out by squirting a mouthful of water at it fire arrows matthias she remarked look i can see by the light of their fire that theyre launching a raft matthias redoubled his efforts hurry everybeast kick out as hard as you can cheek gripped a trailing rope in his teeth and swam strongly with it the raft doubled its speed arrows zinged all around them as the rats leant over the rails of their own ferry raft keep down keep pulling keep paddling orlando yelled theyre coming after us as he shouted a shrew next to him let go and floated away transfixed by an arrow stonefleck was on the ferry raft firing arrow after arrow dont let them get away he exhorted his army get the poles come on get pushing with those poles fire keep after them with superior numbers and long poles the rat ferry drew closer to the raft stonefleck waved to the shore no more fire arrows he ordered you might hit us weve got them now logalog spat into the water did you hear that guosim kick now kick for your lives the woodlanders raft pulled away fractionally but stonefleck urged his rats to greater efforts with their long poles the two vessels were separated only by a thin margin of river stonefleck and a few chosen rats stood outside the rails of the ferry preparing to jump from one craft to the other the light of victory gleamed in stoneflecks normally impassive eyes matthias pulled himself up and saw what was happening it looks as if theyre going to board us he said gloomily orlando heaved himself from the water and stood dripping on the deck of the raft waving his battleaxe come on rats lefs see what youve got inside your heads he taunted an arrow from the rat ferry struck orlando in his paw he pulled it out contemptuously snapping it easily he flung it at stonefleck youll have to do better than that to stop me ratface he called suddenly the raft sped off downriver on the rushing current the rat ferry stopped stockstill throwing stonefleck and several others into the water hurriedly the rats dragged their leader and the others back aboard stonefleck twanged his wet bowstring and spat water why didnt somebeast untie the ferry towropes pull us back to shore well have to follow along the bank a ragged cheer arose from the shrews raft as the friends disappeared into the night on die rushing water that evening a group sat around the table in cavern hole discussing general ironbeaks ultimatum the reaction was angry and indignant who does he think he is redwall isnt conquered mat easy we beat them once we can do it again aye but this time ironbeak has the hostages hell kill them if we dont surrender hurr hem a crafty owd burdbag thafn the abbot rapped the table silence please we have no time to sit about arguing what i need is some sensible suggestions let us review the position the raven has the hostages and no matter how we try to buy time or debate hell kill them eventually make no mistake about that i tried to bluff him today possibly i succeeded but it wont last listen even if it meant the loss of just one life i would have to surrender the abbey we cannot have three deaths on our heads it is against all our principles winifred the otter thumped the table with her tail play the villain at his own game then whaf s the name for it er subterfuge that s it well use subterfuge every creature sat up bright and attentive when there was no response to winifreds suggestion they slumped back wem gotter be athinken ard rasslin wi uz brains foremole urged more silence followed surely somebody must have a glimmer of a plan winifred said sadly here comes supper lefs think while we eat the abbot suggested good idea ambrose spike agreed sometimes i thinks the brainbox and the stomach bag is joined up someow hoho i say they done us proud acorn salad and spiced applendamson pie pie thats it they turned to stare at john churchmouse i was trying to remember the name of those black and white birds that are with ironbeak its pie magpie the abbot put aside his platter go on john think hard have you got an idea john scratched his whiskers in frustration oh if only i could remember what it was its stuck right between the tips of my ears hmph its no good ive forgotten now ambrose supped october ale noisily from a beaker pity i thought you was goin to come up with a plan to get your missus an cornflower an that baby down off the roof the roof the magpies thafs it john churcnmouse banged his paw down on the table squelching a wedge of pie by mistake of course i saw those three magpies only this morning robbing our orchard and flying up to the eaves those birds are ironbeaks supply line he needs them to bring in food and if we could capture em we could do a swap winifred said through a mouthful of salad three magpies for three hostages good idea john burr aye vittles be of more use to burdbags than ostages otherwise theyd be astarved from unger foremole added constance rapped the table right lef s get a proper plan organized what we propose is to capture the three magpies and exchange them for the hostages no army can survive without supplies and ironbeak knows this he wouldnt be able to keep his followers here if they were starving this way we can save redwall and get the hostages back but how do we capture the magpies the abbot held up a paw used to be the abbey fishermouse before i was abbot could we not snare them with fishing nets weve got lots of big nets well said abbot but magpies are not fishes how would you snare them into nets constance asked ambrose spike poked his snout out of the ale beaker find out where they get their food supplies and put down bait i think they get their supplies from our orchard john churchmouse said licking pie from his paw little sister may was highly indignant im certain they do father abbot only today i saw them from the infirmary window those three dreadful birds stealing from our orchard anything that falls ripe from a bush or tree they cany off if s theft thats what it is durty ol burdbags oi was awonderen whurr all they ripe strawbrries was agoin exactly mr foremole sister may wagged a reproving paw at one time it was only you and mr stag hare who used to steal them but those three birds gracious me youd think we were growing strawberries just for their benefit i watched them guzzle down a great load before carrying off as much as they could with them disgraceful foremole covered his eyes with a huge digging paw hurr hurr sister oi was only atestin they berries it were mainly young mattimeo an that timntess wi thurr squirrel pal as scoffed most o them hurr hurr young roguers youre right foremole john churchmouse sniffed i only wish they were still here to do it i for one wouldnt grudge them the odd strawberry from the patch there were murmurs of agreement from all little sister may blew her nose loudly well talk like this isnt getting many dishes washed ive got an idea suppose we gather the ripest strawberries and sprinkle mem with some sort of sleeping potion then we could put them in one place in the orchard and lie in wait with the nets sister may im shocked and surprised at you abbot mordalfus shook his head in amazement what a good idea but im not sure we know enough about sleeping potions thafs the sort of thing the masked fox used on us you can look to villains for that sort of thing but we are only simple abbey dwellers leave it to me father abbot little sister may smiled sweetly i have enough herbs berries and roots in my infirmary cupboard to lay a horse out flat oh it will be exciting ive always wanted to try my paw at sleeping potions foremole tugged his snout in admiration youm a proper liddle fiend an no mistake marm oill escort you up to firmary to pick up your potions an suchloik ambrose spike crooked a paw at the abbot follow me ive got your big nets stowed away in my cellars mobilized by fresh hope the abbey dwellers went about their tasks up in the roofepaces cornflower rocked the sleeping baby rollo upon her lap as she and mrs churchmouse conversed in hushed tones look bless him hes snoring away like my mattimeo used to when he was a baby she said becoming sad i dont think theres a moment of one day since mattimeos been gone when i havent thought of him first i worry then i tell myself if be all right because matthias will have probably found him then go back to worrying men i tell myself he may have escaped oh mrs churchmouse if only they were all babies again like rollo aye those were the best times my m and tess were a right pair of little scallywags i can tell you mr churchmouse and i never got a winks steep that first season they were bom all they wanted to do was play the whole night long dyou suppose that the raven will really have us thrown from the roof asked mrs churchmouse apprehensively hell do what he has to mrs churchmouse im afraid of him but i dont care what happens as long as that horrible bird doesnt get redwall that would be the end the churchmouse stroked baby rollo he had stopped snoring and started sucking his paw what hope is there for this poor little mite no mummy and a prisoner too she wondered cornflower sighed the roofspace was dark and chilly with night draughts sweeping in under the eaves all around them the black birds perched in the rafters and it was difficult to tell whether they were awake or sleeping she wondered where matthias was and what he would be doing at this moment thinking of her husband the redwall warrior gave her courage again dont you fret mrs churchmouse our friends in the abbey will have made plans to free us youll see lef s try and get a bit of sleep here well share my old shawl clouds scudded across the moon on their way across the night sky while a million stars twinkled over the gently swaying forest mattimeo was awakened by the sound of the night guards bageye and skinpaw were on duty and they walked past the sleeping captives conversing in low earnest tones the young mouse could not hear what was said though he strained his ears to catch any hint as to their eventual destination marti are you awake only just tess keep your voice down the rest are still asleep is anything the matter the churchmouse asked yes and no he replied i was trying to hear what tihe guards were talking about theyve seemed very edgy since we left the forest and hills where stonefleck and his rats live thaf s strange i noticed the same thing last night before we camped down here theyre all so silent and uneasy even slagar mattimeo raised his head taking in the scene around him the earth was flat dry and dusty no trees grew and there was little sign of any grass shrubs or greenery it was a dusty brown desolation stretching out before them i tell you tess i dont like it myself this far south mossflower country is very odd listen you cant even hear a single bird singing what sort of land is it where even the birds cannot live young jube the hedgehog stirred in his sleep he whimpered and turned restlessly tess passed her paw gently over his headspikes and he settled down into a quiet slumber poor little jube she said sympathetically he used to be so confident that his father would rescue him and treated the whole thing as if he were only along with us for part of the journey im worried about him hes so thin and sadlooking these days mattimeo smiled at the churchmouse you sounded just like your mum then tess always fussing and worrying over some young one youre right though jube isnt his old self anymore in fact none of us are were much thinner and older im not surprised after all weve been through since that night of the feast at redwall tess looked at her habit it was torn dusty and stained it all seems so long ago i think weve grown up a lot since then ah well the main thing is that were still together weve made friends too look at auma i couldnt imagine life without her and jube anymore slavers and captives alike began wakening mattimeo winked at tess and smiled as cheerfully as he could well come through it all you wait and see he said comfortingly ho hum another nice sunny day for a walk eh tess i wonder where old slagar is taking us today nutgathering bcknkking what do you think tess stood up looking a bit more like her old self oh i think wed better just stay with the rest and have a nice ramble she chuckled what about you would you like to play follow my leader or should i say follow my slagar come on mouse pick up your daisy chain and lef s go bageye checked their manacles muttering in a sullen voice huh dont know what you two have got to laugh about orlando waded ashore towing the raft behind him it had been a hard and dangerous night fighting their way out of the main current back into the shallows the crew had poled the raft into a small bay wet and weary they stumbled onto dry land in the pale dawn light shivering after their nightlong ordeal on the swift choppy river v basil slicked water from his long drooping ears whaaw heres one old soldier who wont complain when the sun starts getting hot no chance of a bite o breakfast i suppose matthias dried his sword carefully on a tussock of grass no chance at all old soldier those rats will be dashing along the banks right now hoping theyll catch up with us wed better move fast if we want to stay alive logalog you and cheek tow the raft out a bit the current will carry it away no sense leaving it here as a marker where we came ashore jess jabez would you take the rear and try to cover our tracks from the bank leave them as few clues as possible it may buy us a bit of time jess squirrel bounded up a nearby tree took a quick look around and descended speedily matthias wed better hurry she urged i could see movement in the bushes further up the bank if we stay here much longer were going to have company right jess come on everybody keep me in sight im going to take a curving sweep into these trees then with a bit of luck well circle south and miss the rats hurry now lets get out of he an arrow bedded in the ground it stood quivering a fraction from orlando who kicked it into the river thaf s the trouble with being my size you make a good target lef s run for it the rat advance scout fired a whistling arrow upwards to alert the main body stonetleck turned in its direction theyre trying to head south through the trees follow me well cut them off he set off at a tangent cutting into the woodland to outflank matthias morning sunlight slanted into the trees as swarms of rats ran silently keeping abreast of their leader stonefleck halted on a sloping hillside and listened carefully they were coming nodding to his followers he dropped down behind an oak the rats spread themselves among the other trees notching arrows onto bowstrings he could not have timed it better the woodlanders came hurrying through the forest below looking back over their shoulders to see if they were being pursued stonefleck let fly a shaft at the mouse in the lead hoping to catch him in the side of his neck the mottled rat gave a grunt of disappointment as the arrow pinged harmlessly oft the hilt of a big sword the mouse was carrying slung across his back and shoulders a hail of arrows hit the main party below shrews fell slain and wounded as the mouse in the lead shouted ambush theyre on our right flank follow me they rushed for cover in the protection of the forest to their left stonefleck dashed down the hill after them charge it was a lucky accident that stonefleck tripped over a protruding tree root the rats swarmed past him in a headlong attack only to be met by matthias and orlando the two warriors had taken a temporary stand allowing the rest of their party to get away armed only with bows and arrows the rats could not fire in dose combat orlando took the first two with a cleaving sideways chop of the huge war axe while matthias stepped swiftly from behind a tree and slew a rat who was dashing past turning quickly he took another on the point of his sword orlando thundered into a group of the front runners wielding his axe he scattered them like chaff roaring aloud his battlecry eulaliaaaaa redwalffll matthias was at his side the scything whirling blade cutting a deadly pattern of cold steel amid the rats stunned by the shock of the wild attack the rat horde fell back stonefleck ran up urging them forward rush them theres only two come on they regrouped and dashed in yelling wildly but the two warriors were gone matthias and orlando ran panting into the main party a short distance ahead the warrior mouse was angry why didnt you keep running we would have caught up with you basil shook his head we couldnt not after we heard all the screams and shouts from back there we were about to go back and help you you should have kept going matthias repeated no time to argue now here they come again logalog broke into a run pointing ahead look theres a clearing over that way lef s get to the other side of it and hold them off with our slings stonefleck and his horde were hot on the trail they had covered half the clearing when a deep shrew voice called out sling a rain of hard river pebbles struck the rats felling several and driving the rest back stonefleck grouped his force at the other side of the clearing they stood among the trees and returned fire with arrows screams and cries rang out as the battle raged back and forth shafts going one way stones flying the other basil took charge of the slingers forming them into three ranks first rank sling and reload second rank sling and reload third rank sling and reload he ordered matthias and his friends did as best as they could dodging from tree to tree picking off the odd rat with their slings jess took a brief respite and dropped down by matthias im out of stones have you got many left she asked the warrior mouse hardly any theyre no match for arrows jess look theres more rats arriving by the moment were outnumbered by at least ten to one at least they only have to follow us and pick us off one by one and we cant make a run for it now their firepower is too heavy id hate to die this far from redwall matthias me too jess but theyve got us pinned down now it was a mistake to try and make a stand but theyd have caught us if wed kept running ill have to rack my brains and see if i cant come up with whafs that sparra kill kill kill eccecccceoc queen warbeak and her sparra fighters hurtled into the rats like a winged shower of small beaks and talons jess leapt forward matthias if s warbeak and her sparra folk what are they doing here i dont know but theyll be massacred if we dont help them basil logalog come on chaaaaarge quickbill and his two brothers brightback and diptail had found an easy source of supply for ironbeaks fighters why forage in the woods when mere was a beautiful orchard right in the grounds of the big redstone house with the redwall inhabitants forced to stay indoors the three magpies had grown bold now they did not even bother foraging by night each day they would fly down to the orchard and eat their fill before loading up with supplies to take to the roofspace quickbill was amazed at so much different fruit growing in one place he had never encountered an orchard before hakka the northlands were never like this brothers apples pears plums and look look at those juicy red berries the trio stood around the strawberries on the ground unhurried each seeking out a bigger strawberry than the one his brother was eating they were behaving like naughty young ones raiding the orchard chakka look at this one it is like two stuck together yaah but this berry is more red and shiny see kacha i will eat them all as long as they are fat and juicy the magpies long tails dipped and jerked as they gobbled the strawberries with swift bobbing head movements they carried on comparing berries as they greedily ravaged the welltended strawberry patch suddenly brightback belched then he staggered and fell awkwardly his two brothers cackled aloud at the sight chahaha the red berries are making you too fat to stand brother we will load our bags and fly back up diptail pecked at a berry and missed his beak struck the soil smiling foolishly he flapped his wings and fell flat yakko the red berries are magic i cannot fly he giggled quickbill yawned he lay in the soil flapping his wings against it with a silly grin on his face coohoo look at me im flying led by constance a group of redwallers crept out from behind a buttress at the east corner of the abbey they were carrying nets easy now lef s bag all three at once quickbill was the strongest of the three he saw the shadow of the net spreading over him but he felt unable to do anything about it diptail was in a deep drugged sleep brightback tried to keep his eyes open but they snapped shut the net fell on them trapping the three birds squarely at its center they lay stunned amid the remains of the knockout strawberries little sister may came out from behind the raspberry canes wagging a paw at the sleeping thieves it serves you right i hope you wake with dreadful headaches constance and winifred rolled the magpies tightly in the nets they cant hear you sister constance told her lets get them inside before were spotted pushing and tugging they lugged their feathered hostages inside the abbot dusted off his paws well done my friends what do we do now wait until the appointed time or open negotiations right away constance gave a huge grin she was beginning to enjoy herself allow me father abbot leave it to ambrose and me well go and inform ironbeak that we have three chickens in the bag the rest of you take up your posts at the windows and make sure there are plenty of arrows and spears showing constance and ambrose strolled out in leisurely fashion the badger threw her head back and called up to the roof hey you up there irontrousers or whatever you call yourself get down here i want a word with you ambrose sniggered into his paws i wish basil stag hare was here hed think of some good names to cau that bird there was a short silence then mangiz appeared at the eaves the crow flapped down to a lower roof level are you ready to surrender so early stripedog he asked go and boil your beak featherbag silence earthcrawler my general sent me to speak with you ambrose wrinkled his snout at mangiz listen maggorbrain you just flap back to your chief and tell him that we want to speak to the big fish and not the little worm hurry up now dont stand there gawpin the seer crow was outraged mangiz does not forget an insult hedgepig ambrose smiled cheekily good then heres a few more for you to remember you potbellied crosseyed featherbottomed excuse for a duck now be off with you before i really get goin when the crow had gone ambrose turned to con stance what dyou think stripedog was i a bit too hard on him constance thought for a moment no no on the whole i thought you did quite well hedgepig ironbeak flew out with mangiz and several of the rooks they came down to the lowest roof constance did not mince her words hello there ironbum or is it tinbeak i can never remember anyhow about the three hostages youre holding dont you think if s high time you let them go ironbeak suspected by the badgers tone that something was amiss but he kept up a bold imperious front if you have not come to surrender they will die earthcrawler ambrose wriggled his spikes i knew youd do no good talking politely to that bird constance stopped her teasing now that she had drawn the raven out her tone became harsh and serious listen to me ironbeak we are holding your three magpies prisoner if you harm a single hair of those hostages i will personally drown those birds in our abbey pond is that clear the birds on the roof cawed and cackled in consternation ironbeak silenced them with a wave of his wing you have captured quickbill and his brothers i do not believe it constance moved to the abbey door then i will show you the proof we have cut your supply line you will starve without the magpies constance went indoors a moment later she was dragging out the net with the three magpies inside they say that seeing is believing what do you say to that she called ironbeak peered over the guttering i say that it was very clever of you stripedog but it wul do you no good i will send others out to forage oh as i understand it warriors are warriors not scavengers your fighters could not do the job thats why you had magpies kaahl then we will become scavengers we will take the food from that place you call orchard ambrose pointed to the windows no you wont weve got archers slingthrowers and javelins stationed at the windows facing the orchard it is not as far to shoot from there as it is from the ground to the rooftop send a few of those birds into the orchard now and youll see what we mean whilst ironbeak stood on the roof digesting this information ambrose pointed at the remains of the strawberries lying in the patch shoot there was a twang and hiss from the windows four arrows and two javelins stood quivering among the strawberries ironbeak swallowed hard what do you want constance kept a heavy paw upon the net you know what we want an exchange of hostages what you ask is not possible then your army will starve in the roofspaces she warned we will kill your mice if you do not surrender ironbeak countered and we will kill your magpies this net is weighted with stones they will drown in the pond you are peaceful creatures i know your ways you could not do such a thing constance seized the net in her paws and then began dragging it to the abbey pond your mistake she snarled savagely they may be peaceable creatures badgers are not it will be a pleasure to rid mossflower of this scum i am done with talking the big badger tumbled the net into the shallows revived by the water the three magpie brothers awoke spluttering yflggfl save us ironbeak save us help we will drown trapped in this net ironbeak general save us the birds on the roof danced anxiously around their leader cawing and flapping mangiz whispered something to him the raven general cocked his head towards the crow his bright eye roving across the scene at the pond when mangiz had finished ironbeak spoke in a level voice stop do not drown my magpie brethren they have served me well i will talk terms with you a great cheer arose from the defenders at the window slits constance gave a silent sigh of relief then you agree to our request three in exchange for three ironbeak spread his wings so be it the exchange will take place here in front of this redstone house when the evening bells toll at sunset ambrose exchanged glances with constance let the hostages be freed here and now she proposed ironbeak folded his wings and closed his eyes with finality do not stretch your luck earthcrawlers you have gained a victory the exchange will take place as i say agreed constance hauled the net from the shallows agreed when the birds had flown ambrose shook his head at constance if s some sort of trap i can feel it in me spikes that bird has somethin in mind for us didnt you see him whispering with the crow they were hatching a plan the abbot came out to greet them i agree with ambrose he said they are obviously working out a trap you did well it was a good bluff constance the big badger looked grim it was no bluff father abbot i would drown a dozen like these in the net if our abbey or our creatures were threatened we will wait and see what they have planned for sunset queen warbeak and her sparrows stood little chance against the rats many of them were shot in the air but the queen and her sparra warriors were brave and reckless fighters and they plunged in regardless of danger matthias and orlando headed the charge across the clearings the shrews drew their short swords and followed cheek jess and jabez whirled slings loaded with stones as clubs and basil hurtled in with both long back legs kicking dangerously redwaaaall mossfloweeeer guosim logalogalog the speed of the attack combined with the sparrow assault took the rats off guard they fought tooth and claw using arrows to stab with but they were no match for the force that came at them despite their superior numbers the shrews were fearsome warriors at close quarters with their short swords they fought in groups facing outwards circling and milling they created a carousel of slaughter rats fell screaming and kicking everywhere cheek and jabez stood back to back thwacking away with their loaded slings sparra warriors fastened their claws into rats heads and pecked madly at their faces the rats were unused to being attacked in their own territory and they fought mainly a defensive action many brought down shrews and sparrows however they were no match for matthias and orlando the axe and the sword swathed into them at every turn and rats flew high in the air from basils awesome kicks the battle raged back and forth the woodlanders were still greatly outnumbered though their weapons and fighting skills were superior it might have gone one way or the other when logalog turned the tide he spied stonefleck slinking away into the trees and using his sword as a spear he launched it at the rat chieftain his aim was true stonefleck fell slain by the sword logalog had thrown when the rats saw their leader fall the fight went out of them screaming and wailing they scurried off into the trees matthias stood leaning on his sword breathing heavily ignoring the cuts and bites he had taken the warrior mouse extended his paw to the shrew leader well thrown logalog the shrews gave a loud cheer for their leader matthias looked around the slain littered the edge of the clearing like leaves in autumn where is my friend queen warbeak he asked his heart sank within him a small group of sparra warriors who had survived the battle were grouped about their fallen queen matthias jess and basil knelt by her side tears streaming openly down their faces for the sparra queen lying there warbeaks eyes were dimmed in death the breeze moved her feathers gently a sparrow passed matthias a small scroll we come alia way from redwall he told the warrior mouse abbot say give you this queen see you in trouble with ratworms she say help um friend matthias jess lifted warbeak lightly and carried her up into a sycamore tree laying her on a broad bough she covered the sparra queen with leaves in the timehonored sparra fashion matthias sat at the foot of the sycamore his head in both paws grieving for warbeak basil came over and patted matthias there there old lad i know if s a pity she had to die so far from redwall but she saved us by her courage matthias plucked at a blade of grass yes the queen loved redwall that was the bravest thing ive ever seen any creature do basil she threw herself and her warriors at those rats knowing she and her sparras stood no chance they flew in against arrows and attacked with only beak and claw orlando wiped his axe blade on the grass i never knew your sparrow friend matthias but she saved all our lives by her brave action ive seen creatures ten times her size without a quarter of her boldness what a warrior jess squirrel looked up to the leafy shroud on the tree bough good old warbeak eh totally mad of course shed rather die than miss a good fight ill bet wherever she is now that shes chuckling at us standing round blubbering like a load of abbey babes who have to go to bed early instead of getting on with our search for the fox matthias rose dryeyed he stuck his swordpoint into the ground aye jess youre right weve got some burying to do here then we will leave this place i never want to set eyes on it again we must carry on south later that day they halted in a quiet place an ash grove far from the clearing where the battle had taken place matthias took stock of the situation the surviving sparrows would fly back to redwall taking with them the news that the warrior mouse and his friends were alive and well still on the trail of the young captives logalog and the remainder of the now depleted guostm voted firmly to stay with the friends and see the mission through they settled down to study the map and writings that had been sent from redwau matthias scanned the parchments carefully by the fur i wish we had met up with warbeak before we did listen to this those who wish to challenge fate to a jumbled shout walk straight sunset fires in dexteree find where loamhedge used to be at the high place near the skies look for other watchful eyes sleep not neath the darkpine trees be on guard take not your ease voyage when the daylight dims danger in the water swims make no noise with spear or sword lest you wake the longtail horde shades of creatures who have died bones of warriors who once tried shrink not from the barren land look below from where you stand this is where a stone may fall and make no sound at all those who cross and live to tell see the badger and the bell face the lord who points the way after noon on summers day death will open up its grave who goes there none but the brave look at this map weve come through all these places there are the cliffs here is the pine forest here the water with the bows of the rats on the far shore this place here hummocks and trees this is where we are now what do you think basil youre right of course old warrior hmm sound advice too it warns of the dangers in the woods even gives the little fishes a mention ha voyage when the daylight dints maybe we would have stood a chance of giving those rats the slip if wed crossed by night well well a jolly old bit of prophecy here creatures certainly did die and weve left the bones of warriors back there but whaf s all this about shrinking from barren lands eh the only thing i ever shrunk from was lack of food wot orlando checked the map jess do you think you could climb a high tree and look over to the south to an expert climber like jess this was but the work of a moment she was up a hornbeam in the twinkling of an eye were nearly out of the woodlands she called down from the topmost branches i can see some sort of plain beyond it looks very bare and dusty matthias nodded approval well at least were on the right track but weve no way of telling how far south weve travelled i suppose well have to try and cross the barren land and look for some place where we can look below to where a stone may fall and make no sound at all does that make any sense to you orlando the badger shook his head if s all a mystery to me but if it will help us to get our young ones back im game to try i know nothing of badgers heads and bells and lords who point the way and death and graves though matthias stood nor do i friend but i intend to find out logalog will your guosim be ready to inarch at daybreak ready as ever warrior well soon see what other little surprises this strange southland has in store for us the abbey bells tolled their eventide watch over redwall as the sun sank below the western plain constance had taken no chances with the three magpies they huddled miserably in a corner of cavern hole each with its pinion feathers bound legs hobbled and beak shut tightly with twine constance and the abbot sat together in the opposite corner listening earnestly to ambrose spikes report there aint been a move out of anybird we watched the eaves all afternoon brother trugg foremole and meself not a feather or a beak stirred the abbot scratched his chin strange i was sure that ironbeak would try to lay some sort of trap either him or that sly crow odd very odd odd or not constance shrugged the suns going down wed best get these three outside and exchange them for three decent creatures winifred will you and foremole see that archers and javelins the main doorways behind us keep them facing ironbeak and his company in case of trouble foremole saluted dutifully doant ee wurry marm usil givem billyo if n they moves a claw general ironbeaks hostages had been carefully flown down a short time after sunset the two mousemothers kept their eyes shut tight as they were borne through the air by six rooks baby rollo however enjoyed the flight immensely whooping and giggling as he tugged at the three birds that were carrying him they landed safely in front of the abbey pond then surprisingly the carrier birds flew off leaving the hostages guarded only by ironbeak and mangiz to forestall any thoughts of escape the two birds kept their fearsome beaks dose to rollos head knowing that neither cornflower nor mrs churchmouse would attempt anything whilst the infant was threatened slowly they walked across to the main abbey door constance and ambrose awaited them standing to one side of the three magpies the open abbey doors were crowded with determined redwallers armed to the teeth ironbeak halted short of the door why are all your creatures armed and menacing us like this i understood this was to be a friendly exchange his voice was harsh and commanding foremole waved a large spear at the raven harr doant make oi larff youm the vurmints wot been adoin all the tricksterin an attacken thus yurrs wot us calls porteckshun gainst crafty ol burdbags mangiz pointed with his wing why are these birds bound like this we have not tethered your creatures ambrose winked at the crow probly cos mice dont have beaks and wings puddenhead i will not stand here to be insulted by you hedgepig mangiz fumed then stand somewhere else and ill insult you there featherbag ambrose do not provoke them constance interrupted we are here to make a peaceful exchange of hostages one for one cornflower are you all right yes thank you constance as well as can be expected under the circumstances constance bowed stiffly to ironbeak thank you raven as you can see the magpies are unharmed apart from being restrained otherwise they have been well treated ironbeak cast his bright eyes on the doorway you must think me a fool i make no exchanges while we are faced with weapons tell your creatures to put down their arms aha i thought so ambrose whispered to constance this is where the raven shows is feathers the moment we drop our weapons ell spring is trap whatever it is constance watched ironbeak as she murmured back i know what you mean ambrose but what can we do he has kept his word even coming unarmed to meet us we cannot face him with an army geared up to the teeth hmm i suppose youre right leave it to me he turned to the redwall contingent lay those weapons down and listen to me if the raven or his pal try one false move then grab the armoury up fast and make the pair of em into pincushions ironbeak had heard what went on and nodded do as you will we have come here only to trade hostages no tricks constance banged her paw down upon the path then lef s get to it and stop fussing about or well be here to see dawn break ironbeak nodded to mangiz and the crow started the exchange we release them at the same time one for one first the infant for quickbill agreed constance untied the first magpie agreed rollo was aware of the gravity of the situation he strode slowly across to constance crossing paths with quickbill on reaching his friends the little bankvole began singing kick a magpie in the eye shoot a crow wiv a great big bow winifred swept him up and hurried indoors now the one called cornflower for brightback agreed the mouse and the magpie passed each other in silence tension mounted in the air now that there were only two left as cornflower embraced constance the harsh voice of mangiz sounded last the churchmouse for diptail agreed the exchange took place without a hitch both sides stood watching each other at a wave from ironbeak the magpie brothers and mangiz flew off then the raven general fixed his eyes on constance i will continue to attack you it is my destiny that i should rule in the great redstone house the badger gave him back stare for stare others have tried to conquer redwall warriors greater than you we are still here right is on our side justice too one day our warriors will return home then you will be driven off or slain ironbeak was unmoved hajtjta we shall see you are not as clever as you imagine none of you did it not occur to you that my fighters were not with me to see the exchange take place oh nutsnacorns ambrose groaned i knew the villain had somethin hidden up is feathery sleeve while i was drawing out this business for as long as possible ironbeak continued my birds were in your orchards loading up many supplies i kept you talking long enough for them to make several trips your sentries who should have been guarding the windows feeing the orchard were watching me and mangiz in case we tried something anyway black birds cannot be seen flying by night also i must tell you that we have moved down to your infirmary and dormitories i am conquering this place from the top downwards now you are left only with the place called cavern hole if you try to cross the floor of great hall after dawn tomorrow we will be watching from the galleries ready to attack you we have all the supplies needed and you will be held to a state of siege below the floor of this place you and your friends might think yourselves clever but you are not wise enough to outsmart general ironbeak the raven shot off into the night sky like a dark arrow constance shook her head wearily he wouldnt have outsmarted matthias cornflower patted constance you were wonderfully brave to get us free were not beaten yet as long as were alive and redwall stands there is hope she said reassuringly we must defend the abbey and keep it safe especially for the day when matthias returns with mattimeo strange isnt it i keep thinking of my little matti even at the oddest times constance smiled fondly thaf s because hes your son and youre his mother whenever i look at you i can tell you are thinking of him any creature would be glad of a mum hke you cornflower here whaf s this tears cornflower sniffed and wiped her eyes no im just a little tired i suppose i hope mattimeo is getting his proper sleep wherever he is the trek across the great barren country started at daybreak canteens had been filled at the last woodland pool supplies were very low but the shrew cooks had done them proud logalog and his scouts had foraged the woodland fringe and fennel cloudberry and dandelion together with some hallripened hazelnuts had been thrown into a large communal salad with the addition of some dried fruit and the last of the cheese then a good meal had been eaten facing the flat expanse of sunscorched earth basil sniffed the dry air useless trying to scent anything around here still die tracks are clear enough i can see them from here runnin off in a straight line theyre a day and a night ahead of us i reckon he stood stretching his long limbs gazing out at the already shimmering horizon as it wavered and rippled with the fierce heat right lads quicks the word an sharps the action eh form up here and follow me no lagging and sitting down on the bally old job by the left wait for it cheek quick march the little column trekked off into the unknown expanses of the desert ahead of them leaving behind the final fringes of mossflower slagar had driven both captives and slavers hard marching by night and resting by day they had crossed the wasteland footsore and weary mattimeo and his companions helped each other along their mouths were dry and parched from lack of water the manacles rubbed and chafed tess caught cynthia bankvole as she stumbled for the umpteenth time up now stay on your paws cynthia if s daylight so theyll let us rest soon the volemaid licked dusty lips with a dry tongue i hope so tess i cant stand much more of it though i dont know which id prefer right now a drink or a sleep auma lent her size and strength supporting them both with a paw at their backs keep going i can see something ahead though i dont exactly know what it is can you see it sam the young squirrel strained his eyes looks like some sort of a black shadow with bushes and trees on the other side of it whatever it is it has to be better than this wasteland i think theyre planning to let us rest when we reach there keep going it shouldnt be too long now distances in the drylands were deceptive it was gone midmorning when the slave line halted at the place which auma and sam had sighted cynthia bank vole drew in a sharp breath and clapped a paw over her eyes then sat down dizzy with fright they had arrived at the brink of an abyss a huge rift in the earth opened before them it was as if the world were splitting through its middle impenetrably black and endlessly deep it stretched away in either direction as far as the eye could see though they were standing at its narrowest point the distance across yawned many times the length of a tall beech tree the captives stood wideeyed in astonished silence at the awesome sight across the gorge a swaying construction of rope and wood stretched it was secured at either side by thick stakes driven deep into the earth but the center of the rough bridge dipped perilously into the chasm jube buried his face against the dusty ground ooooh id as soon die as try to cross that a moan arose from the slave lines others felt the same as jube and even the stoats weasels and ferrets who had come this far with slagar began muttering among themselves the masked fox stood leaning against the stakes watching them he had come across this problem before and was ready for it frightened eh legs turned to jelly have they he taunted them we never bargained for anything like this chief threedaws gulped slagar strolled to where two weasels drynose and damper stood guard over the expeditions food and water pushing them to one side he took the three large water canteens and carried them to the head of the bridge what dyou mean bargained youre not here to bargain you are here to obey orders you skinpaw show them how if s done a weasel like you isnt afraid of crossing a bridge skinpaw shook his head vigorously ask me to do anything slagar anything march fight climb mountains cross rivers but not that the silken masked fluttered the cruel one seemed to be smiling beneath it he turned to his slavers one by one you halftail or you viteh how about you scringe or bageye there no they remained silent while slagar spoke as if he were cajoling nervous young ones oh come on now its only a little bridge across a gorge besides do you see the bushes and trees on the other side theres a lovely little pool there full of nice cold water just think you can drink all you like skinpaw eyed the canteens that slagar held weve got water chief he pointed out the fox swung the canteens out wide letting go of them he leaned over watching them disappear into the abyss where i dont see any water now you spineless toads listen to me you have a choice either you cross this bridge and drink water or you stay on this side and die of thirst threeclaws was the first to go he stepped gingerly out onto the swaying bridge gripping the rope sides tightly carefully he tested each wooden slat before putting his weight on it when he was a short way out slagar called fleaback scringe pick that line up and start the prisoners going halftail you go with them the rest of you follow after theyve crossed encouraged by threeclaws slow but sure passage fleaback and scringe stepped onto the bridge tugging the leadrope come on you lot step lively and no hanging back or stumbling scringe chivvied them mattimeo could not shut his ears to the sobbing of cynthia and jube who were in a state of frozen shock he tore a strip from the hem of his habit and bit it into two pieces here tess put these around their eyes cynthia jube listen hold on to tess and auma and keep going youll be all right the trick worked groping awkwardly the blindfolded creatures held tight to tess and auma who though they were both frightened of the swaying sagging bridge found that a lot of the fear was taken out of the crossing by attending to cynthia and jube only sam squirrel was totally fearless about the bridge at one point tim had to remonstrate him for making the structure wobble with his jaunty walk hey go easy sam he called nervously theres others on this bridge not as clever as you at crossing gorges oops sorry tim never mind were nearly over now ma ttimeo tried not to glance down into the bottomless depths he dearly wished he had his paws on firm ground again the crossing was made without incident safely on the other side everybeast breathed a huge sigh of relief slagar led them a short way into the bushes theres the pool drink as much as you like threeclaws see theyre fed and watered then secure the line halftau come with me slagar walked back to the edge of the gorge while halftau watched he crossed back over the bridge then the masked fox got out flint and steel it did not take long to get the dustdry ropes burning as soon as they were alight he bounded onto the bridge and crossed back with surprising speed and agility chuckling to himself he watched the ropes burn through the bridge swayed and collapsed with a clatter of wooden slats as it struck the wall of the chasm beneath them slagar took halftails dagger and sawed through the taut ropes which held the weight of the bridge he leapt back as the whole structure slipped away with a creaking groaning snap they waited awhile but there was complete silence from the depths of the abyss slagar smiled see completely bottomless nobeast can follow us now a fullscale council was in progress at cavern hole winifred the otter winced as sister may applied poultices and herbs to her deeply scratched back aaahh go easy sister thats the only back ive got ouch sister may went about her task ignoring the protests hold still you silly otter you were told not to cross great hall but you would not listen stop wriggling while i attend to this scratch on your ear ow what are you trying to do pull me lug off that ears got to last me the rest of my life you know constance pointed to winifred as you can all see she was injured merely trying to cross great hall you must stay down here ironbeak and his birds are waiting in the galleries and if one of us so much as shows a whisker outside cavern hole he or she will be slain winifred was lucky she was swift enough to get away under no circumstances must you try to leave here besides where would you go well i for one would go to my little gatehouse cottage cornflower answered or i might gather fresh fruit and vegetables and water it seems to me were letting this ironbeak have it all his own way there were shouts of agreement the abbot called for order please our first concern is the safety of every creature here we must stay where it is safe there are plenty of stores the cupboards and larders are well stocked there is ample food in the kitchens and we have the entire stock of the wine cellar available i have spoken to brother trugg and the only shortage will be fresh water it must be used only for drinking bathing washing and other uses are forbidden there was a lusty cheer from rollo and some other young ones camped beneath the table im glad someone approves constance smiled well if thats all well just have to put up with the situation for a while put up with the situation indeed john churchmouse snorted indignantly cornflower laughed aloud oh john you sounded just like my matthias then at the mention of the warriors name a silence fell i do hope our young ones are safe mrs churchmouse fretted when i think of my tim and tess and sam squirrel and mattimeo and cynthia where they may be now or what those villains may do to them oh i do hope matthias brings them back safe to us she broke down in tears there there mdear john said patting her gently dont you cry theyll be all right baby rollo began patting her skirt from underneath the table ducking in an imitation of john churchmouse there there me dear dont oo cry be all right every creature laughed and even mrs churchmouse managed a smile through her tears ambrose spike lifted rollo up onto the table thaf s the stuff old rollo you get all these wet blankets cheerful again right whaf s next you little ruffian eh the tiny bankvole wrinkled his nose uttering a single word plans the hedgehog shook his head in admiration there yare out of the mouths of baby beasts an innocent creatures flans thaf s what matthias would have said if he were here stiffen me spikes he wouldnt want us mopin an cryin cornflower stamped her paw down hard youre right ambrose lets get our thinking caps on thaf s if we ever want to walk freely around our own abbey and pick our own fruit from our own orchard or even just sit on the walls in peace and watch the sunrise over redwall i say lef s not be beaten by a flock of birds constance touched a paw to her snout ssshh lets do it quietly you never know who may be listening while the badger was speaking winifred the otter crept to the foot of the stairs that separated cavern hole from great hall picking up a small turnip that baby rollo had been playing with tippawing halfway up the stairs she paused a moment then flung the turnip as hardas she could bonk there was a hollow noise of turnip striking beak followed by a loud squawking caw winifred nodded with satisfaction good shot let him go and tell old irontrousers about that if we are making plans has any creature got a suggestion the abbot asked keeping his voice low hourr oiave if n you cant cross gurtall or goo out abbey whoi doant men moi moles runnel out there was no doubting foremoles logic as constance was first to agree splendid idea theres no telling what we could do if we could tunnel out without ironbeak knowing however i was thinking of what he said last night if he means to conquer redwall he must attack us down here sooner or later it will become fairly obvious to him that we have lots of food to keep us going so in the event of not being able to starve us out hell attack cavern hole i think we should barricade the stairs to keep them out there was unanimous agreement for the tunnel and the barricade and the busy redwallers set about their tasks with a will out on the sunbaked wastelands matthias and his followers were slowed down from a brisk march to a shambling gait basil stag hare crossed his ears loosely over his head in an attempt to provide himself with some shade whew cpyou know ill never look a hot scone in the face again knowin if s come out of a jolly old oven as hot as mis place cheek tenderly pawed his dry nose huh quick march and follow me lads we should have travelled by night instead of listenin to you flopears basil brushed at his drooping whiskers id give you a swift kick if i had the energy young feller a broad black shadow fell across matthias but he carried on enjoying the shade without thinking where it had come from get down the warrior mouse was thrown flat as jess tackled him from behind as he hit the dust matthias felt a rushing breeze pass over him he turned over and looked up two great buzzards circled overhead wheeling and soaring as they waited for a chance to catch any creature off guard logalog fitted a stone to his sling as he sighed wearily heat thirst desert big birds what next the slings had little effect on the buzzards as the great dark birds would see the stone coming and fly out of range with ease oriando called a halt to the slinging stop stop youre only wasting energy lef s ignore mem well not exactly ignore them if you know what i mean but keep an eye on them matthias you take the front of the column ill take the rear if they get too close we might get the chance of a sword or axe strike and thaf put paid to them as if sensing what was going on below the two buzzards grouped and attacked the center of the band they dived so speedily no creature had a chance to do anything there was a scream and the two great hunting birds rose into the air with a wriggling shrew pinioned between them from out of theblue they were joined by a third big bird who soared down with wings outstretched look theres three of them now thaf s no buzzard ifs attacking them butting into the buzzards like a battering ram the strange bird drove them downwards causing them to drop the shrew who bumped to earth in a cloud of dust clawing and biting the other bird who was stockier and shorter than the buzzards battered away with wing and talon screeching loudly until it drove them off circling to make sure it had driven the predators away the bird dived and landed next to orlando it was sir harry the muse pray accept my apologies sir my conscience was bothering me so i had to take to the air and now i am back as you see matthias ran to greet the poetic owl well timed sir harry thank you for your help the owl blinked at the sun id sooner fly neath the moon i dread the hot afternoon the heaf s infernal and owls are nocturnal i hope the sun sets soon the shrew who had been caught by the buzzards was not badly injured he opened his pouch and offered the owl half a shrewcake which he had been saving sir harry accepted it gravely bowed politely then devoured it in a most undignified manner mmmff sgood scrumff slovely the poetic owl waddled along beside matthias as the warrior mouse explained their position im afraid were very low on supplies we could only manage to feed you with the same amount as we are rationed to dont tell me you really suffered from conscience pangs sir harry you must have another reason for flying all this way to be with us id call that a very smart guess in fact youve called my bluff my reason i must confess is not for food and stuff i get tired of being alone can i come along with you ive heard you talk of your home could i live at redwall too humph pesky bird would scoff us out of the blinkin abbey basil snorted huffily matthias glared reprovingly at the hare basil courtesy and good manners cost us nothing the old hare blinked grumpily and unfolded his ears oh well in for an acorn in for an oak i spose itd be all right for him to live at our redwall huh save me gettin all the jolly blame any time a mouthful of food goes missin wot sir harry did a hop and a skip i knew youd see things my way if s settled then its done and if food goes missing ill say blame me sir im the one dont worry i will old chap basil muttered under his breath orlando reared up shading his eyes with a big paw i see a black shadow maybe that is the black line on the map we should make it sometime about sunset matthias pulled the map out hmm yes a sort of broad black band i wonder what it is basil was stil muttering to himself huh soon find out i spose if if s anyttun to eat ill bet that owl gets there first hmph poetry indeed orlandos estimate was correct it was just as the sun began dipping beyond the western horizon that they stood on the edge of the great gorge they gazed awestruck at the massive fissure splitting the land asunder orlando and matthias peered over the edge by the fur and claw look at that how are we going to cross a gap that wide sir harry sat back on his tail feathers tho im the most poetic of birds right now im lost for words logalog whirled his sling and shot a stone down into the abyss there was neither sound nor echo came back orlando quoted the lines of the poem from memory shrink not from the barren land look below from where you stand this is where a stone may fall and make no sound at all jabez shook his head in wonderment so this is what a broad black band on a map looks like halfeaten fruit some of it rotten lay scattered between the upturned beds torn sheets and stained walls of the once neat dormitory and a window had been broken so that the magpies and rooks could fly in and out at will the fighters of general ironbeak had smashed the small wooden lockers and tables they lay about in the wreckage some sleeping others eating ironbeak had taken the infirmary and sickbay as his headquarters mangjz explored the cupboards poking his beak into sister mays collection of herbal remedies yagga why do these stupid earthcrawlers keep dead leaves and grasses they are not good to eat so what use are they ironbeak perched on sister mays wooden stool who knows mangiz that is nothing to do with our problem i am certain that the earthcrawlers have plenty to eat and drink down in that place called cavern hole the time is coming when we will have to think about an attack we will go in there and drag them out mangiz stood on the medicine cupboard shaking his head that would be like using a boulder to crush an ant my general i am sure there must be a better answer to your problem then tell me mangiz you are my seer are the pictures becoming clear in your mind again my vision is still clouded by the mouse that wears armour but i am not relying on dreams and visions soon now i will think of an idea kacha then think quickly mangiz or the summer will be gone when the brown leaves blow and the wind becomes cold i want those earthcrawlers to be only a memory as i rule in my great redstone house foremole had wasted no time he and his crew had tunnelled through from cavern hole to the grounds they emerged by the west wall poking their snouts out into the sunlight hurr hurr youm mays well try an keep waiter in a sieve as stopn uz moles agoen whurr we do please aye jarge whyrr to naow oim athinken usd best tunnel to pool burr then to miz cornflers liddle ouse by yon gate doant ee forget a noice deepn to orchard soon a veritable network of tunnels was under construction rollo was not too pleased they had taken the big table for the barricade and now he had nowhere to camp he soon cheered up when ambrose spike allowed him to help with the hammering and nailing of the barrier chairs and benches cupboards and shelves together with the large banqueting table were placed across the bottom step of cavern hole ambrose and winifred had given it a lot of thought there were spaces to fire arrows through slits for javelins and spears plus a form that the defenders could stand upon to sling stones over the top at the enemy the abbot and sister may had done a thorough stocktaking of all food in the larders and drink in the wine cellar and there was little danger of provision shortage constance checked the weaponry besides the stand ard arms there were lots of kitchen utensils that could double as fearsome implements of war the badger brandished a copperbottomed saucepan thoughtfully what dyou think cornflower it would make quite a fetching war helmet for you constance brother sedge snatched it from the badger dyou want mossflower vegetable stew with dumplings or not he asked crossly oh sorry i didnt know you were planning to use that saucepan here take this rolling pin if make a useful club and put that frying pan down please im cooking redcurrant pancakes with apple slices brother sedge told the badger indignantly oh er right is this pan all right to borrow perfectly then i wont have to make any hazelnut cream sauce to pour over my pancakes constance put the pan down quickly no hazelnut cream sauce unthinkable brother sedge ive just had a splendid idea why dont you invite the birds down to lunch and feed them to death hahaha brother sedge picked up a ladle aggressively are you insulting my cooking badger cornflower shook with mirth oh dear no im sure she meant the remark as a compliment come on constance lef s see if any of the gardening tools can be of use to us they retreated chuckling as brother sedge sliced apples savagely foremole reappeared through the tunnel entrance into cavern hole he waved to the abbot looldt yurr dalfus zurr fresh watter aplenty motes climbed out bearing buckets of water on poles between them proof that the tunnel to the pond had been completed the abbot was well pleased thank you foremole now we have all we need look mrs churchmouse fresh water as much as we need mrs churchmouse rolled her sleeves up busily wonderful i think if s high time for somebeast to get a bath rollo gave a yelp of dismay and tried to crawl into the tunnel but he met gaffer who was climbing out urr youm be marm you scrub that liddle feller noice an clean naow baby rollo was carried off protesting loudly i wanna be a mole moles dont get baffed mangiz had been thinking very hard my general last time i was in the galleries of great hall i saw the mouse in armour he was not a real live mouse but a picture on a great doth that is fastened to the wall the earthcrawlers must value him highly what if they do mangiz a piece of cloth is a piece of cloth how can this help us maybe they value him highly enough to defend him what is going on in your head my mangiz tell me i am thinking that we will not have to attack the earthcrawlers if they saw us trying to take the big doth with the picture of the mouse on they would come out and attack us to save it ironbeak clacked his beak together sharply chakka we would catch them out in the open this is a good plan mangiz you are my strong right wing the sun slanted through the windows of redwall abbey it shone on the large tapestry in the peace and quiet of great hall book three malkariss the arrival of a cool summer morning did not make the gorge look any less wide jabez spike shook his head despairingly twould be simpler to float a stone across a river than to get all these creatures across that great dark pit breakfast was frugal and the water ration had run low they ate and drank in silence basil stag hare looked longingly at the bushes and vegetation on the opposite side ill wager theres tender young plants and lots of water over there wot he said wistfully cheek gulped his water ration in a single swig wish youd stop goin on about foodnwater basil otters need water more than some old dried up twig of a hare know orlando strolled moodily round the blackened stakes that had held the bridge that fox he really thought of everything didnt he jess had a faraway look in her eyes she stroked her tail thoughtfully before peering over the edge of the gorge hmm chopped the bridge off completely at both sides did he hmm matthias do you think our owl friend could fly down into the ravine and cast his eye about for the remains of the bridge ive got an idea matthias looked inquiringly at sir harry the owl stretched his impressive wings the work of a moment dear sir to a useful fellow like me ill chance a flight down there well see what we shall see the sunlight shone through his outspread wings as he executed a graceful soaring motion diving swiftly he was soon lost to view within the dark abyss jess instructed orlando on the next part of her plan lend me your battleaxe big fellow oof on second thought you hold it now do as i tell you stand it upright against those stakes which held the bridge good logalog could you bring some rope the shrew leader rummaged about until he found a small coil heres your rope but there isnt enough to get us a fraction of the way across that gap jess uncoiled the rope i have no intention of trying to cross with this piece orlando hold the axe still while i lash it to the stakes sir hany reappeared over the edge this is your lucky day ill tell you what i found as i was winging my way far below the ground the bridge cast over the edge complete with slats and all hangs from a rocky shelf which juts from the canyon wall jess secured the axe bolt upright well done i knew a long wiggly thing like a rope bridge couldnt fall far without getting caught on something i dont want the slats theyre not part of my plan can you bring me one of the long ropes do you need a knife sir harry blinked indignantly what need of a blade have i no sword or knife do i seek i am monarch of the sky with fearsome talon and beak with a hoot and a whoosh he shot back into the depths jess shrugged apologetically hope i havent offended him slagar glanced around nervously they were passing through pleasant brush country mainly bushes and shrubs with the odd tree dotted here and there the whole area gave mattimeo the impression that once long ago it had been gardened cared for and cultivated he walked in line with his friends along what appeared to have been the path of a terrace flowers still grew in dumps and rocks ran in a straight line probably bedded there by some industrious creatures in the dim past tess spoke into his ear from behind the sudden sound causing mattimeo to jump slightly why are there no birds singing she asked the young mouse was mystified youre right tess i couldnt say what made me uneasy about this place at first but youve put your paw slap on it theres no sound no noise of grasshoppers birds the things youd normally expect to hear on a bright summers day even slagar doesnt look too happy with this place tess clinked her chain manacles gently the sound hung on the still air it is beautiful though id like to stop and sit here awhile do you know it reminds me somehow of our abbey look there are ripe berry bushes over there and daisies and roses too sam who was in the front stared ahead into the distance i can see two tall rocks shaped like a badgers head and a big bell silence back there or you wont live to see nightfall pick those paws up and march faster vitch obeyed unconsciously speeding up until he overtook his leader slagar cuffed him badtemperedly where dyou think youre running to get back and watch those prisoners and keep from under my paws rat orlando looked doubtfully at the contraption jess had set up high over his head the thick bridge rope was fastened to his axe top the rope ran out across the abyss taking a steep downward slope until it reached the stakes on the far side where sir harry had secured it close to ground level the big badger scratched his muzzle hows it supposed to work jess he asked dubiously quite simply matthias would you go first and show him the warrior mouse shinnied swiftly up the stakes removing his belt he swung it over the rope with one paw catching the other end as it came down he stood with his paws twined in the belt that hung either side of the bridge rope ready jess he called the squirrel climbed up and gave him a good push whizzing across the gorge from the rope lashed around the axehead matthias sped on a straight downward course lifting his tail clear as he hit the other side in a cloud of dust he jumped to his paws waving triumphantly logalog and his shrews cheered aloud jess turned to orlando with a smile thafs how im not sure jess i might be too big arid heavy then you can go next to last the squirrel said decisively whos going last me of course you want your axe back dont you right then ill untie the rope lash your axe to my back and swing across dont worry im a good treeflyer ill go straight down into the gorge on the end of the rope stop myself against the opposite wall and climb up orlando wiped a dusty paw across his brow im glad if s you and not me trying that by the way please take care not to lose my battleaxe down there oh stop fussing you great lump and help that shrew up on to the rope jesss plan worked well and the operation went smoothly though with one or two minor hitches sir harry was kept busy flying to and fro to borrow belts for those who had none when orlandos turn came he persevered bravely however his size and weight caused the axe handle to bend and the rope to belly the badger was stuck in the middle hanging perilously over the abyss he was moved by matthias and his friends throwing their weight on and off the rope until it began to twang and vibrate and orlando moved slowly along it at the edge he had to be hauled over the brink by basil cheek and several shrews when it was her turn to go last of all jess the champion squirrel of redwall did the crossing in swashbuckling style untying the rope she bound orlandos axe to her back and leapt straight into the gorge grasping the end of the bridge rope down she sped suddenly snapping to a halt then with practised skill she swung across and bounded up the rope paw over paw here orlando she panted hurry and get this dumping great hatchet off my back i cant stand straight with the weight of it ill leave you tied to it if you call it a hatchet again squirrel the pool among the bushes was like a cool oasis they washed the dust off bathing and splashing in the clear water all save jabez stump who sat munching cow parsley taint natural bathin otherwise wed have all been born fishes the hedgehog objected the foragers found plenty of berries fruit and plants even a crabapple tree laden with tiny golden crabapples the friends lounged about eating and dozing almost reluctant to leave this haven of plenty logalog nibbled wild celery as he made his report to matthias the scouts have picked up the trail going south as usual if s easy to follow matthias nodded studying the map and the poem aye it looks like plain travelling theres no obstacle ahead unless you count these two rocks the badger and the bell constance abbot birds are trying to steal our tapestry brother trugg tripped over his habit and fell as he dashed from the barricade where he had been standing sentry duty get slings arrows and javelins pull the table aside quickly the defenders rushed up the stairs into great hall three magpies were struggling with the wall fastenings of the heavy tapestry they ignored the charging animals remaining intent on what they were about before the redwallers had a chance to marshal their forces and open fire they were beset by birds rooks hurtled down from the galleries pecking and clawing general ironbeak and mangiz leading a small force dropped down behind them amid the confusion constance saw what was happening ironbeak was trying to cut off their path back to cavern hole she whirled dealing a rook a heavy blow that sent it spinning as it buried its claws into her neckfur back back return to cavern hole everybeast hurry she ordered two rooks were trying to drag sister may off by the back of her habit but john churchmou e thwacked them soundly with a javelin gaahh scat come on sister follow me he cried calmly the little sister shot off an arrow got him ha he wont sit down for a season take that you horrible bird oh right come on mr churchmouse ill protect you ambrose spike took a run at a group of birds who were attacking cornflower curling himself tight he went spinning into them like a flying ball of needles and they rose to the air squawking constance lashed about with a frying pan the weapon making a loud bong every time she scored a hit get out of our abbey you scavengers bong look out behind you abbot bong constance hurtled at ironbeak and mangiz the sight of the large badger with teeth bared made them jump to one side she growled and snarled like a wild beast charging them recklessly so that they had to take to the air the other birds followed their leaders example winifred the otter saw the way clear to cavern hole this way everybeast she called they clattered down the stairs and slammed the table back into position and not a moment too soon ironbeak saw his trap had been foiled and he chased several birds down the stairs after them they must not escape winifred and constance were waiting now two javelins shot from the arrow slits in the barricade one rook fell slain another took the javelin in his leg hopping and cawing he followed his fellow fighters up the stairs in a hasty retreat the javelin clattering and dragging from the limb it had pierced ambrose spike pushed a form up to the defences stand on this you archers see if you can fire across at those magpies several of the brothers and sisters took their place and began loosing shafts at the thieves the arrows fell miserably short though they did have the effect of deterring other attackers from coming down the stairs constance slammed a heavy paw against the wall the thieving pilfering barbarians how dare they steal our warriors tapestry foremole tugged at her fur scusin oi marm whoi doant ee use our tunnels tunnels but how what good would that do hurr youm could come at um throo main door they baint be aspecten that of course what a great idea constance exclaimed half of you stay here with the abbot ill take the rest through the runnel to the nearest exit outside if were sharp enough we can launch a surprise attack on those magpies seize the tapestry and go out of the abbey and straight down the tunnel back to here come on winifred ambrose cornflower and foremole would you come too with some of your moles surpintly marm uzll give um boi okey hurr that uz will i come i come me too nay young maister rollyo youn stay boi yurr an shoot arrers quickbill and his brothers were loosening the final fastenings general ironbeak and his fighters were on the floor of great hall and they hid each side of the wall at the top of the stairs waiting for another foray from cavern hole chakka block these stairs well next time and we will have them out in the open you grubclaw and you ragwing stay by me try to get the big stripedog in the eyes diptafl and brightback undid the last loop from its hook on the wall the large tapestry slid down to the floor yaggah we have it brothers redwaaaaall constance came thundering down upon them from the open doorway diptail lost his proud tail feathers with one sweep of a blunt paw brightback and quickbill shot into the air like startled flies cornflower ambrose and winifred hurriedly rolled up the tapestry while foremole and his crew stood whirling slings mangiz spotted them kragga the earthcrawlers are over there ironbeak the raven general sprang forward followed by his rooks unwittingly they exposed their backs to the stairs a hail of arrows and slingstones from the barricade behind them caught the birds unawares ironbeak dodged out of the line of fire his eye smarting from a pebblestone after them this way you wormheads away from the stairs they were halfway across great hall when the main door slammed and the tapestry rescue party were gone the fuming ironbeak laid about with his hard yellow beak useless stupid blunderers worthless dumping idiots where are those chickenhearted magpies quickbill take those blockhead brothers of yours outside and see where the earthcrawlers have got to the abbot smiled with pleasure and relief as the long roll of tapestry was fed out of the hole by the moles you acted courageously my friends martin is certainly back among us cornflower turned to foremole is there a tunnel through to my gatehouse cottage foremole tugged his snout aye missus oi dug it meself splendid sister may would you come with me tonight we may as well make use of the tunnels i have an idea it may not defeat ironbeak but it will certainly give him and those birds something to think about baby rollo rolled himself in the tapestry and giggled as gaffer mole tickled him john churchmouse looked severely over the top of his glasses come out of there this instant rollo what would martin think mrs churchmouse chuckled hed probably think it quite nice to have some company after hanging alone on the wall all that time general ironbeak was in a fine fit of rage as he stalked up and down the sickbay and the infirmary mangiz and the three magpie brothers stood stockstill waiting for his wrath to unleash itself upon them they had failed to find any trace of the exits and entrances to the cunningly dug mole tunnels kacha you slugbrained dolts do you mean to tell me that you could not find a few creatures carrying the big cloth quickbill looked down at his claws we searched we looked everywhere ironbeak there was not a sign of any creature not a sign you speak foolishness they are earthcrawlers not birds they could not fly off into the blue where did they go the big stripedog charged us general we could not fight it by the time you sent us outside we could not find any trace of them we did not expect them to come through the doorway like that you were supposed to have them penned up in that place by the stairs ironbeak moved like lightning he pulled quickbill up against the wall and felled him with a sharp blow from his heavy beak yaggah dont tell me what i was supposed to be doing you forget yourself magpie i am the leader mangiz do your visions see anything does your minds eye tell you where the earthcrawlers went the crow shifted nervously my visions are still clouded lord the raven eyed him scornfully yaeh not the mouse warrior again ironbeak i see what i see the mouse wearing armour blocks my visions and hovers in my thoughts i cannot explain it ha tt is this the mangiz who served me in the northlands i think this redstone house is making you like an old thrush the mouse is only a picture upon a piece of cloth we have seen this we know it is true i have not seen a mouse in armour striding around here nor have you yet you stand there dithering and flapping lord my visions are clouded a mouse wearing armour hovers in my thoughts kachal get out of my sight i will do my own thinking you have foiled me mangiz as mangiz turned to go there was a scratching and chirping in the doorway ironbeak leapt forward sparrows get them the five sparrows who had been listening at the door flew off ironbeak and mangiz were in hot pursuit of them as they rounded the stairwell and flew down towards great hall sparrows get them mangiz echoed his leaders cry to the patrols in the galleries the sparrows fluttered and veered not certain of where to go next one of them was taken by the beaks and claws of three rooks it stood no chance sparra sparra down here the voice of constance boomed up from cavern hole like four arrows straight and true the sparra warriors shot down the stairs and over the top of the barricade to land safely among their redwall friends a lively volley of slingstones discouraged any pursuit by ironbeaks fighters all the abbey creatures gathered in cavern hole to hear the report of the four survivors who were all that was left of queen warbeaks brave little army they told of the long days searching fruitlessly down false trails through the thicknesses of mossflower country in the far south of hawk attacks and uneasy nights spent in strange trees of all their adventures right to the time they found matthias and his friends in dire peril there followed a harrowing tale of the hardwon battle culminating in the death of queen warbeak and nearly all her command many redwallers wept unashamedly for warbeak and her warriors were great friends and true redwallers there was heartfelt relief and the sadness gave way to cheers at the news that matthias basil and jess together with old shrew comrades and some new companions were alive and well still hot on the trail of the evil one and his band who had kidnapped the young ones from the abbey the abbot ordered food to be brought for the weary sparrows who had flown night and day to be back at redwall then he informed them of developments since they had left the arrival of general ironbeak and the slaying of the old sparra folk and the nestlings by the ruthless invaders one of the sparrows related what they had heard outside the infirmary door cornflower dapped her paws together i knew it i was right martin the warrior is watching over us oh im so glad i thought up a little plan earlier on this makes it so much better knowing that those villainous birds are uneasy about the warriors spirit protecting our abbey now i think my scheme will really work i think you should tell us what this plan is before you decide to go off doing things by yourself young mouse the abbot said firmly cornflower explained mangiz perched in the galleries with ironbeak both birds were watching the floor of great hall below general do you think those sparrows heard us talking mangiz wondered who cares about a few sparrows you see mangiz you are worrying about stupid things it is as i said you are becoming wary of your own wingshadow now leave me alone since it is i who now has to do all the thinking you must not bother me with talk of sparrows and armoured mice so be it lord mangiz flapped off to the dormitories in a sulk ambrose spike and brother dan selected a long barrel stave and set about carving it with their woodworking tools as he worked the hedgehog muttered a sword like the great sword of martin that matthias carries wish i had it here as a model still i can remember fairly well what it looks like i can recall the exact details of our warriors sword fortunately brother dan sniffed ambrose sniffed back at him see that barrel of october ale yonder ive got to remember to tap it before autumn see those barrels of cider ive got to remember to add honey to them in a day or so or theyll go bitter now that big barrel of strawberry cordial well ive got to remember to strain it off into jugs for the evenin meal tonight so that if be cold and clear so you carry on recallin what you like about the warriors sword dan ive got enough to remejpber thank you evening was falling with a glorious red sunset as cornflower and sister may accompanied by several moles slipped from the tunnel exit into the gatehouse cottage barring the door foremole checked at the windows to make sure they had not been seen nary a sign o burdbags missus wem be safe enuff cornflower went into the bedroom and opened the chest where matthias kept his warriors garb see if s all here sister may the armour and everything all my matthias took was his sword he likes to travel light sister may helped cornflower to unpack the helmet and greaves laying the burnished breastplate upon the bed she eyed it doubtfully dearie me if s all very heavy are you sure youll manage to walk with it on cornflower shrugged i wont know until i try but im fairly strong give me a paw with this shoulderplate will you shortly afterwards she clanked out into the living room fully armoured foremole shook his head admiringly burr youm lookenasoightaright missus oi never seed ought loik that strewth but for your face oid say twas marthen acummed back agin sister may emerged carrying a piece of filmy gauze not to worry mr foremole ill make a face mask and in the dark shell seem quite pale and ghostly i must say cornflower all that bulky armour makes you look quite large and impressive cornflower clanked about gazing down at the gleaming metal lef s hope it fools the birds tonight basil dodged about in the rays of the setting sun i say look you chaps this must have been a herb garden aha mint yumyum im rather partial to a bit of fresh mint achoo bless me theres thyme around here somewhere it always makes me sneeze achoo ah here tis hmm very tasty too achoo the trackers were camped in the old cultivated garden land shrew fires burned red against the twilight and a delicious aroma permeated the air cheek took a taste from the end of a ladle gaw marvellous what is it logalog chopped wild chicory with his sword and threw it in the pot thaf s special theres so much still growing round here that we have a wide choice im calling it hunters hotpot theres only water to drink but im making apple fritters in honey to follow jess squirrel looked over towards the twin black silhouettes of the badger and bell rocks in the distance what an amazing sight matthias youd think for all the world that those shapes were real matthias was busy with jabez stump and sir harry they were studying the map and poem again well thaf s the badger and the bell but this next part sounds pretty desperate face the lord who points the way after noon on summers day death will open up its grave who goes there none but the brave they sat in silence around the fire weighing the ominous words sir harry waddled across to sniff the aromas of the cooking pot and returned heartened dread words do not alarm me when food is on its way no parchment threat can harm me lead on lead on i say basil gobbled a lettuce leaf well spoken me old featherface i feel exactly the same i can face death after dinner any time only thing bothers me is that i might miss tea and supper wot robbed of his noble moment the owl glared at basil and stalked off matthias tapped the map this thing here bothers me its like two lines one at an angle to the other with sort of little splinters sticking off all along it logalog banged the side of the pot with the ladle come on come on never mind death and doom and mysteries this hotpof s ready form a line no shoving in ahead basil get to the back go on amid much jollity and laughter the shrews lined up with matthias and his friends to be served basil was eagerly holding his bowl out for a portion of the hunters hotpot when an eerie voice rang out doom dooooooooommmm logalog paused the ladle deep in the pot what was that basil waggled his bowl dont know old chap fill the bowl please theres a good fellah matthias and orlando grabbed their weapons but a call from cheek reassured them its all right an old rabbits showed up over here the newcomer was an ancient rabbit he even had a wispy white beard he staggered into the firelight waving his paws and shouting in a wavery voice doom death destruction and darkness doom i say doooom basil waggled his ears at the ancient one i say old chap push off and let a bloke have his hotpot will you they gathered around the rabbit matthias bowed to him i am matthias the warrior of redwall and these are my friends we mean you no harm what is your name sir and what is this place called the rabbit stared straight ahead doom all about me is doom oh give your whiskers a rest you old fogey basil called out as he nudged logalog to use his ladle or ill never get served doom doom deathndestruction cant you say anything that doesnt begin with a d the old rabbit slumped down his limbs trembling with age matthias placed his bowl of food in front of the rabbit and draped a sack about his shaking form the creature ignored the food and continued his mutterings of death and doom cheek peered closely at the old rabbit hes fuddled got a headful of black dust he remarked basil gave the otter a stern glance mind your manners in front of your elders matthias turned the same stem glance upon basil listen to the pot calling the kettle black you dont seem to be setting cheek much of an example the warrior mouse squatted down in front of the old one pointing to the tall rocks tell me sir what lies beyond those rocks for the first time the rabbit appeared to hear the question he looked towards the badger and the bell shaking his head death and darkness terror and evil he intoned then fell silent and would say no more orlando leaned upon his axe its no use matthias the poor old fellow is frightened out of his wits leave him there with that sack and the food perhaps he might come round later and talk to us ess squirrel shook her tail i wonder what caused him to be like this it must be something pretty awful to make a creature behave so look matthias hes getting up the old rabbit rose slowly walking towards matthias he stroked the sack that was draped about him as if it was some kind of comforting robe halting in front of the warrior mouse the ancient one untied a woven grass binder from his paw a piece of stone dangled from it without a word he pressed the object into matthiass paws and wandered off into the night clutching the sack about him like a cloak logalog and jabez intercepted him but matthias motioned them away let him go poor creature he seems to be very fond of that sack maybe he gave me this in exchange for it basil inspected the stone hanging from its grass bracelet funnylookin doodah what dyou suppose it is ive no idea it looks like the model of a small stone mouse probably some kind of ornament that he wished to give us in exchange for our hospitality the warrior mouse looped it about his sword belt and sat down to finish the evening meal with his friends the halfmoon gleamed fitfully down on the scene at the foot of the tall rocks the summer night was warm but eerie and silent jube whimpered in his sleep and tess stroked his head until he fell silent auma stared up at the strange gloomy rocks rising like twin sentinels in the darkness i dont like it here she said shuddering all my life i lived by the mountains of the western plains they were sunny and friendly these are not tim reached out and touched the rock wall which was still warm from the sun theyre only rocks like any others if s just that nature shaped diem differently he reassured her quiet there get those eyes shut and sleep or youll feel my cane threedaws strolled by swinging his willow withe he checked that they were still and silent before moving on to join slagar the sly one stood between the rocks his silken mask making a splash of colour against their dark surface he turned at threedaws approach all still aye theyre quiet enough chief good well soon be rid of them where is this place youre taking them slagar are you questioning me threedaws the fox

smartly and marched off with his head high fool slagar sneered beneath the silken hood as he watched the weasel go halftail was slumbering against the bell rock when slagar stirred him the stoat tried to give the impression that he was alert is that you chief i was just lying quiet here watching the captives he pretended good good ive often noticed that youre the one who stays awake and keeps a

assistant to give orders for me its a job for somebeast like yourself the chance to prove you can handle power vitch could not help rubbing his paws together with excitement im the one for the job slagar ill prove it to you i know you will vitch that s why i picked you slagar crept away to resume his watch between the rocks satisfied that he had laid his plans well from the moonlit terraces below the badger and the bell other eyes watched him through the warm summer night slagar stood quite still not daring to move a muscle from out of the surrounding darkness grey rats had come silently he was now surrounded by them there was a vast army of the creatures each one robed in black and carrying a short stabbing spear with a broad leafshaped blade there was not a single sound from any of them as well as he could the cruel one took stock of the situation the rats encircled the camp eyes glimmered in the bushes spearblades shone everywhere around both the tall rocks and in the narrow defile between they far outnumbered stoneflecks horde which guarded the riverbanks the masked fox had encountered them before when he had passed this way he remained unmoving awaiting a sign the creatures in front of him parted as a purplerobed rat came towards slagar this one did not carry a spear in his paw he held a white bone sceptre surmounted by a mouse skull the rat spoke no word you have come for the slaves i was waiting for you nadaz slagar said his voice sounding hollow in the silence the rat called nadaz shook his sceptre the skull rattled against its bone handle and slagar fell silent nadaz pointed the sceptre at the fox then swept around to point it at the sleeping captives turning again he pointed between the twin rocks indicating the direction they would be taking slagar nodded his understanding dark forms surrounded mattimeo and those chained to the slave lines the young mouse came half awake as he heard less give a muffled groan silent paws held his head still and a pad of leaves holding the ashes of burned grass and herbs was pushed up against his mouth and nostrils mattimeo struggled but the overpowering scent of the compress was too strong to fight against dark mists roiled in front of his eyes as his body slumped limply against the folds of a black robe the senseless forms of the captives were placed on large oblong shields eight rats bore each shield vitch was awakened by a shake from slagar ssshh dont make a sound follow me and keep quiet were on our way the fox warned as vitch rose he accidentally stood on dampers paw the weasel awoke with a whimper seeing the captives being carried away he jumped up slagar where are they aargh at a sign from nadaz one of the rats slew damper with a swift thrust of his stabbing spear vitch shook with terror as a bag was placed over his head slagar whispered to him as his own head and mask was enveloped dont panic they wont kill us just go where they direct you the silent army moved off south between the twin rocks with their unconscious captives and the two slavers the pale moon shone down on the body of damper he lay still in death with his sleeping companions nearby unaware of what had taken place in the soft summer night the same moon mat shone over mossflower sent silver grey shafts of light through the windows of great hall two rooks perched in the upper galleries on sentry duty half awake and half dozing they stared down at the scene below dark shadows softened the corners of the stones with lighter areas where the moonlight shone in one rook shifted his claws uncomfortably graah it is better in the day when the sun shines warm and bright his companion shook a wing to keep awake you are right rag wing i do not like this place in the darkness the earmcrawlers are all asleep down in that cavern hole place why do we have to stand about here all night nothing ever happens do not let the general hear you say that if he says stay here all night then we obey aye you are right when the darkness comes again two others will have to stay guard and we will sleep upon the soft beds of the earthcrawlers krakkah they are good beds there was nothing like them in the northlands what is that grubdaw did you see something move down there graah it is only shadows no over there look the big door is open see something moves slowly emerging from a patch of deep shadow a ghostly figure glided into a shaft of moonlight the two rook sentries stood thunderstruck it was a mouse in gleaming armour the mouse from the big cloth the spectre turned to face them but it had no face there was just a grey misty area where the face should have been raising a fearsomelooking sword it pointed directly at the fearbound birds and intoned in a deep booming voice death comes if you stay in redwalllll before the echoes had finished rebounding around great hall the panicstricken birds had fled in terror tumbling and bumping into each other in their haste to get away from the ghastly sight ironbeak was shocked into wakefulness by grubclaw and ragwing the infirmary door banged open wide as they hurtled through feathers flying in all directions general yaggah whoocaw a ghost a ghost death it said death kraggak save us ironbeak struck out with both wings belaboring the rooks silence you thickheads mangiz come with me you two quickly show us where you saw this thing the four birds hurried through to the sentry post in the galleries ragwing pointed a quivering claw he was shaking uncontrollably ththereththereththeretherethere ironbeak pushed him aside roughly fool i see nothing we were here and all of a sudden there it was right there grubclaw tried to explain ironbeak stared down at the spot they were both pointing to kraak there isnt anything there right you ragwing tell me exactly what you saw or ill make you more frightened of me than any ghost youve ever seen now stop yammering and stammering and talk slowly well chief me and grubclaw were standing right here on sentry we werent sleeping oh no we were wide awake then i says to him whats that moving down there and he says to me its only shadows kraakh when we looked again there was a mouse just like the warrior mouse on the big cloth except this one had no face it waved a sword at us a big long sword and it said death comes to you if you stay in redwall that ghost spoke in a voice like no mouse it was like thunder over the northland mountains it was like like ironbeak waved his wing threateningly enough i have heard enough a ghost of a mouse eh grubclaw could not help himself calling out a mmouse all in armour chief with a big sword ironbeak zoomed over the galleries winging downwards he landed on the floor and this is where it stood well do you see any ghost now do you he asked his voice echoing around great hall the two sentries shook their heads numbly ironbeak called out kraggah ghost i am general ironbeak greatest fighter in all the northlands come ghost see if you can scare me the raven stood boldly in the shaft of moonlight on the floor of great hall nothing happened general the big door is still open mangiz called down to him ironbeak stalked outside he looked around then came in again slamming the door after him he flew up to the galleries you see nothing inside nothing outside no mouse in armour ghost call it what you will nothing he turned upon the two sentries waggling his murderous beak under their eyes his voice heavy with menace so tell me again what did you see nothing they said in fearful unison then who opened the big door mangiz asked ironbeaks eyes glittered with rage as he nodded to the sentries carry on guarding this place mangiz we will go back to the room as the crow entered the infirmary ironbeak gave him a kick which sent him sprawling mangiz looked up in surprise the general had struck other birds before but never his seer ironbeak stood over him this is all your doing crow he said his voice thick with anger you and your clouded visions kacha a ghost mouse wearing armour those rooks were scared witless then when i go and prove to them there is no ghost what does my strong right wing have to say ironbeak imitated mangjzs voice mockingly then who opened the big door the crow cringed trembling as the general continued so i show them there is no ghost and you start convincing diem there is one i am no ghost mangiz and what i say is final i will teach you not to open your beak at the wrong time the crow screeched in anguish as the big ravens talons came down ambrose spike placed a bowl of hot celery and cream soup before cornflower as sister may removed her helmet try some of this itll help keep your spirits up hohohoho constance held her sides wiping tears of laughter from her eyes ohaha oh dear i must say you looked hauntingly beautiful in your armour tonight cornflower oh haha hee hee hee not intending a pun sister may remarked as she folded the gauze facemask im glad it worked it goes to show you what can happen from the ghost of an idea oh dear they fell about laughing did you see their faces when you pointed the sword at them hahaha they kept bumping into each other when they tried to fly off together that was thanks to constances ghost voice its enough to scare anybeast hohoho go on constance do it again the big badger cupped her paws around her mouth and called in a sepulchral voice leeeeaaave some of mat sooooooup for meeeee outside on the gallery sentry post ragwing shuddered on his perch what was that did you hear it grubdaw the other rook pecked his companion hard upon the bottom yak dont you start that again youve got us into enough trouble for one night now go to sleep that way you wont be able to see anything worth reporting with your dim imagination there was dissension and mutiny in the camp of slagar the slavers woke to find the slaves and their leader gone worse followed when drynose the weasel found the lifeless body of his comrade damper the filthy murdering fox hes stabbed my mate damper he cried out hafftail attempted to pacify him rubbish slagar wouldnt kill one of his own hah well what about hairbelly and wedgeback he done em both in drynose is right you keep out of it threeclaws ill bet you that lousy masked murderer has even killed little vitch look around can you see vitch vitch isnt dead scringe butted in slagars taken him along somewhere halftail brandished a dagger at scringe somewhere what dyou mean somewhere youve been spying and ustenin to things that dont concern you scringe i think youre a dirty traitor dirty traitor eh listen whos talkin youre the turncoat bucko slagar told me to keep my eye on you and dont you start waving that dagger at me snotwhiskers ive got a sword twice as big as that look halftail rushed scringe as he tried to draw his sword taken unawares the ferret was easy prey to the stoaf s dagger he fell mortally wounded halftail turned upon the rest thaf s what spies and traitors get anybeast want some come on threeclaws pulled out a viciouslooking hook hey halftail youve got a lot to say for yourself who do you think you are the chief i am as far as youre concerned weasel slagar left me in charge when he told me hed be gone for a while threeclaws brandished the hook nodding to fleaback and drynose and all three advanced slowly upon halftail threeclaws grinned wickedly slagar left you in charge whose paw do you think youre trying to pull he would have left one of us weasels in charge wouldnt he mates halftail snatched the sword from the dead scringe he swished it at them and jabbed with his dagger get back weasels leave me alone or therell be real trouble when slagar returns threeclaws circled slowly swinging the hook you must have bread for brains if you think the fox is coming back you idiot why do you think he took the slaves with him hes got no intentions of coming back ha no wonder they call him the sly one drynose made a rush at halftail the stoat leapt to one side and spitted the weasel with his sword he shouted an appeal to bageye the only other stoat in the group come on bageye slagar left me in charge help me out mate before bageye could rise to his paws wartdaw and snakespur two other weasels jumped on him their iron hooks flashed once weve got this one threedaws go on finish halftail halftail fought like a mad creature he wounded skinpaw and was about to finish him when snakespur struck him from behind with his hook halftail was dead before he hit the ground the survivors of the mutiny sat about licking their wounds and eating any provisions they could find out of the crew that had taken the young ones from mossflower there were only five weasels remaining skinpaw fleaback threeclaws wartclaw and snakespur undecided they lounged about the camp threeclaws fancied himself as leader but after the slaughter that had taken place he decided to stay in the background lest one of the others challenge him for supremacy besides who knew slagar might come back and then there would really be trouble as if reading threeclaws thoughts snakespur grumbled aloud deserted thafs what weve been mates deserted that scurvy fox has left us in the lurch and gone off to get the reward for the captives himself what makes me so mad is that weve followed him like a pack of fools all this time yes chief no chief huh now where are we half a seasons journey into the middle of nowhere with empty paws and empty bellies too by the look of those slack ration bags but what about little vitch fleaback interrupted i wonder whaf s happened to him snakespur slashed at the grass with his iron hook dead as a pickled frog for all i care whats one rat or more got to do with us were weasels mate oho i tell you id like to have that foxs guts at the end of this hook right now brave words from the scum of the earth a large male badger had walked quietly into the camp he stood testing the edge of a big doubleheaded battleaxe with his paw the weasels leapt up unsure of what to do against the huge warrior without a leader to galvanize them into action orlando gave a cold smile run or fight eh baby stealers his voice was deceptively calm i know you havent the courage to fight theres only five of you and not a gang ah well if youre not going to fight then you must run like the cowards you are but even then you wont get far because youre surrounded matthias and his friends stepped from the bushes and the rocks wartclaw began trembling violently it was slagar it was his idea we dont even count look at the way hes deserted us matthias pointed at the bodies of the fallen tell me weasel what happened here it was the masked fox he did it you lie we lay hidden and watched it all you murdered your own comrades listen to me if you do not speak the truth then you will all join them is that dear the weasels nodded vigorously jess squirrel faced skinpaw where has slagar taken the captives i know youre not going to believe me the weasel moaned in despair but when we woke this morning he was gone the prisoners too and a rat named vitch matthias drew his sword the five weasels began pleading if s true if s true please sir believe us see that dead weasel there hes damper we found him slain when we woke he must have tried to stop slagar leaving logalog drew matthias aside and whispered hes probably telling the truth my scouts have discovered tracks theyve been well covered but there were rats here matthias im not just speaking about a group this was a horde a mighty army the warrior mouse nodded he turned to the five weasels i believe you now try to remember did any of you wake last night and see who was here no sir no we were asleep slagar took the watch alone basil picked up a rope and made five loops in it right cmere you wicked weasel types put these nooses around your dirty necks stop blubberin we aint goin to string you up though if s all you richly deserve wot wretches now well let you march up front isnt that good of us that way youll get the benefit of any bally old traps thaf ve been laid for us poison arrows swamps full of mad frogs great eagles that rip your jolly old eyes out an suchlike cheer up chaps if be fun cheek found threeclaws willow cane and gave it to basil i say a btinkin fiogger is this what you keep the slaves goin with sort of give them the odd whack like this and this and this whack swish thwack matthias stopped basil there was a sound from the bushes and the old rabbit tottered out still wrapped in his sack he walked round the captured weasels staring at them with rheumy eyes death death is this all he left last time the masked one came this way none of his band lived dead all slain matthias tried questioning him further but he staggered off into the bushes still moaning about death and doom orlando watched the ancient one until he was lost to sight matthias that one knows a lot more than we think did you hear him hes seen slagar passing through here once before it must be an old game with the fox to pick out a band of vermin and promise them the sky then when he gets near his destination he either dumps his helpers or slays em one way or another then hes free to reap the rewards of his filthy trade all for himself yes matthias agreed but what does he get out of it what is his reward orlando shrugged maybe well find out when we catch up with him one thing is dear now that hes got rid of his band he must be near the end of the journey though where that is your guess is as good as mine matthias stood between the two tall rocks he drew out the parchment i hope this will take some of the guesswork out of it friend he indicated the space between the badger and bell rocks this is where we are now let me see the poem says see the badger and the bell face the lord who points the way after noon on summers day death will open up its grave who goes there none but the brave jabez squatted beside the bell rock not long to go till afternoon well rest here wheres this lord whos supposed to be pointing the way they gazed out at the country it was mainly grassy hills dotted with scrub and groves of trees in the late summer morning there was no indication of mystery death or doom it all looked fairly plain and harmless orlando shook his head well whoever the lord is hes not come out to show us anything yet id best give a shout he may be taking a nap the badger cupped his paws to his mouth and roared until the valley echoed hi there are you listening lord this is orlando of the axe from the western plains come out and show us the way the echoes died on the summer air no no youre doin it all the wrong way old stripetop basil chaffed orlando here let a chap with a touch of breedin have a jolly try basil stood beyond the rocks throwing his head back he yodelled out in a wobbly tenor hullo there i say lord old fellah its basil one of the mossflower stag hares doncha know listen why dont you toddle out an point the way to me and my pals super wheeze wot the only sound that could be heard in reply was orlando sniggering matthias offered basil a shrewcake and he wandered off eating and dumtering to himself confounded bad form youd think the rotterd have the manners to answer a chap jess was also muttering to herself afternoon on summers day what part of the afternoon midday high noon middle of noon late noon how are we supposed to know silly rhyme if you ask me what dyou think matthias i think it means before the early evening jess look the words are separate it doesnt say afternoon it says after noon another thing the lord ivho points the awy doesnt have to be a living creature jess looked puzzled how do you know that easy the badger and the bell are both rocks we identified them by their shapes so why cant the lord who points the way be a rock cheek sidled up or even a tree why do you say that because ive just climbed up this badger rock a way and had a look around the one thing that stands out like a landmark is a tree if s sort of directly in line with the path between these two rocks but we cant see it from where we stand down here jess squirrel raced up the rock face of the badger peak like an arrow from a bow if s there matthias she called down i can see it the biggest fir tree in the world what a sight if s colossal the early noonday sun beat down on the summit of badger rock matthias jess and cheek stood atop the tall edifice looking down at the tree in the distance the warrior mouse grasped the rope jess had rigged come on lef s get down from here and get moving i want to arrive at that tree before the sun goes down i know exactly what to do and what to look out for now mattimeos eyes opened slowly he felt sick and groggy but above all frightened lifting his manacled paws he rubbed his eyes the last thing he remembered was being held whilst a hooded figure pressed something against his face the overpowering sweet sickness of it still hung upon his breath he had lost count of time though it was dark he felt he was in some sort of chamber and outside it might be night or day he had no way of knowing the creatures around him were groaning moving restlessly as the effects of the soporific wore off then the familiar heavy paw of auma touched his mattimeo is that you what happened where are we the badger asked worriedly i dont know if s too dark in here feels like a kind of stone room like ambrose spikes wine cellar at redwall i dont like it if s cold too are the rest of us all here the others had awakened and they dragged themselves over to the sound of aumas voice though their presence was of small comfort the young mouse could not shake off the dread aura surrounding him a shrew whimpered in the darkness then the ja igle of keys outside warned them that some creature was about to enter a torch flared and they covered their eyes against the brightness of the light shadows danced about the stone walls as the torchbearer entered it was a rat in a long purple robe his eyes glinted dully in the flames from the torch and when he spoke his voice was flat in tone but menacing and imperious i am nadaz voice of the host he said do not move or dare to talk with me or you will regret it nadaz commands the breath that comes from your mouth i am the power of life and death over all of you there is no light in here nor is there food and water you will be left in this place until i decide that you are fit to use your eyes again to eat and to drink malkariss has spoken the light was extinguished with the slam of the door and the turn of the key who is malkariss cynthia asked her voice sounded hollow and scared tess grasped her paw in the darkness im certain well find that out soon enough slagar followed nadaz they passed through tunnels and rooms with vitch trailing nervously behind some of the chambers and corridors they walked along had obviously been built a long time ago by master craftsbeasts other were crude hacked and gouged from the earth with boulders hardpacked soil and severed tree roots showing in the light of the torches which burnt in wall brackets throughout the strange place a long winding passage gave way to a broad rock ledge and vitch gazed around in awe crystal and mica deposits in the rocks reflected the torchlights of a huge wheelshaped chandelier and on the brink of the ledge stood a colossal statue hewn from white limestone it was the standing figure of a monstrous white polecat with teeth of crystal and glittering eyes of black jet beyond it the ledge dropped away to the depths of the earth around the walls winding down to the deeps was a narrow carved stairway which started from the left side of the ledge losing itself in the misty green light below nadaz beckoned slagar and vitch to stand on a groove in the rock some distance away from the statue the purplerobed rat moved slowly with bended head until he stood close to the figure who comes near malkariss a sibilant voice echoed from between the crystal teeth nadaz answered keeping his head bowed it is nadaz voice of the host o king of the deep lord of the abyss defier of the sun the fox slagar has returned bringing many creatures young and strong to work in your realm beneath the earth there was a pause then the voice from the statue spoke again who is the other one nadaz went to slagar and a whispered conversation took place the purplerobed rat returned to his former position he is a young rat named vitch the fox says that if it pleases you he is a gift to serve in the ranks of the host he is not born to the host our ways are not known to him the voke was curt and dismissing a rat that comes from the place of woodlands is of no use to us chain him with the slaves two blackrobed rats appeared out of the shadows they seized vitch and chained him dragging him off as he screamed at slagar save me dont let them do this to me i was loyal to you i served you well help me slagar the masked fox did not even turn to look at vitch he stared at nadaz and shrugged i thought he might have been useful being a rat like yourself the voice cut short further conversation between slagar and nadaz keep the new slaves in darkness without food until i decide they are fit to work hunger and lack of light is a sound lesson for creatures that have known freedom in the woodlands ask the fox what he wants of me nadaz conferred with slagar again malkariss allpowerful one slagar says to remind you of your promise when he brought you the last slave workers that you give all the land above ground to him from the gorge to the south boundaries of your realm he says he will serve your interests faithfully and be your voice above ground tell the masked one to be patient awhile take him down below and show him the work that is being done to complete my underworld kingdom i will watch him for a time and when i have made up my mind that his voice above ground would serve me as well as yours does beneath the earth then i will send for him slagar could hardly wait for nadaz to walk back to him he had heard the voice of malkariss clearly listen rat tell your master that ive kept my side of the bargain he promised me that land now you go and tell him i have a right to the territory nadaz rattled the skull on his sceptre the masked fox was suddenly surrounded by the blackrobed rats with their short stabbing spears held ready the voice of the host confronted slagar you dont tell me anything fox you have no rights here and never dare to make demands upon malkariss your audience is over come with me now if the lord of the abyss wants to reward you he will do it in due time until then keep a rein on your tongue feeling far from satisfied the masked fox was led away down the curving causeway steps by nadaz and his servants the diamondpatterned skullmask moved this way and that as slagar descended into the green depths the steps wound down into the earth until they reached the cave bottom where the green light came from whatever fuel burned in the torches and braziers that dotted the vast and intricate workings the sly one was impressed dwellings had been hewn into the rock streets and avenues stretched before him some of them looked as if they were part of another building from another time groups of young woodlanders painfully thin and covered in rockdust worked beneath the whips of their cruel taskmasters dragging boulders and cutting and dressing stones into square and oblong blocks slagar caught a glimpse of some huge unearthlylooking creature that he could not identify nadaz urged him past a band of slaves mixing mortar and cement strangely shaped amphitheatres and high arched caverns gave way to a halflit passage then the party halted in front of a wall carved upon it in relief was a weird and curious mural with the figure of malkariss at its center nadaz turned to him this is the limit of our workings go now my blackrobes will take you to your chamber and there you must wait until lord malkariss gives his decision you are fortunate fox apart from the creatures i command you are the only one who has set eyes upon the underground world as the blackrobed rats led slagar away he watched nadaz from the corner of his slitted hood the purplerobed rat touched the left paw of the carved polecat and the figure swung inwards as nadaz went through slagar managed to see a shaft of light on the other side before the carving was pushed back into place the sly one made a mental note that this was a secret exit then in silence he allowed himself to be led back up the causeway steps slagar neither liked nor trusted malkariss and nadaz but he was confident that he could outthink them both one day he would rule all of this land above and below ground at present he was content to wait the delivery of the slaves had gained him entrance to this strange world malkariss would probably think he was an efficient servant and promotion would follow slagar would bide his time he was nobeasfs servant only one position interested the masked fox complete and utter ruler the afternoon had begun fading away in pinktinged sunlight when matthias and his friends arrived at the tree it was a giant pine standing alone orlando stood and stretched to his full height against it by the stripes if s so big it makes me feel like a pebble against a mountain ill bet itd take a lot of otters tail to tip to go round a trunk this size eh cheek the young otter patted the immense girth of the bole ill say it would have you ever seen one like this before jess the squirrel shook her tail in admiration never if s a wonderful sight pity it stands alone because you can only climb up it or down you couldnt leap to another tree the nearest ones are over there see where matthias is heading hey warrior where are you off to i thought you wanted to see this tree matthias walked in a straight line with a measured pace keeping his eyes to the ground if s not the tree i wanted to see only its shadow basil caught up with him what dyou want with a bally shadow old lad matthias kept walking deliberately remember the rhyme face the lord who points the way after noon on summers day right the tree is the lord who points the way and if s gone noon nearly evening the shadows are at their longest now look at our shadows theyre much longer than we are so if the tree is the biggest thing around it has the longest shadow i have an idea that where this shadow ends well find what were looking for the rest of the searchers rushed to join him like creatures in some solemn procession they walked along with heads bowed following the path of the giant pines shadow it ended upon a humped rock sticking from the heath a short way from a copse they gathered around the rock so here it is well what now matthias banged upon it with his sword hilt it sounded quite solid logalog scratched it jess jumped upon it orlando tried to push it in various ways they all tried to make the rock yield up its secret to no avail basil lay flat on his back on top of it staring up at the rapidly fading day dont think much of your idea old chap bit of a damp squib wot a rocks a rock and thaf s all this one is matthias stubbed his paw against the stone ouch listen im convinced that this is it this is where the poem says that death will open up its grave just as well we never found it cheek gulped basil leapt from the rock aha but we might yet ive remembered something too our old eating game from the border scouts and foot fighters regiment you see we used to put out a great plate of food each all heaped up as high as theyd go now the one that threw the longest shadow won it all never took part meself foods far too serious to gamble with but on summers day that was different i knew id win then because you get the longest shadows of all on summers day matthias was becoming impatient summers day what summers day basil summer is full of days so tis jabez stump interrupted but to us old woodlanders theres only one summers day right in the middle orlando nodded wisely aye thaf s midsummers day my dad told me that thank you matthias sighed but where does all that get us we dont know how far the shadow would fall on midsummers day no we dont jess agreed however we could make an educated guess at least we can see the direction the shadow of the tree is going they spread out in a straight line from the end of the pine shadow of course the tree might have been even taller at the time the poem was written jess called out its very old and it could have lost a bit off the top in a storm or something i wonder where the shadow would have ended it was in the copse one of logalogs shrews was first to find it he held up his paw over here look he shouted excitedly a carved stone step screened by bushes was what they had searched for a tew sweeps of orlandos axe cleared die surrounding bush revealing similar steps a whole flight of them ran out of sight down into the ground matthias traced the less worn edge of the first step carefully with his paw he looked up at them with a stunned expression on his face i know what this place is orlando peered at the lettering loamhed what does it mean matthias sat upon the step his paw at the spot where the word ended the rest of it has been worn away this was loamhedge the mice who founded redwall with martin the warrior came from loamhedge abbey they left because of the great sickness that brought death to many creatures i can remember when i was a little mouse at my history lessons great abbot mortimer told me of the founders abbess germaine brought the brothers and sisters from a place called loamhedge abbey but where exactly it lay nobeast knew now we have found it matthias pushed away the overgrown grass from the side of the step exposing a standing line of carved mice the middle one was missing he drew from his belt the talisman that the old rabbit had given him it fitted neatly into the center space see heres the missing one that fuddled old rabbit knew where old loamhedge once was and he gave me this because it was the only thing of value he possessed maybe he too was a slave one time and managed to escape from here who knows great abbot mortimer used to say that loamhedge was a building that was nearly as large as redwall abbey orlando tapped the step with his axe handle whats it doing down there are they the cellar steps jabez stump looked about the copse no they couldnt be if this loamhedge place had been destroyed the land would have been covered in debris and great buildin stones this must have happened at the dancin of the cliffs orlando scratched his stripes im completely baffled now an abbey called loamhedge that was here but isnt now and dancing of the diffs whats it all about we stumps lived in south mossflower by the cliffs longer than anybeast jabez explained my old grandpa used to tell me about the days of josh stump his greatgreatgreatgrandpa they say one day long ago our family lived atop of that cliff but it started ashakin an tremblin as if the whole cliffs were dancin when it stopped old josh stump he said i wont live atop of no dancin cliffs no more and he took the family to live down in mossflower woods never a stump went up em again until i did to search for young jube recognition dawned upon matthias of course it must have been an earthquake long ago that was what caused the great gorge we crossed yes and those gardens we passed through no creature ever had gardens and orchards on such bumpy land the earth had shifted you see what happened loamhedge abbey must have been swallowed up when the ground moved these steps would be dormitory stairs or attic steps and the whole building must have just dropped straight down into its own cellars maybe even further with the great weight of it all ironbeak was determined to confront the ghost he gave the sentries a night off taking mangiz with him he stood at the sentry post in the galleries as the last crimson sunburst hit the windows of redwall abbey bathing the floor in a glorious deep rosecolored light mangiz watched it through swollen eyelids mayhap the mouse in armour will not walk until the middle of the night my general he said wearily yarrak mayhap it does not walk at all fool mayhap it does not exist that is what i have brought you here to prove tired eyes of dozy rooks will see frogs fly or atones lay eggs i am ironbeak i know better than to believe such things so should you mangiz held his counsel deciding discretion was the better part of valor the sparrow who had been watching them from a slit window made his report to cornflower and constance bird say you no come black crow worm no so sure both wait above great hallplace now baby rollo was having imaginary adventures dressed in the helmet of the warrior he waved the sword frantically singing aloud kill a bird wivout a word hit a black rook wiv a heavy book bang a crow an make him go cornflower relieved him of the wooden sword stop waving that thing about rollo youll put somebeasf s eye out with it so the general is waiting for the ghost to walk again let him wait when it gets dark enough he wont be disappointed the spirit of martin the warrior will roam abroad constance gently polished the burnished breastplate you must be careful he wont be as easy to fool as those two last night think we need a more intricate plan this time cornflower laughed good then lef s sit here a good kmg while and think up a clever scheme dont forget it was our turn on supper duty tonight but well be excused because were working for the abbey war effort john churchmouse and ambrose spike will have to cook the supper constance stifled a giggle oh no john and ambrose therell be war in the kitchen when those two meet over the cooking pots right down to business lets get our thinking caps on the rooks of general ironbeak were perched in the dormitory they listened in awed silence as grubclaw and ragwing related their encounter with the abbey ghost especially as the two rooks were not above adding bits to make it a good story now that ironbeak and mangiz were not there hakka it was dark out there last night i could feel in my feathers that something was going to happen ragdaw began kraak me too it was darker and gloomier than the bottom of a northland well so ragwing and i stood sentry with beaks and daws at the ready for any funny business didnt we bird grubdaw added aye we did that then suddenly grubdaw says to me ragwing can you see that shadow down there how could you see a shadow if it was pitchblack a rook interrupted well er er it was the moonlight coming in through the windows yes thafs right it was the moonlight anyhow the rook butted in again kaah what a load of old eggshells it was dark as a northland well but with moonlight shining through the windows grubclaw ruffled his feathers airily kragga who is telling this you or us we know what we saw but we can keep it to ourselves if you start making fun of us ttie other rooks silenced the interrupter we saw a shadow in the moonlight ragwing continued well at first we thought it was a shadow but when we looked closer it was an earthcrawler grubclaw nodded solemnly a ghost mouse all in armour it seemed to appear from nowhere crook it was carrying a long sword and it had no face it moved like a feather in the breeze i think it was floating dont you ragwing yes it definitely floated and another thing it carried the long sword as if it weighed nothing it must have had great spirit strength the cold lights burned from its eyes like fire in ice i thought you said it had no face how could it have burning eyes yaggah will you shut your beak and listen it was it was er the white moonlight shining on it yes it made the face that this ghost didnt have look like two burning eyes haak we saw it i swear on my egg and nest isnt that right mate true true it seemed to know we were watching it because it turned to face us we perched there ready to attack if the ghost mouse tried anything and did it try anything i mean krakkah did it well it pointed with this great sharp sword and said teath to all who stay in the redhouse aye thats the very words it said but the voice kaah it was like thunder over mountains i wonder you lot didnt hear it we were sleeping so what did you do haak ill tell you what we did we shook our daws at it and said you come any closer ghost and youu have us to deal with stop there while we go and bring general ironbeak our chief grubwing embroidered aye we backed off ready to give a good fight if it came floating up to the galleries ironbeak and mangiz came out mangiz was shaking like a fledgling whose mother has left it ragwing added what did ironbeak do kaah him he flew about a bit and could not find the ghost so he said he didnt believe us and flew off to get some sleep so where did the ghost mouse go to yakkah i dont know to the place where other ghost mice go i suppose you mean there might be others kagg im not saying anything but i wouldnt be surprised at all the big door was open wide ironbeak couldnt deny that the conversation carried on getting more horrific with each imagined detail until some of ironbeaks fighters decided that conquering the redstone house was not such a good idea did you see mangiz today he was badly knocked about yagg do you think the ghosts had something to do with it ambrose spike threw a careless pawful of hotroot into the simmering watershrimp soup john churchmouse glared at the hedgehog over the top ofhis steamedup glasses ambrose the recipe says half a spoon of hotroot why didnt you measure it the old hedgehog bustled john to one side dont tell me how to make shrimp and hotroot soup i learned my recipe from otters a pawful thaf s what you need lef s see if mat roseleaf and cowslip custard is ready dont you dare touch my custard you roughpawed cellar keeper if be ruined if you open that oven too soon come away ambrose could not get past john to open the oven he snorted and began furiously kneading nuts into a batch of honeysuckle scones john rugged his whiskers in despair honeysuckle scones have a delicate flavour all of their own sister agness recipe calls for beechnuts but youve put acorns and hazelnuts in where did those beechnuts i shelled go to ambrose wrinkled his snout and kneaded faster oh those i ate em there was only a few im very partial to a beechnut now and again john clapped a paw to his brow you didnt wash your paws the whole batch will taste of hotroot ambrose grinned wickedly so what ginger em up a bit give them more blackberry wine to drink and they wont notice the difference come on quillpusher get those onions peeled john flung down his oven cloth peel them yourself barrelminder late that night a breeze sprang up clouds scudded across the moon sending shifting patterns over the abbey floor beneath ironbeak and mangiz the methuselah and matthias bells rang briefly stopping abruptly to leave an eerie silence in their wake how can the bells toll when we have the earthcrawlers trapped in that room below mangiz murmured to ironbeak kagga hold your beak ironbeak silenced him i dont know how they rang the bells and i dont care it might be a diversion to stop us watching here keep your eyes on the floor below over by the big door they waited and watched so did the rooks from the dormitory who had sneaked out on to the far corner of the galleries curiosity had overcome their generals command to stay in the dormitory they had to see for themselves the main abbey door creaked on its hinges slowly opening the raven and the crow held their breath as they watched it a few dried leaves drifted in on the sighing breeze pale moon patterns swayed on the worn stone floor and the darkness in shadowy corners seemed to grow deeper the tomblike silence was broken by a voice like rolling thunder death waits in this place for those who stay mangiz felt the feathers on his back rise as if a cold paw had touched them the ghostly phantom appeared it came in slowly by the doorway halted looked up at ironbeak and pointed with the sword see general there it is the armoured mouse mangiz exclaimed ironbeak buffeted the crow savagely shuttup idiot im going to deal with this once and for all the raven went into a short run he hurled himself over the galleries and sped towards the floor of great hall the apparition took one pace backward and vanished completely there was a cry of horror from the rooks general ironbeak skidded to a halt landing clumsily in his haste he bowled over in a bundle of feathers swiftly regaining his balance he dashed outside it was mere seconds since the ghost had disappeared but the grounds in front of the abbey were completely deserted ironbeak whirled about baffled he tore at the grass with his talons before rushing back inside hither and thither he darted about on the floorstones finally he halted his powerful frame heaving with exertion looking upward he sought something to vent his rage upon the rooks in the corner of the gallery they cackled as they dashed to get back to the dormitory but ironbeak was swiftly among them lashing out left and right tearing with his claws slamming with strong wings and hitting out with his vicious beak yaggah krakkah why did you not fly down and catch the thing you were closer than i was get back to your perches you swamp flies go on out of my sight you softbeaked craven you will forget what you saw here it was only a trick of the moonlight if i hear one bird speak of it i will break his wings the rooks fled the scene with ironbeak chasing them mangiz slipped away quietly from the other end of the galleries not wanting to face his generals rage great hall lay quiet and still once more behind the halfopen door constance and foremole folded the black doth which they had used to make cornflower vanish the three redwallers slid silently from the great hall out into the tunnel and back to cavern hole where supper was set out ready for them the abbot took the sword from cornflower as she unbuckled the armour well how did it go he asked anxiously perfect father abbot i appeared the birds were terrified the raven flew at me it was perfect ironbeak flew at you how did you escape easily constance and foremole tossed the black doth over me i dodged round the door and we all hid behind it ironbeak searched outside and inside but he didnt look behind the door foremole wrinkled his nose yurr these scones tastes loik otroot burr gimme watter there be enuff otroot in yon soops to set afire to youm ambrose gave him a look of injured dignity try some of the roseleaf and cowslip custard the abbot prodded it gingerly oh is that what it is i thought it was a collapsed birds nest ambrose sniffed and went off to the wine cellar with his snout in the air well i enjoyed it you lot dont deserve a good cook night had fallen over the copse matthias and orlando sat upon the step putting an edge to axe and sword against the stone shrews filled their sting pouches basil ate his fill and cheek and jess fashioned javelins hardening their points over the campfire daggers swords and knives were tested bows made from strong green boughs arrows tipped and hardened in the fire it was but a few hours to dawn when all the preparations were completed they lay down to take a brief rest before they slept matthias jess orlando and jabez stood above the stone step they held paws foursquare and swore a solemn oath at dawn we will go down those steps we will not come back up without our young ones nor will we come up if the fox still lives orlando turned to the five shivering weasel captives and pointed his axe at them get yourselves ready because youll be going down first the fighting rooks of general ironbeak were badly frightened at first it had been exciting to perch and talk of the ghost when none of them really believed there was one but now they had seen it with their own eyes a terrifying phantom that uttered dire warnings ironbeak himself could not harm it the tiling had vanished completely in a trice all through the night the sentry posts had been deserted while the rooks huddled together in the darkened dormitory whispering of the awesome event grubclaw and ragwing had been right so had the wise mangjz the great redstone house was a bad place to be the advent of a golden sunlit morning did little to change their minds that task was left to general ironbeak and he set about it with gusto sunrays flooded through the broken dormitory window turning the raven leaders black wings an iridescent green flecked with tinges of blue he paced up and down with an aggressive rolling gait as he confronted his command yaggah you cuckoobrained bunch can you not see it is all a trick the earthcrawlers are playing on us the rooks shifted uneasily inspecting their feathers or staring down at their daws some of them looked to mangjz but the crow had distanced himself from the whole thing by perching upon a cupboard with his eyes dosed ironbeak carried on ranting kaah i flew down to attack this socalled ghost and did it strike me dead did it attack me did it even stay to defend its abbey no it hid away by some silly little trick it fooled you all but it did not fool ironbeak nor did it scare him i am the greatest fighter in all the northlands an earthcrawler mouse with bits of metal does not scare me i will face it right now or in the middle of a dark night mangiz is what i say true the seer crow opened one eye he knew better than to argue with the raven leader the mighty ironbeak fears no living thing he speaks true baby rollo was taking cooking lessons brother dan and gaffer were teaching him to make breakfast pancakes of chestnut flour and greensap milk studded with dried damson pieces preserved in honey sugar the infant bankvole was far more concerned with the tossing of the pancakes than the mixing of them brother dan was up to his paws in the sticky mixture and blobs of it dung to his ears and nosetip gaffer discovered he had a sweet tooth for preserved damson pieces the mole sorted through the supply for the choicest bits and promptly ate them winifred the otter caught all three of them like guilty young ones as she entered the kitchen whats the holdup out here theres a lot of hungry creatures waiting for breakfast out in the well swish my tail what in the good name of bulrushes is going on rollo stop sticking those pancakes to the ceiling this instant rollo was in the act of throwing a pancake from the pan at the ceiling he stopped and the pancake flopped neatly over his head covering him to the neck another pancake slowly detached itself from the ceiling and began to fall winifred grabbed a plate and ran to catch it brother dan stop playing round with that batter like a hedgehog in mud and help me winifred caught the falling pancake as brother dan took a plate in his sticky paws and went after another potential dropper gaffer began trying to remove the pancake from baby rollos head the infant had eaten a hole in it to give himself some breathing space sensibly gaffer began eating from between rollos ears hurr baint gonna pull thisn offa youm rollyo best scoff away bothn uz til it be gone hurr hurr cornflower appeared in the kitchen doorway she tried to look very forbidding while at the same time doing her best to stifle the laughter that was bubbling through at the comical scene shame on all four of you hahaha er hmph what on earth are you doing heeheehee ahem gaffer will you stop trying to eat that infants head and remove the pancake with some flouflouhahahahaoheehee flour as she spoke a pancake dropped from the ceiling squarely onto her nose and hung there like a tabledoth the five of them sat down upon the kitchen floor laughing uproariously holding their aching sides as tears rolled unchecked down their cheeks waaaahahahahohohoheeheehee if s a good job we hadnt ordered porridge for breakfast hoohoohurrhurrhurr nor soo soo hurr hurr soup missus the happy laughter rang spontaneously out it was a great relief to have a pause of merriment after so much siege and sorrow far out upon the western plain a great dark red bird crashed to earth among the dandelions and kingcups and lay among the yellow flowers like a red sandstone rock the great birds sides heaved and her neck pulsed as she greedily sucked in air her eyes dilated and contracted fearsome orbs of tawny umber flecked with turquoise and centered with gleaming black as she scanned the blue sky above for predators one wing tucked neatly across her back the other hanging limply at her side she made a flapping run and gained the air the red bird flew with a painful rolling motion the injured wing flopping lower than the good one flight was becoming too difficult to sustain so she came to earth again this time in a rolling heap of feathers as she struck the plain floor scattering buttercup petals in all directions the great bird rested momentarily her huge curved beak gaping open tongue hanging to one side doggedly struggling to her legs she walked for a while the injured wing trailing limply in the dust her eyes fixed upon the building in the distance at the woodland edge it was not so open there her beloved mountains were too far away so she would try to make the building before sunset there would be places where she could lie and rest nooks and crannies where she could not be caught out the open plains made her feel vulnerable in flight she was a redoubtable hunter and fighter but crippled like this she could only keep low and hope there were no flocks of other birds abroad that would relish the chance to attack an injured bird on the ground flapping and hopping scrambling and crawling the great red bird made her way east towards the buding which offered refuge on the far flung south reaches of the plateau lands dawn broke placidly over the copse matthias rose and picked up his sword a good day to settle business orlando the badger shouldered his axe we travelled a long way to see this dawn my friend a good day all around shrews were girding themselves up for war bows arrows slings lances even dubs were got ready as basil lugged the five weasel prisoners along on a makeshift lead they wailed pitifully no no please dont make us go down there well be killed we wont stand a chance we have no weapons well be slain basil tugged the lead sharply cmon step lively there you wingeing weasels youve lived like cowards try to die like heroes hmph fat chance o that eh laddie buck stop snivellin and wipe your nose you villainous vermin they broke away from basils grasp and flung themselves in front of matthias grovelling shamelessly spare us please sir spare us sir harry flapped down from an alder theres nothing affects a craven like the thought of sudden death the idea he might not see the night or draw another breath orlando kicked a weasel in the rump as he stepped over the prostrate creatures you know matthias these scum arent going to be a bit of good down there theyll probably give the game away with all their sobbing and bawling shuttup you snivelling snotnoses or ill finish you here and now the weasels fell silent matthias leaned on his sword stroking his whiskers youve got a good point there orlando but what do we do with them if we dont send them ahead of us on the stairs orlando hefted his battleaxe let me finish em off now and save a lot of trouble the weasels began moaning afresh stop that crying cxyou hear me stoppit matthias snorted impatiently right heres what well do orlando i couldnt let you kill them in cold blood that isnt our way well set them going southward sir harry would you accompany them on their way to make sure they keep going sorry about this but there probably wont be a lot of space down there for you to fly about and youd get into trouble under the ground sir harry shrugged as you wish as you wish matthias we each have a role to be filled ill take these weasels south for a bit but the first one to cry gets killed the owl picked the lead rope up in his beak and flapped off with the five weasels stumbling and hurrying behind him basil watched them go pity about old harry he looked a bit peeved to me dyou think hes gone off in a huff matthias the warrior mouse nodded ive no doubt he has dont worry hell be back meanwhile id like a last word with everybeast gather round and listen to what i have to say to you the small army squatted in the copse while matthias stood on the top stair of old loamhedge and addressed them first i want to thank you all for your help and for coming this far with me you have left your homes and territories far behind orlando jess jabez and myself have good reason to live or die today you see we have young ones to rescue the rest of you i cannot ask you to sacrifice your lives for our cause they are not your young ones down there basil stag hare stood up beg pardon old lad but young tim and tess are down there whaf d my old chum john churchmouse and his good lady wife say if i came back emptypawed without their young uns coming with you ill say i am bucko you try and stop b s hare esquire cheek stood by the hare im with basil hes a grumpy ol frump and i like him so there basil and cheek went to stand with matthias logalog drew his short sword shrews and guosim are friends of redwall i never started a job that i didnt finish i go with you the whole of the guosim moved as one with logalog to stand at matthiass side orlando raised his huge axe his voice was tight with eagerness as he called come on warrior what are we waiting for mattimeo and the slaves had been taken from their darkened cell nadaz and several blackrobed rats led them to the edge of the ledge where the statue stood they were permitted to look over into the depths through the greenish mist mattimeo could make out the thin bedraggled forms of scores of young creatures squirrels otters hedgehogs mice they were hauling huge blocks of stone on towropes and rats stood guard over them with whips and cudgels urging them with heavy blows to greater efforts other young ones were lifting the stone blocks into position with pulleys and tackles while yet other young woodlanders laid mortar and limestone cement in the gaps that were to receive the stones sometimes a young creature would cry out and fall over exhausted only to be beaten by the rats until he or she got up or lay permanently still numbed by the horror of it the new slaves were led before the statue and forced to bow their heads whilst nadaz spoke to malkariss i am nadaz voice of the host o ruler of all below earth these are your new servants what do you require me to do with them the hairs rose on mattimeos neck at the sound of the voice emanating from the crystaltoothed statues mouth they have looked upon my kingdom soon they will have the honour of building it for me it proclaimed from his bowed position mattimeo glanced along the line he saw vitch chained and held by two rats the young mouse nudged tess look whos there our little slavedriver being rewarded for his services i hope they chain me next to him for a while down there less stamped her paw hard against the ledge her eyes blazing they can chain me next to who they like but im not building any filthy underground kingdom for a talking statue the young churchmouses angry tones echoed around the rocky cavern there was a brief silence then malkariss spoke again take them back and lock them away without light food or water they are not ready to serve me yet as they were led up the gloomy winding passages tess began to weep oh im sorry i spoke out ive caused you all to be locked in the dark and starved again no you havent cynthia bankvole said bravely id rather starve than be beaten to death like those poor creatures auma seconded her aye dont worry tess if you hadnt spoken out i would have thafs it friends we stick together redwallll mattimeos voice rang out like the abbey bells he was knocked fiat with the butt of a spear before they were flung back into their darkened prison it was midafternoon and redwall lay quiet under the heat haze hardly a leaf stirred in the vasmess of mossflower beyond the north and east walls and the plains shimmered and danced making the horizon indistinguishable down below in cavern hole depression had set in it had started when little rollo and a baby fieldmouse wanted to go out to play naturally the abbot had to forbid any such idea with the birds about so ambrose spike took them to play down in his wine cellar cornflower fanned herself with a dockleaf the heat seemed to have penetrated the stones even down to cavern hole where it was usually cool poor rollo he did so want to go out to play on the grass i remember mattimeo tim and tess used to go out in the orchard sam squirrel would teach them to climb the apple and pear trees and that sweet chestnut over by the gooseberry patch abbot mordalfus mopped his brow with his habit sleeve ah yes he was a scamp that sam squirrel mind you so was i at their age i used to get sent off to bed for dashing around the top of the outer wall when i was a young one ha ha old sister fem used to say it gave her dizzy spells just watching me phew i dont know about rollo but i could certainly do with a stroll outside in the grounds if s hot in here mrs churdunouse dosed her eyes dreamily mmmm id love to be sitting dabbling my paws in the pond on an afternoon like this foremole tugged his snout obligingly burr ifn youm laydeez ud loik to wet youm paws oill take youm thro yon tunnel to pond winifred the otter sprang up what a good idea oh would you please let us go father abbot well be careful i promise we will the first sign of a rook and well pop into that hole like moles pardon the expression abbot mordalfus took his spectacles off smiling indulgently he settled back in his chair well if s pretty certain i wont get any rest with you chattering creatures about of course you may go but dont stay out too long and be very careful ill stop here and take a nap foremole was first into the tunnel age afore booty foller me gennelbeasts the abbot settled back in his chair with a sigh a ray of sunlight crossing great hall penetrated down the stairs across the barricade top and shone in his eyes he watched the small golden dust flecks dancing in it his eyes gradually dosing as he drifted into hs noontide nap cornflower came wriggling back down the tunnel followed by her companions she scurried from the entrance and not bothering to dust herself down began shaking the sleepy abbot by the paw wake up wake up father abbot quickly theyre attacking it the poor thing oh ifll be killed if we dont do something the abbot blinked and jumped up eh what attacking what poor thing where winifred grabbed his other paw a big rustycolored ft f bird much bigger than ironbeaks lot if s over by the pond and the rooks are attacking it oh im sure it isnt an invader weve got to help it the abbot leapt into action find constance quickly get any available moles and v bring them here a moment later constance rushed in from the i kitchens covered in flour with a bunch of scallions in her f paw she dimbed into the tunnel shouting orders everybeast stay here except the moles send them after me ill deal with this v in front of the pond the great red bird lay with one final effort she had flown over the outer abbey wall landing i with a thud on the soft gatehouse garden soil seeing the water glint in the afternoon sun she hauled herself painfully over to drink at the pond the throat of the great red bird was dry her tongue parched spots danced before her eyes crazily she staggered and i wobbled towards the water next instant she was harried by three rooks who descended upon her they pecked and dragged at the great red bird lashing out with their clawing talons half unconscious and defenceless she lay at their mercy foremole was awaiting constances arrival up the tunnel r oer thurr stroipmarm he said pointing to the scene of the attack theym akillen yon burd they gurt bullies constance hurtled from the tunnel and was upon the rooks before they knew what was happening she bulled the first one straight into the pond and cuffed the next one high into the air with a quick hefty paw the third rook took oft leaving most of his tailfeathers between the badgers teeth the attackers flew squawking through the broken dormitory window terrified to look back lest the big badger was coming after them swiftly constance began dragging the great red bird to the tunnel it raised its head feebly and tried to attack the badger constance narrowly avoided the fierce curved beak but took several scratches from the powerful talons before she stunned the already halfunconscious bird with a smart tap of her paw between its eyes sorry but if s for your own good you silly great thing here foremole which end do you want foremole scrambled from the tunnel leaving three of his crew ready to receive the burden youm leave et f me marm yurr jarge oim asendin burd in ead hirst save reverse feather draggen chuck yon rope round they daws oill tie beak gaffer be youm ready wi grease casen et be too woid in beam ironbeak and mangiz flew through the dormitory window with several rooks they landed where the attack had taken place the general looked particularly badtempered after being disturbed at his noontide roost yakkah first it is ghost mice now we have a great disappearing red bird where is it fools it was right there general we pecked it and scratched it yes yes and what happened then the big earthcrawler the stripedog it tried to slay us so you turned tail and flew off ironbeak said scornfully chief there was nothing else we could do that stripedog is a wild beast how long ago did this take place only a moment back ironbeak we were at the dormitory window when we saw this big rustylooking bird come over the wall it must have been ill because it flapped and flopped about like a new eggchick so you attacked it oh yes chief we gave it a good clawing and beaking and you killed it yes er no i mean we were going to when the earthcrawler came where did the stripedog come from search me ironbeak buffeted the insolent rook flat he ground his talons against its beak and pecked it hard upon its leg kaah out of my sight nettlehead i think the sun in this warm land has addled your brains first you see a great bird then you are attacked by the stripedog and mat was only the flick of a feather ago now there is no sign of the earthcrawler and the big bird has vanished too maybe they are both hiding underwater in that pool shall i throw you in so that you can search them out the stripedog has already done that by the look of grubclaw mangiz interrupted ironbeak shook his head sadly gaah you too you make me sick all of you watch this the raven spread his wings and hopped about near the pond cawing aloud earthcrawler rustybird come out and fight me it is i general ironbeak terror of the northlands there was no response the raven turned to mangiz and the rooks see it is the same as the ghost mouse get out of my sight the useless lot of you from the hidden tunnel entrance in the shrubbery by the rushes brother sedge chuckled quietly oh dear oh dear whatever next the great red bird was taken into ambrose spikes wine cellar it was cool and spacious there john churchmouse walked around it awestruck whew that is a large bird ive never seen one like it before what sort of bird do you think it is mordalfus the abbot looked up from the deep scratch he was attending to i dont know john this is a very strange bird it is not a woodlander nor does it live on the plain or we would have seen it from the abbey walls i wonder what brought it here sister may worked at the other side of the bird she laid herbs and dabbed lotions on wounds bandaging wherever possible poor thing shes taken quite a savage beating the bird kicked and tried to raise its head sister may leapt up oh dear look out shes coming round she warned the huge flecked eyes with their dark irises snapped open constance beckoned the onlookers away sister may abbot would you carry on with your healing the rest of you go back to cavern hole i dont want this creature to feel surrounded cornflower pass me those scissors please she snipped at the beak and leg fastenings we mean you no harm you are among friends lie still she said gently you have been hurt the bird groaned and lay back werra diss it asked in a strange accent the abbot recognized the tongue

now here with friends with habbot with sissismay sister may took the water from cornflower and held it up to the huge hunting bird thaf s all very well but youd better be on your best behaviour and my name is sister may say it sister may sissismay goodan very fierce with matthias and orlando in the vanguard and basil stag hare acting as scout the depleted shrew army padded silently down the steps to the kingdom of malkariss at first it was quite dark with the morning brightness filtering down only a short way but gradually the steps opened out on to a broad torchlit corridor they halted while basil scouted the lie of the land as they waited matthias took in his surroundings the wellfinished stone now coated with moss had once been an upperstory passage tree roots forced their way between the masonry causing some of the wall to buckle and bend outwards and water dripped from the roof forming small pools on the wellworn floor basil was back shortly with some information the blinkin place is worse than a great rabbit warren with corridors caves passages an tunnels all slopin downward too as for the enemy well if s rats again old lad they wear a black robe with a hood and their weapon appears to be a short kind o spear not the throwin kind you understand more your good old stabber they dont seem to carry any other type of weapon in a place this size there must be a lot of the blighters id guess matthias tried to form a plan in his head as he discussed the information with his friends wed best stay together no sense in splitting the force jess you cheek and jabez guard the rear and watch our backs orlando and logalog stay in front with me guosim have your javelins slings and bows ready if we run into a small bunch pick them off right away dont let them get back to their main force and report that were down here or well lose the element of surprise basil was there no sign of our young ones no fraid not they must be further down this bally maze somewhere ill keep my eyes open which way dyou suggest right or left along this passage orlando placed his axe on the floor and spun it right is as good as any way trust to luck they stole off right down the broad torchlit corridor nadaz brought slagar before the idol on the ledge the masked fox stood tensely awaiting the decision of malkariss from the depths below the sounds of young slaves toiling drifted upwards the sly one watched the statue of the huge white polecat wondering what sort of creature lived within it was it a polecat or a fox like himself slagar liked to think it was a fox he considered foxes to be the cleverest of animals the voice issuing from the monolith interrupted his thoughts nadaz you will tell the masked one that i have made my decision he is to be given fourscore rats and left to cany out my commands in the territory above my kingdom tell him that he will be watched closely i have many more blackrobes waiting to carry out my word more than leaves on an autumn wind if the fox plays me false he will be slain both him and his fourscore fighters if on the other paw he remains loyal to my bidding by the time the snow falls i will increase his command by ten times and set my slaves to build him a stone fortress above ground where he can rule all the territory from the cliffs to the south hinterlands malkariss has spoken go slagar quivered with excitement he had heard every word his silken mask fluttered in and out as he swelled his narrow chest revelling in the newfound power he had been given at a signal from nadazs bone sceptre the fourscore rats emerged from the winding causeway and took up their place behind the new commander many thoughts ran through slagars fertile mind as he inarched at their head alongside nadaz up the winding passages of old loamhedge toward the lands that awaited him in the morning sunlight his territory malkariss was no fool he thought the fourscore die with me if i prove false so he was providing himself with extra insurance the rrts in my command will be watching me closely and no doubt malkariss has issued them with secret orders to slay me if i try to cross him i will show him who the sly one really is after i am commander of a great horde with my own fortress i will make malkariss wish he had never met slagar i will trap him down inside his own underground kingdom and within a season he will either be dead or eating from my paw as for this one nadaz he is only a servant to the statue slagar serves no statue the sly one serves only his own ideas slagars plans had made no provision for what came next hounding the bend in a passage he found himself face to face with orlando the warrior badger gave a roar and swung his axe but nobeast was quicker than the masked fox in an emergency he ducked swiftly back into the ranks of his rats pushing the nearest two in the path of the swirling axehead matthias deflected a spear with his sword crouching low he fought his way into the ranks sword flashing as he went after his enemy logalog yelled and the guosim hurled a rain of stones and arrows at the rate nadaz fell flat then crawled back against the side of the wall springing up he grabbed a torch from its sconce and flung it among the attackers as he yelled retreat back to the ledge amid the milling confusion the clang of orlandos axe rang against the stone walls as he scythed madly at the rats who were trying to turn and run matthias had fought his way among the rats but lost sight of slagar turning he faced the rats who were trying to push past him blocking sweeping and hacking he battled away until he met orlando coming from the opposite direction logalog passed them both at the head of the guosim after them they stumbled over the bodies of fallen foes the passage was dark because nadaz was taking the torches from their holders as he went stumbling and banging against the walls the woodlanders dashed wildly through the inky blackness guided by the sounds of the retreating rats ahead of them light showed from the back of the column and they made way for cheek who had thoughtfully retrieved the torch thrown by nadaz and swung it back into blazing life now that they could see where they were going the attackers ran pellmell downwards through winding passages and deserted halls heedlessly past a heavily locked timber door mattimeo sat up in the darkness listen whafs that somethings going on out there he said excitedly they crowded round the door banging and shouting in here in here help us were redwallers but they were shouting to an empty corridor the sounds of the chase died away into the distance the hunted rats broke out on to the ledge with slagar and nadaz in the lead ignoring ceremony the purplerobed rat shouted towards the idol enemies a badger and a mouse with a band of woodlanders they are right behind us the voice from the idol rang out this is your doing fox you were followed here i will deal with you later nadaz tell your fighters to surround this statue sound the alarm throw the whole weight of my host against these impudent intruders the rats formed themselves in a cordon around the idol spears pointing outwards nadaz dashed to the far side of the ledge and began pounding on a deep circular drum to sound the alarm slagar did not wait for the attackers to arrive he slunk off quickly down the winding causeway stairs pointing to the blackrobed rats who charged past him on their way up hurry to the ledge everybeast malkariss wants you he told them redwall mossflower logalogalogalog the woodlanders came roaring out of the passage on to the ledge logalog and the guosim charged thr rats defending the statue but they were quickly repulsed by the fanatical dedication of the fighters with their stabbing spears more rats were already on the platform of the ledge matthias gasped with shock a countless horde was pounding its way up the stairs of the causeway he had not realized the numbers were so vast like seething black ants they swarmed up from the misty green depths without thinking he threw himself at the foremost group orlando and jess ran to help him the squirrel armed with a short shrew sword drive them back weve got to stop them getting onto this ledge matthias shouted a spear thrust nipped orlandos muzzle and blood sprang to his nosetip eeeeeuuulaliaaaaa the maddened badger went in like a battering ram rats who tried to back out of his way were driven over the edge of the ledge and plunged screaming into the green misted depths matthias was filled with battle rage he tried hard to keep a level head using all the timehonored skills of the true warrior swordsmouse sweep slice deave thrust he worked like a machine relentlessly battling great odds jess was different she leapt and bounded stabbing left and right blood flowing from her tail like a scarlet ribbon though the stabbing spears were unwieldy at any great range they were proving effective at dose quarters none of the blackrobes spoke or shouted they formed flying wedges charging individual attackers often breaking to surround them in a stabbing ring of spearpoints logalog had been driven back twice at the second attempt he fell wounded in the throat by a spear basil stag hare leapt into the breach righto guosim lads form three ranks over here front and center now look lively slings and bows only fire drop down an reload keep advancin thats the style fire drop down reload but keep movin to your front sharpish now good show the rats were forced to break their circle and came round to defend the front of the statue from basils strategy the hare was a veteran at manoeuvres he gathered a small force of shrews carrying javelins i say young cheek heres your first chance at a command take these fellahs to the back of the ledge work your way round that dirty great statue tiling and come up behind those rodents facin us give em plenty of the old onetwo and dont forget mlad duck an weave cheek saluted smartly his fear diminished with the heat of battle righto baz old sport basil watched him go shaking his head and smiling hardnosed young blighter bit like mself when i was a nipper he thought tire now drop down an reload shrews thats the stuff f give the troops the battle raged back and forth as nadaz pounded the war alarm the booming drumbeats echoed around the rocks as arrows flew stingers hurled and spears stabbed matthias looked wildly about amid the melee his forces were vastly outnumbered and still rats were waiting on the causeway steps in droves breaking dear of the fray the warrior mouse yelled aloud retreat retreat take your wounded and get back to the passage we came in by the guosim carried logalog as they hacked their way back to the mouth of the passage oriando jess and jabez stood side by side with cheek as basil fought a fierce rearguard action matthias weaving in and out of them helped with the wounded finally they gained the passage the drum stopped pounding and the rats fell back halfway across the ledge protecting the causeway steps as their comrades swarmed up spreading across the length and breadth of the rocky plateau in the midst of it all nadaz stood rattling the mouse skull at the top of his sceptre p inting at the woodlanders as if trying to cast some sort of spell over them orlando cleaned his axe and set about sharpening it against the rock wall well we gave them a good fight even though we were outnumbered he said consolingly the warrior mouse sat with his back to the wall breathing heavily aye if we had the young ones now we could back up and go above ground trouble is i havent seen them anywhere the badger licked a wounded paw nor have i or the fox for that matter im not leaving here while he still lives then if i cant find my auma at least ill know he wont enslave any more young ones cheek stood at the mouth of the passage pulling faces at the ranks of blackrobes gathered a short distance away yah tatty ratty your silly old statue isnt worth a crushed acorn it takes a horde of you to face real fighters doesnt it he taunted mem basil and jess were trying to bandage the awful wound in logalogs neck which was deep and serious basil shook his head will listen to that young rip shortly well all be slaughtered and there he is calling names like a volemaid at a tea party haha the little bucko good for him i say old logatfung stay still youll only make that scratch worse know the shrew leader pawed at the wet bandage around his neck he was panting hard if s a bad one mate im out of it he said rasping harshly basil waggled his ears encouragingly poppycock old lad well have you as good as new shortly logalog pushed himself into a standing position and turned to matthias wheres flugg i must see him matthias ive got to go up into the daylight i dont want to die down here in mis dark place matthias grasped his friend firmly by the paw i understand logalog you go up top and rest youll be all right flugg will you and some of the others take logalog up into the daylight easy now mind his neck matthias look orlando was standing on a protruding wall rock craning his neck theyve let a sort of a rope over the side of the ledge and theres a large basket on the end of it looks to me as if theyre lowering something down i wonder what it is matthias shrugged your guess is as good as mine listen orlando pretty soon now theyre going to attack i can feel it we might hold out for a bit but well end up being overwhelmed i have an idea that might buy a bit of time for us then if all fails at least our creatures might make a run for it and escape standing out from the cave entrance matthias pointed his sword at nadaz you there rat i challenge you to single combat he shouted nadaz continued chanting and shaking his grisly sceptre the warrior mouse tried again youre afraid its all right when you have your horde with you but on your own ha youre nothing but a coward send anybeast out then i am matthias of redwall i am a warrior who does not know fear are there any among you like me or are you all spineless scum the blackrobed rats turned to look at nadaz youre not saving my acorns warrior orlando whispered fiercely i stay down here with you until the end ill fight their champion matthias smiled shaking his head orlando ou are the bravest creature i have ever known no my friend they know you could beat any one of them thats why i offered to fight there must be quite a few of them whod fancy their chances against a warrior my size but if you must stay then so be it when i fall you can guard the passage and buy our friends a bit of extra time to escape orlando placed a heavy paw upon matthias champion of redwall you may be a mouse but your heart is far bigger than mine look out somethings happening over there nadaz was now pointing his sceptre at the causeway the rats on the steps made way and they seemed to shrink back against the rock walls in fear matthias gripped his sword hilt tighter and his breath caught in his chest it was a huge rodent somewhere between a ferret and a stoat the beast looked like a primeval throwback it had no ears and practically no neck the hulking head perched squat upon its heavy shoulders leered evilly through curved and stained teeth sinew and muscle stood out like great cords all over its body and heavy spiked iron bands ringed its paws and waist it carried a stabbing spear of fearsome size and a weighted net nadaz made an evil sniggering noise matthias of redwall who fears nobeast this is your challenger wearet the slavemaster sister may and cornflower had tried to feed stryk with abbey fare but the red kite was no vegetarian so they finally compromised by giving the great hunting bird a net of watershrimp stryk had taken to the comer of the wine cellar and she settled down to sleep on a pile of moss and sacking stay out of mr spikes wine cellar little one sister may warned baby rollo never go down there alone we cant take chances with a bird like that one huh hope it doesnt get a taste for october ale or elderberry wine great hulkin thing like thatd empty my cellar ambrose spike grumbled into an apple and blackberry pie wedge the abbot looked over the top of his spectacles no quicker than the average cellarkeeper could empty a larder youre right sister may stryk is a fine big bird but she is not used to our ways pity about her wing shes very proud did you see the way she got huffy when i remarked that it was broken id like to take a look at it sometime cornflower stopped rollo roaming in the direction of the wine cellar and sat the mischievous infant on her lap poor thing sister may said sympathetically apparently she buut her nest on a piece of branch sticking out from the mountain then one night the branch rotted and the nest fell she struck her wing awkwardly on a jagged rock and broke it stryk said that she lay in the ruined nest for many days unable to move she had no mate to defend her and she was attacked by other birds finally she forced herself to fly bit by bit she made her way across the western plain looking for somewhere to shelter and that was when she saw our abbey constance came in mopping her brow still hot out there wheres the big bird asleep what a sizr ill bet she could almost lift me d you think shell ever fly again abbot i dont know constance maybe if we could look at her wing wed be able to tell however big red kites arent our present worry its ravens crows and rooks im concerned with cornflower you must stop this masquerade as martin the warrior i know it annoys ironbeak but it isnt getting us anywhere theres another reason also that raven is no fool and sooner or later hell be a bit quicker than us and hell catch you theres too much risk involved youll have to give it up cornflower became indignant but father abbot when i get dressed up as the ghost i know it upsets ironbeak and thaf s why i must continue it has also started to demoralize his rooks theyre scared and the crow wotsisname mangiz hes frightened of me too i can tell that crow is a very superstitious bird and the others take notice of him let me do it just one more time tonight please mordalfus polished his glasses cornflower youre a bigger mischiefmaker than your son and a fighter as brave as your husband make tonight the last time that you haunt our abbey baby rollo had dozed off and cornflower placed the sleeping infant in the abbots lap i will thank you father abbot sister may come on we have work to do if the ghost is to walk again tonight come on constance we need you for the voice of martin the abbot stroked rollos head and im left holding the baby as usual ironbeak sat at the broken dormitory window and related his troubles to mangiz warrior mouse ghosts big red birds what next my seer the earthcrawlers are down in that cavern place where we cannot get at them i have conquered nearly all this great redstone house from the roof down and i cannot let it slip away from me if i were forced to leave here we would have to go back to the northlands they are cold and hard mangiz and it is all fight and no food we are getting older and could not face many more winters in the north tell me mangiz have your visions come back are you seeing anything in the eye of your mind again my general you were right mangiz said readih glad that he was back in favor i see the ghost mouse was only a trick of the earthcrawlers to frighten us from here as for the great rustybird kachah it was only the imagination of scared rooks the heatwaves shimmer and dance in this country and you could see more strange things than on a dark night in the northlands ironbeak was heartened well spoken mangiz my strong right wing what else do you see are the omens good for your general the omens are good it all becomes clear as water now ironbeak you and i will live a good and easy life in this redstone house the food will be plenty and the seasons good winters cold will not harm us in this place surrounded by tall woodland when the earthcrawlers get tired of playing their silly little games we will catch them all out in the open and that day they will be slain then there will be none left to oppose us this i see truly my general ironbeak stood and stretched his wings and mangiz ducked to avoid being knocked out of the window kachakka this is good mangiz i feel good in my feathers too i think i will fly up and perch awhile on the roof of my big redstone house tell the rooks to rest well and sleep yourself you look tired and hot ironbeak launched himself from the sill and spiralled up to the abbey roof mangiz blew a great sigh of relief and settled down to nap in the hot sun it was the first time he had lied to ironbeak about his visions they were still clouded by the warrior mouse but the crow was not going to tell ironbeak that what the general did not knew for the moment would not harm him and compliments were better received than kicks when night fell over redwall and the mossflower country cornflower began buckling on her armour however sister may had a better idea so cornflower unbuckled it and listened constance covered her mouth and shook with suppressed laughter when the ruse was outlined to her oh yes lefs do it i wouldnt miss this for a midsummer feast the rooks perched in the dormitory half dozing half awake none fully asleep since the general had issued the order for them to have the rest of the day off most of them had slept all afternoon and they found it difficult trying to sleep in the night also it was hot and airless for birds who had lived their lives in the cold northlands a full moon beamed down through the dormitory window bathing the entire room in pale bluish white light leeeeave ooooour abbeeeeeeeeey yaak what was thatr death is neeeeear the rooks froze on their perches death waits outside this rooooooom a black shadow cast itself across the beds and the floor there was something at the window the rook ragwing turned his head slowly and fearfully until he could see the window framed by the broken pane with cold moonlight surrounding it was the head of the warrior the helmet with no face pale grey mist hovered in place of the warriors features ragwing and his companions were in a state of panic bordering on hysteria and the words of the bodiless phantom were like some dread puzzle leave our abbey how could they leave the abbey knowing that the ghost had said death waits outside this room there was only the window and the horrible head was floating about there even the bravest rook would not venture out that way it was more than the terrified birds could stand so they scrabbled underneath the beds afraid to look or move as they stole back to cavern hole constance shook the window pole that had supported the ghostly head at sister may one more giggle out of you sister and ill have you put on cooking duties with ambrose spike she said menacingly cornflower held a kerchief to her face pretending to blow her nose she was in fact biting the material to stop herself roaring with laughter constance waited until they were out of earshot in the tunnel then she laughed heeheehee i took a quick peek through the window and the rooks were underneath the beds trying to make themselves invisible sister may shook her head in mock sympathy if s no wonder you didnt give them much choice leave the abbey but dont leave the room really constance what made you think that one up i dont know i suppose i just lost my head hahaha cornflower wiped tears from her eyes realising that the fun had turned to sorrow and longing for her family my matthias and mattimeo would have appreciated a joke like that dear me i cant get them out of my mind night or day oh matthias will be able to take care of himself no matter where he is but what about my little mattimeo i wonder what hes doing right now i hope hes safe and well fed im sorry my friends im an old wet rag these days moping about like i dont know what sister may began weeping herself there there we understand dont you worry your young one will be all right constance sniffed loudly of course he will o a silence had fallen upon the ledge friend and foe alike were hushed as matthias and the wearet circled about the warrior mouse straight backed moved lightly on his paws the great sword of martin held doublepawed against his right cheek the wearet crouched low spear held pointing at his opponent the loaded net making swift dragging noises as he cast it in small circles continuously the eyes of the two fighters were locked as each tried to read the others thoughts hoping one false move of a paw would give him the advantage matthias attempted to keep his back to the entrance where orlando and his friends waited but the cunning skill of the wearet forced him round until he could feel the rat horde at his back the wearet snarled viciously and shuffled forwards jabbing at his foe matthias was concentrating on the spearpoint and the swirling net not until too late did he feel the spear butt of a blackrobed rat hit him in the back of his legs the warrior mouse tell backwards the wearet hurled himself forward spear first but matthias twisted to one side caught the end of the net and gave a sharp tug adding impetus to his enemys charge there was a bubbling scream as the wearet stumbled in his lunge and the rat who had tripped matthias with the spear butt staggered forward impaled upon the wearets stabbing spear matthias goaded his foe sharply across his hindquarters with the needlelike swordpoint the wearet foamed and screeched as he shook the fallen rat from his spearpoint casting the weighted net back over his shoulder the weights struck matthias on top of his head blackness interspersed with colored stars exploded behind his eyes and he felt rather than saw the spear jab at his throat as the wearet attacked on the turn there was a ringing clang as the warriors swordpoint countered the spear blade his head clearing matthias leapt nimbly forward clipping the wearef s slobbering jaw and slicing across his spear paw despite the ferocity of the attack the wearet kicked matthias in the stomach and whipped away at his body with the folded net he drove his opponent back until he was practically at the rock wall of the ledge matthias whirled the sword and came forwards propelling himself forcefully off the rocks redwaaaaall the fury of the onslaught drove the wearet back he took two sharp slashes upon his flanks before clouting matthias in the face with the flat of his spear blade and throwing the net over the mouse warrior matthias knew he was snared he could not use his sword and the net weighed heavily upon him as the wearet stooped to gather the ends and fully entrap him seeing a slim chance matthias trod on the grounded blade of the spear causing the wearet to try to pull the spear free it was all the chance matthias needed he bulled forward battering into the wearet shoving hard with head and paws he sent his foe hurtling back into the ranks of the rats matthias dropped his sword and fell flat keeping his paws tight to his sides the wearet stumbled and struggled amid the rats holding only one edge of the net he dragged at it the net slid from matthias who snatched his sword and jumped up charging straight in among the rats hacking this way and that in an attempt to get at the wearet get out of there watch your back matthias orlando roared from the cave mouth matthias dimly heard orlando with the spirit of martin coursing through his veins he whirled in a tight warriors circle up down and at middle height the great sword was everywhere at once in a glittering circle of steel rats fought to get out of its way wearet cut through the rats to matthiass opposite side and regained the open space as the warrior mouse came spinning out of the horde he saw the wearet and carried on his deadly course still spinning his sword sheared into the net shredding it to a useless mass of cordage as it was swept from his foebeasfs paw the wearet snatched a fallen stabbing spear arming himself doubly prodding and thrusting he locked blades with matthias the ring of sword upon spears echoed around the ledge as the pair fought madly backwards and forwards hacking and slicing parrying and striking in a hideous ritual of death mattimeo and his friends had lain miserably in the darkened cell until they lost track of night or day several attempts had been made to force the door each one more futile than the last aumas body ached from the number of times she had thrown herself at the heavy unyielding door and sams teeth were numb through trying to gnaw at the timbers mattimeo tim tess jube and even cynthia had tried in one way or another all resulting in bleeding and splinterstuck paws they sat miserably in the darkness cynthia began weeping there there hush now well get out of here youll see tess comforted her auma placed her aching back against the wall id like to think well get out of here too but where would we go anywhere mattimeos voice trembled i wouldnt mind getting out of here just to die fighting those robed rats instead of perishing down here like some insect under the ground at least it would be better than a life under the whip of a slavekeeper ssshhhh who said that sam crawled close to mattimeo i did listen can you hear anything no can you im not sure but it sounds like a drum pouading far away and the sound of voices cynthia bankvole sobbed aloud i knew it theyre having some sort of feast and were going to be dragged out of here and eaten im sure of it oh stop being silly cynthia tess snapped at her impatiently what a foolish idea where are all these drums and voices coming from sam i cant hear a thing auma stood up i can sams right it sounds like pounding and chanting and shouting whatever it is you can wager its not going to be any party for us maybe cynthias right tims voice came out of the gloom really auma not you too voices drums chanting i thought you had a bit more sense than frightening others huh i cant hear anything but i agree with auma sometimes if s best to expect the worst that way youre never disappointed jube said philosophically thanks for cheering us all up hedgehog tess scoffed here we are locked in a cell below ground and manacled without a hope or a weapon between us and youre chattering on about us being the dinner at some sort of evil ceremony hush sam interrupted i can hear paws coming this way and a dragging sound too cynthia gave a little scream mattimeo stood up resolute well let them come and well make an end of it one way or another lef s try and do what our parents or martin the warrior would do in a comer like this sell our lives dearly we have manacles and they can be turned into weapons let whoever beast it is come and try to do their worst supported by flugg and two other shrews logalog made his way painfully up the tortuous winding passages towards the surface the shrew leader groaned and lowered himself slowly down resting his back against a door logalog are you all right flugg asked anxiously he nodded wearily i must sit here awhile its all uphill to the copse let me rest and catch my breath the shrews sat with him when we get above ground you must leave me he said turning to flugg go back and help our friends flugg you have been my good comrade and brother for many seasons listen now once you leave me and i am no longer with you the guosim must have a new leader that one is you flugg forget your name now you are logalog of all the guosim flugg banged the door angrily with his sword hilt no do not talk like that you must live logalog held a paw to his throat wound you cannot disobey me the law and rules of the guosim say this is the way it must be if there were a river or a stream here now i would ride a log on my last journey then you would have no choice hear me i have spoken what was that some creature was banging on the door from the other side flugg banged in reply placing his mouth near the jamb he called logalogalogalog there was more thumping in reply followed by a voice calling redwaaaall mossflowenr logalog struggled to his paws id know that voice anywhere if s just tike his fathers if s matthiass young one get that door open guosim there was a heavy padlock and hasp on the door but one of the shrews named gum produced a small dagger stand aside let me try with this gurn told the others luckily it was a lock of simple and ancient design gurns dagger jiggled and twisted a few times then there was a dick and he pulled the padlock curve from the hasp ring inside the cell auma had her ear to the door she listened carefully keep quiet weve given them our challenge now lef s see what they do are they shouting flogaloggle or whatever it is jube piped up daft sort of war cry if you ask me we never asked you jube be quiet mattimeo commanded curtly whats happening out there auma think theyre unlocking the door mattimeo right this is it get your manacles ready and give the best fight you can manage if we dont meet again my friends goodbye aumas voice was hoarse and urgent theyve unlocked the door wait it must open outwards mattimeo felt for his companions paws in the darkness why wait lef s rush them chaaaaarge they hit the door it flew open wide mattimeo flung himself upon the first creature in his path tim and sam leapt on another even the dim passage light dazzled their eyes which were accustomed to nothing but complete darkness grappling on the floor the young mouse heard his name called by a deep gruff voice mattimeo ifs me logalog mattimeo had flugg by the throat his paws dropped with a clank of manacles as he yelled out stop theyre friends immediately the fight halted mattimeo and his companions stood in the torchlit passage rubbing their eyes gum shook his head admiringly what a bunch of young warriors dont rub your eyes too hard let me open those manacles with my dagger cynthia began sobbing again but this time it was with happiness the friends were smiling at each other gradually it was dawning on them that they were no longer the prisoners of malkariss slagar nadaz or any other evil creature mattimeos laughter boomed around the passage walls hahahaha free were free ifs my fathers friends the guosim ifs certainly your lucky day young uns most of your parents are here theres matthias orlando jabez jess even old basil stag hare we joined forces with them to search for you theyre down on the big ledge fighting the hordes of malkariss mattimeo could hardly believe his ears his father the champion of redwall here auma let out a great whoop sam leapt high into the air jube wrinkled his nose knowingly told you so i said we wouldnt get far without my old dad catching us up do you remem he was seized by tim and tess and whirled around then cynthia joined in good old basil the redwallers are here hurray flugg was knocked flat by the whirling dancers but mattimeo helped him to his paws dusting himself off the shrew grinned broadly by the fur and the claw and the law im glad we found you lot though youve got our logalog to thank for that if he hadnt decided to rest here awhile wed have gone right past you and youd have rotted in there laughing happily mattimeo knelt to shake logalog by the paw i knew youd find us oh i just knew it would happen someday thank you logalog oh thank y the logalog of all the guosim was smiling even though his eyes had dosed for the last time he had lived long enough to keep his promise to his friends he had found their young ones matthias was growing tired the wearet seemed to have hidden stores of insane energy the strange beast was wounded in a dozen different places but his size and mad ferocity seemed to buoy him up the warrior mouse went into the sword fighters stance blade held ready to cut sweep and thrust gaining a small respite for breath as the wearet circled him looking for an opening matthias turned slowly as the wearet tried to get behind his back in the mouth of the tunnel orlando stood alongside basil watching the gruelling conflict that creature cant get the better of our warrior but i think matthias is looking very tired now is that a very deep gash on his brow dyou mink basil tchah a mere scratch old lad ive done more damage to a salad with a spoon dont let the champion of redwall fool you orlando oh dear no in a moment or two hell decide ifs time for lunch and hell settle old thingummybobs hash you mark my words basil was proved right the moment matthias saw he had the wearet with his back to the wall he came in like a hungry wolf sparks flew from the rocks as matthias smashed home a devastating attack he seemed to be everywhere at once roaring slashing and milting the confident sneer faded from the wearef s face as he found himself battling for dear life the mouse warrior fought with the strength of two and the skill of many seasons the wearet pushed himself from the rocks with a gigantic effort and lunged savagely forward with both spears matthias darted to one side and his blade crashed down like summer lightning shearing through i both spear handles in one heroic sweep the warrior mouse turned a halfcircle with the momentum but the wearet was swifter than a shadow he leaped at matthiass unprotected back passing his paws over matthiass head he began strangling the warrior mouse with the broken handles of the spears which he had held i onto choking for breath matthias slammed his swordpoint c down into the wearef s footpaw grasping the spearhafts with both paws he crouched deep leaning i forward the wearet screamed and shot over matthiass head landing with a thud at the end of the ledge i matthias leapt up and hurled himself onto the wearet his foe was waiting the wearet thrust all paws straight into the air and matthias felt himself rise he struck the very brink of the ledge and rolled over into the void with a shout of dismay general ironbeak fluttered about in the sunwarmed shallows of the abbey pond he took a deep drink throwing his head back as the bright droplets sparkled i from his fine dark plumage mangiz stood to one side taking in the scene with disdain he had often drunk water but bathing in it was out of the question the t raven general shook himself and swaggered briskly j about at the waters edge today was a day for great i plans the omens were good and he felt energetic ffh oufcfa that was good now my mangiz are your visions favoring us does your minds eye see clear still kayah all is still well my general though my visions say that haste would be unseemly kaah unseemly what kind of old farmhens talk is that listen to me my strong right wing you just keep your visions happy and ironbeak will do the planning but general i told you yesterday the visions said that j silence kraggafc have heard enough go and bring i my magpies to me and all my fighting rooks i have a plan to put paid to all the nonsense that surrounds this redstone house a good plan straightforward with no trickery or sneaking about like thrushes in a hedgerow from now on we will fight as we did in the northlands no creeping around the back good direct attacking straight wingtobeak fighting with no prisoners taken now go mangiz was beset by a dreadful feeling of foreboding though he knew there was no talking to iron eak when he was in conquering mood the crow withdrew bowing respectfully general your wish is my command i will bring all our birds to you little sister may looked a simple soul but that was because deep down she was a very wise schemer during the night she had laced stryk redkites drinking water with a huge dose of the drug she had concocted for the magpies in the orchard stryk was a thirsty bird and she had drunk deep now the great red kite lay soundly under the influence of sister mays sleeping potion abbot mordalfus john churchmouse brother rufus and sister may gathered round the unconscious bird each of them versed in the art of healing as passed down through generations of redwall brothers and sisters john churchmouse donned his spectacles and dusted off a slim volume hmm old methuselahs index of bird ailments and remedies what dyou think father abbot the abbot looked up from a tome he was studying aye thafs a good one john though theres much to recommend this fine book sister heartwoods compleat category it contains nearly five chapters on birds brother rufus helped sister may as she raised stryks broken wing then she wiped her paws

shrugged his spikes moodily i dont suppose youd like me to fetch your lunch dinner teansupper too huh oh and ambrose would you ask winifred to fetch our lunch dinner tea and supper out here this is going to be a long job ironbeak left off tugging a worm from the lawn as mangiz approached he saw the crow was alone and glared severely at him yakk well my general what has happened is none of my doing if you peck me and claw me you will be doing me a great wrong ironbeaks bright eyes shifted back and forth between the abbey and the crow will peck the tongue from your foolish beal if you do not stop babbling and tell me what is happening kaah it is the rooks and the magpie brothers my general they have barred themselves within the dormitory room and will not come out now what has got into those duckbrained idiots ironbeak snorted they say that the head of the ghost mouse appeared to them last night and it warned them to stay in the dormitory room the raven leader struck his powerful beak sideways against a stone the noise it made surprised mangiz kaahagga then i must go and talk to them mangiz followed the general at a respectable distance he did not tike the way ironbeak had said the word talk the raven perched in the broken window space of the dormitory room his seer crow sat upon the grass listening intently kaah so my fighters you have been listening to the ghost mouse again what did it have to say this time apart from a few muffled caws there was no dear reply ironbeak dug his claws into the woodwork of the window frame kraal you do not choose to speak to your leader then i will come in and speak to you he hopped down and vanished inside the dormitory mangiz hunched up closing his eyes as he listened to the awful sounds of birds screeching and beds being upset he couldnt see the feathers which flew out of the dormitory window yaggah who gives the orders a mouses head or ironbeak i am in command here get out out you worthless rabble rooks and magpies poured out of the window struggling against each other to get through the enclosed space mangiz winced at the savage sounds of his general dealing out fierce punishment not for nothing was he known as the most feared fighter in the northlands the great sword of redwall disappeared into the green mists of the abyss matthias scrabbled furiously as he rolled over the brink of the ledge his paws grabbing automatically for anything that would check his headlong plunge it was the rope which the basket had been lowered down on that saved him he seized it wildly but was unable to grasp it firmly and he began sliding downwards the rock face of the chasm passing him in a blur the wearet leapt up and began immediately hacking at the rope bellowing aloud orlando charged at the head of the woodlanders rats went down before the great battleaxe like corn to the scythe with basil and the others facing outwards guarding his sides and the rear the warrior of the western plain fought his way through too late the last strands of the rope twisted and shredded to snap under the blade of the spear matthias was gone the wearet turned to look up the last thing his eyes beheld was the huge male badger swinging a doubleheaded axe in his direction orlando gave a great howl of rage rage against himself for letting matthias accept such a challenge rage at everything in this evil place that had taken his young one from him and rage fuelling his great fighting spirit so that he wanted to do battle against anybeast that stood in his way i am orlando of the axe eeeeeulaliaaaaa the woodlanders war cries rang about the underground kingdom of malkariss as basil cheek jess and jabez headed a wild charge into the rat horde nadaz stamped and screeched like a mad thing rattling his sceptre as he chanted death threats against the invaders matthias felt the rope go slack and he plunged like a falling stone into the green curtain of mist racing through his mind were the faces of cornflower and mattimeo certain he would never see them again whump the warrior mouse landed on something soft and yielding it was a large woven grass basket thickly padded inside with moss and purple cloth the force of the fall stunned him temporarily he lay on the ground beside the basket trying to galvanize himself into movement and collect his thoughts amazed at the fact that he had lived through such a fall the lid of the smashed basket moved there was a slobbering snarling noise from within the basket then it fell to one side as something rolled out but the creature on the floor beside the basket bore little resemblance to the high statue on the ledge this malkariss was gross the great white mound of scabrous fur now broken by the weight that had dropped on it from above was something out of a bad dream short floppy paws with long mottled nails which hung limply reached up to wipe the crusting bleariness from eyes dimmed and half shut with age the mouth sagged open revealing blackened stumps of teeth matthias sat up groggily his senses swam and he began to doubt whether he was still alive when he saw the broken vision of evil crawling towards him surely such a thing never lived above or below ground when malkariss spoke his voice was thin and reedy not being projected by the chamber within the statue or echoing around the rock ledge spaces it was almost a piteous whine you have looked upon malkariss you must die matthias shuddered the horrible thing had its paw upon his sword which had fallen dose to the basket as he was about to lever himself upright a chunk of rock struck malkariss upon the back and he arched in pain another rock hit the white polecat striking him on the paw he released the sword with a whimper more ocks pelted in matthias scrambled away retrieving his sword as he went thin ravaged creatures fur welted with lashmarks their paws manacled were advancing on malkariss like a grim army they hurled rocks at the cringing figure dragging slowly forward pulling slave chains along the ground they chanted die evil one die we will bury you with pieces of your own kingdom gaunt young hedgehogs squirrels mice moles and otters were picking up big rocks from a pile of debris with both paws they gathered around the fallen tyrant heaving the stones onto him with all the force they could muster matthias watched in horror as malkariss was buried beneath a growing mound of rocks malkariss could no longer be seen but still the slaves continued hurling rocks onto the pile the redwall warrior grabbed a halfstarved otter and pulled him to one side here hold your chains tight across that rocky slab do not be afraid i am your friend the otter did as he was told hope shining in his dustnecked eyes strike hard friend he cried to matthias the warriors sword whistled downward through the air with a sharp snap it sheared the links of chain like a billhook chopping grass nothing could withstand the great sword of redwall whose metal had come from a falling star once he had severed the lead dragchain matthias set about cleaving the manacles from slaves young creatures wept openly and some cheered and began to dance with broken chains dangling from their paws the mouse warrior was freeing them two at a time as quickly as he could for sounds of battle raging above had reached his ears a blackrobed rat ran up brandishing a whip but before he could reach matthias a squirrel felled him with a whirling length of chain well struck squirrel the mouse warrior called out i am matthias of redwall what do they call you despite his scrawny appearance the squirrel laughed and swung the chain until it whirred around his head elmtail i am called elm tail i will buy my freedom with this chain that bound me as a slave thaf s the way elmtail when i have freed your friends we will do it together mate the slaves began cheering and those already liberated swung their chains aloft the battle on the ledge was in full flood side by side the woodlanders stood in a tight circle within a circle the outer ring of shrews with jess and jabez was stabbing and thrusting with swords and javelins all the time moving in a clockwise direction the inner circle fired over their heads urged on by basil and cheek they pelted stones and arrows into the tightpacked horde of rats that surrounded the woodlanders on all sides commanded by nadaz the rats fought back with fanatical vigor and many a good shrew fell to the stabs of their short spears orlando would stand at the center of the circle until he regained his breath then with a mad roar he would charge out to wreak slaughter upon the rat horde only coming back into the circle to wipe the gore from his axe and lick wounds whenever basil saw a particularly vicious attack he too would go vaulting over into the thick of it his long flailing limbs laying rats senseless to be trampled under the masses of their own horde yahooooo take that you blighter here old lad have some of this harespaw pie and lie down for a bit thud another rat would stretch his length on the rocky ledge more blackrobes pressing up the winding causeway steps piled in to fight fired on by nadaz kill kill slay the invaders who dare come to the land of malkariss jess squirrel angrily turned a rats own spear upon him waifll i get my paws on that one in the purple robe ill make him sing a different tune cheek flexed his throwing paw and spoke his mind to a nearby shrew archer theres just too many of em if we lose a creature were one short but you can knock ten vermin out and twenty spring up in their place the shrew sighted and shot his arrow nodding with satisfaction at the result right twixt the eyes they never come back for more after that whafs that you say otter oh aye theres no stoppin em is there still weve signed for the trip so we might as well make the best of it eh above the din of the battle jess caught a ripple over on the far side of the ledge at the tunnel mouth she fought her way to basil over there look it seems weve got some kind of reinforcements basil did an extrahigh leap taking great care to kick a rat flat on the head as he went yahaha well blow me old whiskers jess if s the young uns mattimeo over here you young scallawag redwallll the cry was taken up in answer across the melee hooray were saved basil you old grubweuer were coming redwallull mattimeo and the former captives were battling their way through the throng using flailing manacles and spears from fallen rats they drove across the platform with their cell door in front of them as a shield pushing shoving thrusting and whipping out left and right with everything available the young creatures fought their way to be reunited with their friends nadaz danced and screamed louder urging his rat horde to greater efforts the inevitable victory he had foreseen began to waver as the tide of battle flowed in favor of the brave woodlanders the father abbot was delivering a stern lecture to cornflower concerning her ghostly antics i did not approve of this venture from the first my child one false move and the generals birds would slay you and sister may constance could be badly hurt too cornflower avoided the stern gaze but father abbot we have got the birds frightened if the ghost of martin walks the abbey by night we will make the rooks and others lose heart and they will not enjoy living at redwall maybe they will fly off to their northlands and leave us in peace the old mouse held up a paw for silence we went over this argument once before at first i thought it might have done some good perhaps it has but cornflower you are taking this whole thing too lightly treating it as a big joke i feel it in my whiskers one of you will be badly hurt or captured the whole charade must stop a rebellious gleam shone in cornflowers eyes matthias would have approved of it ill bet he and basil would have kept it up until those birds were scared out of their feathers mordalfus peered severely over the top of his glasses i am glad you mentioned matthias have you thought of my duty to him as abbot what if he came marching back out of the south with our young ones as i am sure he will do one fine day how do you think i would feel having to report that whilst he was gone i allowed you to play foolish tricks until you were killed you see cornflower i have a responsibility as father abbot to you matthias and all the creatures within our walls now will you please do as i say cornflower sighed deeply and bowed i will do as you say father abbot she said reluctantly the kindly old mouse rose stiffly he patted her lead thank you cornflower now constance will you take all the warriors armour to the gatehouse and put it back carefully constance gathered the armour and climbed into the runnel ironbeak was stalking the edge of the abbey pond the silver glint in the waters told him that there were fish about he marvelled at the abundance of food the earthcrawlers had within the walls of the redstone place orchards gardens a great storehouse in the area below stairs even a pond with good water and fish for the taking sometime soon it would all belong to him he looked about in admiration staring at the strong outer wall that would keep other earthcrawlers out his quick dark eye caught a movement over by the main gate the big stripedog had materialized practically out of thin air it was carrying something ironbeak crouched in the reeds and watched intently constance took a quick glance around to check nobeast was observing her swiftly she unlocked the gatehouse door and slid inside with the armour the door closed behind her ironbeak could see the key still sticking out of the lock seizing his opportunity he rose and glided silently across to the gatehouse the deed was accomplished in a trice the raven leader slammed tile door sticking his beak into the handle ring of the heavy iron key he gave it a swift turn and withdrew it from the lock there was a scrambling noise from inside then the sound of paws pounding against the solid timbers of the door as the badger called out cornflower is that you stop playing about and open this door come on i know ifs you ironbeak soared off jubilantly with the key looped on his beak now that the enemy he feared so much was out of the way there was nobeast strong enough to withstand a sudden attack truly mangizs visions were becoming reality inside the gatehouse constance had her eye to the keyhole she could see nothing whoever had locked her in was gone for it was quiet outside the badger ran to the window redwall abbey was a long distance from the gatehouse it stood serene and peaceful across the lawns beyond the pond the window was too small for a fully grown badger to break and craw through so she began exploring the place other small windows in each of the bedrooms proved useless constance noted the chimney vent in the cosy hearth but it was out of the question a badger of her dimensions would be jammed right away she tried the door again it was solid with florin spikes and iron bands fixed to the stout oak timbers after exploring every possibility constance resigned herself there was a jug of water and plenty of dried fruits in the cupboard she sat at the living room window watching and waiting for help to appear stryk redkite wanna fly gain must fly sissimay sister mary scrubbed her paws wearily no no you naughty bird you must rest until the wing heals now be still or you get no supper don wan supper wanna fly the abbot and brother rufus sat with john churchmouse taking their supper at a barrel top john rubbed the back of his neck whew i wish that bird was a sparrow instead of a great red kite it would have been much easier abbot mordalfus took a long draught of october ale it was difficult john but i think it was worthwhile you did a marvelous job putting those new pinion feathers in place did you take all your instructions from methuselahs book john shrugged modestly not exactly father abbot i did invent attttle fish glue to reinforce the twine that i tied them with though i actually did manage to get the feather ends into the cavities of the old ones they should take and be as good as new by the end of season what about you rufus how did it go with the break brother rufus munched wildcherry flan mmmff scuse me we used fishbone and feather quill to repair it everything was a bit messy but quite straightforward when you have our abbot to help you sister may dried her paws ive used every kind of ointment and healing nostrum i know to help the operation along now we must wait wanna fly stryk redkite flyover mountain like skyclouds the big bird wailed john folded his spectacles away huh now we must wait try telling her that the great red bird made as if to move sister may picked up a wooden ladle just you dare mlady ill tan your feathery hide stryk perched sullenly her wing still supported by the wine firkin and the books warra warrior sissimay shoulda be redkite the very idea of it you feathery baggage cornflower had great difficulty keeping baby rollo away from the wine cellar he was anxious to see the big bird at the moment she and mrs churchmouse had the infant occupied by the barricade in cavern hole where he and some of his little friends were busy at their selfappointed task of watching for rooks rollo crouched down peering round the edge of the table that lay on its side after a while he turned to the mousewives who were busy shelling peas no cooks hes trying to tell us theres no rooks cornflower explained to mrs churchmouse oh i thought he was referring to mr spike when he said no cooks hes no cook at all indeed he isnt hotroot pepper in the scones i could have drunk the abbey pond dry that night though our rollo might have a point havent noticed any birds out there yesterday or today they may be up to something do you think its worth telling the abbot or constance mrs churchmouse rolled a small garden pea over for rollo to play with no i shouldnt worry ironbeak knows he cant get us out of cavern hole it would make him look bad in front of his birds if he failed in another attempt i think theyre doing the same as us waiting it out this weathers too hot to do anything theyre probably idling about in the dormitory eating and sleeping ironbeak was not sleeping nor was mangiz or any of the rooks they were gathered at the edge of the abbey pond listening as the raven general outlined his strategy the final plan to conquer red wall abbey ironbeak paced up and down in front of his command yaggah listen well my fighters i will not say there is no ghost mouse what i say is that it is a trick some silly thing the earthcrawlers have thought up when we conquer them i will make them tell us how they did it then we will throw their ghost from the very top of this redstone house kaah see if it comes back to haunt us then in the past i was like you one time in the northlands when i was standing nightwatch i was sleepy my wings drooped and my eyes began to close yarrak i saw a great green eagle a fearsome bird instead of running away i flew to attack it kaah it was only an oddshaped green bush do you see what i mean tired eyes darkness even sun shadows when you are dozing can cause your mind to see strange sights so let me hear no more of these things they are like the first sight of lightning to an eggchick the rooks were unconvinced but dared not speak tonight we will make ready for our final battle the general continued mangiz sees that the omens are good i know you are loyal fighters you have fought under me in the northlands now you shall have your reward in this warm country for we will live together in the redstone house with lots of food sun and easy times here is how we do it i have not posted guards or sentries for two days now the weather is hot and the earthcrawlers are resting easy they have plenty of food and dunk themselves safe in the cavern hole place kayah this is good let them go on thinking we have forgotten ihem then they will relax they have posted no guards at their barricade for two nights now i have seen this in the hour before the sun rises at dawn quickbill and his brothers will go down the stairs if all is quiet they will signal to us kraal silence is the key to my plan without the big stripedog we will have them at our mercy the battle beneath the ground raged back and forth mattimeo and his friends had joined forces with orlando and the woodlanders heaving masses of rats pressed in from all sides the double circle continued its deadly function reinforced by the willing young ones jess squirrel stood alongside her son sam but there was tittle time for happy reunions in the midst of a battle orlando and auma lifted the door bodily between them using it as a large flattener on the blackrobed rats nadaz kept up his chant wailing and screaming as he sent in wave after wave of blackrobes shaking his eerie bone sceptre rattling the mouse skull he pointed to the woodlanders die die you will all die here your bones will rot in the kingdom of malkariss the voice of the host has spoken basil stag hare and cheek lifted a rat between them the wildly struggling creature screeched as he was hefted above the heads of the hare and the otter were goin to chuck you over to your boss basil informed him tell him f keep the howlin an yellin down bad form know right me old cheek one two and away he goes the rat flew through the air falling short of nadaz he landed on the spearpoints of the horde basil tuttutted oh bad shot sir whatve i told you about holdin your end up cheek never mind try try again thaf s the spirit grab hold of that smelly chap to your left now nadaz was standing on the big drum he pounded it with both paws in a mad dance and the noise rolled and boomed encouraging the rats on the causeway steps to press forward onto the ledge jube hedgehog and jabez his father were unas ailable they rolled into one tight ball hurtling madly about spiking rats over the brink of the ledge deflecting spearthrusts with their needled armour casing but the rats still came forward tess and tim churchmouse formed a trio of flailing chains with mattimeo and managed to gasp snatches of conversation as they pounded the rats with the swinging slavechain manacles watch your back matti got him thanks tess look out good shot tim are you all right phew my paws are getting tired aye theres no end to them look down those steps theyre pouring up four abreast matthias ran farther up the underground workings dealing with any guards that were left and freeing slaves as he went climbing over piles of rubble and dashing through halffinished chambers the mouse warrior swung his sword like an avenging pendulum striking the chains of slavery to smithereens and dealing death to the oppressors with both paws aching he stopped and took stock of his surroundings a long passage with a blank wall at one end through the semidarkness he glimpsed a vast carving on the rock wall it was a frieze of woodland creatures chained together dominated by a prominent relief of the statue on the ledge surrounded by robed rats relaxing his guard he laid aside the sword and studied the carvings obviously it marked the boundary of malkarisss evil kingdom slagar stepped out from behind the mouse warrior the cruel one dealt matthias a swinging blow with the metal weights of his threemonged weapon and me mouse warrior pitched forward overwhelmed by the striking bolas grinning behind the silken mask slagar turned his victim over you did well mouse am saved the tremble of slaying malkariss when the horde has overcome your woodlanders i wifl rule here but first i must fulfil my oath of vengeance grabbing matthias by the throat the fox reached for the great sword yaahaa if s the fox kill slagar lake a hunting pack the slaves came through the nibble at me masked fox he looked wildly about for an escape route and his eye fell upon the carved mural a few paces away the silken hood sucked back and forth wudry as he snatched up his bolas and teapt over the fallen warrior gripping the outstretched left paw of the polecat image slagar twisted and pushed in the same way that nadaz had done the previous day the stone polecat swung inwards slagar stepped through into the bottom of a deep well shaft with sunlight pouring in from above he slammed the exit door back into place and mounted the pawholds to the surface reciting an old woodland verse in a crazy singsong as he climbed a fox who fights and runs away lives to fight another day it is not over yet matthias of redwall i will live to take your sword your son and your life wiffing paws helped matthias up he shook his head groggjly as the slave army packed in about him wheres slagar he was here wasnt her matthias asked uncertainly hmtail gave the warrior back his sword youll never believe this the fox vanished completely into that carved rock wall we were never allowed up this end of the workings so the rats must have made that carving themselves anyhow hes gone what are your orders where to next matthias the warrior mouse shook off his dizziness waving the sword he began running back up the tunnel to the ledge let us finish this thing follow me and shout our battle cry so that my friends will knr w we are coming like a tidal wave beginning to build out upon the sea the army grew creatures poured out of caves passages and corridors running with matthias towards the causeway steps they heard his war shout and echoed the wild cry until the caverns of malkarisss kingdom rang with their voices redwaaaaaaaallul nobody had really missed constance as always the creatures of redwail were free to go or come as they pleased and it was not uncommon for the badger to seek solitude and a place where she could be alone with her thoughts for a day or two the abbot was not exactly happy with the situation for in times of trouble his great badger friend seldom left the abbey mordalfus yawned settling himself on a makeshift pallet by the tunnel entrance in cavern hole who could tell what was in a badgers mind he would probably awake the next morning to find constance busy cooking breakfast for them all he thought he checked that the redwallers were bedded down safely baby rollo was squeaking in his sleep as he snuggled between cornflower and mrs church mouse and a nightlight burned dimly in its wall sconce the old mouse folded his spectacles away into his wide habit sleeve closing his eyes gratefully he composed himself for a restful nighf s sleep the fighting birds of general ironbeak also slumbered peacefully on their dormitory perches through the warm summer night mangiz and the raven leader catnapped on the windowsill awaiting the hour before dawn inside the gatehouse constance had slept fitfully during the early evening now she was up and roaming restlessly about every aperture she had tried was checked and rechecked the badger had reached the conclusion she had been locked in by a bird and that the raven had some plan which he would put into operation quite soon picking up a fire iron from the hearth constance began working on the hinges of the heavily bracketed door as if summoned into wakefulness by some inner alarm ironbeaks eyes snapped open wide and he surveyed the sky and the top of the outer ramparts it was the hour before dawn rousing mangiz he hopped down into the dormitory and began waking his fighters talking to them in a low voice kurrah now is the time brightback take two rooks and your brothers mangiz will show you what must be done bring the wood akahh careful now do not drop it the rest of you follow me a mediumsized plank of pine wrapped in sheets was picked up by mangiz and his helpers they slid it silently along the floor taking great care not to let it bump against anything they moved it slowly down the stairs and out into great hall at a signal from the crow they latched their claws into the sheets it was hard work but after a bit of wingspreading and flapping the plank rose a short way from the floor with mangiz holding it steady at the front they flew low towards the steps of cavern hole brightback and diptail settled the rear end of the clothcovered wood securely on the third step down and mangiz and two rooks placed the front end on top of the barricade at the foot of the stairs so that it formed a straight walk from the third step to the top of the table that formed the mainstay of the barrier the crow tested it walking the length of the plank quietly he ducked his head under the arch of cavern hole entrance ironbeak had worked it out well a bird could pass into cavern hole easily this way mangiz flapped one wing three times from die top of the stairs and ironbeak and his rooks materialized out of the shadows to join them the generals quick brigl t eye sized up ttie muffled plank on the third stair karrah you have done well we will pass inside as softly as a feather on the wind keep behind me and wait for my signal the redwallers slept on oblivious to the feathered head which poked itself into their refuge the nightlight guttered low as ironbeak crept in positioning himself on the inside of the barricade where he could assist his birds one by one the rooks came through the opening bobbing their heads as they passed the space between the plank end and the curved entrance arch ironbeak silently beckoned them to take up specific places he indicated the runnel entrance the two steps at the far side which led to the kitchens with the larders and wine cellar beyond and the edges of the barricade to prevent it being moved outwards as an avenue of escape next came the magpies he stationed them at the top of the barricade to stop any earthcrawler climbing out mangiz was last to come through together he and ironbeak slowly climbed down until they stood firmly inside the final bastion of redwall mangiz could not help but admire his general truly ironbeak was a conqueror despite false prophecies and fighters scared near witless he had stayed in command and fulfilled his own visions the redstone house would fall to his beak and talon constance worked furiously with the bent and battered fire iron her hackles stood erect with an unmentionable dread and some sixth sense drove her to greater efforts as she battered and bludgeoned at the unyielding hinges timber splintered and groaned as she struck the door sparks flew as metal dashed against metal the stouthearted creature crashed the fire iron into the door again and again her paws numbed by the stinging vibrations she had to break the door down she had to get back to the abbey with all speed to save her friends from the unknown danger which threatened a heavy talon raked the sleeping abbots back he arched into wakefulness with a grunt of pain yaggah wake up my little earthcrawlers this is the day i make you do the dance of death ironbeak has captured this great redstone house karragaaaah cavern hole echoed to the triumphant harshness of the raven general and his fighters mingled with the confused and terrified cries of shocked creatures tim churchmouse was wounded in the side by a rat spear he fell as two of the blackrobes hurled themselves on him mattimeo battled his way through with cynthia bankvole screaming shrill war cries alongside him and together they beat off the rats that beset tim and hauled him upright tim youre hurt cynthia asked anxiously yes i mean no im all right give me that spear orlando and auma stormed through the big badger practically holding the door as a shield with one paw as he flayed his battleaxe left and right while auma was creating havoc with a billet of ashwood she was using as a club get tim behind my father quick take that you robed vermin auma shouted orlando glanced anxiously at the causeway steps here comes another wave theres more pressing up from below listen theyre chanting something sam squirrel vaulted across like an acrobat he leapt to the top of the door as oriando held it upright ifs redwall theyre shouting redwall mattimeo its your father with an army of slaves oriando passed his axe to auma grabbing mattimeo he lifted him high above his head tell me young un is that your father mattimeo was weeping and laughing aloud as he roared at the top of his lungs yes yes redwalllu no warrior can swing the sword of martin like him father ifs meeeeeee down below on the causeway stairs matthias heard the voice of his son rise clear over the pounding drumbeats and the noise of war a great wave of shuddering joy swept over him and he began fighting like a berserker rats dissolved in front of him as he battered his way madly up the steps nothing could stand in front of the redwall champion and his army basil stag hare whooped with happiness as he struck out powerfully with his long limbs hoorah cheek old lad lef s show these rotters what a fight looks like right you wicked bounders look out here comes the hare for the job tess churchmouse and sam squirrel flung themselves in like twin windmills of spinning chain this is for the beating and the marching and the lashing and the starving thwack swish crack swoosh the woodlanders fought with renewed heart and hope blackrobed rats went hurling over the ledge they fell back down the steps and for the first time they tried to escape by the tunnel entrance oriando hurried through and blocked their exit he stood with his back against the door wielding his axe come to me come to me rats eeeulaliaaaaa the shrews fought like little demons under the leader ship of flugg their new logalog leaping and stabbing twisting and hacking they were everywhere at once shouting the guosim war cry logalogalogalog nadaz saw the battle had gone against the creatures of malkariss all was lost the purplerobed rat slipped quietly off the drum abandoning his bone sceptre he weaved between the blackrobes until he was behind the statue of the white polecat only tim churchmouse saw him enter the statue he remembered what he had just seen before leaping back into the fray now matthias and his slave army were near the top of die causeway steps behind them they left a trail of slain blackrobes others had leapt from the stairs into the void rather than face the creatures they had treated so cruelly or the hoteyed warlord who led them basil and mattimeo fought their way down die causeway until they met matthias on the stairs the old hare twirled his ears in the most curious manner what ho warrior i see youve taken steps to help us wot the light of battle left matthiass eyes as he gazed upon his longlost young one he threw his paws round mattimeo hugging him fiercely tears sprang to the warriors eyes as he pressed his face against his sons ragged habit matti youre here youre alive by the stones of redwall mattimeo dung tightly to his father sobbing and laughing at the same time i knew youd find me someday i knew it basil nodded back towards the ledge come on chaps theres still a battle f be finished those blighters dont want to give up gang of bally fanatics if you ask me outside the small wooded copse lay peaceful butter flies fluttered about the business of summer grasshoppers chirrupped and small insects slept on mossy stones oblivious to the carnage that raged in the chamel house beneath them a short distance from the copse slagar lay behind a rocky outcrop the deadly bolas grasped firmly in his paws warm rays of golden sun beat down upon his torn and stained cloak making the silken harlequin pattern tawdry against the emerald green of the grass the hood fluttered and moved spasmodically as the cruel one muttered to himself his dreams of power shattered by the very creatures he had sworn vengeance upon but slagar would never admit defeat after all he had been through his breath rasped harshly as he made insane promises to himself slagar will win in the end am i not the lord of light and darkness i never needed malkariss or nadaz or anybeast if the blackrobes win then i will rule them if nadaz lives i will slay him and say it was he who betrayed malkariss if the woodlanders are victorious then i will slay matthias and take the sword i know now the sword of redwall is magic and whoever holds it is the leader the defeated woodlanders were huddled against the walls of cavern hole ironbeak stared at them and wondered how a ragtailed little bunch of earthcrawlers managed to cause him so much trouble under the fierce eye of the raven general cornflower drew baby rollo close and hugged him mangiz strutted up and down his voice harsh with power krakkah now earthcrawlers you will pay for your defiance i am the voice of the great general ironbeak mightiest fighter in all the northlands he does not wish to speak with scum like you think of all the silly little tricks you have played you could not fight like real warriors filthy grease and dirt drugging our magpies stupid mouse ghosts who did you think you were dealing with a bunch of puffedup feather bags ambrose spike said boldly the hedgehog was forced to curl up defensively as he was set upon by vicious rook beaks winifred managed to fend them off she helped ambrose up and he shook himself defiantly they couldnt hurt one of the spikes im all right he told the otter where is your great stripedog now mangiz sneered she has run away in fright brother rufus shook his curled up paw at die crow what have you done to our constance you villain silence mouse worry about your own fate the great stripedog will meet hers in good time but you all of you this day will be your last you will die in this place abbot mordalfus shuffled forward let them go it was none of their doing i am abbot here and i alone am responsible for defying your leader take me ironbeak dashed forward and knocked the abbot down yagga i am ironbeak i say who lives or dies earthcrawler before anybeast could stop her sister may leapt at the raven leader she kicked and bit tearing plumage from the ravens puffedout breast you big bully you leave our abbot alone she shouted his dignity lost for a moment ironbeak hopped about wildly until he had shaken the mouse sister off as sister may lay defenceless on the floor the enraged raven began attacking her kraah stupid little earthcrawler you will be the first to die cornflower and several other creatures were about to run in and help sister may when the thunderbolt struck a giant red bird came soaring through from the wine cellar into cavern hole and struck ironbeak like a battering ram kreeeeeeegh i am stryk redkite you hurt sissimay i kiu kill feared fighter as he was ironbeak did not stand a chance against the ferocity of the mountain bird there was a massive flurry of red and black feathers upon the floor of cavern hole over and over they rolled with stryk always coming out uppermost her great powerful talons and beak tearing and rending yaak help me ironbeak managed to scream ut to his fighters the barricade fell with an earsplitting crash and constance was in the middle of the rooks like a striped whirlwind cornflower and mrs churchmouse managed to grab rollo and the few little ones and hurried them into the kitchens settling the infants under the kitchen table they ran to peer round the archway into cavern hole and witnessed the liberation of red wall abbey stryk redkite fought ironbeak across the shattered barricade and up the seven steps into cavern hole where the two birds took to the air the raven had no way of escape he flopped about bouncing from the walls and windows relentlessly pursued beak and claw by the red kite she drove at him with her beak raked and clawed him with her talons ironbeak tried every trick he knew plunging and dipping whichever way he went the kite was unshakably on top of him around columns over galleries under roofbeams glorying savagely in her regained gift of flight ironbeak tried one last desperate attempt at escape he winged straight up to the trapdoor leading to the place in the eaves and he had actually set his claws into the ring of the wooden door when the kite struck full force stryk redkite circled the ceiling of great hall as the lifeless carcass of general ironbeak plummeted down to hit the stone floor below in a ragged heap of raven feathers kreeeeeegh stryk redkite flies mangiz tried to flee he took wing and left the ground flying for the stairs and the ruined barricade constance was waiting she stood with one paw swinging strongly upward as the crow drew level with her she batted out hard the seer crow hit the far wall of cavern hole like a ripe fruit then he slid to the floor never to rise again the remaining sparrows of queen warbeaks command took care of a rook and a magpie between them winifred flattened two rooks with a big frying pan and brother rurus and sister may accounted for a rook between them immediately the fight went out of the remaining rooks and the two surviving magpies without their leader and mangiz the seer they lost heart constance pointed a blunt paw into that wine cellar all of you one squawk or false move while youre down there and well do to you exactly what you planned for us now get out of my sight double quick before i change my mind and let the big red bird loose on all of you shepherded by winifred and ambrose the birds fled hurriedly through the kitchens to the wine cellar ambrose armed with a soup ladle threatened them move along there if one o you rotten eggspawn so much as looks at my barrels of wine and ale ill chop off your tails and pickle the lot of you in a barrel of sourapple vinegar constance set the big table back in its former place no real damage done except to your gatehouse cottage door cornflower ill help you repair it there the old place looks nearly as good as new father abbot redwall is yours once again we await your word the abbot glanced up into great hall our flrst problem is how to stop stryk flying about shes making me dizzy soaring and wheeling around the abbey john you can make an addendum to the books on birds concerning the remarkable healing powers of a great red kites wing by the fur that bird looks as if she wants to spend the rest of her life in the air john churchmouse not renowned for his humor smiled when i was a young un i could never make a kite that flew properly funny how you learn as you get older he joked from the wine cellar the tiny gruff voice of baby rollo sang raucously chop up a rookn make a soup send him to bed wivout any bread dip his tail in tober ale an good ol magpie pie the sound of happy laughter rang through redwall abbey from the wine cellar to the very roofbeams of great hall where the big red bird soared gracefully matthias stood with his paw upon mattimeos shoulder and gazed around the hushed ledge orlando and auma were with him jess squirrel and her son sam jabez stump and his son jubilation and basil and cheek with tim tess and cynthia logalog flugg and his remaining shrews stood behind matthias while before him there was gathered a motley horde of young woodland creatures the surviving blackrobe rats had fled down the causeway steps back to the green misted caves and tunnels that had been the kingdom of malkariss all along the ledge down the steps of the causeway and across the floor of the bottom workings lay the ranks of the slain in the flickering torchlight eerie shadows danced around the silent rockface mattimeo took the great sword of redwall from his father as matthias stood on a rocky knoll with his paws outstretched you are free matthias proclaimed a roaring cheer echoed through the underground the warrior mouse nodded approvingly all of you who suffered under the cruelty of malkariss you who were stolen from your homes to lose many seasons of your young lives chained in dark places let me tell you something the world outside is dressed in the colours of summer grass flowers trees and rivers they are yours if you cannot remember where you came from if you have nowhere to go come with me and my friends to redwall abbey in mossflower country and live in peace there for two days we have had to fight the powers of evil many were slain in the great battle and you must never forget them the good creatures who gave their lives to buy freedom for you heads were bowed and tears were shed for lost youth and lost friends matthias stepped down and nodded to orlando who took his place on the knoll the warrior of the western plain raised his battleaxe as his thunderous voice boomed out let us go up into the sunlight but first we will destroy the symbol of wickedness that has plagued this place orlando and matthias took their weapons to the base of the great white statue which reared from the ledge to the roof of the immense cavern orlando spat upon his paws and grasped the axe handle firmly as he swung it back the purplerobed rat nadaz hes in there tim churchmouse cried out a hissing voice came from between the crystal teeth of the monolith fools you cannot destroy the kingdom of malkariss now i am not only the voice i am king of the void matthias walked round the statue until he found the secret door it was a tightblocked entrance cunningly carved so that it appeared as a mere hairline crack on the smooth limestone matthias struck it with the flat of his blade come out nadaz it is over he cried over the voice of the host laughed scornfully no it is just beginning malkariss was old and weak i am nadaz i am strong you cannot get me the entrance has a secret seal that only i can unlock from the inside when you are gone i will get more blackrobes more slavers and i will follow you and hunt you down like insects orlando swung the axe hacking a chunk from the limestone then go to your kingdom evil one eeeeulaliaaaaaa woodlanders scattered and began running for the tunnels as pieces of limestone hurtled and flew shattering against the rocks matthias hewed at one side of the statue with his war blade orlando pounded at the other side with his battleaxe nadaz screeched and raged inside the head of the great white idol steel rang against stone as chunks splinters powder and lumps of limestone whizzed in all directions the muscles stood out like knotted cords upon the back of orlando the axe as he slashed and hacked coated in white dust matthias swung the doubleedged blade biting deep into the base of the statue grunting and sweating the two warriors battered away at the likeness of malkariss until the limestone began shuddering under the impact cracks started to show running the length of the limestone column which joined the floor of the ledge to the ceiling of the cave the warriors continued their onslaught but now doggedness had replaced their former reckless spirit still they swung with deadly purpose ignoring the chips and lumps of stone that flew about them like missiles directing all the force of their blades against the idol while nadaz ranted and screamed you cannot escape i will hound you across the woodlands through the seasons by night and day the rafs tirade was blotted out by a deep rumbling that emanated from base to apex of the statue and the whole ledge began to tremble matthias shouldered his sword then realization of what was happening took over and he jerked at the fur of the badgers back oblivious to everything except the destruction of the evil symbol orlando the axe flung his whole frame against each crashing blow as his weapon bit deeper and deeper into the groaning splitting stone matthias ducked as the doubleheaded blade swung past him orlando stop he roared at his companion the whole place is collapsing we must get out with an explosion like a thunderclap the statue of malkariss broke off at its base matthias and orlando ran for the tunnel entrance hearts pounding ears ringing as they raced across the quaking ledge they had caused the earth to dance just as jabez stumps forebears had witnessed long ago the untold weight of the idol dropped tearing a colossal piece of the cave ceiling with it a widening rift split the entire ledge into two sections as the statue plunged into the depths and the rock walls shattered the two warriors dashed up the tunnel with the entire underground collapsing behind them mattimeo sat in the copse watching the last of the woodland horde climbing out into the sunlight creatures danced and laughed rolling in the grass embracing the trees and waving at the great golden eye of the sun above basil winked at him by jingo thafs something worth waitin to see wot tess flung herself down at the young mouses side fresh air and freedom matti it tastes better than strawberry wine and new bread the ground beneath their paws started to tremble they froze hugging the earth as the whole copse began to shake jube grasped his fathers spikes what is it pa he asked worriedly jabez hugged his young one to him the earth is dancing just as the cliffs once did jess and sam dashed to the flight of steps that ran down to the underworld matthias orlando get out of there they called the steps shuddered violently jess peered into the gloom theres somebeast coming make way sam uttle vitch the rat scampered out as if demons were biting his tail yaagh my whole cell began moving and the door fell off help me mattimeo grabbed him by the neck my father and orlando did you see them no no i just ran if s falling in down there cant you hear it basil stag hare flung himself upon auma and dragged her back as she tried to get to the steps father my fathers in there she protested a deep rumbling boom exploded from the bowels of the cavem trees started to sway crazily and the earth bucked like a tablecloth being shaken free of crumbs mattimeo took hold of aumas paw and they lay flat on the ground we dont leave here until our fathers are out the mouse declared basil buried his face against the trembling ground well spoken young un i second that proposal there followed a terrific bang the entire copse fell creating a huge valley from the hole in the ground where the steps started a whooshing gust of air white with limestone dust flew high into the sky like a geyser two round objects shot out like balls from the mouth of a cannon matthias landed high in the branches of an elm orlando tut the top of a rowan and came crashing to earth in a cloud of twigs and leaves the axe and the sword stood quivering in the bole of a young beech then the earth stood still basil got slowly to his paws and guffawed haw haw haw mattimeo theres a flyin white mouse up a tree over there looks a bit like your dads ghost wot mattimeo could hardly believe his eyes jabez stump tapped auma your old pa looks like a lump of white dough ready for the oven i reckon missie huhuhhuh jube patted his spikes to make sure they were all there whew that big hatchet nearly scalped me orlando rose dusting himself off in a dignified manner be careful how you talk of that weapon young un if s a battleaxe not a hatchet jess squirrel and sam went haring up the beech trunk stay where you are warrior well get you down but only if you promise to do no more bird imitations matthias smiled at sams impudent remark i promise just get me down that same joyous day the remnants of general ironbeaks force were led out on rope leads to the top of the north battlements ambrose spike and baby rollo followed them up the north wall steps to the ramparts the infant bankvole waddling along comically in a passable impression of the birds gait a light warm breeze stirred the abbof s robe as he and constance lined the prisoners up the inhabitants of redwall stood about on the broad wall top glaring at the subdued line of rooks and the two magpies who blinked in the strong sunlight huddling nervously together at the sight of stryk redkite as she watched them from the wall threshold above the gatehouse is that all of them ambrose aye tis father abbot good mrs churchmouse cornflower would you put the collars on them please the two mice emptied iron collars from a sack ambrose spike had made the collars from iron barrel hoops they were circular and left open in the middle and slipped easily around the birds necks ragwing the rook dipped his head cheekily and the iron collar slipped off and clanged upon the wattstones winifred replaced the collar and whacked the rook with her rudderlike tail do as youre told featherbag or ill give you something yourwont forget in a hurry the otter warned the abbot folded his paws into his habit sleeves you birds listen to me we have not slain you or treated you badly but this does not mean we are soft your leader and his crow are dead the siege of redwall is over i have granted you the gift of life you will be spared but you must go back to your northlands and never return here again this is my decision i will not slay or enslave you as your general would have done to us however you will take with you a token to remind you of your visit to our abbey the collars will allow you to fly not too high though they will also prove an encumbrance forget your warlike ways from now on survival will be your main object the abbot nodded to constance the mighty female badger took the collar of the first rook between her paws with a small grunt of exertion she bent it so that the open ends of the iron closed about the birds neck the collar was now firmly in place not too tight but not loose enough to get off from bird to bird she went bending the iron neck rings into place until the operation was completed the rooks and the magpies pecked at the collars and cawed angrily sister may lifted her paw high now you villains when i drop my paw the bells will ring and you will fly northwards as fast as you can when the bells have rung three times my friend stryk redkite will be right behind you and you know what will happen to anybird who tries to stop or fly off in a different direction so good riddance birds i would advise you to fly pretty fast sister may dropped her paw bong boom the methuselah and the matthias bells tolled out across mossflower general ironbeaks depleted fighters flew off as fast as the burden of the iron neck collars would allow bong boom the abbey creatures watched them winging low over the treetops flying north across the summer green fastness of the woodlands bong boom the great red kite took off from the west wall threshold with the graceful soaring motion of a natural hunter kreeegah stryk redkite fly sissimay look yes see you stryk but remember your promise let them leave our country peacefully when the birds were lost to view cornflower and mrs churchmouse took rollo with them around the walltop to the south edge the abbot watched them go where do you think youre off to he asked them now that the abbey is safe father abbot we are going to keep a vigil from the south wall until matthias comes home with our young ones with your permission of course cornflower added mordalfus smiled understanding permission granted you are excused all other duties keep a good watch with stout hearts i know in my bones that our warrior will return with the young ones cornflower shaded her eyes with her paw repeating oetly to herself as she gazed south into mossflower martin return our loved ones safe to us baby rollo had not quite got the gist of cornflowers quiet words however he placed a chubby paw to his brow as he chanted with her marto aturnd luv ones safetyus the kingdom of malkariss was gone so were the last remnants of old loamhedge sunk deeper beneath the earth the jumble of stones that had once been planned as an underground realm was blocked forever to the eyes of everybeast choked and cemented in its deep grave by rocks shale soil and roots matthias looked up to the rim of the crater where trees leaned at odd angles in the sunken copse and brown and black soil showed through the riven cracks in the grassy carpet wearily he sheathed the sword across his shoulders and turned to his followers follow me to redwall they were halfway up the steep hill when vitch made a bolt he dashed downhill crossed the depression and began climbing the other side matnmeo started to pursue him but his father held him back let him go son he has no place among honest woodlanders they stood for a moment and watched the small rat scramble over a large boulder half embedded in the hillside suddenly vitch screamed and began scrambling back on to the boulder holding both paws up pleadingly no no please i never told them anything i wasnt going with them they found me the silken mask and cloak appeared in view then there was a whirling sound as the metalended bolas hissed through the air vitch died without a sound slagar matthias and orlando rushed down the hillside unloosing their weapons as they ran the crazed fox stood up he ran halfway to the fallen vitch changed his mind at the sight of the oncoming warriors and began scrambling to the top of the hill foam flecked wildly from orlandos mouth as he swung the axe pounding uphill as easily as he would over level ground spurred on by the sight of his archenemy matthias raced alongside the badger his teeth clenched tightly brandishing the sword of red wall the whole army turned and followed them slagar made it to the top of the hill he glanced behind to see the two warriors halfway up pursuing him still looking over his shoulder the masked fox ran but only three paces the earth swallowed him up he fell like a great fluttering moth down into the one place that had not sunk or collapsed the old well of loamhedge abbey the secret exit from the kingdom of malkariss matthias and orlando stood with their chests heaving as they gasped in air staring down at the crumpled mass far below in the deep well the secret way was no more an avenue of escape it was merely a deep pit that proved useless except for its final function the grave of slagar i swore to slay that silken hooded thief orlando sighed with regret matthias leaned upon his sword so did i friend this has saved us any argument lets get some rocks at least we can bury him together the body of vitch stfll with slagars bolas wrapped around its skull was lowered down into the pit the former slaves filled in the last of the pit with soil orlando tamped the earth with a hefty paw theres an end to him there are no words you could say over such a creature as matthias nodded agreement a poetic voice rang out from above a taker of slaves and a thief i know not what master he served cruel slagar has come to grief twas all that he deserved sir harry the big owl flapped down beside matthias yes ifs old sir harry the muse i see you won victory so i flew back to bring you the news just guess what happened to me i chased those vermin south i think theyre running yet when i heard a great noise from afar so i said to myself ill bet thaf s my friends doing battle beneath the ground then i turned on my wings and flew to see how a mouse could make such a big sound basil came ambling up oh hullo ifs you the great flyin poetic feedbag how are you old chap hungry ill wager wot matthias chuckled as he gave mattimeo his sword to carry come on son lets go home the summer of the golden plain drew to a glorious finish and the yellow flowers faded and died matthias had not returned to redwall but still cornflower did not give up hope she even pleaded with the abbot not to name the season though mordalfus had chosen autumn of the early chestnut he bowed to cornflowers wishes stryk redkite had returned to her beloved mountains and the orchard was beginning to get heavy with the rich harvest of fruit and berries cornflower stood on the south wall and faithfully kept up her vigil with mrs churchmouse and rollo see the woodlands are turning brown and russet soon the hazelnut and acorn will be ready for gathering well miss jess and sam nobeast gathers the nuts as well as a squirrel she said sadly aye beechnuts too mrs churchmouse added remember last autumn when all the young ones went into mossflower nutgarnering my tim and tess bom had long sticks to knock them down from the low branches cornflower sighed my matti got into trouble over the nutgathering he took his fathers sword from the gatehouse to rattle the branches with oh i do wish he and matthias were back mrs churchmouse if hopes were honey wed have a cupboardful cornflower ah well wed best get indoors if s way past young master rollos bedtime whos on supper tonight mrs churchmouse asked to change the subject er sister may and brother trugg it should be something nice come on little rollo supper and byebyes the infant took cornflowers paw as they descended the wallsteps a come f morrer on wall he wanted to know yes rollo well come to the wall tomorrow and all the tomorrows after that until my mattimeo comes back do you remember mattimeo rollo rubbed a tiny paw into his eyes he was tired amember timeo supper vms good redcurrant fritters and honeybread with hot elderberry cordial the abbey had been repaired after the bird damage food was plentiful and the season was mild yet a gloom hung over the abbey without the presence of absent loved ones cornflower sat late at table with constance and the abbot ambrose spike had gone to his wine cellar mrs churchmouse and john had carried rollo off to the dormitory and all the other redwallers had gone off to settle down for the night the only sound was winifred and brother rufus laying the trays out in the kitchen for next mornings baking mordalfus folded up his glasses and yawned still no sign of them yet cornflower no father abbot but dont you worry theyll come home soon you have great faith daughter that is good but we must learn in this life that the time comes to be realistic you must see that theyve been gone nearly a seasons length now that is a long time in the span of any creature a tear rolled down cornflowers cheek and she wiped it away busily oh dear my eyes get so watery when im tired maybe i should get brother dan to make me spectacles like yours constances heart went out to the brave little mouse and the badger stood up decisively right if s quarter moon tomorrow night if theyre not back by the time the moon is full then im going out to look for them the abbot nodded his approval an excellent idea old friend ill send the remaining sparrows with you and whoever you choose to take they shook paws across the table constance winked cheerily at cornflower come on cornflower off to bed with you or youll be too tired to climb those south wall steps tomorrow when cornflower had gone constance shook her head im afraid i must agree with you mordalfus a season is a long time and the longer theyre away the less chance they stand of coming back i know constance but i couldnt say that in front of cornflower she keeps her hopes up though she looks so sad these days and the churchmice too cxyou really suppose theyll come back constance toyed with some crumbs on die tabletop my heart likes to think so however my brain tells me different at least the hope that well be sending a search party out soon should cheer her up ah well come on young feller if s past bedtime the two friends shuffled off wearily up the steps into great hall shortly before dawn cornflower turned restlessly on her pallet in the dormitory she had decided not to sleep in the gatehouse cottage until her family was reunited soft voices rang through her head as grey figures stole across her dreams matthias is that you are you back she called out in her sleep no wait youre not matthias if s mattimeo oh my little matti how youve grown is it really you come closer and let me look at you the figure loomed closer out of the mists of slumber it was a warrior mouse neither matthias or mattimeo but so like them both the mouse smiled at cornflower and pointed in the direction of the south wall martin becomes matthias becomes mattimeo and so it goes go now a voice said the dream faded as some creature tugged at cornflowers paw she opened her eyes and sat up as baby rollo climbed on the pallet wanna waterdrink rollo firstee he pleaded cornflower hurriedly threw on a habit over her nightgown come on little one well take water and bread up on the wall lef s have a picnic breakfast the sun will soon be up rollo skipped beside her happily waternbreads pickernick on wall the sun rose over mossflower like a ball of red fire lighting the treetops and dispelling the long grey and purple rolls of cloud the sky was soft pink tinged blue birds heralded the day as a light mist rose from the forest cornflower looked out eagerly over the still woodlands not a leaf moved or a blade of grass stirred there was nothing out there she set rollos breakfast out upon the stones then clenching her paws in determination she waited still nothing the morning brightened as redwail abbey came alive with the sounds of creatures going about their daily chores and pursuits john churchmouse sat next to his wife at the breakfast table he looked up from the maps of mossflower he was studying w no baby rollo this morning dear mrs churchmouse passed the cheese to ambrose no thats strange cornflowers missing too i wonder where they have got to john finished his october ale at a single draught top of the south wall of course where they go with you every day come on ill take you up there and well stand with them for a while when they arrived at the south ramparts rollo was hurling apple cores over the wall at imaginary rooks morning cornflower glad to see youve got a warrior to protect you in case of invasion john remarked oh good morning to you both sorry i didnt give you a call but we decided to come up here early and bring breakfast with us john chuckled good job it wasnt porridge the way that young scamp is chucking stuff about here rollo why dont you try throwing a pebble with your little sling itll go further rollo tried but the pebble kept hitting the top of the wall and bouncing back half preoccupied with watching the antics of the little one cornflower turned away from her vigil constance joined them and as the mice played with the baby bankvole she looked out across the south reaches casually at first then constance froze as if she had been turned to stone she remained rigid staring southwards and slightly west cornflower looked up as she retrieved rollos stone constance what is it dust dust where from seems to be from beyond that bend in the path behind the trees i cant tell yet wait a moment yes if s dust all right and if s coming this way the three mice scrambled to the top of a battlement cornflower jumped up and down and constance had to catch her apron strings to keep her from falling ifs dust somebeast is coming up the path i know ft cornflower shouted john churchmouse quickly donned his glasses there must be a great many to send up a dust cloud like that so early on an autumn morning theyll be round the bend soon listen can you hear voices constance leaned forward straining her ears faintly she could catch the strains of voices chanting the familiar warriors cries of redwall and mossflower round the bend of the path they came the paws of the horde raising a cloud of brown dust cornflower could see the leaders as they began to march in double time at the sight of redwall abbey ifs matthias and mattimeo theyve returned she shouted john churchmouse and his wife yelled aloud look meres our tess and tim hooray constance leaned out across the battlements theres basil and jess and sam see theyve got young cynthia with them i can see two badgers theres an owl look an owl hedgehogs shrews woodlanders by the fur and daw theres a great army of woodlanders coming this way turn out the abbey tell the father abbot sound the bells matthias marched shoulder to shoulder with his friends while the horde packed in behind them gazed up in awe at the red sandstone abbey which reared above the trees ahead mattimeo began laughing tim tess and cynthia pounded him on the back as they shouted and cheered wildly good old redwall tell ambrose to get the barrels open whos that on the walls if s your mum look theres ours too mum mum uyou think they can hear us the methuselah and the matthias bells began pealing and clanging out across the clear morning air bong clang boom bong clang boom basil halted the army right markers get fell in come on you sloppy lot were coming home like a proper army not a ragamuffin crowd ranks of six chins in chests out shoulders back step lively there you at the back catch up come on come on laddie buck youre not on a daisychain ramble now know quick march never gives up does he jess muttered to sam from the side of her mouth you watch hell be the first to break ranks and charge if anybeast throws a pie over that wall the hot morning sunlight shafted down on the brown dust rising between the green and gold leaves of mossflower as the main doors of the old red sandstone abbey burst open the abbot walked out at the head of the abbey dwellers they lined the path facing matthias at the head of his army there was complete silence as they stood looking at each other the warrior mouse unslung his great sword stepping forward he laid it flat in the dust at the paws of mordalfus father abbot we have come home there was a mighty cheer which shook the timbers of the main gate frame then the ranks broke as every creature dashed forward to greet old friends and meet new ones so it was the young ones returned to redwall it took the whole of that day in the abbof s study for the full story to unfold from both sides matthias jess basil and orlando with mattimeo tim tess sam cynthia and auma crowded in alongside cornflower constance and ambrose spike food was brought in to them as the young ones related all that had happened from the night of the feast to malkarisss cells matthias orlando jess and basil related the hunt for the young ones from the same night up to the death of slagar it was late afternoon before they were done the abbot had listened intently to the harrowing narrative he shook his head sadly in the midst of all our joyous reunion we must never forget fallen friends particularly queen warbeak and logalog i will hold services for all our fallen friends at the first sunrise of spring and they will remain dear to our memories for all the seasons to come in the sad silence that followed matthias decided to lighten the mood of the proceedings a little he slapped his paw down on the table well then mordalfus you old twig i suppose youve been sitting here twiddling your paws while weve been away tell me how did you manage to keep busy the abbot chuckled oh we managed i suppose however ill let cornflower tell you about that cornflower took her paw from around mattimeos shoulder for the first time that day she stood up and grinned mischievously hmmm it was as dull as ditchwater without our warriors and young ones about then one fine day we had a visit from some birds let me tell you about it they listened spellbound fuming with indignity at the thought of baby rollo being held hostage cheering for sister may and her drugged strawberries laughing aloud at the warrior ghost mouse and the terror it caused among the rooks and finally applauding constance and stryk redkite at the final struggle mattimeo picked up his fathers sword and offered it to cornflower here mum you should be the champion of redwall matthias shook his head in amazement by the daw and the fur what a brave bunch we have at our abbey i would dearly like to meet this stryk redkite constance gazed fondly at auma as she stroked the young ones headstripes you will matthias you will someday now we must find quarters for our new friends sister may and brother rufus will open the infirmary to all for sore paws and old wounds must be treated im afraid theres no supper tonight youll have to go straight to bed anyhow you lot look as if a long

slapped basil smartly upon the paw mr stag hare will you kindly give your overworked jaws a rest and be quiet thank you now let me explain the reason that we are not cooking supper is that the season

rotten egg yaaaah foremole entered the study rubbing his nose oi jus bin arunned over boi a mad crearur hum orlando laughed so hard he hurt his jaw the feast of the autumn of the warriors return began just after dawn mist rose in the orchard as the sun began to mount in the sky and rosy apples dripped dew onto the heads of the creatures who sat beneath the trees there were far too many for tables so the entire party sat on the grass chestnuts were baked and roasted on the fire pit dug by the moles cheeses were rolled from the larders fresh fruit lay in heaps between honeycombs and small hillocks of new baked bread ambrose spike tapped the casks of cider october ale berry wines and various fruit cordials which stood on trestles around a thickboled beech tree the liberated slaves sat transfixed they had never seen such an abundance of fare moles called for gangway as they trundled deepernever pies out on trolleys long poles slung between otters wobbled under the weight of cauldrons of watershrimp and hotroot soup hazelnut and acorn scones were laid out in rows to cool by the raspberry canes mrs churchmouse and cornflower barely managed to stop baby rollo diving from a pear tree into a maple and mint cream trifle while mattimeo and his friends were recapturing their lost season with other young ones from the slave pits they dashed about plucking wild cherries from the tops of iced cakes and sneaking candied chestnuts from an arrangement which sister may was making she scolded them tongue in cheek as the intricate heap fell apart for the umpteenth time jabez

expanses of sky and the autumn sun shone down kindly upon the happy scene as the creatures of redwall feasted through noontide across the balmy evening until the night fires and lanterns in trees illuminated the joyous scene below the half moon came out to watch for the sun it shed pale light upon baby rollo fast asleep on orlandos lap the big badgers battleaxe hung from a beech tree nearby he turned to matthias who was drifting off into sleep holding cornflowers paw warrior i have never seen such a wondrous place as this look at the beautiful building those huge safe walls the fruit and food growing from the ground and that pond it glows like a silver plate in the moonlight aaaahhh these contented old ones peaceful wise and your young ones too they look so happy and good even when i lived out on the western plains with my auma we never knew such wellbeing as this can you explain it to me matthias let his eyelids droop until they shut orlando my good friend the explanation to it all is merely one simple word redwall the badger turned to reply but matthias and cornflower were asleep he looked down at baby rollo slumbering on his lap without a care in the world settling himself down orlando turned his face to the night sky which surrounded mossfiower he repeated the precious word aloud to the moon redwall extract from the diary of tun churchmouse recorder of redwall abbey it is the summer of the rosebay willowherb great masses of the pink mauve flowers nod their heads by the sides of our abbey paths seven seasons have passed counting the autumn of the warriors return and this will be my second season as recorder john my father retired he is now helping the abbot to compile a great volume of mossflower recipes strange when i was young our father abbot was an old mouse yet still he carries on changeless as ever i think he will outlive us all the slaves who werefreedfrom the evil ofmalkariss have all settled here they are our brothers and sisters now and a happier band you could not meet the sparra colony is growing and flourishing in our roofspaces though now it is called warbeak loft sir harry the muse lives up there with them he was elected leader and poetry instructor several times now he has resigned in despair at the sparra language though his love of authority always leads him to be reelected redwall is surely a place of curious happenings not the least of which is the adoption of cheek by basil there was much amusement three seasons ago when he became officially the hares young one now he caus himself cheek stag otter and the impudent rascal has also adopted all basils manner isms stryk redkite is at present paying us a visit she has a mate a huge fellow named skine and they have their first eggchick too sister may was delighted at their announcement that the young one is to be named after her however she insists on the little female being called may and not sissimay ambrose spike is revelling in his latest title high keeper of cellar keys and the entire family of jabez stump rosyqueen his wife and their ten hungry daughters are living in the wine cellar with jube ambrose has put in an order to the foremolefor the cellars to be extended and it will be attended to immediately after the mole crew finish enlarging and lining the tunnels they dug during ironbeaks seige they are a useful underground system particularly in deep winter snow the guosim marched off into mossflower again they were born to wander flugg is a strong logalog wise too and he brings them to winter here every fourth season they are good allies rollo and cynthia bankvole are bellringers just as tess and i once were rollos latest yearning is to become a squirrel and join the band of sam and elmtail to become part of the mossflower patrol that rollo he will probably want to be a badger next constance is getting ready to sit out in the sun and take things easy she is teaching auma all she knows and some season soon auma will become the mother of redwall she is dearly loved by every creature in our abbey orlando is constances firm friend and they are seldom apart his axe hangs in great hall as lord of the western plains he only has to stand on the west battlements to survey his lands last summer the churchmouse family mas united to the warriors much to the delight of my mother and cornflower mattimeo and my sister tess were married our parents like to sit out in the sun a lot my mother and father cornflower and matthias like all life they are growing no younger they prefer to talk of the old times with friends and that is good they deserve a tittle rest and peace after bringing us up though matthias still joins basil and ortando to train the defenders it is difficult to believe that we have all grown from young scamps into responsible creatures but i am rambling i will finish my writings and go outside into the sunlight to the ceremony and the feast at the main gate forgive me for not telling you earlier but today we have a new redwall champion and a naming party matthias is to place the great sword in the paws of his son mattimeo and he will be our abbey warrior from henceforth there is one scamp who made doubly good did i not tell you tess and mattimeo have a little son and i am an uncle my mother and cornflower chose the new babys name he is to be called martin so the legend of redwall has come full circle through martin to matthias from matthias to mattimeo and finally back to the little life we are all so proud of martin son of the warrior the bells are tolling for the ceremony so you will have to pardon me for hurrying off ite this may your lives be as full and happy as ours and may the seasons be kind to you and your friends the door of our abbey is always open to any traveller roaming the dusty path between the woodlands and the plains tim churchmouse
