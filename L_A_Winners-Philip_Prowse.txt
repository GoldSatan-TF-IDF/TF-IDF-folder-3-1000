street for half a minute then she walked to the door goodbye mr samuel please find the chief for me she said chapter three the rideawinner ranch i watched sandy bonner leave my office she had told me a very strange story was her story true i wanted to find out about her i decided to follow her i picked up my hat and my jacket quickly i left the office i ran down the stairs when i got to the hallway sandy had left the building i went outside i saw sandy at the corner of the street she was getting into a small black car a x i got into my own car which was parked near the office building as sandy drove away i started my old grey chrysler and i joined the traffic sandy bonners black x was a hundred metres in front of me it was a beautiful friday in la blue sky sunshine and smog there was a lot of traffic the engines of the cars trucks and buses made the smog in the air i thought about the clean air in hawaii then i thought about herman and about the money that i owed him the traffic moved slowly there were four cars between me and the black x sandy drove through the city and then towards pasadena i followed her we turned onto the foothills freeway we drove east towards the san gabriel mountains fortyfive minutes later i was driving past the santa rosita racetrack sandy was still a hundred metres in front of me but after another ten minutes the black x turned off the freeway i turned off too and i started to follow sandys car along a small road but i slowed down soon i was about three hundred metres behind sandy i didnt want her to see me the road was straight and flat there were dry bushes on each side of the road and there was dry grass the grass was yellow and dusty after about three kilometres i saw some trees the black x turned off the road near the trees sandy drove onto a track i slowed down again and i stopped the chrysler i watched sandys car the x went along the track for three hundred metres then it stopped near some buildings sandy got out of the car and she went into one of the buildings i started the chrysler again and i drove slowly towards the trees i turned off the road and onto the track where the track joined the road there was a red and white sign the words rideawinner ranch were painted on it after a few metres i turned off the track and i parked the car in the trees there was a pair of binoculars in the chrysler i picked them up and got out of the car i leant on the top of the car and i pointed the binoculars at the buildings i looked through the binoculars i saw a large white ranch house and i saw some long low wooden buildings next to it there were some horses near these buildings the low buildings are the stables where the horses are kept i said to myself i got back into the car and i waited i could see the ranch but no one at the ranch could see me or the chrysler half an hour later a car came along the road and turned onto the track the car passed me and it went towards the ranch house it was a big red x the red x stopped next to sandys black car and a man got out he went into the ranch house i sat in my car and waited nothing moved it was hot and dusty no one was riding a horse nothing happened i decided to go closer to the ranch house i looked at the track between the trees and the ranch house there were some bushes at the side of the track the bushes were halfway between the house and my car i got out of the chrysler i ran with the binoculars in one hand towards the bushes when i reached the bushes i lay down on the ground the ground was hot and very dusty i lifted the binoculars and i looked through them i could see the ranch house clearly now i could see the red and black cars outside the red x was turned towards me there was a piece of paper fixed to its front window i turned a small wheel on my binoculars now i could see the paper more clearly i read some words on the paper the paper was a carpark ticket for the santa rosita racetrack then i turned the wheel on my binoculars again i looked at the house immediately i saw sandy bonner she was inside the house she was standing near one of the large windows she was talking to someone a tall slim man with dark hair that man isnt dick gates i thought gates has red hair suddenly sandy stepped forward and hit the man across the face the man lifted his hand was he going to hit sandy at that moment sandy moved away from the window i couldnt see what happened next i stood up i was going to run to the ranch house and help sandy stay where you are a man shouted i turned about five metres behind me there was an old man he was wearing blue overalls a cotton shirt and a wide hat he had a rifle in his hands he was pointing the gun at me i smiled and i started to walk towards the old man hi i said whats wrong there was a shot from the rifle and the dust by my feet flew into the air i stopped who are you stranger the old man asked what are you doing here i thought for a few seconds the old man chewed gum slowly he watched me i im watching birds i said smiling i showed him my binoculars there were some interesting birds over there i pointed towards the house i was watching them the old man looked towards the ranch house there arent any birds there mister he said i smiled again no there arent i said when you fired your rifle you frightened the birds people dont wear suits when they watch birds the old man said angrily why are you hiding in these bushes this is private land now go back to your car and leave the old man stepped forward and pushed me with the rifle who are you i asked and why are you telling me what to do im lou weaver i work here ive worked for miss bonners family for more than thirty years the old man said he pushed me with the rifle again miss bonner is my boss i do what she tells me to do i have this gun and im telling you what to do now leave and stay away from here i turned and walked quickly back to the chrysler i didnt say anything i didnt tell the old man about my meeting with sandy sandy bonner had told me not to come to the ranch i had made a mistake i didnt want the old man to tell sandy about my mistake lou weaver followed me he stood in the trees as i got into the chrysler i saw him in the driving mirror as i drove away lou weaver was chewing his gum and looking at me i drove back towards la i had to help sandy and i had to find the chief how then i remembered the carpark ticket on the window of the red x the words santa rosita racetrack were written on that carpark ticket i didnt know anything about horse racing and racehorses so i decided to go to santa rosita racetrack i wanted to find out about horse racing and i wanted to find out more about the thin dark man perhaps someone at santa rosita knew him chapter four santa rosita racetrack i turned off the freeway at santa rosita racetrack it was a small racetrack but it was beautiful there were tall trees by the dusty track there were high darkblue mountains behind it some jockeys were riding their horses on the track the sun shone down from the blue sky it was late afternoon but the sun was very bright everything was peaceful there werent many cars in the car park i parked my car and i put on a baseball cap and some dark glasses then i left the chrysler and walked towards the track i stood by the dusty track and watched the horses there was no racing today these horses were training the horses were very large and very fast i was surprised when a horse went past me the noise from its feet was loud and dust flew into the air i looked around me near the track there were some office buildings and some stables there was a high fence around these buildings i walked towards the stables area there was a gateway in the fence the gate was very tall it was closed as i went nearer i saw the gate open a truck with a trailer came out i didnt see anyone near the gate but it closed behind the trailer i waited and watched a few minutes passed then a x with a trailer came in from the road the car stopped by the gate there was a carpark ticket on the front window of the x the driver put his head out of the side window of the car he spoke into a metal box near the fence then the gate opened and the car and the trailer went through the gateway i walked over to the gate and i waited a minute later another car came in from the road the driver spoke into the box the gate opened as the car went through the gateway i walked beside it now i was inside the stables area i walked a few metres away from the gateway hey you a man shouted suddenly someone came up behind me he held my arms and pushed me against a stable wall stand against the wall hold your arms out dont turn round the man said i did what the man told me he searched the pockets of my clothes the man was behind me and i couldnt see his face he took my detectives licence out of my pocket then there was a loud laugh the man pulled off my baseball cap and my dark glasses lenny samuel the man said turn round i turned round a big man was standing in front of me he was wearing a brown uniform with a dark cap and glasses i knew him his name was slim peters but his name was a joke he wasnt thin he was fat many years ago both slim and i had been la policemen slim i said what are you doing here slim pointed at his uniform im a racetrack security guard he replied but im asking you a question what are you doing here i didnt answer his question how did you see me i asked slim pointed to the gateway i saw you on tv he replied he laughed again there was a tv camera on the fence above the gate then slim pointed to a small building near the gateway i work over there he said so you can see everyone who enters and leaves on tv i asked yes slim replied but lenny you havent answered my question what are you doing here i want to talk to someone who knows about racehorses slim i said what happens to the best racehorses when they retire can you help me i didnt ask slim about the thin dark man who drove a red x come to my office said slim well have some coffee and well talk about your problem we went to slims office and we sat down slim gave me back my detectives licence are you the only security guard here slim i asked im the only guard here this afternoon slim replied theres no racing today friday is a training day the horses are training today security is low on training days there are more guards on racing days when theres racing security is very high on racing days we have to check everyones id and the racetrack officials have to check the horses ids on racing days do horses have id i asked yes slim replied every racehorse has a passport with a photograph and all the horses details written in it and every horse has a number tattooed inside its mouth slim made some coffee we sat at his desk and drank the coffee slim looked at the tv screen as cars went in and out of the gate then we talked about my problem who shall i talk to about retired racehorses i asked slim talk to the racehorse trainers who are here today slim said ask one of the trainers about retired racehorses but if you are going into the stables area you must have a security pass ill give you one he opened a drawer in his desk and he pulled out a pass it was a small yellow card on a piece of cord the words all areas were written on the card slim gave me the pass you can use this today slim said put it round your neck can i use it tomorrow i asked no you cant use it tomorrow slim replied there are yellow passes for training days and blue passes for racing days i cant give you a blue pass only racetrack officials owners trainers jockeys and the people who take care of the horses have blue passes other people cant go into the stables area on racing days i took the pass but i continued talking to slim i learnt a lot about racetrack security there was racing at santa rosita racetrack from december to april there were races on wednesdays and saturdays horses trained at the racetrack on the other days the horses owners had stables at the racetrack horses were brought to the racetrack to train they stayed in the stables while they were waiting to train and they rested in the stables after training then the horses were taken away on training days trailers with horses were arriving and leaving all day nobody checked the horses or the trailers on training days on racing days the horses stayed in the stables while they were waiting to race and they rested in the stables after their races but on racing days the horses ids were checked carefully the ids were checked when the horses arrived at the racetrack and they were checked again when they left racetrack officials looked at the horses passports and at their tattoos after thirty minutes i stood up and walked to the door slim had given me a lot of information i tried to remember everything that he had told me thank you for your help i said to slim ill talk to some trainers now i put the yellow security pass round my neck ok lenny slim said i was pleased to help give me back the pass when you leave come here and watch the races tomorrow afternoon i smiled no thank you i said ill be working a few minutes later i was watching some jockeys bringing their horses back to the stables i talked to one of them then i talked to some of the people who took care of the horses i found out some interesting facts about racing people earn a lot of money from horse racing one woman told me people bet millions of dollars on horseraces the best racehorses are very valuable most racehorses are less valuable when they retire she went on but some retired racehorses are used for breeding their owners breed young racehorses from them these breeding horses are very valuable none of this information helped me sandy didnt use the chief for breeding the chief earned money because people wanted to ride a famous winner the chief was sandys horse people who wanted to ride him knew that only sandy could use the horse to earn money so who had taken the chief and who was the thin dark man at the ranch i decided to look for the red x chapter five the red x the doors of some of the stable buildings were open i went into the buildings and i looked around some of the stables were quite small they had stalls for only two horses but some stables were large they had stalls for five or more horses many of the stables were locked i looked into some of them through their windows every stable had a number i watched two men bring a horse from a small stable stable they put the horse into a trailer and they drove away the stables area was quite busy and nobody looked at me it was now early evening many horses were coming back from training on the track their jockeys took them to the stables to rest i walked along the roads between the stables im not going to find the chief here i thought and im not going to learn anything more here i need to talk to sandy bonner again ill go back to la now sandy will phone me this evening suddenly i saw a red x with a trailer it was near a large stable stable which was a hundred metres from me a tall slim dark man was shutting the stable doors is that the x that i saw at sandys ranch i asked myself i dont know there are hundreds of red xs in la and there are thousands or tall slim dark men a minute later the red x went past me it was going towards the gateway there were two people in the car as the car passed me i saw the drivers face he was the tall slim man that i had seen at sandys ranch he was the man that sandy had hit i couldnt see the other person clearly was it a man or a woman i didnt know i watched the car it stopped at the gate for a moment and then it left the stables area i walked towards stable there was no one near the building the doors were closed i went to the side of the building and tried to look through the window but i couldnt see into the stable there was some wood fixed inside the window i put my hand in my pocket and i took out my special keys my special keys could open many different doors perhaps i could open the stable doors with one of these keys i put one of the keys into the lock on the stable doors i tried to turn the key but it didnt turn i put a different key into the lock no luck then i heard a car coming towards the stables area i didnt want anyone to see me near stable i put a third key into the lock this time the key turned i opened the doors quickly and i stepped inside the stable i locked the doors behind me there was very little light inside the stable there was a smell of horses and straw i looked around me along the wall to my left there were stalls for horses but there were no horses all the stalls were empty there were no stalls on the righthand wall and there were no doors and no windows in that wall but there was a big cupboard on the wall halfway along it the cupboard was three metres high and two metres wide there was nothing in it it was empty then i heard a noise the noise was very close to me was it coming from the big cupboard no the cupboard was empty and there was nobody in the stable i did not understand i opened the stable doors a little and i looked outside i had a shock the red x with the trailer had come back it was reversing towards the stable doors i closed the doors quickly and looked round again where could i hide there was a pile of straw in the corner of the stable i ran to the corner and hid myself under the straw i heard the stable doors open suddenly there was more light inside the stable then i heard the car and the trailer coming in i heard someone open the back of the trailer i didnt move i waited i heard people moving in the stable after a few minutes i heard someone shut the trailer they opened the stable doors the car and the trailer left the stable again and stopped outside i heard someone shutting and locking the doors the stable was darker again then i heard the car moving away i was safe i lay under the straw and i waited there was straw in my ears and in my nose i waited and listened for a few minutes then i got up and i walked towards the stable doors i looked around there was very little light and i almost fell over something there was some more straw in the stable now near the doors and there was a bag of horse food someone is going to bring a horse here soon i thought i must leave quickly i unlocked the stable doors and opened them i did not see anyone outside i stepped out of the stable and turned round i was going to lock the doors suddenly there was a terrible pain in my head someone had hit me on the head someone had hit me very hard i fell to the ground a mans voice said you were right dick there was somebody hiding in the stable then someone put a bag over my head and someone tied my hands behind my back with a rope i lay on the ground and waited what next there was a terrible pain in my stomach then in my arms and then in my legs someone was kicking me very hard someone was kicking me again and again was i going to die then another man spoke dont kill him i want to ask him some questions he said the kicking stopped ok mister the second man said what were you doing in the stable tell me it you dont

horses through them i watched the people i was looking for a tall slim man suddenly i saw him he was sitting in the grandstand he was about thirty and he was wearing dark glasses and a dark suit it was the man that i had seen at the ranch and in the red x he was talking to another man who was sitting next to him the other man was about ten years older he was tall and heavy he had long red hair tied in a ponytail he was wearing a brown jacket sandy had told me about this man it was dick gates i watched the two men through my binoculars they couldnt see me the men were talking and they were watching the races the darkhaired man had a mobile phone and he was making lots of phone calls i moved the binoculars and i looked at some other people in the crowd suddenly i saw another man that i knew herman herman started to walk towards me he was about one hundred metres away but he hadnt seen me i didnt want to talk to herman but i wanted to watch the two other men so i didnt move herman came closer and closer there were hundreds of people near the track but herman was big and tall it was easy to see him now he was only twenty metres from me i turned and started to walk quickly away from him i walked to the betting office this was a long low building with many windows people were standing in lines at the windows they were waiting to make their bets behind each window there was a person who took peoples money and wrote down the details of their bets i joined a line perhaps herman wont see me i thought then a hand hit me on the back a very large hand hi lenny herman said loudly what are you doing here do you like racing i didnt know that hi herman i replied quickly yes i like racing i want to bet on the next race i smiled at the huge bodyguard and pointed to the line of people at the betting window herman joined the line behind me i want to talk to you about my money lenny herman said you made a mistake when you gave me the envelope there was only in it oh im sorry about that herman i said the line of people was moving i was getting nearer the betting window dont worry about it herman said with a big smile give me my now i was almost at the front of the line i was almost at the betting window there was one man in front of me i didnt know what to do herman i began youre next lenny said herman he pushed me forward suddenly i was standing in front of the betting window there was a woman behind it yes the woman said i took the money from my pocket i had and i had to bet on a horse quickly i didnt know which one to choose i looked at the list of horses for the next race and i saw a name that i knew golden dragon golden dragon was going to run in the next race only a few people were betting on the horse his odds were to if golden dragon wins the race ill get fifty times more money than i bet on him i thought i want to bet on golden dragon to win the next race i said quickly the woman took my money she gave me a piece of paper with the details of my bet written on it i turned to herman i want to watch this race i said after that ill give you your money ok lenny said herman lets watch the race together herman bet on a horse called margarita then we walked to the track we waited for the race to start i looked through my binoculars dick gates and his friend were sitting in their seats the thin dark man was speaking into his mobile phone again margarita is a winner lenny margarita is going to win this race herman said she won her last two races no golden dragon will win i said herman laughed golden dragon he said hes the slowest horse in the race hes never won a race the horses were going towards the starting gates herman pointed to a big brown horse his jockey was wearing a gold and black shirt thats golden dragon he said he wont win golden dragon is big and strong i said herman looked at the horse again yes youre right he said he is big and strong but hes a loser margarita is going to win i looked at the horses through my binoculars they were ready to start the race then i looked quickly at the grandstand dick gates and his friend were holding binoculars they were looking at the horses by the starting gates suddenly the crowd shouted the starting gates had opened the race had started i looked at the horses galloping along the track golden dragon was the slowest horse chapter nine the race faster golden dragon faster faster someone was shouting it was me the horses came round the track they were galloping towards us margarita was in first place but golden dragon was in second place at first he had run slowly but now he was running faster and faster the horses galloped past us people were shouting golden dragon and margarita were sidebyside the two horses crossed the finishing line together which horse had won we waited while the officials looked at a photograph of the finish that was amazing said herman golden dragon was very fast hes never run so fast five minutes later there was an announcement from the loudspeakers the result of the last race is first golden dragon and second margarita i jumped up and down and i put my arms round herman wow herman said how much did you win wait here i said i walked to the betting window i showed the woman the piece of paper with the details of my bet she gave me my money golden dragon had won at tol and i had won i gave herman then i said goodbye to him i looked at the grandstand again where were gates and his friend they werent sitting in their seats had they left after golden dragons race perhaps they had bet on golden dragon too but they hadnt left their seats before the race i remembered the darkhaired man and the mobile phone perhaps they had been betting by phone yes that was the answer but there were other questions these two men knew sandy they had stolen the chief and sandy had told me golden dragons name what was happening i walked away from the track i took off my cap and my dark glasses i walked towards the stables area there were two security guards and some racetrack officials standing by the gateway to the stables area slim wasnt there i watched the gateway the two guards stopped every car at the gateway they checked the drivers id if there was a trailer an official checked the horses id too i put the blue security pass round my neck and i walked up to the gate i waved to the security guards and smiled then i walked through the gateway into the stables area the area was very busy there were horses and cars and trailers everywhere jockeys in brightlycoloured clothes were talking to trainers i walked slowly towards stable i stopped about fifty metres from the large stable i put on my cap and my dark glasses again and i stood near some trees the red x and the trailer were parked outside stable i didnt see a horse in the trailer i stood and i waited then someone that i knew walked towards stable it was lou weaver i looked at his face he was very pleased about something but he was very worried about something too he stood outside the stable a few minutes later a jockey came towards stable with a big brown horse the jockey was wearing a gold and black shirt lou spoke to the jockey and took the horse from him i knew the horse it was the winner of the last race golden dragon i didnt understand if golden dragon was sandy bonners horse why hadnt she told me this then a man came out of the stable it was the tall darkhaired man he held lous arm and they walked into the stable with the horse the doors closed ten minutes passed then the darkhaired man appeared again he opened both of the stable doors and he reversed the red car and the trailer into the stable he closed the doors behind him i waited after another five minutes the doors opened again and the x and the trailer came out the darkhaired man was in the car he stopped the car outside the stable he got out and he went back inside the building i walked slowly towards the car and the trailer now there was a horse in the trailer its golden dragon i thought hes going home after his race i walked back towards the gateway i sat on the ground by a tree i had an idea i was going to wait until the red car and the trailer left the racetrack then i was going to look inside stable again i had a lot of questions and i wanted some answers i had been hit on the head and tied up with a rope outside this stable why had that happened what were these two men doing why was lou weaver here did sandy know about this i sat and waited ten minutes later the red x and the trailer went past me and stopped at the gate there were two people in the car now one was the darkhaired man i couldnt see the other person clearly was it dick gates or was it lou weaver the car and the horse were checked then the x went through the gateway and left the racetrack i was going to be careful today i waited for an hour the x did not come back the stables area was not very busy now and the sun was not so bright i took my special keys out of my pocket and i opened the doors of stable soon i was inside the building and i had closed the doors behind me it was dark inside the stable i put my right hand on the wall was there a light switch i moved my hand along the wall nothing i moved forward slowly with my hand on the wall at last i found a switch it was in a corner i touched the switch but no lights came on i was going to walk back to the doors i was going to open the doors a little i wanted some more light inside the stable but i didnt move i heard something it was the noise of an electric motor i took my gun out of my pocket something very strange was happening light was coming into the dark stable but it wasnt coming from outside it was coming from the righthand wall after a few seconds i could see clearly the big cupboard was moving slowly there was a door in the wall behind the cupboard the cupboard was fixed to the door the switch that i had touched had started an electric motor and the electric motor was opening this secret door yes the light was coming from behind the door chapter ten the chief the light was coming from a room behind the secret door in the room there was a stall and in the stall there was a big brown horse i had heard a strange noise on my first visit to stable now i understood the noise had come from this room i walked towards the horse stand still a mans voice said something hard and sharp was pushed into my back i knew the voice i started to turn towards the man stand still the man said again throw your gun behind you then lie down on the floor i did what the man told me to do i lay on the floor and i waited for a few seconds then i turned over very quickly lou weaver was standing beside me he was holding a large fork it was a fork that was used for moving straw very quickly i pulled the fork from lous hands and i kicked his legs i kicked them very hard lou gave a loud cry and he fell down on the floor beside me i picked up my gun and i moved over to lou i sat on his chest the old man couldnt move and i had the gun ok lou i said do you remember me yes i remember you lou replied you came to the ranch yesterday then he looked at my security pass are you an official here he asked he was frightened no i said my names lenny samuel im a private detective im working for sandy bonner im looking for the chief i showed lou my detectives licence he was surprised ok he said youve found the chief but sandy knows where he is what do you mean i asked let me get up and ill tell you everything lou said we stood up lou walked over to the stall and pointed to the big brown horse this is the chief he said im taking care of him here until tomorrow why is the chief here at the racetrack i asked and why is he in this secret room lou touched the horses nose the chief made a soft noise golden dragon didnt run in the last race lou said the chief ran in the race the officials didnt know about it the chief and golden dragon are the same height and the same colour but the chief runs much faster than golden dragon hes a winner but the racetrack officials check the horses passports and tattoos on racing days i said the chiefs id and golden dragons ids are different yes the officials check the horses ids on racing days lou said they check the ids when the horses arrive and they check them again when they leave but nobody checks them on training days the chief came here in the trailer yesterday afternoon he was put in this secret room the trailer was empty when it left the racetrack nobody checked the trailer the chief stayed here last night this morning lou went on golden dragon came here in the trailer the officials checked his passport and his tattoo but golden dragon didnt run in the race this afternoon golden dragon was put in this secret room the chief was taken to the track the chief ran in the race instead of golden dragon the chief won the race then he was brought to this room again and golden dragon was taken away in the trailer his id was checked at the gate the chief will stay in this room again tonight lou continued there is no racing tomorrow sundays are training days when the trailer comes tomorrow it will be empty nobody will check it then the chief will go back to the ranch so you are working with these criminals i said and sandy knew about it you are criminals too how much money did you and sandy win lou miss bonner and i havent won anything lou said angrily gates and his friend ventanas are the criminals they own golden dragon they came to our ranch on thursday morning and gates stole the chief we didnt know their plan then at midday today they came to the ranch again they told us about their plan they put sandy in a storeroom and they locked the door they had guns they made me come here with them ventanas said if you dont help us look after the chief well kill sandy bonner i had to help them suddenly there was a noise from the front of the stable lou pulled the gun out of my hand be quiet he said stay here with the horse and dont make a noise gates and ventanas have come back if they find you here theyll kill you i lay down in the straw next to the chief he was very big please dont stand on me i whispered to him weaver a mans voice shouted where are you why is that door open lou walked towards the front of the stable i could not see anything but i could hear the conversation im sorry mr gates lou said i was hot and the chief was hot after the race and forget about the horse gates shouted the horse will be dead tomorrow dead why lou weaver asked angrily weve done everything that you wanted the chief ran in the race instead of golden dragon the chief won the race for you now you must let sandy go free you must go away and never come back the other man ventanas laughed it was a cruel laugh we won million when golden dragon won the race he said we made bets all over the country we made our bets by phone we dont want anyone to find out about that so the chief will die and well kill the girl and well kill you too weaver kill sandy lou said angrily no there was a loud bang and a cry of pain there were two more loud bangs and then there was another noise something fell to the ground ive shot him dick ventanas said are you ok no gates said the stupid old man has shot me in the arm very carefully i looked out from the chiefs stall lou weaver was lying on the ground my gun was on the ground beside him ventanas was holding a gun dick gates was holding his right arm with his left hand there was blood on his hand what shall i do with the horse ventanas asked shall i kill

to kill sandy i had to move fast chapter eleven la winners when gates and ventanas had left i came out of the secret stall lou weaver was badly hurt but he was alive there was a bullet in his shoulder his shoulder was bleeding there was a lot of blood i took off lous shirt and tore a piece of cloth from it i tied the cloth round his shoulder i covered the hole in his shoulder but i couldnt stay with him i had to get to the rideawinner ranch i had to get there quickly gates and his friend had driven away fifteen minutes before and they were going to kill sandy someone will come and take care

going to be full of cars the rideawinner ranch was only a few kilometres away but i couldnt drive there in less than an hour what could i do suddenly something pushed me in the back what was it was it a gun i turned round quickly it was the chief he had come out of his stall he was looking for lou the big horse saw the old man lying on the ground the chief went to him and touched lous body with his mouth the horse was trying to help his old friend then i had a plan i looked around the stable there was a piece of rope hanging on the wall i tied the rope around the chiefs head and neck i whispered to the horse come with me chief were going to help sandy i took the horse towards the stable doors gates and ventanas had locked them i took the special keys from my pocket a minute later the chief and i were outside the stable i left the doors open it was late afternoon i looked around people were putting horses in trailers no one was watching us i had to hurry soon it was going to be dark ok i said to the chief ive never ridden a horse before its going to be difficult but i have to try i jumped onto the chief and we moved towards the gateway i looked ahead slim and another security guard were standing at the gate some racetrack officials were with them they were checking ids a car with a trailer was going through the gateway i kicked my feet on the chiefs sides we galloped towards the gate suddenly slim saw us he tried to shut the gate stop slim shouted what are you doing where are you going i didnt reply slim stood in the gateway for a moment then he ran the chief galloped through the gateway i turned the horse in the car park and we stopped i shouted to slim theres a man in stable hes been shot i shouted call a doctor and call the police then i turned the chief again and we galloped across the car park there were long lines of cars leaving the racetrack but we werent going to go on the road we were going to gallop across the fields towards the ranch i held on tightly to the rope round the chiefs neck the big brown horse galloped very fast he knew where his home was i smiled riding was easy but then i saw a fence in front of us galloping was not difficult but could we jump the fence i kicked my feet on the horses sides and the chief jumped he went over the fence but i did not stay with him crash i fell onto the dusty ground i sat on the ground my shoulder was painful and i was worried how could i get to the ranch now then i heard a noise it was the horse the chief was walking back to me he came up to me and waited i stood up slowly i jumped onto the chiefs back we started galloping again i saw the ranch in the distance there was a car moving along the track to the white ranch house it was a red x were we too late as we got closer to the ranch we slowed down soon the chief was walking quietly the big brown horse was tired he had worked hard that day the red x had stopped in front of the white ranch house the chief and i went to the side of the house and i watched the door after a minute the door opened and dick gates and sandy bonner came out gates was pushing sandy in front of him he had a gun in his left hand sandys hands were tied with a rope and ventanas was walking behind gates and sandy he had a gun too suddenly sandy stopped walking she turned and looked at gates wheres lou she shouted at him hes dead gates replied the stupid old man shot me gates pointed to the blood on his right arm sandy started to cry please leave me she said i wont tell anyone about you you took the chief and you won your money now youve killed a kind old man please go and leave me be quiet and get into the car gates shouted he pointed the gun at sandy no one had seen the chief and me we were standing quietly at the side of the house get into the car gates shouted again i kicked the chief the horse and i moved forward the two criminals heard the horse and they turned round but we were only five metres away go chief go i shouted the horse jumped at the redhaired man and hit him very hard gates fell to the ground there was a shot the shot came from gates gun ventanas cried with pain and fell to the ground too gates had shot him i jumped down from the horse i ran back to sandy she was looking down at ventanas hes ok she said when the chief hit gates gates shot his friend in the leg gates was lying on the ground he was not moving his eyes were closed i picked up the two guns then i untied the rope from sandys hands and i tied it round the criminals hands i took the mobile phone from ventanas pocket quickly i called the police after that i told sandy about my visits to the santa rosita racetrack i told her about the secret room in stable and i told her about lou weaver and my ride from the racetrack lou isnt dead i said i couldnt tell you about gates and ventanas this morning i was frightened sandy said but i was worried about lou hes a good man will he be ok yes lou will be ok i said what happened here tell me the whole story now

and about lou he wanted me to help him but he didnt tell me his plan he frightened me i hit him he was very angry this morning i went to los angeles and spoke to you again sandy went on i said forget about me and the chief but when i got back here gates and ventanas were here again they told us their plan they wanted to take lou to the racetrack the chief was behaving badlythey wanted lou to take care of him ventanas had a gun he was going to kill lou if he didnt go with them so sandy said i phoned you i phoned you while ventanas and gates were taking lou to their car i tried to tell you about their plan but gates came back into the house he heard me speaking to you and i couldnt tell you everything gates locked me in a storeroom they were going to kill me this evening sandy said thank you for saving me thank you for everything mr samuel i was pleased to help you i replied but it was the chief who saved you sandy put her arms round the horses neck hes wonderful she said and she smiled i wanted her to put her arms round my neck but she liked the horse not me come to the ranch any time mr samuel sandy said come and ride the chief again he likes you thats very kind of you i said but i
