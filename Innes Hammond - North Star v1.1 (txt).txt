there was more noise on that platform than there ever had been when north star was drilling the wind roaring through it banging and slamming at the iron sheets tearing them loose whirling them away everything chaos and the thuds of the waves thundering beneath our bodies the halfsubmerged rig had a dead feeling it was like a rock awash mike randall onetime militant with a police record could never forget the petrolbomb or what it had done to the child when he came home he was still running with just one last place to hide north star was the oldest rig in the north sea operating west of shetland in the most dangerous sea area of all randall was on the trawler duchess which became her guardship until the night of the savage storm when one mans decision marked the turning point and started a desperate battle for life hammond innes north star chapter one it was march the wind cold from the northeast and the fisher maid plunging down the waves with a wicked twist to her tail i shut the door of the bridge behind me leaving the skipper to listen to the forecast and went down the ladder heading aft to check the gear i knew the forecast would be bad but it couldnt be any worse than the weather we had had off bear island i paused in the shelter of the superstructure here on the starboard side i was out of the wind and i took out my pipe filling it automatically standing there staring out across the darkening sea i had seen to the stowage of the gear myself a thousand miles back when we had finished trawling it was just an excuse to be out in the open away from the smell of oil and stale food the blare of the radio and the company of men i had been locked up with for too long on a trawler its bloody difficult to be alone when you want to shetland was still just visible the black humps of the distant hills like wave patterns against a cold green strip of sky and the light on sumburgh head blinking above the hard line of the horizon only that pale green strip to mark the bitter cold wed been steaming through the rest of the sky was clouded over now a flurry of sleet drove like a veil across the starboard navigation light inside of two days we would be back in hull and still i hadnt made up my mind the shadowy figures the crash of glass the sudden blaze of bottled petrol and that childs face at the upstairs window it had haunted me throughout the voyage slowly the pale light faded in the west i stood there watching it until that last vestige of the dying day was engulfed by night wondering whether the strike would still be on what the hell i was going to do waves were breaking against the stern the driven spume white in the gathering dark and the wind whistling in the top hamper i was thinking of my father then wondering what he would have done giving his life for a cause in a country not his own would he have allowed his principles to be totally destroyed by a single cruel and senseless action the match made a small flared arc as i tossed it over the side my hands gripping the rail the metal cold to the touch my eyes staring westward to shetland fifteen miles away he had been born in shetland and i had never been there i hadnt even known him only the legend my mind slipped back my life in flashes and always that legend a guiding light to everything i had done and i wasnt sure any more a door opened the muffled sound of the radio reminding me of the industrial world just two days steaming away the docks the stuffy smoky meetings the arguments the pickets the turmoil of overpopulation man in the mass christ how could one man one individual speck find his way in the tangle of motives and pressures mike i turned glancing upwards to see sparks standing at the top of the ladder his thin hair blowing in the wind the bridge door slammed behind him as he came down to stand beside me a sheet of paper thrust towards me i pushed it away i dont need a forecast to tell me itll be force before the nights out its not the forecast his thin rather highpitched voice was half blown away by the wind a message for the skipper well give it to him then i said irritably i have but since it concerns you i could smell the beer on his breath as his pale face thrust closer the eyes bright behind his glasses you in trouble how dyou mean look mike he said you were shipped at the last minute after les sinclair had gone down with a virus you and the skipper youre not buddies like les so he may not tell you i thought id warn you thats all the police will be waiting for you when we dock a detectivesergeant wright heres a copy of the message and he pressed the piece of paper into my hands thanks they want to interview you i suppose you know why yes i know why i stuffed the paper into my pocket staring out into the night saying nothing i had been afraid of this all through the voyage somebody must have recognized me and now when i stepped ashore the police would be there wanting a statement and if i gave it to them if i admitted i knew who the men were then i would be a witness for the prosecution and the decision would no longer be a personal one something between me and my conscience and made of my own volition it would be the result of police interrogation at least it would seem like that to everybody but me dyou want any sort of a message sent a private message lawyers or anything like that he was still standing there at my elbow a man whose world was the ether who fed on information dragged out of the air on invisible wavelengths his curiosity glowing in his owlish eyes no i said theres nothing a lawyer can do he hesitated standing there beside me waiting doubtless it was kind of him but radio operators are all the same they want to be in everybodys confidence in the end he left me and i was alone again watching as the icebattered trawler plunged southward down the north sea each surge and twist carrying me closer to the moment of decision but you dont change the whole direction of your life because a child is nearly burned alive or do you the storm was rising and in the end i gave up thinking about it and went to my cabin lying there sleepless and fully clothed the ships plates writhing to the violence of the movement i was back on the bridge in time to get the news it came right at the end the talks broken off and the strike still on weeks now and every shipyard in hull at a standstill did that mean pier son watt were out too the skipper was there and he turned and looked at me you hear that and the poomps going full bat theyd been going flat out ever since wed hit the ice theyll get us home i said he didnt answer moving to the port side of the bridge his carpet slippers flapping loosely he wasnt a big man but there was a lot of strength in that short longarmed body the round bullet head almost neckless on broad shoulders and he had an inner strength his silences more telling than words he stood there for a while staring out into the murk ahead better get some sleep its going to be a long night i nodded it was his watch now and i went below checking the engineroom and the hold the fish pounds were just about full almost kit that would be about stone landed a lot of it highpriced worth the bashing we had taken up there on the edge of the pack and my share as mate looking good the fact that she was low in the water did not matter now we were running with a quartering sea and the pumps were holding if wed been steaming into it things might have been different it was a long night all right at four in the morning i was back on the bridge visibility almost nil and the big deckle they called the porpoise with his eyes glued to the radar screen the skipper was in the chartroom working out a decca position his thick hairy hands juggled with the parallel rule pencilling a cross just east of our intended course winds veered a point pooshing us more than i thought he ordered a correction to the helm as he entered up the log and then instead of leaving me to my watch he slid the chartroom door shut three weeks now you heard what they said on the news every yard in hooll at a standstill he had his broad bottom wedged against the chart table his slightly protuberant eyes fixed on me every blasted yard he pulled his pipe and and began to fill it when did you first go into trawling some years back now ah asked when spring of the lady betty old harcourt shipped as a deckie did you i nodded and your mates ticket four years later he lit his pipe solid and immovable as the ship fell off a wavetop sending the rule and dividers skidding across the chart ah doant understand you and thats the truth a bloke with your education he shook his head frowning still got your union card an all yes but not the hooll trawlers officers shipyard isnt it i didnt say anything and he grunted what made you switch to trawling my own business i said aye he took the pipe out of his mouth his eyes staring but just tell me ahd laike tknaw i laughed what could i tell him the sea i said its in my blood i suppose you were at the marston yard on clydebank a member of the strike committee in and before that you were in prison result of a demo that tangled with the police thats a long time ago youre still the same bloke arent you come to the point i said orl raight ah will pierson watt now if theyve coom oot sounds laike it an theyre nonunion all of them young watt wont employ union men so where do we go for a refit not my problem i said no not your problem but youre doing i reckn then youre wrong he shook his head an obstinate look on his face youre a good mate i grant you that but youre a troublemaker i wouldnt have shipped you if he stuffed his pipe firmly back into his mouth if what i asked i was doing you a favour you were short of a mate aye but it didnt have to be you and then he shrugged and said orl raight ahll tell you jimmy watt asked me to take you get the bugger off our backs thats how he put it and then his big forefinger was jabbing me in the chest do you deny you were on the committee not on the committee i was called in to advise them advise them eh his voice was still quiet and under control but the hull accent was stronger now something building up in him an undercurrent of menace advise them on what intimidation he leaned his round head closer the grey eyes cold and fishlike in the hard light or did they call you in to get at jimmys foreman to get bob entwhisle to what the hell are you talking about i was suddenly angry remembering how id walked out of that crowded meeting the little congregational hall thick with smoke and full of violence you know nothing about it doant i well i know this you listen to me i was shouting and i reached out and grabbed hold of his shoulder doant you dare he slammed his big fists down on my arms wrenching himself free keep your hands off just listen i said it was the economics of the strike the future of the yards the financial state of shipbuilding in the north east they were scared about their jobs he glared at me they doant care about their jobs they doant care about anything just so long as they can smash us all to hell you may be right what was the point of arguing with him i suddenly felt tired my watch i said youd better get some sleep yourself now why would they ask you about the financial state of the shipbuilding industry i was trained as an economist london school of economics you know so much about me you should know that i turned to the chart what do you intend to do you cant make another trip without a refit theres a leak forard where we hit that growler ah doant need you to tell me that he relit his pipe staring down at the chart theres no roosh ahll have a word with jimmy in the morning aye he nodded to himself weve a little time yet and he turned abruptly without another word and left me alone to my watch it was a long four hours nothing to relieve the monotony but the slowly changing position of an oil rig seen only as a blip on the radar screen the wind was gusting fifty knots the ship standing on her head and no visibility in the blinding murk of sleet and spray plenty of time to think and my brain too tired too numbed by the battering to work out what i was going to tell the police when we docked there had been two of them two shadowy figures and then the crash of glass the sudden blaze their faces lit as they turned and ran i switched on the decca navigator concentrating on the clicking dials to get a fix doing it automatically knowing i could identify them both and worrying about bucknall claxby i didnt care about he was an older man a hardline militant brought in to cause trouble if it had been just claxby there on his own i wouldnt have hesitated but young harry bucknall was the son of a good honest shipyard worker who had marched to london with the jarrow boys in the thirties a postgraduate university student intelligent and an anarchist at least he had done it out of conviction believing that violence was the path to revolution and i had no doubt who had been the ringleader i entered up the fix and went back to stand by the wheel staring out into the black night all i had to do was tell the police tell them the truth but it was the charge that worried me if i hadnt been there if the little girl had died in that fire it would have been murder the charge could still be attempted murder and myself in the witness box the full glare of publicity and everybody knowing i had been interrogated by the police it would be my evidence my evidence alone that convicted them i would be cast in the role of a judas and they hadnt meant to harm the little girl they hadnt known she was there all this time i was pacing up and down the bridge tumbling under my feet the noise of the storm beating at my ears the elements in tune with my mood everything in chaos the world my life everything was this a sort of crossroads in the long journey from womb to grave if only there were somebody i could turn to somebody to lean on to give me strength to tell me what the hell to do i was thinking of fiona then wishing to god that just something in my life had turned out right and then a rogue wave came out of the night hitting us on the quarter water roaring along the port side and as the ship fell off the top of it with a slam that hurled me against the man at the wheel i heard him cursing under his breath our eyes met and his big mouth opened in a grin them lads ashore all toocked oop in bed with their womenfolk makes me laff on a night like this why cos they doant know when theyre well off always itching for something me i joost want what theyve got raight now id settle for the missis all warm and cosy laike naice soft bed that didnt move unless i made it he grinned winking an eye the longing of weeks at sea on his face my watch ended and i went to my bunk lying in the dark thinking wearily i was an idealist and idealists get cut down to size when ideals are transposed into politics maybe i wasnt tough enough when it came to the crunch was i a coward then my ideals shattered by a petrol bomb but the doubts had started long before that when was it at that clydeside meeting when a small group of militants screamed fascist at me because i had tried to spell out for them what would happen i had dried up and handed the mike over to a man who talked their language not the logic of falling orders and redundancies was that when the doubts had started i couldnt be sure it was such an accumulation of things it was just on ten when i went back on to the bridge daylight now a grey world cloud and sea all one in colour and the whitecaps rolling in from dead astern i glanced at the gyro and then at the skipper youve altered course aye aberdeen he nodded his eyes on a small freighter headed for norway and making heavy weather of it as she butted the tail end of the storm did you talk to watt he didnt answer me and after a moment i ducked out of the bridge to the door of the radio room the fug in that little cubbyhole was overpowering the air thick with smoke sparks was thumbing the key tapping out a message in his shirt sleeves a cigarette burning beside him in a rusty tobacco tin full of stubs i waited sweating there until he had finished any news for me i asked he picked up his cigarette turning in his chair and looking at me his dark eyes large behind the steelrimmed glasses you know were headed for aberdeen morse crackled from the loudspeaker and he reached out tobaccostained fingers for his message pad listening with his pencil poised then he relaxed that rig again so much traffic for redco ive hardly been able to send at all and the old man desperate to jump the queue and get us slipped he hasnt notified the aberdeen police not his job to do that the office knows of course so maybe they have he leaned back his eyes fixed on me but half his mind on the morse theyre waiting to haul anchors so i suppose they got no joy on the bressay bank les is fit again by the way and he added sorry about that the old manll be sorry too in a way les isnt the best mate in the fleet whatll you do when we get in i hesitated wondering whether the police would be waiting for me at aberdeen go on the club again i suppose one trip in six months i was hating myself for being so dependent on trawler owners for employment conscious of a deepseated urge to start something on my own why dont you switch to oil supply ships something like that thats where the future is trawling he shrugged his shoulders doesnt matter to me i go where marconi send me but a man like you with a masters certificate you want to go where the future is he jerked his head at the sound of the morse hes talking to the tug owners now a big german job steaming north from heligoland the forecasts good so theyll be under tow tomorrow night every trip its the same down past brent and auk all this area of the north sea nothing but rig talk bluewater staflo north star glomar take my advice i listen and i know therell be more rig supply ships than trawlers soon maybe i stood there for a moment listening to the crackle of the morse clydebank newcastle hull all the political involvement of my life my mind switched to shetland to the islands now far down below the horizon was it the island blood in my veins that had made me abandon capitalist america as a kid was that why i had started on my wanderings seeking the values i could hot find in the rich world my mother had embraced or was it the legendary is figure of my father had i built him up as a hero in my mind simply because she had tried to bury him i didnt know my mind was confused all i knew for certain was that everything i had done everything i had believed in had suddenly turned sour and then sparks murmured the offshore capital of the world he coughed over his cigarette aberdeen you know it i shook my head never been there he smiled well thats what they call it the morse ceased and he glanced at the clock his fingers reaching for the dials turning to the emergency waveband take a walk round the harbour when you get there have a look at the pipe storage depots the diving outfits all the clutter of stuff the oil rigs need youll get the message then all right aberdeens no longer a fish port its an oil rig supply base and if i were in your shoes he stopped then his body suddenly tense as a ghostly voice calling in clear began repeating the single word mayday mayday mayday the voice was urgent giving details now it was a trawler with its engines out of order being swept on to a rockbound coast in heavy seas shetland sparks was scribbling it down on his pad and as the voice began to repeat the vessels position he glanced up at a largescale map looks like hell drive ashore on whalsay island he ripped the sheet off his pad and got to his feet nothing we can do about it but the old man better know and he hurried past me through into the bridge the name of the trawler was the duchess of norfolk we looked her up out of curiosity she was just under tons built at lowestoft in and owned now by g petersen of hamnavoe shetland new engines paxman diesels so what had gone wrong all the chief said was bloody shetlanders they wouldnt know a crankshaft from a camshaft he didnt like the shetlanders having been stuck there once with gales and a leaking ship the duchess of norfolk was in fact south of whalsay and with the wind backed into the northeast she drove towards south nesting we caught snatches of radio talk very faint as the trawler ranger steamed to her assistance it gave me something to occupy my mind following her progress on the shetland isles chart no she cleared muckle fladdicap a bare three cables to the eastward drifted inside muckla billan and litla billan missed the rock islet of climnie by a shift of the tide and hit fiska skerry at by then the trawler ranger was almost up with her and inside of half an hour had a line aboard that was the last i heard of her for we were already in sight of aberdeens north pier with the city showing grey through the murk above the pale line of the links and i was busy getting ready to dock the skipper took us in heading straight for albert basin where the trawlers lay as we approached point law a survey vessel sweeping past us began to open up sparks appeared at my elbow see what i mean he nodded towards a cluster of tanks to starboard with supply ships moored alongside mud silos he said the area beyond was being developed the sound of reconstruction work coming to us across the water thats the future youre looking at it was an extraordinary sight the whole harbour area crowded with ships drilling ships survey vessels seismic ships tugs and ancillary craft all jampacked among the fishing vessels and upriver from torry harbour a litter of pipes and buoys equipment of all sorts lay piled up on the quay more mud silos and a new berth nearly completed as we moved slowly into albert basin we passed very close to point law and the supply ship bunkering there it was the first time i had been really close to one of these flatbottomed tuglike vessels that keep the rigs drilling i only know trawlers i said moored there the ship looked very sleek very efficient but i had seen one once heading out to the brent in a strong westerly gale seas breaking over the flat open afterdeck id rather have the fisher maid up around bear island than one of those in a north sea gale he shrugged his eyes smiling behind his glasses all im saying is if you got in on the act you wouldnt be short of a ship for years not the way new rigs are coming into service a trawler passed us very close another just ahead of us as we nosed our way down the length of albert quay searching for a berth i could see the fish market now and then a gap opened up and the skipper said quietly looks a laikely hole reckon theres just room for us he ordered port wheel our bows swinging and i took the loudhailer out on to the wing of the bridge we were tied up by the lumpers offloading the catch since aberdeen was not our home port there was no pay only subs from the local agent to see the boys home they had a long rail journey ahead of them and most of them were away by the time the first pound boards were being replaced and the emptied compartments hosed down the skipper called me to his cabin he was packing his bag you in a hurry to get back he knew i was the only officer who hadnt got a wife waiting for him in hull i shook my head he was standing holding a shirt and a bundle of dirty socks in his hand a slug of whisky on the locker behind him ah thought not the bulging eyeballs stared at me take it then you wont object to staying the night aboard weve no ships husband here you see and les doesnt arrive till tomorrow he waited a moment and then nodded good thats settled then better use my cabin sos you can keep an eye on things laike the lumpers packed it in shortly before and then i had the ship to myself i sat on the bridge smoking a pipe and watching the lights come on as dusk descended over the city and the high land behind it a stillness had settled on the basin the quay deserted except for the occasional figure moving along the shadowed wall of the sheds a siren blared briefly and a trawler up near the entrance started backing out i watched her as she backed for the open sea thinking of the mate preparing his gear and the ice ahead and the skipper wondering where the hell hed get a catch that would satisfy his gaffers after that the port seemed dead nothing stirring night had closed down on aberdeen i tapped out my pipe and went to the galley to collect a plateful of shepherds pie and veg the cook had left for me the galley stove was still warm and i put a kettle on for coffee with the coffee i had a glass of brandy from the officers exbond locker a cat had come aboard and as i drank i watched it stalk its prey in the shadows cast by the deck lights to be suddenly alone on a ship gives one an odd feeling of isolation all during the voyage the fisher maid had been alive with men an organized unit of activity her hull vibrating to the pulse of her engines resounding to the noise of the sea now it was deserted a hollow shell inactive still and strangely quiet i had time to think now but somehow i seemed unable to concentrate i was tired of course but i think it was the stillness and the quiet that prevented my mind from focusing clearly i finished my drink went down to my cabin and packed my gear shifting it to the skippers cabin in the bridge housing then i turned in i was in my pyjamas having a last smoke when i heard footsteps crossing the gangway the murmur of voices i went through into the bridge and out on to the wing two figures stood talking on the deck below looking for somebody they turned at the sound of my voice their faces pale in shadow something slightly menacing as they stared up at me then one of them moved coming out of the shadows to the foot of the ladder heard you were still aboard wed like a word with you he started up the ladder a short burly figure his round pugnacious face framed in dark sideburns eyes deepset and a fulllipped mouth remember me i nodded the sight of him taking me back to that angry meeting in hull he was a newark man and nothing to do with the shipyards his name was bob scunton and he had confronted me when i was still trying to address the meeting prodding me in the stomach and telling me to belt up and stop talking a load of statistical rubbish the lads didnt want to know the other man i had never seen before all right i said you can come up and i led them into the bridge there was only one seat so we stood facing each other and i didnt like it i had the feeling of being cornered well what is it last month the night of the shipyard workers meeting scuntons voice was slow and deliberate his eyes watching me you got a little girl out of a burning house and handed her over to the neighbours didnt give your name just handed her over and slipped away right i didnt say anything standing there waiting conscious of the other man with a slight cast in the left eye that made his gaze oddly disconcerting thought no doubt you wouldnt be recognized my mouth felt dry all my fears now suddenly realized i knew scunton knew his reputation these were men who operated in the shadows manoeuvring and motivating others controlling events they werent union men they werent members of any political party but they were always there in the background whenever there was trouble come to the point i said all right i will he licked his lips his eyes darting round the bridge what about a drink while were discussing it its been a hard trip i told him im tired so are we he growled soon as we heard you werent putting into hull we came north he thrust his head forward you havent talked to the police yet have you no he nodded okay but when you do what are you going to tell them thats what we want to know its no business of yours but i knew it was i could see it in the way the two of them glanced at each other and suddenly all the turmoil and the doubts exploded in anger you bastards put them up to it is that it is that what youre scared of that ill identify them and theyll involve you scunton moved towards me you shop them and well but the other man interrupted him ill handle this bob his voice was quiet a hard flat voice you were recognized one of the neighbours a man the police will expect a statement he paused the disconcerting gaze sliding past me then suddenly he asked what were you doing standing there in the rain outside no washbrook road i hesitated unwilling to explain myself to men i knew would never understand you werent at the meeting that night no there was a mood of violence i said a lot of threats were made mainly directed at pierson c watt and the yard foreman we believe in solidarity scunton growled in that thick voice of his pierson watt were the one yard you believe in violence i told him all right maybe we do when its necessary i turned back to face the other man if i hadnt been there bucknall and that fellow claxby might well be facing a murder charge so you know who it was scunton cut in yes i said i know who they were and suddenly i didnt care if you want to throw petrol bombs why the hell dont you have the guts to do it yourselves and to risk innocent lives a little girl you threw it his voice was so quiet it stopped me like a bucket of icecold water thats what we came to tell you staring at him seeing the hard bitter line of his mouth the cold grey eyes glinting in the gleam of deck lights i felt suddenly scared of him who are you i asked him he gave a little shrug a shut look on his face we have a witness he pulled a packet of cigarettes from his pocket and offered me one and when i pushed it away he said you were alone nobody to corroborate your evidence he took out a cigarette and lit it the movement of his hands deliberate he was giving me time to take it in so it will be your word against his and the man who will say you threw the petrol bomb is a local man hell make a good witness get out my hands were clenched the words coming through my teeth he didnt move drawing in a lungful of smoke and staring at me bucknall doesnt matter but claxby is too useful a man to be thrown away get out of here you could be useful too he said it reflectively as though considering the matter then he shrugged but at the moment were concerned with the east coast yards weve failed with the trawlermen the fisheries officer of their union wont play but if we can hold the strike long enough then therell be very little fish coming in anyway that will give the unions the leverage they need in their negotiations a trial with two militants in dock wouldnt suit us at all he paused and then added we were able to have a word with your radio operator before coming here in a pub youre out of a job again it seems and when i didnt say anything he smiled he told us he thought you ought to be commanding a supply ship thats where the future lies isnt it he was looking at me again and the expression of his eyes had a speculative quality get into oil he said quietly and forget about what you saw in washbrook road he stubbed out his cigarette then turned abruptly towards the door jerking his head at scunton think about it he said over his shoulder all you need tell the police is that it was too dark to see who they were and if i tell them the truth he swung round on me then youd be a fool and he added you keep your mouth shut and ill see our witness does the same you understand he stared at me a moment then he nodded and went out scunton following their footsteps sounding hollow as they went down the ladder and across the deck to the gangway and after that i was alone again still in my pyjamas and feeling cold i got myself a drink my hands trembling wishing as i had done so often in my life that i had somebody to fall back on not just the legendary figure of my father but somebody something to give me strength and suddenly i was thinking of the islands seen the previous evening black against that green strip of sky shetland the land where my father had been born i had never been so close to shetland before and sitting there the brandy warming my guts it gradually came to me that now was the moment i would go north to the islands now while i had the chance chapter two my first sight of shetland was a lighthouse sliding by the window and green lawn slopes falling from rock outcrops everything fresh and clean touched with the luminosity of evening light the highlander landed and i saw the remains of old wartime buildings as we taxied in to park beside a large british airways helicopter there was a light drizzle falling and as i stood waiting on the apron for my baggage the smell of the grass and the sea all about me i had a deep sense of peace something i hadnt felt for a long time most of my fellow passengers were oil men returning to the redco rig for ten minutes or so they filled the little prefab terminal with colour and the babble of their accents then they trooped out to the waiting chopper and in a buzzsaw whirr of engines and blades they were lifted up and whirled away suddenly everything was very quiet only the rattle of crockery as a woman went round the tables collecting empty cups the murmur of voices from the ba desk where the dispatch clerk was talking to the crew of the highlander there was an ordnance survey map on the wall i got myself another cup of coffee and stood looking at it refreshing my memory based on the shetland charts i had pored over on the bridge of fisher maid sumburgh head is the southernmost point of the whole island chain the tip of a long finger of mountainous land jutting south from the main port of lerwick the distance by road looked about thirty miles a voice at my side said can i help you he was a small man in blue dungarees darkhaired with bright blue eyes and a ruddy face i want to get to hamnavoe i said and pointed to the little port which was at the north end of the island of west burra a little below lerwick but on the west coast he ran a car hire business but when i said i couldnt afford to rent a car that didnt seem to worry him hamnavoe he shook his head dont know anyone going to hamnavoe youll have to go to lerwick first theres a bus in the morning or maybe i can fix you a lift either way it means staying the night and he added my wife can fix you bed and breakfast if thats any help his name was wishart and i stayed the night with them in a small house above sumburgh village with breezeblock outbuildings in which he kept his cars he had been a mechanic servicing local farm vehicles until the oil companies started drilling off shetland now ive got a real good business not just tourists you see its all the year round oil executives contractors technicians commercial travellers weve never known it so good his face was beaming yes but how long is it going to last his wife said quietly and behind her words was the experience of hard times ah his eyes glanced quickly round the neat little parlour with its gleaming new furniture and bright chintz curtains thats the question isnt it we had finished the meal and were sitting drinking whisky out of a gin bottle the whisky had a strong peaty flavour you being from aberdeen maybe you know the answer to that i shook my head im a trawlerman trawlers eh you looking for a job up at hamnavoe maybe i replied cautiously its a lot smaller than lerwick you know youd do better in lerwick he poured himself another finger of the pale liquor topping my glass up at the same time only this morning i rented a car to a man wanting to get hold of a trawler chap something to do with one of the rigs but there arent any big boats up here only peerie ones and theres none of them going cheap anyway the fishermen here they hate the oil companies theyre scared of what could happen the torrey canyon was bad enough but suppose one of these production rigs blows particularly if they strike oil to the west then all of the shetland fisheries could be destroyed millions of tons of oil polluting the seas for miles around thats what scares them he looked at me his eyes very bright dangerous bloody game anyway trawling i mean theres just been one of them wrecked went ashore yesterday in a northeasterly gale skipper dead and two of the crew injured the duchess of norfolk he nodded thats right drifted into south nesting bay hear they beached her in the east voe of skellister thats all right until another northeaster piles the seas in you mentioning hamnavoe reminded me of it the skipper came from hamnavoe now what the hell was his name not a shetlander norwegian i think you ever been up to graven and when i told him i had never been in shetland before he nodded staring into his glass an old wartime base like sumburgh here but bigger they had seaplanes catalinas and a big airfield and scalloway thats where the norwegian boats were based after they moved from lunna landing men and arms in norway bringing refugees out i was only a peerie boy at the time but my dad was up there a blacksmith fixing armaments all sorts of odd jobs and he went on to talk of his father the stories he had told until it was almost midnight and his wife chased him off to bed it rained all night i could hear it drumming on the slates but in the morning the sun was shining a magnificent view of sea and rocks and greensward all sparkling in the freshness of that early northern light i left with the post van that had brought the mail down from lerwick the washed brightness of land and sea calling to something deep within me we passed under ward of scousburgh mosey hill and hallilee the road dropping down to the sea vistas of blue water stretching away to bressay and the isle of noss it was all new an island world yet i felt at home and the remoteness of it seemed suddenly to cut me off from all the rest of my life it was a strange feeling and i sat there beside the postman hardly saying a word he dropped me about three miles from lerwick where the scalloway road came in from the west you wont have to wait long anybody will give you a lift a breeze had sprung up a cold little wind from the north i lit my pipe watching the red van disappear i was alone then the hills all around me sheep noises and the sea down in the valley would anybody at hamnavoe remember my father i didnt even know when he had left the place my mother might have been able to tell me but i hadnt written to her in years and anyway she was dead now she had never been to shetland never talked to me about his early life a builders truck loaded with breezeblocks took me to the outskirts of scalloway where the road to hamnavoe turned off to the south along the placid waters of the east voe a small drifter was anchored under the castle sea birds lying to their own reflections and i could see water stretching away beyond the bridge that joined trondra island to the mainland shore i was there about twenty minutes before a tourist gave me a lift into hamnavoe it was lunchtime then i bought some biscuits and cheese left my bags at the stores and strolled up a grass track to sit on a bank below some cottages a purseseine fishing boat was coming in round the headland another moored at the concrete pier both of them woodenhulled and painted black the woman in the stores had told me there was nobody of the name of randall in hamnavoe now she had said something about a plaque in the church but when i went there after my lunch it was locked there was no pub and the few people i met had never heard of him it was the teacher up at the school who suggested i talk to miss manson an elderly spinster living at brough about a mile down the road towards grund sound but the wind had backed westerly and it was raining then i found lodgings in a little house on the hill that had a bed and breakfast sign in the window and was full of children it was a bleak place looking north to a scattering of islands half hidden in the rain the man was away at sea the woman uncommunicative and the radio blared incessantly as darkness fell i walked down to the pier but there was nobody there the two fishing vessels silent and deserted and hamnavoe itself a dead place wrapped in a wet blanket of low cloud i was walking slowly back my head tucked into the collar of my anorak when a shaft of light shone out from a cottage doorway and a voice said you the stranger been asking about alistair randall yes i said and he invited me in he was a beaky tiredlooking man with thin white hair and a nervous blink to his eyes the door closed behind me and i was in a cosy little room with a peat fire a little old woman very plump sat in her knitting chair the needles clicking bright eyes watching me out of a round face that showed scarcely a wrinkle my wife he said and i was conscious of an atmosphere in the room an undercurrent of strain mrs sandford knew the randalls she nodded an almost imperceptible movement of the head the knitting needles clicking away and her eyes fixed on me with a strange eagerness can you tell me about alistair randall i asked her eyes dropped to her knitting and there was an uncomfortable silence her husband smiled at me blinking his eyes he was here all one summer it was very warm in the room and i unzipped my anorak you did know him then the knitting needles stopped the room very still and she was staring at me again who are you she asked i hesitated before replying since leaving the fisher maid i had been using my mothers maiden name of fraser just in case they tried to follow me but now my name is mike randall i said alistair randall was my father the sound of her breath was like a sigh and she nodded slowly yes i see now the eyes of course we did wonder albert and me when we heard you had been making enquiries that strange eagerness was back in her eyes as she gazed up at me from america arent you i was brought up there i left when i was twenty she seemed disappointed but your mother she went out as governess to a rich businessman and then married him during the war i think yes during the war muriel she nodded her name was muriel is she still alive i didnt say anything and she turned to her husband give mr randall a chair albert and a glass of whisky to keep out the damp she asked me a lot more questions then about myself and what i had done with my life so you didnt come to see me i came to find out about my father did you know i wrote to your mother no it must be three or four years ago now she shouldnt have written like that her husband said his voice gentle almost apologetic i told her not to life hasnt been easy for us she muttered angrily both of us getting old now and albert hasnt worked in twenty years it was my son insisted i write did your mother never mention i had written to her mrs graber bay view narragansett rhode island usa thats right isnt it i think she must have written to her for money and because she was disappointed that i hadnt come to hamnavoe in answer to that letter it took time and patience to get her to talk about my father her husband hardly said a word he was from scalloway and i dont think he had ever met alistair randall but she had virtually grown up with him for the randalls had had a small farm at houss on east burra and her eldest brother had kept a lobster boat down in the voe of north houss alistair often came out in the boat with us the softness of her voice the faraway look in her eyes i sensed there was something more but all she said was he was a very wild boy he had gone to sea at the age of fifteen on an inshore boat fishing out from hamnavoe then his father had died the farm was sold and his mother had gone to live at easter quarff which was where she had come from i didnt see him for a long time after that he got a job on a lerwick drifter and when the shetland times printed his views on the working conditions of the island drifters he started writing for the papers regularly you see she produced some faded cuttings from her work bag and while i was glancing through them she told me how he had shipped in a danish cargo boat bound for svendborg and hadnt come back for a long time did he go on to russia i asked for the last of the cuttings was about whaling in the barents sea but she didnt know he only spoke of denmark and norway oh and finland he had been to finland how long was he away almost three years and then he came back to lerwick no to hamnavoe of course i was married by then but you saw him again she glanced across at her husband a smile that had a quality of sadness yes i saw him again did he talk about russia at all he was a communist you know she shook her head no he never talked to me about russia how old was he then she paused while she worked it out he was a year younger than me so he would have been twentythree that made it for he had been born in i asked her how long he had stayed in hamnavoe just the summer that was all he was writing most of the time a book i think but i never heard it was published and he was gone before winter he was a very restless man was that when he went to america but she wasnt sure i never heard from him again only at the end she delved into her work bag again an envelope this time she held it out to me her small hand trembling slightly it was because of this i asked albert to bring you in i thought you must be a relative you making enquiries of him here he will have written it just before he was killed you can read it if you like i dont mind the envelope was dirty and torn and it had no stamp on it the address was in pencil barely readable mrs anna sandford hamnavoe shetland the letter inside consisted of two sheets of ruled paper taken from some sort of notebook a thin pencilled scrawl that had obviously been written under great tension it was was headed somewhere outside madrid and dated february darling anna we are cut off and being shelled to hell we have held on now for twentyeight weary months not much food and bitterly cold the communists have pulled back our flank exposed tomorrow or the next day i shall probably be dead in these last hours i think of shetland and of you theres not been much of happiness in my life and what little there has been i had with you a pity i ever left the islands but a mans destiny lies in himself and is unavoidable it has led me inevitably to spain where we have played out the overture for a new world war the bright hopes of youth lost in this mess of blood and cordite you may think it strange that my thoughts are with you now and not with my wife but muriel is a realist whereas you are the essential woman the mother earth of my native islands god keep you and shetland in peace during the holocaust to come i pray for you as i hope you will sometimes pray for me your loving alistair i read it through twice trying to visualize his circumstances at the time of writing crouching in a trench on the crumbling perimeter of madrid and the writing so overcharged with emotion the highland half of him crying out for pity for prayer too i looked across at the woman so still beside the fire my mother said he used to write poetry she took the letter from me staring down at the two faded pages during that summer yes i suppose it was poetry it didnt rhyme and i didnt understand it you see so he never showed me any more her eyes were beginning to weep and she turned away stuffing the letter back into her work bag one of his brigade brought it more than a year later that was just after our troops had been evacuated from norway he was an raf sergeant then stationed up at graven brought us some sugar too didnt he albert her husband blinked and nodded his name was pettit a kind man we were very short of sugar you see and with a growing boy her voice trailed away those were difficult times here in shetland you know and she began knitting again its for my son she said he was here today and her husband said the first time in more than a year that undercurrent again and as soon as i had finished my whisky i left them hurrying back to my lodgings while the words of that letter were still fresh in my mind in the bare little room i wrote it down i think exactly and then i went to bed and for a long time lay awake in the dark thinking of his disillusionment and how it matched my own to die on a battlefield for something you no longer believed in and his last letter not to my mother but to this woman in shetland the mother earth of my native islands the call of his homeland perhaps is that what we cling to at the point of death the only picture i had ever seen of him was in my mothers sittingroom in the big house on rhode island it had been tucked away in a drawer full of odds and ends a photograph taken outside the registry office in edinburgh where they had been married i remember my mother coming in and finding me standing there with it in my hand the cold contained fury with which she had whipped it away from me and torn it up so long ago now that i could barely remember what he looked like only the eyes which had seemed to stare at me out of the print and the fact that he was shorter than she was and his suit crumpled the wind blew all night it was still blowing in the morning but the clouds broken now and fitful gleams of sunshine i started out for brough shortly after nine walking south along the back of west burra the grass all green and the sea sparkling i found miss manson feeding chickens in the backyard of her cottage a tall gaunt woman with steelrimmed spectacles and a waspish tongue the schoolteacher had warned me she was as full of gossip as a cat with kittens so i didnt tell her who i was only that i was a relative it didnt satisfy her of course but she couldnt stop talking chiefly about anna sandford and the dance she had led her husband running all over the island after alistair randall so soon after they were married and that son of hers serves her right he was always a hard boy and now hes up in unst and hardly bothers with them at all well theres little of albert there you know the poor devil i dont think she had known my father at all only the gossip she was a good deal younger but she could remember the farm being sold and she showed me the dower chest her mother had bought at the auction a plain oak piece carefully polished some people called eunson lived there now and she told me how to find it she also told me that the plaque i had heard about was not in hamnavoe church but in grund sound grund sound was another mile down the road there was a little war memorial where the road to houss branched off to the left across a stone bridge and the view down the south voe was a bright vista of water flat as a mirror in the sun the church was just beyond the bridge a small stone building close by the school freshdug earth black as peat was piled in one corner of the graveyard and the church door stood open it was dark inside and stark in its plainness the plaque was at the west end and the inscription etched black on the plain brass read alistair mouat randall journalist and soldier who died in the spanish civil war no when the fight begins within himself a mans worth something browning i stared at it a long time wondering who had put it there the date of death not given nor the side he had fought on and those lines from browning was it my mother had she made that strange choice of an epitaph i turned to the nearest pew and sat down wishing i knew the rest of that poem footsteps on the gravel outside and a single bell in the roof struck an uncertain note it struck again and then again a slow toll rhythmic as the strokes of an oar the door swung open the sunshine flooding in and then four men bearing a coffin on their shoulders there was no music only the tread of their feet to act as a dirge they laid the coffin down before the altar the daffodils on it a blaze of spring in a shaft of sunlight the men took a pew to the left and then a presbyterian minister came in followed by a young woman in a tweed skirt and a monkey jacket a brown scarf tied over her head her face was set and very brown behind her was a shambling giant of a man blond and bearded and several others all illatease in their sunday best they were fishermen by the look of it the girl didnt notice me her gaze on the coffin but the big man did his eyes steel blue and his huge hands clenched i waited until they had settled and then slipped away out into the sunshine back to the little war memorial where i sat on the grass looking down the long vista of the voe to houss ness i was still there when they came out of the church i saw the coffin laid to rest in its grave and then they all left in a land rover heading south down east burra towards houss the girl driving the minister locked up and followed them in his car leaving only the gravedigger shovelling at the peatblack earth the sad little scene and the two lines of that poem death the solution to everything who had known him so well that he had revealed to them an inner conflict that matched my own who had cared enough to blazon it to the world and understood enough to claim that and not his death for a cause as the real worth not anna sandford surely not my mother but somebody i stared blindly at the stone cross bare against the blue sky and wished i had known him and then a car came from the direction of hamnavoe and stopped in front of me its bright red body blocking the view youre randall arent you the driver was a man of about my own age perhaps a little more his dark hair greying at the temples and blown by the wind he wore a fishermans jersey and his face was round and plump the eyes slightly bloodshot i was told id find you along the road to grund sound can i give you a lift and he pushed the door open for me im ian sandford i hesitated wondering what he wanted id as soon walk i said aye its a fine day and weve not had many of those this last fortnight he was leaning towards me across the passenger seat his face framed in long sideburns mother said you were a trawlerman that right i didnt say anything trying to recall what else i had told her the islands were an enclosed world and gossip travelled fast would you know the worth of a trawler lying beached with a hole in her bottom there was a speculative glint in his eyes depends how badly shes holed and what its going to cost to get her off he nodded jump in then and ill drive you over take about an hour thats all i hesitated thinking it was probably just an excuse to find out more about me but the wind was blowing from the northwest now it was cold and anyway it would be interesting to have a look at that trawler there couldnt be more than one beached on shetland i got in beside him but instead of turning the car he said suddenly what made you come to grund sound theres a plaque in the church here i wanted to see it he stared at me suspiciously then he laughed oh that he nodded towards the graveyard and the man shovelling earth there was a funeral here today i thought perhaps you saw it did you and he added it was the trawlers skipper they buried old man petersen owed money in lerwick a finance company mortgage he backed and turned the car the wrecks up for sale now just outside hamnavoe we turned right across the bridge to trondra you ever been to unst he asked ive got a bit of a hotel at the end of burra firth where the north road stops trolls vikings and stone circles thats what they come for and its only two miles to the top of herma ness they can see muckle flugga from there and go home with pictures of the northernmost point of the british isles he had a quick energetic way of talking as though needing to convince himself all the time that he was possessed of a dynamic personality birdwatchers in summer gales in winter he laughed its a bloody hell of a place then why are you up there i asked oil im waiting for the oil to come ashore thats why he leaned towards me his manner becoming confidential ive got a company now and ive just landed a contract to supply two of the rigs food mainly but to ship the stuff out i need a boat you see we crossed the scallowaylerwick road heading north alongside loch of tingwall towards the eastern shore it was shortly after midday when we drove through skellister south nesting bay blue under a blue sky and the voes sheltered in the lee of the land calm as silk the duchess of norfolk lay in the east voe so close against a narrow spit of land she might have been moored there she was low in the water aft but still neat and trim not too much rust and her brasswork gleaming in the sun looks in good condition sandford said i nodded thinking of the men following that coffin so much care and their ship stranded here and up for sale shes holed below the waterline is she i couldnt see any damage part of her bulwarks stove in that was all its on the other side he said and we left the car walking through little mounded hills of sheepcropped grass until we stood on the spit only a few yards from her i could see it then a ragged tear in the plating by the stern it was about five feet long and only just showing above the surface of the water well what do you think i barely heard him i was daydreaming thinking how it would be possible to repair that rent and get her off down by the stern like that her engineroom would be flooded but if that was the only damage a single pump would soon float her once the hole was patched you dont know how far the damage extends below the water do you about two feet three feet at the after end somebody took you out there was no sign of a boat he laughed nobody here last night it was almost dark i just stripped off my clothes and swam out there were ropes trailing from her deck aft but he had not climbed on board well what do you reckon shell fetch at auction he was watching me closely she was soundly built and those paxmans have you got enough money i was wishing to god i had no he said of course i havent but i can borrow it cant i same as i did when i converted those old wartime buildings up at burra firth i stood there looking at the chunky vessel with her high straight stem the rounded stern she had been drifting before the gale all the time until she struck it was the bulwarks forard that were damaged nothing much else a window broken and one of the trawl doors missing that was all i could see and if a man whod never been to sea in his life could borrow the money how much would she be worth down south his voice was eager greed in his eyes as he stared at me slipped and repaired with the engines in proper order she was built in i was remembering prices paid for old trawlers in hull but most of them distant water boats and much bigger than this one somewhere around fifty thousand i said sixty at the most and lying here just as she is beached in the voe and her engines full of seawater he wanted a low figure of course hoping for a bargain it depends if anybody else is as keen as you you might get her for as low as fifteen but youd be lucky fifteen thats about what i thought less maybe he was staring at the black hull and i knew he was working out the probable cost of repairs he didnt see her as a ship only as a means of making money when will they fix the date for the auction i asked its fixed already next monday and this was friday the haste seemed almost indecent but as he pointed out it only needed a strong noreaster and the finance company wanted their money they dont care what she fetches so long as it covers the mortgage thats the beauty of it we walked back to the car then both of us too preoccupied with our thoughts to say much as we drove back through skellister and along the road to the south we were in country that was as much water as land loch and sea all quiet in the lee the hills smiling in the sun and my mind on that trawler resting on her bed of boulders if he hadnt been so coldblooded about it regarding her not as a ship but simply as a means of making money i dont think i would have done what i did or if he had asked me to skipper her but he was so bloody anxious to get to his bank before it closed that he hardly said a word as he drove straight to lerwick and parked the car on the esplanade not far from the steamer quay meet me here in an hours time and ill drive you back but by then i had made up my mind dont bother i said i have to see somebody here anyway just as you wish he hesitated then slammed the car door well thanks for your help and he hurried away across the road and up a steep little alley it was a crazy idea i had rather less than ј in my pocket but to hell with that to hell with the police hull was a long way away and i was thinking of the future now and providence in the shape of that trawler beckoning irresistibly a bank might not give me a loan but there were companies operating up here now that had the cash if i could provide them with what they wanted i walked along the esplanade to the queens hotel got myself a beer and a sandwich and phoned wishart in sumburgh i was lucky he was in and he knew where the oil man who had rented a car from him was staying at the lerwick hotel his names fuller and hes got it till monday monday evening i asked no morning hes booked out on the early flight to dyce and he hasnt changed his booking but he didnt know about that if he has he cant have the car i thanked him and rang off either fuller didnt know about the auction or else he wasnt interested an oil company looking for a trawler would hardly concern itself with a wreck and wanting one on the cheap was a relative term i had another beer enquired the way to the hotel and set off up the hill behind the port the lerwick hotel was out by the hospital a low building standing well back with bressay and the open sea behind it fuller wasnt there he had left immediately after breakfast taking a packed lunch with him i wrote him a note telling him i would call back at six that evening and went down to the port again in the raised pedestrian way above the esplanade i found a newsagents and bought an ordnance survey map and a copy of the shetland times the local paper was datelined th march it had come out that morning and the wreck of the duchess of norfolk was its lead story i read about the wreck sitting on a bollard with the gulls screaming above the fish quay the engines had apparently been shut down due to overheating the pipe supplying seawater to the cooling system having sprung a leak they had been used briefly in an attempt to get her past fiska skerry but had generated insufficient power and a big sea had slammed her sideways against the rock the ranger had towed her off and got her as far as the east voe of skellister but had had to abandon the tow just short of vadill of garth the engines had been used again to beach her in the lee of the spit unfortunately both the chief engineer and his assistant were in hospital they were the two men who had been injured so there was no indication as to whether the overheating had seriously damaged the engines at least they had not seized up solid the most surprising information in the report was that the insurance on the vessel had been allowed to lapse it was owned apparently by gertrude petersen and skippered by her fatherinlaw olav petersen eightyone who had died of a heart attack during the gale while they were steaming south between whalsay and the out skerries it was the lack of insurance that had decided the mortgagees to foreclose we naturally presumed the insurance had been maintained the manager was reported as saying when we learned that the premium had not been paid we had no alternative the amount of the mortgage was not given onthe back page under auctioneers announcements was a notice of the sale at the queens hotel on monday st march at noon the trawler duchess of norfolk of tons presently lying aground in the east voe of skellister by order of the owner mrs g petersen of taing house east burra and of the mortgagees north scottish land and securities it took me the rest of the afternoon to track down the equipment i thought i might need and to establish some sort of relationship with the yards the smallest proved the most helpful it was out beyond the breezeblock plant on a dirt road that led to the old gun emplacements on green head the owner a cheerful baldheaded man named jim halcrow had been an engineer in the navy it was little more than a workshop with no slip and only four men employed he serviced engines and deck gear and as luck would have it one of the boats he was working on at the moment was an oil rig supply vessel in for emergency replacement of a fractured prop shaft well be going for trials about a week from now and whos to care if i take her up to south nesting on test if i did an if we hapt on yon trawler lying afloat itd be natural for us to take her in tow now wouldnt it he gave me a broad wink provided of course were doing the engine repairs for you how much i asked say fifty for the tow cash and nobody breathing a word and the rate for the job on her engines it was a little after six before i got back to the hotel fuller was waiting for me in the entrance lounge a solid man with grey hair and a grey face he smiled when i asked him if he had found the trawler he was looking for well be needing two and with summer coming theres not many owners interested in chartering ive got the offer of one but its old and available only at the end of july thats too late he offered me a drink and when he had given the order he enquired whether i was a trawler owner not at the moment i said your note said you had a proposition he had a faintly harassed air for answer i handed him my copy of the shetland times but he had already seen it and he knew about the auction briefly he explained his requirements a vessel in commission and complete with crew to act as watchdog to a drilling rig his company would start operating in shetland waters about a month from now it would probably be drilling through into the late summer early autumn the standby boat was required to keep station whatever the weather which was why he had wanted trawlers rather than small coasters and we dont want to own them we just want to charter i wasnt suggesting you bought it the drinks came and i asked him what the charter rate would be his figure was too low and i told him so you loan me twenty thousand for six months at a nominal per cent and ill accept the charter at your rate and i went on to give my qualifications and the general outline of how i thought i could get the stranded trawler serviceable enough to pass survey inside of a month his questions were mainly financial i think he had been trained in accountancy he had that sort of a mind and he knew very little about ships but he was desperate to get something settled that was obvious when he invited me to stay on for dinner the reason emerged during the meal he worked at the head office of a shipping line that had just been taken over by a city finance company run by a man who as he put it had a flair for getting into the right thing at the right moment this man was arriving at sumburgh next day flying his own plane and as soon as he mentioned the name i understood his need to have something to show for the two days he had been up here vic villiers had been acquiring a reputation for the ruthless exploitation of underdeveloped assets when i was still at the lse this was his first venture into oil one of our subsidiaries has a rig operating in the north sea the present contract has less than a month to run after that mr villiers plans a crash exploration programme of the two licences we acquired in both of them licences to drill on the continental shelf west of shetland i didnt care what their plans were all i wanted was the money to bid for the duchess but when i suggested he take villiers down to see the trawler tomorrow he smiled at me sourly i dont think hed appreciate that hell have the chairman of one of the big merchant banks with him and will be travelling on to unst for a weekends birdwatching hes a very keen ornithologist then come down and see it for yourself i said now tonight then at least youll be able to tell him what the proposition is he was a creature of settled habits and not at all keen on a night visit to a lonely inlet but he was even less enthusiastic about my coming with him to sumburgh in the morning and putting my proposition to villiers direct he borrowed a torch from the management and half an hour later we were walking the grass verge of the voe the hills to our left were black against the night sky the trawler a dark shadow in the pale sheen of the water i took him out to the spit playing the beam of the torch over the hull and superstructure explaining again and in detail how i thought i could salvage her he didnt say much but i hardly noticed i was so keyed up a mood of excitement of elation almost that i hadnt felt in years and suddenly i was stripping off my clothes if sandford could swim out to her then so could i and the desire to stand on her bridge for a moment was urgent and overwhelming also i wanted to check the size of the hole in her hull and make certain there was nothing else seriously wrong with her wait here i said i wont be long i think he tried to dissuade me but by then i was wading naked into the water it was cold but not as cold as it had been on the edge of the pack up by bear island it didnt take more than a few strokes to bring me alongside the hull the torch was rubber covered virtually watertight so that i was able to dive down and examine the rent it was much as sandford had described it but the plates were buckled over a wider area i dived to the bottom saw that she was grounded at the stern and then swam all round her checking the hull but that was the only damage i came back to the rent cold now and feeling tired i wasnt at all sure i could pull myself up by the rope dangling over the side and with the hole gaping in front of me i took a chance and swam through wary of the jagged edges of the plating i surfaced in the engineroom the taste of oil on my lips the water black and scummy full of floating debris the two banks of diesels were awash the coupling to the single screw completely submerged i floated cautiously to the ladder leading up past the header tank into the crews quarters and clambered out the air was warm and stale smelling faintly of diesel oil i stayed there for a moment wondering how the hell those diesels had functioned at all with the engineroom half under water but then of course she was on the bottom now and the tide making afloat most of that rent would have been above the waterline i was beginning to shiver rubbing my hands over my body i could feel the goosepimples below the film of oil i started up the ladder then unwilling to dive down again into the black murk of dirty water out of which the engines protruded like rocks awash the ladder led up to an alleyway and i went aft past the galley and the messroom to a door that opened on to the deck with toilet and showers right in the stern i moved forard making a quick tour of the ship careful of my feet and trying to memorize every item of damage it was dark now a cold breeze fluttering the flag of a dan buoy all the nets neatly stowed along the inside of the bulwarks up on the road a cars headlights blazed and then vanished you all right fuller called i shouted back to him that i wouldnt be long and made my way to the bridge it was an oldfashioned layout a telegraph on the starboard side and the wheel at the back but new equipment had been added most of it ranged haphazardly under the halfcircle of insloping windows decca radar navigator and recorder echosounder log and speed indicator the skippers seat was fixed to a piece of metal piping socketed into the floor and on the wall behind was the vhp set and the warden receiver it was old equipment probably secondhand leading off the starboard gangway to the right of the companionway down to the quarters was an enclosed space with a shelf for chartwork and on it was the main r t set a big crestavega doublesideband the door to the masters cabin was not locked inside i found the bedding neatly piled on the bunk all vestige of its dead occupant removed somebody the girl probably or that shambling giant of a man who might well be the mate had been on board and collected the old mans things all except an aged reefer jacket hanging on the back of the door salt marks white on the dark cloth and traces of mildew i put it on and went back into the bridge standing for a moment with my hands on the wheel trying to visualize how she would be in a seaway with the diesels at half ahead and her crew shooting the trawl myself the owner and skipper it was a dream no more and i was too cold to think very clearly but the longing was there deep inside me it was only a moment i stood at the wheel but i can still remember the odd feeling of companionship i experienced as though there was a presence beside me in the darkness of the bridge not hostile just watchful i let go of the wheel and it was gone as though it were the helm itself that had communicated with me how long i wondered had the yearold olav petersen been master on this bridge i went back to the radio shelf outside the skippers cabin remembering i had seen charts there i thought perhaps the log might be there too hoping that if it went back far enough it might give some indication of why petersens daughterinlaw had become the owner had her husband also died on board but there was no log book only the charts these were the two shetland isles charts nos isa and b and i opened them out laying them flat along the shelf and following the pencil marks of their last cruise they had been trawling off ramna stacks on the rd off gloup holm and the clapper on the th and had started south down bluemull sound at on the th it was all there every fix every change of course the pencilled figures thin and shaky but on the th the writing had changed it was larger firmer and there were erasures as though whoever had taken over was unaccustomed to making chart entries i was shivering by then my teeth chattering uncontrollably i put the charts back in the drawer and with a last glance round the bridge i went out along the starboard gangway into the chill of the night breeze i had forgotten about the reefer and i took it off and s hung it in the shower compartment at the stern the freeboard was so small with the tide near the high that i did not bother about a rope but dived straight over the side and headed for the spit the coldness of the water took my breath away and i was gasping for air as my feet touched bottom i heard fuller speaking but i didnt catch the words then the beam of a torch stabbed the night and a voice demanded who are you what are you doing here it was a womans voice loud and very clear vibrant with anger i stopped blinded by the glare and shivering ive no clothes on i said feeling foolish she laughed a furious snorting sound do you think i havent seen a man naked before now come on get out and explain what youve been up to and she kept the torch full on me all the time i was stumbling ashore over the boulders i heard fuller trying to explain but by then i was past caring i just reached for my clothes and dragged them on without bothering to dry myself i thought she was some farmers wife out after sheep or ponies and then i heard her say sharks youre like sharks coming out here in the dark her voice was wild and high sniffing round the ship as though it is a bloody carcass i grabbed the torch and turned it on her the violence of her emotions warning me her face was no longer that of the young woman i had seen following the coffin that morning gone was the serenity the tightlipped control im sorry i said what else i knew how she must feel i could see it in her eyes the blaze of anger brightened by tears and she was right sandford fuller myself others probably all of us for our different reasons wanting to know whether the trawler could be floated again you shouldnt have come shouldnt have come my ship an you tell me feeling the way you do about her i lowered the beam of the torch not wishing to intrude into the private world of her emotions well go now i heard a sob in the darkness that was all she didnt say anything if i had known i murmured then left it at that no good making excuses when to her we were sharks with our teeth into the prey but whether the ship was just an outlet for her grief or something more i dont know men grieve over the loss of their ships but for a woman i was thinking about her most of the time fuller was driving me back to hamnavoe id never met a woman owner before i was still thinking about her next morning as i took the road to brough again walking through a light drizzle fuller had said he would put my proposition to villiers and i was remembering the blaze of anger in her eyes wondering whether she would attend the auction i was quite sure she had been on board when her fatherinlaw had died and this i was able to confirm when i stopped at miss mansons cottage she has always gone out with them even when jan was alive he was her husband and she had to him being so sickly you see she couldnt tell me very much the petersens had only been on east burra four or five years jan petersen had died about two years ago of pneumonia she thought he had been in hospital at lerwick and after his death the trawler had been anchored between voyages in the shelter of the taing instead of at hamnavoe so its not often we see gertrude now and she added shes norwegian you know the old man too and most of the crew theyre all norwegians i walked on then to grund sound and the little church but it was the grave with its bunches of daffodils i saw i wasnt thinking about my father i paused for a moment on the bridge gazing across at the mound of fresh earth i think i had half hoped to find her there i could have explained to her then but perhaps not i went slowly on and ate my lunch in a field with three shetland ponies watching me and a view of the calm circle of water sheltered by a tongue of land that was marked on my map as the taing her house which was an old farmhouse little bigger than a cottage stood at the base of the tongue it was built of stone with a slate roof superbly set against the steep backdrop of the hills beyond clift sound i could just imagine how it would have been for her coming back after a weeks trawling and waking up in the morning to look out of the window at her own ship lying snug to its reflection but the inlet was empty now and the house looked deserted no sign of life i walked on through houss across ayre dyke and over the ward of symbister to a view of the stacks of houssness and south havra beyond and all the time i was thinking about the ship how much she would fetch at auction what it would feel like to be an owner and in business for myself the urge to achieve something constructive that creative instinct i had ignored for so long it had all suddenly become focused on that trawler i was so full of plans that it never occurred to me villiers would turn down my proposition god how simple everything is when you are walking alone with the sea all round you and dreaming dreams but when i got back to my lodgings late in the afternoon i found a long envelope waiting for me inside were documents for signature with a note from fuller explaining them instead of a loan villiers had instructed him to acquire the mortgage this he had done and he was now offering to assign it to me as advance payment for a threemonth charter on the terms i had already turned down but after that he would be prepared to renew it monthly at progressively higher rates the documents enclosed with his letter were the charter agreement and the deed of assignment for the mortgage and there were three copies of each all copies require the signature of both yourself and the legal owner of the vessel one copy to be retained by her one by yourself and the third to be returned to me at the lerwick hotel by tomorrow evening at the latest and the letter went on we think it best that you negotiate direct with mrs petersen she may well be reluctant to accept you as the mortgagee or and this is equally essential to what mr villiers and i have in mind to agree to your captaining the vessel once it is in commission again in which case the auction will proceed and the vessel will become the property of the highest bidder the mortgage was for ј at per cent interest and sitting in my bare little room going over those documents in the fading light i found it difficult to concentrate on the legal phrases was it villiers or fuller who had devised the scheme not that it mattered but villiers i thought it was so simple so damnably clever a cheap charter that committed me to getting the trawler into commission by th april and then running her on a shoestring to keep out of debt and leaving me to fix it all with gertrude petersen i saw her the following morning and by then i had been over all the arguments to my surprise she was waiting for me when i came down the track to taing house it was blowing hard from the southwest her fair hair flying in the wind as she took me inside i was told to expect you she didnt offer me a chair and she didnt sit down herself but stood facing me her legs slightly apart as though the floor of the sittingroom was a deck that might heave under her feet at any moment i saw mr fuller yesterday in the evening he explained the arrangement to me her manner was cold and distant and her voice controlled you have the deeds with you yes i said surprised and relieved that i didnt have to explain it all to her what made you see fuller i heard he was looking for a trawler no emotion now and the grey eyes fixed on me hard and businesslike youre not the only one with ideas about refloating her johan is down there working on her now and i have talked with jim halcrow i see so she had reached some other arrangement with fuller but when i suggested this she shook her head you think i cut you out a flicker of a smile showed at the corners of her mouth hardly i do not have a masters ticket nor does johan and neither of us has worked in a shipyard jim halcrow says you have is that right mr randall and she added her eyes narrowed as though trying to make up her mind about me it is randall isnt it i understand when you arrived in sumburgh randall i said mike randall she gave a little shrug well mr randall the question is can you get her sufficiently watertight to float her off i think so i said she looked at me a moment and then she nodded good then let us start with the deed of agreement i am told it is the simpler of the two she made room on the table by the window and i spread the three copies out for her i should warn you i said there is a clause in it making its validity dependent on your signing the charter agreement of course she was bending over the documents and she didnt look up her hair falling over her face her hands palms down on the table supporting her weight were short and capable the skin burned brown with salt the nails cut short and the gold circle of her wedding ring glinting in the light directly in front of her was a photograph in a plain oak frame the print blotched with damp mould faded by exposure to light showed a man with a thin face under a peaked cap bent over the gun of a whale catcher beside him an older man head thrown back and roaring with laughter my husband jan she said with his father it was just after the war the first whale he harpooned after he became schutter they were very happy then i think she signed her name quickly on all three copies now the other documents please and she held out her hand but this time she did not sign her name as soon as she had read it through instead she looked up at me do you agree with the terms these people are offering i havent much choice no she stared at me the eyes gone cold again and the hostility back in her voice well i do have a choice mr randall and they need a standby boat very badly all rigs operating in the north sea have to have one by law i check on that before i see mr fuller she nodded emphatically as though expressing satisfaction at her good sense so he has agreed to some alterations i am to write them on all the copies each alteration to be initialled by both of us what she had got out of him was a small increase in the charter rate and an interestfree loan sufficient to cover salvage repairs insurance and with luck most of the victualling i do not intend you see to get into the hands of the moneylenders again i wonder you ever did i murmured you think i get into their hands there was sudden bitterness in her voice you think i forget the insurance premium oh no but business that is a mans job so my fatherinlaw always say my husband too they must deal with the chandlers the buyers everything to do with money and they never haggle she gave an exasperated laugh too proud to behave like fishwives i guess but now she stared at me very determinedly you captain the ship but that is all you understand i look after the business i hesitated thinking of all that had to be done to get the trawler on station by th april it would be hard slogging work and the one thing i would have fought fuller over she hadnt even raised you realize you have committed the ship to standing by the rig for three months in all weathers without any relief boat that is why i was able to get an improved charter rate no crew will stand for it three months out there johan says they agree i have offered a bonus of course and the engineers per is already discharged some burns that is all duncan has two cracked ribs i saw him at the hospital last night and he undertakes to keep those engines running for three months she nodded a little defiantly i thought yes he does i forebore to mention that it was a failure of the engines that had lost her ship but she must have guessed what was in my mind for she said quickly duncan was away sick for almost a month per kalvik the assistant engineer is not so good he is a young man and on his own he do not maintain the engines properly and she added duncan has never been away from the ship before not since we installed the new engines she had it all worked out the crew the engineers everything quite prepared to ignore the fact that under the terms of the agreement we had to provide a replacement if for any reason i was forced to run for shelter but when i pointed this out to her she flared up at me it is you who are raising difficulties nobody else fuel and stores anything you want is to be delivered free of any transport charge by the supply ship and i have arranged for the transportation of men on leave by helicopter from the rig also free since you will not be fishing you will need less crew minimum crew for standby boats is six captain mate chief engineer assistant engineer cook and one deckhand you duncan and johan will not get relief she had been talking very fast now she stopped abruptly standing staring at me her manner suddenly awkward it is a very difficult situation between us we do not know anything about each other and this agreement she made a motion of her hand towards the document as soon as i sign then you are the mortgagee and i am in your hands even the loan i arrange it is made to you not to me he insists on that it was certainly an odd arrangement and the division of any profits was left to us i imagine you will require some sort of an agreement drawn up between us i said she didnt seem to hear me her head turned to the window gazing out at the water these businessmen are very clever there was a long pause and then suddenly she was facing me again two complete strangers and they have hung us round each others neck she smiled a gleam of humour that was gone in a flash well there it is neither of us can argue we have no money she pulled up a chair and sat down i agree we shall need to have an agreement but not now later and she began writing in the alterations she wrote fast as though by concentrating on the words she could relieve the tension and frustration that was in her initialling each alteration as she made it and signing the copies at the bottom then she pushed the whole lot over to me when i had signed she said johan is living on board i suggest you do the same now and the crew they are at the seamans mission available whenever you want them she collected the papers together and put them in the envelope now if you are ready we will pick up your things and i will drive you down to the boat chapter three it took me four days to complete the welding of a steel patch the biggest problem was rigging a secure platform on which to work in the cramped space between the starboard engine and the hull after that it was a question of following each tide down as the water poured out of the engineroom through the rent in the hull the job was slow and dirty and though we had spring tides the last six inches or so of steel sheet had to be left unwelded it was on the tuesday morning just as johan and two of the crew were holding the first sheet in position and i was spotwelding it to the hull plates that sandford arrived no doubt he called my name several times before he tapped me on the shoulder the arc of the welding torchmade a hell of a row in the confined space of the engineroom i swung round the arc sputtering in my hand so that i nearly knocked him off the single plank we had rigged as a walkway from the ladder what do you want that mortgage im told you own it he had to yell to make himself heard ill buy it off you i turned back towards the hull plating with the tide falling and the sheet not yet fixed this was no time for interruptions his hand gripped my shoulder how much do you want i pushed my visor up talk to mrs petersen i said shes the business brains his eyes bright in the spotlight reminded me of the way his mother had looked when she thought there might be money in my visit i have i saw her last night then you know the answer she isnt the mortgagee i glanced at my watch just over an hour of tide to go i turned my back on him pulling the visor down and flicking the jet full on he shouted something at me as i bent to my welding again the bearded face of johan watching with his big hands on the plate dangerously close as the gobs of molten steel flew out i forgot about him then my mind concentrated on the job before the tide was up again i had the whole plate welded except for the last six inches which had still been underwater at the bottom of the tide it was late afternoon then and we went up to the bridge the four of us sweating and tired and dirty you want tea johan asked as we reached the top of the ladder and felt the cold air of the deck no beer i think ja beer his blond beard all grimed with oil and slightly singed cracked open in a grin beer for me also lars henrik the two seamen nodded and he sent lars to raid the pantry we had left our jerseys in the bridge and we entered to find sandford seated in the skippers chair a pile of cigarette butts in the ashtray behind the wheel housing ive been watching the tide on the rocks thought you wouldnt be able to work down there much longer i pulled on my jersey chilled now with the sweat drying on me you been waiting here all the time he nodded cant discuss business with a man waving a welding torch in my face theres no business to discuss i said no he swivelled the chair as though enjoying the feel of being in the masters seat ive been thinking it was clever of you i never thought of buying the mortgage nor did any of us there were five of us turned up at the auction yesterday morning all of us with money to bid for her and nobody was exactly pleased when they told us it was off he lit a cigarette from the butt of the one he had just finished and stubbed the old one out in the ashtray can we go somewhere where we can talk im living on board i told him if you want to talk it will have to be here lars appeared with four cans of beer sandford got to his feet come into the masters cabin then we can talk there theres nothing to talk about i said but he insisted and in the end i followed him well what is it i said as we faced each other alone with the door closed it took me most of yesterday to find out just how youd fixed it i didnt fix it no it was that oil man fuller but youre the mortgagee and im willing to buy you out its all tied up with the charter agreement i know that but it suits my plans ill give you a thousand cash so long as you get her floated within two minutes he had raised his offer to fifteen hundred and i wondered why cash meant he knew all about fiddling tax it wasnt only that i was suspicious it went against the grain and when i asked him who would skipper her he said he had his own man and a crew as well youd still have to complete the charter i said he nodded of course it didnt make sense whats behind your offer he laughed i told you i need a ship and this is the only one available and he added fifteen hundred isnt a bad offer just for getting her afloat and towed into bressay sound youre wasting your time i said money doesnt mean very much to me and it was true if i had stayed in the states i could have had all the money i wanted but not on my terms and what the hell is life about if you dont live it on your own terms but to explain that to sandford who had inherited a solid streak of peasant greed from his mother would be like explaining marxism to a hull trawler owner i pulled the door open i need another beer i said he stood for a moment uncertainly but he knew it was no good i thought you were clever his voice reflected his disappointment youre just a bloody fool he said angrily and then as he was going out he turned and asked me why after all these years i had come to shetland making enquiries about my father you never knew him you never cared what happened to him why now thats my business i said and i pushed him out into the gangway ordering henrik to take him ashore in the work boat we now had alongside gertrude petersen arrived shortly afterwards with a meal she had prepared at home and when i told her what had happened she said i dont like that man i dont like the people he employs last december when we are stormbound in burra firth for two days we are in the hotel and there is this irish behind the bar he make trouble for johan she didnt say what trouble but there was a slight flush on her face as she added it is the last time we drink in his hotel i forgot about sandford after that we lived by the tide our heads aching after every shift falling into our bunks as soon as we had fed and sleeping until the alarm woke us and when in the early hours of the friday morning it was done and we began pumping i just stood there on the deck staring at the dark shadow of the hills feeling utterly exhausted i was like a surgeon who has performed a difficult operation all i wanted now was for the patient to live and so identified had i become with the ship that i felt it was part of me we breakfasted late to the racket of the pump and afterwards gertrude drove me to halcrows yard they were behind schedule and with the drilling contractors screaming for their supply ship the trials were set for sunday afternoon that gave us two clear days we got the anchor out on the port beam with the chain linked by a big block and tackle to the trawl winch hawser then at low water on the saturday morning with the land rover hitched to the tail end of the purchase guy and all of us pulling some of the locals as well we managed to roll her about twelve degrees this list to port was just sufficient to bring the whole patch clear of the water at the bottom of the tide but it still took two tides to cut the plate edges of the hull beat out the dents and weld the last six inches of the patch even when that was done the pump could only just hold its own well have to slip and patch her properly from the outside i told gertrude as we stood that evening in the engineroom the sound of the pump drumming at the deck overhead and the water gurgling in the bilges she didnt argue on the port side the floor gratings ran down into water even when we had released the purchase tackle and the trawler was floating upright on the top of the tide water sloshed and gurgled over the gratings as the ship moved in the wind dancing to a slight swell coming in round the end of the spit she knew the hull had to be absolutely watertight if we were to keep the sea in all weathers for three weary months all this time the wind had been westerly and the water in the voe quiet under the lee of mainland now the forecast was for changeable weather the last of the depressions moving away towards iceland and a high coming in behind it with a low over france that slight swell was a warning of northeasterly winds duncan appeared at my side and stood sniffing the air as though he too sensed the change he was a dour man with a long nose and a sandy moustache the hospital had discharged him the previous afternoon and he had been down in the engineroom ever since cleaning the place up with the help of his assistant per and the youngest member of the crew a big bull of a boy known as sperm pump holding i asked him aye and the engines theyll no get her oot o here if thats what you mean so we just had to hope jim halcrow would risk bringing the supply ship right in on the tide mrs petersen told you the parts you ordered have arrived by air he nodded and i asked him how his ribs were strapped so tight i cant hardly breathe but its the electrics im worried aboot that pipe to the cooling system is nothing by comparison it could be the dynamos will have to be stripped down or even replaced and god knows whats happened to the wiring he sniffed again at the breeze coming in down the voe ach weel ill get back doon again noo that bluidy boy dinna ken the difference between an oil line and a fuel pipe youd better get some sleep i told him a week in that bluidy morgue what the hell ye think i been doing and he disappeared into the night heading for the door to the engineroom his left arm held awkwardly to his body it was still only a breeze when dawn broke but by it had strengthened to force and there were waves breaking on the seaward side of the spit we grounded shortly afterwards the keel bumping on boulders the grating and clanging lasted almost half an hour all we could do after that was wait and hope that the wind wouldnt increase before high water which was at but by then i had something else to worry about gertrude arrived just as we were completing the lifting of the anchor and she came aboard as soon as the work boat had dropped the anchor and chain under the bows jim halcrow says he will bring the supply ship in whatever the weather he has the power and the manoeuvrability also he draws much less than we do but he needs to know the exact time you expect to be afloat tell him well be bumping the bottom at about and clear to tow off any time after she nodded okay i tell him that there was a pause and then she said there was a man at the yard this morning he was making enquiries we were standing in the starboard bridge gangway watching the crew heaving in on the anchor chain the trawler lying still now and the hills behind a diorama of shirting light as the clouds scudded over an island scene and all so peaceful that the industrial world i had lived in seemed unreal what sort of a man a police inspector but in plain clothes not bob scunton then or the other man that was something unless this inspector insisted on my going back to hull what did he want just enquiring about you what you were doing did he ask you any questions no he did not need to he had already talked to me the previous day where at taing you didnt tell me no why she looked at me then why do you think i dont want to distract you and she added he will see you when the ship is afloat and lying off the yard god what a practical soulless woman she was not caring a damn about anything but her trawler what is it about she asked you have done something i looked at her feeling suddenly cold and hard inside was this what a whaling station did to you she had been brought up in the stench of the flensing deck and her father had rubbed his hands with glee and said it smelled of money she had told me that herself laughing and i had seen her in my mind as a young girl with the guts and urine of dead whales spilling out at her feet and her father beaming and rubbing his hands a little girl was nearly killed i said and you were involved no then why is this inspector here from london better ask him i said and went down the ladder to give a hand forard gertrude petersen left shortly after that the warps were all ready aft the anchor stowed and the chain flaked neatly on the foredeck heaving lines and fenders handy nothing to do after lunch but watch the tide making and the sea slowly building as the wind increased and think about what happened next why they should have sent an inspector from london in the privacy of my cabin i poured myself a stiff whisky i should have been worrying about the tow instead i was thinking how hard she was my mind going back to the problem that had been with me ever since that night in hull a local matter surely not something for scotland yard unless but i shied away from the thought it was just a matter of intimidation intimidation that had got out of control i must concentrate on that did i identify the men or not that was all that mattered johan poked his head round the door we can see the tug now it is steaming out in the bay fixed courses so he is making speed trials i followed him into the bridge relieved to get away from my thoughts the sky had cleared the whitecaps in the bay bright in the sun the supply ship was just turning at the extremity of her northward run up by stany hog the high superstructure forard and the flat run aft certainly gave her the look of a tug she completed the turn and started south the time was less than an hour to go i went all round the ship with johan checking that everything was ready and that each man knew what he had to do then i went back to the bridge and tested the loudhailer no sign of the ship she was lost to view behind the dunelike hills of ward of brough ten minutes later she poked her bluff fendered bows round cunning holm islet moving slowly now coming in on her echosounder a few minutes and she was in full view turning and pointing her bows straight at us and at almost the same moment i felt a slight lift to the deck under my feet heard the first faint rumble of the keel knocking on boulders she came in very slowly feeling her way until her bows were level with the spit she hung there for a while her engines throwing a froth of water forard along her sides as she maintained station against the wind funnelling down the voe i could see jim halcrow seated at the controls high up in the little glass wheelhouse gertrude petersen beside him he put a microphone to his lips and loud across the water came his query are you off the bottom yet i was out on the bridge gangway then and i called through the loudhailer for him to come and get us he gave me a thumbsup and drifted round the end of the spit turning on his own axis and bringing his stern right against ours i had never seen one of these vessels operating in a confined space it was like driving a dodgem we didnt need heaving lines johan just passed the end of our big warp straight into the hands of the man hanging out over the stern roller he hitched it on to the winch hawser and my men hardly had time to make fast before the supply ship was going ahead rope and hawser taking the strain there was an ugly grinding noise a jar on the soles of my feet as we came up against rock then we were off our bows swinging away downwind it was the neatest thing one moment we were aground hammering on boulders the next we were out in the channel clear of the spit and sternon to the voe the supply ship had hp and jim halcrow used the wind to get us positioned then he just plucked us out sternfirst into the bay the tail end of our warp was already made fast at the bows all we had to do was cast off astern as soon as our bows were round the tow began we had to go round bressay and enter lerwick from the south but even so we were anchored off the halcrow yard before dark a constable in uniform was standing on the boat jetty watching us by the time we had finished flaking down the tow warp the work boat was alongside jim halcrow coming on board followed by gertrude petersen her eyes shining it worked she said laughing your patch is all right so long as the pump keeps going my voice sounded sharp i was quite incapable of responding to her mood i hadnt expected a constable trials go off satisfactorily i asked halcrow fine manoeuvring and towing made a good test for the new shaft he glanced at the sky upwind of us then at his watch well lets have a look at your problems wheres your chief in the engineroom i nodded and led him below we could hear the water sloshing about in the bilges as we went down the ladder the sound of it was loud now the ship was floating to her marks duncan appeared out of the gloom yell have to have a resairve pump on board apparently we had made five inches during the tow i introduced him to halcrow and left them to it when i got back to the deck the yard boat had arrived and the constable was waiting for me he was a big towheaded young islander with a friendly face you the captain yes he had his notebook open in his hand michael mouat randall would that be the name and when i nodded he said i must ask you to accompany me to the station any reason no sir only that inspector garrard would like a word with you so their witness hadnt perjured himself yet and there was no warrant ive a lot to do i said if the inspector wants to talk to me hes welcome to come on board the young man hesitated ill tell him that if you like sir but hes not one of us yknow so id advise you to come along and see what its all about i didnt like it sending a constable to fetch me to the station instead of coming down to the ship himself oh for gods sake gertrude petersen exclaimed go on down to the station with him and get it over weve got a lot to do well you get on with it then i told her i wasnt in the best of moods as i went ashore the constable had his police car parked behind the yard and as we started down the shore road i asked him what branch inspector garrard was assigned to yell have to ask him sir does that mean you dont know i think he knew but he had his orders and he didnt talk as we drove into lerwick the police station was in the county buildings up on town hall brae a brown sandstone building opposite the garrison theatre i was taken straight through into a small bare room the constable switched the light on ill tell the inspector yere here the door closed and i resigned myself to a long wait stupidly i had left my pipe on the bridge i felt lost without it now that my mind had to grapple once again with problems of conscience and expedience did they really have a local witness who would get up in court and swear hed seen me throw that petrol bomb i could remember the hard line of the mans mouth the shut face pale in the deck lights and aberdeen harbour glimmering in the rain where was he now i wondered i was still thinking about him and why an inspector was checking on my movements when the door opened and a slightly stooped man in a tweed jacket entered sorry to keep you waiting he had the tired air of a man who has been up all night but his eyes were bright as he put the briefcase he was carrying down and sat at the table waving me to the chair opposite i gather youre busy trying to get that wrecked trawler back into commission i nodded any particular reason reason it wasnt the opening i had expected yes why are you doing it i dont see that it concerns the police no well maybe it doesnt he reached into the briefcase pulled out several files and laid them on the table in front of him but motivation is something that does concern me if you know what motivates a man then you are at least halfway to solving a case or avoiding trouble he was softspoken his manner quiet and relaxed almost conversational well come back to that in a moment meanwhile he opened the slimmest of the files in front of him let us take a look at your record he fished out a pair of giltrimmed halfglasses these and the slight stoop gave him a somewhat academic air i would guess you have never done anything without strong motivation he looked across at me not perhaps the right word without ideological convictions would that be a reasonable assessment of your somewhat unusual shifts of work and environment he was staring at me over the halfglasses i see you dont want to admit to that is it the word ideological you object to my ideological convictions presuming i have any are my own concern he nodded perhaps but there are things i dont understand and i would appreciate your cooperation what about why you suddenly decided to come up here for instance the academic air had receded the pale eyes watching me you know the hull police were waiting to interview you a question of intimidation i had nothing to do with that then what were you doing there he didnt seem surprised at my not answering lucky you were he murmured for the little girl anyway he paused letting the silence run on finally he said would you like to tell me about it not your department i said youre not from hull that question about ideological convictions what department are you special branch he smiled let us say i am a police officer who knows quite a lot about you has learned more since he has been here and now wants to know what the hell youre up to do i have to be up to something but hed see it differently of course once a man has been in trouble with the police youre part of the establishment i said you dont have to worry about finding a job its always there but for others its different do you find that difficult to understand i was being sarcastic but it didnt seem to upset him you dont have to worry about a job either randall youre not just a trawlerman youre a highly intelligent highly trained individual but your record if i may say so is a somewhat unusual one he picked up the top page of the file leaning back with it in his hand this is a summary shall i read it to you he did not wait for me to reply but went straight on you were born on nd april your mother muriel caroline randall taught in kindergarten in aberdeen in november following the munich crisis she took a course in nursing at glasgow infirmary there she met henry wilkin graber a wealthy american businessman in fact she was one of the nurses who looked after him when he was brought into the hospital in february following a car accident shortly after his return to the states he offered her the job of governess to his two children she turned him down then but just over a year later in july she took passage on one of the refugee ships to the states that was after the fall of france so presumably her concern was for you would that be right you work out your own answers i said he smiled im only trying to get at the motivation your father for instance have you ever visited shetland before and when i shook my head he said now suddenly you go to west burra where he was born and start making enquiries why a man ought to know something about his father i murmured he was a communist but you knew that before you came up here yes where is he now he was leaning forward his eyes on my face dont be silly i said youve been to hamnavoe and to ground sound too you know damn well he died just before madrid fell to francos forces he nodded of course the plaque who put it there ive no idea your mother perhaps i dont think so and youre an only child no brothers or sisters no but it was somebody who knew him well eh that line from browning the conflict within himself are you sure youve never met him my bewilderment must have shown for he added the plaque was sent to the clerk of the presbytery of shetland in by an anonymous donor with instructions where it was to be placed and a sum that more than covered the cost of the work i only saw it just over a week ago i had no idea how it came to be up there he stared at me for a moment looking me straight in the eyes he was still staring at me when he suddenly said are you a communist no but you believe in communism i also believe in christianity he smiled and i caught a flicker of interest even sympathy in those pale eyes and there is a difference between the christian faith and the christian church is that what you mean i shrugged just as there is a difference between the communist ideal and communism itself say the russian brand you dont need to get me down to a police station to state the obvious he laughed leaning back in his chair and relaxing again well lets get back to your file and please pick me up if theyve got it wrong at all in january your mother took up residence in grabers house on rhode island you were then threeandahalf years old did you like henry graber i dont remember and you dont remember your father either no yet you accepted the one and rejected the other was that because of your mothers marriage were you jealous of graber i reached into my pocket for my pipe realized it wasnt there and heard him say something about the physical relationship of a mother and her only son for christs sake wheres this leading i demanded angrily his strangely quiet face looked suddenly grim ill tell you where its leading to your record its here in this file two dozen separate items at least shop floor convener agitator union organizer and militant youve been in prison youve been charged with inciting others to create a disturbance resisting arrest intent to cause grievous bodily harm and in your public speeches your writings in the way you have incited pickets and moved bodies of strikers youve demonstrated a degree of violent reaction to or from something that is quite abnormal now lets get back to your mothers marriage it was her second marriage and grabers third the date is given here as th november is that right i nodded i think my stepfather was very lonely his wife had just died but it had started before then she had been ill for a long time a mental illness and my mother i checked myself no point in telling him about that moment of appalment when as a little boy i had discovered she didnt regard me as her entire world it was natural enough i guess but a shock to you i imagine so he had an explosives and small arms factory and made a fortune out of the war is that why you suddenly left home i wanted to travel to calcutta dusseldorf i felt my muscles tense the past turning over in my mind my god youve done your homework not me he said its all here and he reached for the second file you were educated very expensively the phillips exeter academy then princeton at princeton you studied economics do you remember a professor hansbacher as i nodded the thick glasses the round beaming face leaping to mind his brilliant lectures on the nature and defects of capitalism you should because he remembered you one of the cleverest students i ever had thats how he describes you he was a communist wasnt he ive no idea i was just a kid that was what he was accused of he lost his job in the mccarthy witchhunt he leaned towards me you were at an impressionable age he must have had considerable influence on you he had a very logical very clear mind a brilliant teacher in fact yet within a year you left why i told you i wanted to travel to calcutta isnt that where the dropouts go what did you use for money i dont think he expected an answer and i sat there silent knowing what was coming th january you were twenty then and in dusseldorf what were you doing in dusseldorf why ask me since youve got it all there he nodded you were charged with being in the possession of drugs and you had one of the leading german advocates to defend you who paid for that was it your stepfather his lawyers yes he paid for it you got three months a year later you had reached india and then suddenly you pulled yourself together you came to england and studied at the london school of economics did he pay for that too but by then id had enough i dont have to sit here going over my past with you i got to my feet its over and done with and ive got work to do youre here quite voluntarily you sent an officer to bring me in he sighed well if youre not prepared to cooperate why did you come he leaned back the pale eyes staring up at me was it because you knew id been making enquiries about you why should that worry me and if you want to know i paid my own way while studying at the lse nothing to do with graber and when you got your degree you joined the staff of a national daily as a financial journalist i specialized in industrial relations you were earning good money then suddenly you abandoned your wellpaid job moved to the clyde and became a shipyard worker any particular reason i found i only knew the management side i didnt know what it was like from the workers point of view nothing to do with your father no and two years later you were a convener fomenting wildcat strikes and organizing picket lines three charges in four years and a short prison sentence then you dropped out of that went to grimsby and got a job on a trawler that was after your marriage had broken up four years later you had your mates ticket then your masters and now youve dropped out again into shetland enquiring about your father refloating an old trawler with a contract to act as standby boat to an oil rig he put the sheet of paper down what was your motive in all this he got to his feet then and stood facing me thats all i want to know your motive does there have to be one i think so life isnt like that i told him theres no logic in human behaviour not always i agree but theres often a pattern he paused looking meditatively down at the file i could pull you in for questioning he said youve got no warrant he looked at me i could get one his voice was suddenly hard did you start that blaze no but you were there you know who did i didnt answer and youve no intention of going to hull to help the police in their enquiries ive got a job to do and theres a lot of work getting that trawler ready for use he nodded ill tell them they may issue a warrant or they may not he considered me for a moment frowning as though uncertain what to do next all right well leave it at that then but if they make an arrest youll be called as a witness you realize that he gave me time to think about it and then he said im going to give you some advice a warning rather he was suddenly very still the pale eyes fixed on me the stakes up here in the north sea are big now he said speaking slowly and with emphasis big enough to attract a lot of interest not all of it welcome do you understand what im talking about i think so i suddenly wanted to get out of there the little office very quiet and his eyes fixed on me good he hesitated then reached for the pad and pencil on the desk and wrote down a number if you find yourself getting out of your depth why should i he looked at me for a moment then he said youre vulnerable thats why youre tough physically but youre vulnerable he didnt explain he didnt have to if you want to talk to me again go to any police station and have them ring that number or you can telephone direct he handed me the sheet of paper it was an number london whats the name of the rig youre going to work with north star and the company startrion a subsidiary of villiers finance and industrial he nodded well just remember what i said and stay out of trouble he went to the door and opened it for me but as i was going out he stopped me one other thing your father he wasnt killed in i stared at him incredulously what the hell are you talking about just that they picked him up in norway in the door closed and i was in the passage leading out of the county buildings past the flagpole into town hall brae chapter four i should have gone back and asked him what else he knew but i was scared those files that dossier on me the offences i had committed were all minor ones but he had made them sound formidable stringing them together like that a pattern of course there had been a pattern and once the authorities get their teeth into you christ they had taken a lot of trouble and my father that plaque who the hell had erected that plaque and why why should anybody do that if he hadnt been killed in the defence of madrid he would have been sixtyeight now if he were still alive too old to be involved in anything very active but in when norway was occupied by the germans and the russians were our allies so many questions and my mind in turmoil as we sweated to get that trawler fit for sea and all the time that feeling of something hanging over me a frightening sense of insecurity as i tried to grapple with a mental change of life that seemed to have altered my whole outlook work was a panacea and god knows there was plenty of that we slipped on the evening of friday llth april working through the weekend to get her off at dawn on the monday it was the only patent slip in lerwick and we were lucky to get the use of it even though it meant doing most of the work ourselves by then i had had a telegram from the startrion office in aberdeen requesting confirmation that we would be on station by th april as required under the terms of the charter the location was also given n w which was some thirty miles west of papa stour in block we went for sea trials on the thursday immediately after survey steaming north as far as rams ness the southern point of fetlar in a norwesterly force with a dirty sea spilling down through colgrave sound there was still a lot that needed doing but the repairs to the hull stood up to it and the engines gave full power we were back off halcrows yard by on the friday morning and gertrude got a telegram off to startrion confirming we were in business provided we could keep the vessel going for three months at a stretch i was at the chart shelf outside my cabin working out an etd based on steaming time required to reach the location when she returned youll go south round sumburgh head yes then you can anchor at taing and sail out to the rig from there it was a thought a last peaceful night and the chance of a final check on the way round we could even get delivery of anything we had forgotten then perhaps you will have time to discuss the agreement between us i looked at her standing in the doorway at the top of the companionway a solid figure in an oilskin jacket clouds were scudding in over the brown stone smudge of lerwick town i couldnt see the expression on her face but her voice had sounded a little tense im afraid i had forgotten about that you are not very businesslike there was a pause and then a little hesitantly she said how do i know you will not go off with the ship you have johan duncan the crew im the only outsider three months is a long time i turned on her flinging down my pencil we both signed that charter agreement i said keeping a tight hold on my tongue a piece of paper any agreement we draw up between us is still only a piece of paper ja she had turned back into the bridge leaning on the telegraph and staring out through the windows the forecast was bad and a rainstorm was curtaining the higher part of the town im sorry she made a little movement of her hand we do not work very easily together my fault i think but this ship has so many memories we come to shetland in her jan and i when selmvaag vaal closed down jan bought her in bergen it cost us every penny we had and some of our friends money as well what was a lowestoft trawler doing in bergen she was an mfv i think you call them right at the beginning of the war she was brought north to scapa flow as a fleet supply ship later she did some patrols and after that she was with the fleet in norway i have the logs at taing then in she is in shetland sailing again to norway it was this ship that brought far petersen off from one of the fjords just east of tromso he had jan with him they often talked about that voyage they were almost trapped by a patrol boat but the fog saved them a thick fog just when the bullets were hitting all round there are some marks if you know where to look when was this i asked in it was winter i remember the date th january that was when they land in shetland that first time and you have the logs yes the early ones jan found them tucked away at the back of a locker in the cabin there ill show you when you bring her into taing she turned abruptly moving a step towards me you will bring her in please in case i run off with her but she didnt smile ill feel easier thats all and she added i saw sandford when i was ashore he was driving past me along the esplanade in a red car has he been on board no you havent seen him again i shook my head turning back to the chart shelf and measuring off the distance to clift sound what is he doing here in lerwick do you think if you run a hotel i suppose you need supplies just over forty miles to the taing say five hours steaming if we left at noon tomorrow he doesnt need to come to lerwick for stores he can order by telephone her voice had risen slightly a note of tension why does he need a ship so badly he is prepared to buy the mortgage i told you hes got a contract to supply two rigs do you believe him she had moved towards me and i could see her face now in the chart cabin light she was frowning i think he is here because we are ready to sail and on a note of urgency she added you must leave for taing now immediately can you do that otherwise i think perhaps we are not permitted to sail at all nonsense i said she may not be classed al but the survey went off all right and even if she didnt pass survey we would still have our temporary certificate of seaworthiness but it wasnt the survey she was worried about it was the crew apparently she had been warned by her local councillor that johan and the three other norwegians might be ordered to leave shetland somebody has been enquiring about their work permits we never bother about work permits before not for fishing but now that we are going to work for an oil rig it may be different then youd better apply for them she nodded of course i have the papers already but mr tulloch thinks it will be opposed and they will be ordered to leave but if they didnt need work permits before he says it is politics the fishermen here are a very strong community and they dont like the oil companies so you see it is not very difficult to stir op trouble and you think sandford is behind it she gave a little shrug perhaps i dont know but it is one way of ensuring that we lose this charter she was so urgent about it that i agreed to sail as soon as we had taken on fuel and water we moored at the quay alongside a lerwick trawler shortly after i think we were lucky in that it was lunchtime and the rain teeming down all the offices were closed nobody bothered us and at we slipped our warps and stood out into bressay sound visibility was bad in low cloud and rain squalls but by we were clear of kirkabister ness with bard head a grey lump bearing sea conditions were fairly good as we steamed south under the lee of the long mountain spine running down to sumburgh head and i had time to take a look at the admiralty sailing directions i had never before had need of part i of the north sea pilot which covers the faroes shetlands and orkneys and i was appalled at the force of the tidal streams the main stream was southeastgoing and between orkney and shetland it reached a speed of eight to ten knots at the margin headlands of north ronaldsay and sumburgh head the result of course was violent tide races known as roosts in shetland they were to be encountered off all the major headlands with the sumburgh roost the most dangerous of all as in the confused tumbling and bursting sea vessels often become entirely unmanageable and sometimes founder while others have been tossed about for days in light weather the roost should be given a wide berth i looked at the spine of the faded and dogeared pilot it was dated obviously the warning was for sailing vessels i was checking the tide data on the chart when johan appeared at my side you take sumburgh very close ja it is the last hour of the southgoing tide so the wind is with the tide and we get a lift on the eddy by fitful i left it to him and he took the wheel himself turning the headland so close that we seemed in imminent danger of hitting the islet of little tind the wind was westerly force the sea lumpy and full of holes but not breaking heavily it took us a long time to round hog of the holm and claw our way up to head of the holm with wind and tide both against us but with johan piloting i had no worries except perhaps when we turned due north up the long sheer slategrey line of fitful head we were on a lee shore then no place for an engine failure and so close in that we were backwinded by the towering cliffs the burst of the waves sounding like gunfire the tide turned and we were inside the havras by with the stacks of houssness just visible and clift sound opening up ahead the light was fading and as we came into the shelter of east burra johan sent henrik forard to call the leading marks into the voe that first view of taing from the sea will always remain the evening light dulled by rain the clouds sweeping low and the narrow tongue of land suddenly revealed as being separate from the green slopes behind and then as we nosed slowly in the house suddenly appearing a grey ghost of a building and the water below it a leaden sheet barely touched by the wind and when we had let go our anchor and the echo of the chain running out had died away our engines stopped everything so still so absolutely quiet i thought gertrude petersen would have been down at the waters edge to welcome her ship home but though there was a light on in the house nothing stirred i had the zodiac inflated and got over the side and rowed myself ashore not bothering about the outboard it was warm rowing in oilskins and farther than i thought the rain had stopped the evening strangely luminous with fish rising i could hear the slap of them hitting the water and the circles rippling out were so numerous that sometimes they interlocked i couldnt see the entrance to the voe it was blocked by the lit shape of the trawler and with the low arm of the taing stretching out from the shore and the steep mountain slopes beyond it was more like a loch than an indent open to the sea the beach below the house was sand and rock with a small boat jetty of cemented boulder the cement was crumbling the boulders loose and it was already half awash on the tide i pulled the inflatable up on to higher ground made fast the painter and then stood for a moment looking back at the voe and the trawler lying there the ship the house the landencircled water everything so perfect i was thinking of jan petersen then wondering how he had acquired such a place and a wife who would go to sea with him stand by him through thick and thin a refugee from another country and i had started with so much achieved so little no matter that the ship was mortgaged the house too probably they were his he had owned them and now he was dead and i was going up to his house to make an agreement with his wife sitting probably at that table in the window with the photograph of him and his father on their catcher i got out my pipe and filled it but i didnt light it i just stood there holding it in my hand as though for comfort in that quiet remoteness of the darkening landscape the moment between light and dark just as night closes in is a time of silence when the soul is touched by doubts i had that feeling now the past a nothingness the future all uncertain and myself not knowing or even understanding what i was doing here i put my pipe away and turned abruptly walking up to the house and knocking on the door i wanted to get this over and get to sea three months in the loneliness of command seeing nothing but the same patch of sea and the ugly superstructure of a floating rig three months of that should be enough to sort myself out the sound of my fist on the door was loud in the stillness and the lamplight streaming out from the window on my right became a muted glow as the curtains were drawn the sound of footsteps clacking on stone then the door opened and she was there but not as i had expected her in the denim slacks and faded jersey i had become accustomed to now she was wearing a long dress and high heeled shoes and her fair hair limned by the light of an oil lamp on the chest behind her fell to her shoulders i stood there for a moment not saying anything her appearance so unexpected she had always seemed to me a sturdy solid norwegian and fullers phrase the legal owner had fitted her exactly well are you coming in or not i went in slowly feeling uncomfortable im afraid i havent changed does it matter she was smiling as she closed the door no i suppose not i was staring at her as she turned into the lamplight her long dress flowing and her eyes bright this was the first time i had seen her with any makeup on takes a bit of getting used to she laughed tonight i am celebrating and she added over her shoulder as she took me into the livingroom ive not had much to celebrate these last few years but when i saw the duchess coming in round the end of the taing she stopped turning and facing me you will never know what that meant to me and then she asked me whether i had fed i hope you havent no ive come straight ashore as you suggested good because otherwise you would have to eat two meals its not impossible she laughed you dont know what ive cooked her teeth flashed white her eyes sparkling it crossed my mind that she was a widow now and flying some sort of flag with the table laid for two lace mats and roughcarved wooden candlesticks and then she said if jan were here how he would have enjoyed it dont you feel you deserve a celebration after all the work you have done now take off your oilskins please and we will have a drink she went into the kitchen returning with glasses and a bottle i found this when i am going through pars things it is aquavit real live aquavit i think it came with the ship from norway and he kept it against some happy day she was in a mood of strange elation gripped by a sort of feverish belief that now the ship was back at her old mooring everything would be all right you bring me luck she said raising her glass the toowide mouth smiling at me skal and she tossed the drink back her eyes on me watching to see that i did the same are you trying to drink me under the table i asked as she refilled my glass maybe i dont know she was laughing but at herself i think at the invitation in her eyes that she didnt bother to conceal you havent wished us luck i got up then remembering how formal scandinavian ships officers could be and made a little speech she clapped her hands and after she had drunk she put her glass down carefully holding it cupped in her capable brown hands her head a little bowed so that the fair hair cascaded over her face i think we are very strange partners you and i neither of us knowing what we want of life or where we are going all i know is what i feel inside me that tonight is different the start of something but i dont know what she raised her head and looked at me questioningly dont you feel that i shrugged maybe i said guardedly i think for you also this is a new beginning what about that agreement i asked her have you thought about it no i havent had time but i think we should discuss it now while we are still sober there is nothing to discuss her hand reached out to the bottle will you have another drink i shook my head not now when weve settled this maybe there is some wine to follow what you would call plonk i think i bought it at the stores this morning but now she filled my glass again now i think we have one last aquavit and drink to a partnership she picked up her glass not looking at me but staring down into the heavy pale liquor you see i have had time to think about it there is no way that i can see to draw up a legal document between us that is of any use i am the owner you hold the mortgage either we are partners or one of us must find the money to buy the other out how much money have you got less than fifty pounds you see you cannot buy me out and i have nothing i am living on borrowed money so what is the point of an agreement i thought you didnt trust me i dont your head is too full of strange ideas about people and politics and economics of the world oh dont think i have been spying on you but they tell me everything about what you eat how much you sleep what you talk about and there is the gossip here too you came to see hilda manson making enquiries about your father the house where he was born is just up the road and there is that tablet in the church so i know something about him she was looking at me a gleam of humour back in her eyes i think probably you suffer from some sort of a father complex her hand reached out and touched my arm do not please be offended i am an expert on this subject jan you see had a father complex so that in a sense i married two men far petersen i always called him that it is the norwegian word for father far was with us always from the very beginning of our marriage but it did not matter i loved that dear gentle old man very much even though he is so stupid about money she moved her hand to the bottle so you see i know she said filling my glass but not her own and then rising to her feet now we will eat it is fish do you mind i shook my head fish to start with then meat she bent towards me laughing cheer up it is not the end of the world that another person knows something about what is going on in your mind for me it gives you a certain integrity and because of that you get no agreement but a celebration dinner instead and she turned to go to the kitchen i offered to help her but she waved me back into my chair have your drink and relax about five minutes i think and if you are bored with your own company there are the logs over there she indicated the table by the window i looked them out for you this afternoon the voyage which brought far petersen and jan to shetland is in the second book i took my drink over to the table moving the lamp so that it shone on the little pile of books tied up with string there were seven of them and all but two were hardbound books like ledgers these covered the voyages from when jan petersen and his father began fishing out of lerwick and hamnavoe courses speeds fixes weather everything was recorded including the time spent trawling and the catches for each voyage mostly they were fishing around shetland occasionally orkney or fair isle these voyages were a week or ten days at the most but in the summer they had fished up to faroe and then the voyages had been longer i glanced only briefly at these logs it was the two others both exercise books that interested me they were not proper logs but a personal record of patrols incidents and voyages completed in the early part of the war they had been kept by a lt adrian farrant the first covered the scapa flow period and the evacuation of british troops from the narvik area of norway in june the second was a record of voyages made in the winter of mostly to rendezvous with local fishing boats off the coast of norway but a few to the coast itself north of the arctic circle it was one of those that gertrude had marked with a slip of paper three men and a small boy were taken off from lyngenfjord at the time agreed mark johnston a mining saboteur with soe knut hansen a businessman from trondheim olav petersen a whaling captain from selmvaag and jan petersen his son aged the worst conditions possible clear sky and bright moonlight i wished the agent who had radioed a report of inshore fog could have been with me for we were spotted before we were even clear of the fjord no wonder lt farrant had hidden the books at the back of the locker in every case he had given the names and occupations of those he had landed in norway and those he had brought out a highly secret record i began from the beginning then turning the pages quickly reading only the names with a growing certainty of what i would find and in the voyage that began sailed from graven at on january i found it arrived off the rv near oksfjord in finnmark at weather ideal with low cloud and drizzle wind light from wnw took off nils storkson as arranged he is an officer of the company linge i think but there is another man with him alistair randall who claims he is a british citizen storkson says he is an agent but not one of ours and insists i put him under guard both are suffering from exposure and randall from slight frostbite he is a much older man and badly scarred an old injury only storkson is armed i have taken away his gun and given them the cabin forard of the galley then followed a brief account of the voyage back to shetland it concluded berthed alongside the quay at graven january and handed passengers over for interrogation both are fully recovered and both tell different stories a matter for intelligence i am only the bus driver i sat back staring at that page reading it through again garrard had been right and the confirmation that my father had not died in spain left me confused and more than a little puzzled an agent but not one of ours whose then not the germans had the russians had agents in north norway at the beginning of the door to the kitchen opened finish your drink and come and eat she put the plates she was carrying on the table it is steamed halibut i hope you like i sac down remembering the presence i had felt on the bridge that strange sense of companionship when i had stood alone at the wheel that first time is it all right she asked you are very silent its fine i said could it have been his presence i had felt had he been in such a state of nerves that it had left an indelible impression you are thinking about their voyage to shetland it was very dangerous to come right into the coast like that the duchess is not a norwegian ship like the boats they had sailing out of lunna and scalloway she was based at graven in sullom voe and it was her speed and range that made them use her but she only went in to the coast in an emergency or when it was something very important it wasnt far petersen they went in to get on that trip it was the man johnston an english agent also to land explosives and equipment if she had seen the name randall in the log she didnt mention it probably she didnt remember and when i had opened the bottle of red wine and the joint of lamb was on the table i forgot about it too i remember i talked a lot about my early life in america and how i had worked my way from germany across the middle east to india she was curious about me and in the candlelight with the drink inside me and her large eyes staring i even told her about diisseldorf to be able to talk freely like that to have somebody listen it was something i found i needed very badly and to add to the enjoyment there was the knowledge that the evening could only end one way and that there was all the next day ahead of us our hands touched once as i took the tray with the coffee on it and a bottle of glen morangie i felt the movement of her fingers and my blood leapt we sat very properly on two separate chairs facing each other and sipped our coffee and our whisky talking gently in the lamplight each of us knowing what was going to happen and the delay making the sense of anticipation almost unbearable i hadnt had a woman for a long time and now with all the work behind me the knock on the door was sudden and very loud i thought it must be johan or somebody from the ship gertrude must have thought so too for she said as she got up they are becoming too dependent on you but it wasnt anybody from the ship it was sandford and he had a policeman with him he came in smiling his sharp eyes taking in the cosy intimacy of the room at a glance i thought wed find youd slipped round here what do you want i asked him but with the constable there we both knew it was the same man who had escorted me to the police station you have foreign nationals working on your boat is that correct i nodded and he read out the four names theyre norwegian gertrude said i am norwegian too we have residents permits aye i know that but what about work permits those have been applied for would that be for renewal or are they new applications we have checked with the department of employment and there is no record my fault she said quickly well mr petersens really and nobody ever troubled us about it but now the applications for permits are in and i have seen the fisheries inspector in lerwick he has agreed to recommend them so you dont have to worry not if you send the men ashore sandford said and when the inspector has had time to think about it i doubt very much if he will support your applications he looked pleased with himself as he turned to me youre sailing tomorrow or is it sunday youll be short of a crew i could help you there well manage i said you cant act as standby boat to an oil rig if your manning strength is below the regulation minimum i stared at him wondering what was behind it youre quite a sea lawyer i said and then i turned to the constable have you a warrant he shook his head therell be no charges so long as you send them ashore those are my instructions and when i asked him to produce them his face took on a stolid look verbal instructions from my sergeant he said im to see that those four men are brought ashore they may have to be deported but thats ridiculous gertrude said they live on board its their home it will be for the home office to decide i got my oilskins from the door where i had hung them i was boiling with anger but i had too much experience of the slow inexorable process of the law to argue i just wondered what that little bastard sandford was up to gertrude came at me as i was zipping up my oilskin jacket you are not going to bring them ashore her voice was high and strident her eyes blazing you cant i forbid it just leave it to me i told her its my responsibility i reached for my cap and put it on then i went across to sandford youve been to a lot of trouble over this why you got that ship by a trick its not the ship youre after now i said its the crew you want your own men on board why he hesitated his eyes gone dead and i knew there was something else something he hadnt told me it should be a shetland crew he murmured shetlanders have a right to exploit their own oil but he couldnt look me in the face his eyes shifting i offered to help thats all crews arent easy to get but you have one willing and ready to take over your own skipper too there was something here i didnt understand but i couldnt take hold of him and shake the truth out of him not with the constable standing there i glanced at gertrude her long dress looked suddenly incongruous the candles behind her guttering in the draught from the open door ill tell them i said and i went out walking quickly down to the landing beach with the aid of my torch it was very dark now a soft rain falling and only the riding light of the trawler showing blurred in the night the constable came with me and helped me launch the zodiac how long before we get the permits i asked him normally its a matter of a few days but in this case he straightened up facing me in the darkness its politics you see sir you mean sandford is right and the applications will be refused its only what i hear and who instructed your sergeant to send you down at this time of the evening i dont know sir but it was sandford who was pressing the matter several councillors too i was in the boat then fortunately he didnt insist on coming with me he pushed me off clear of the boulders and then i was out from the land rowing towards the ship halfway there i stopped and lit my pipe the rain drifting in the flare of the match the sound of an accordion and mens voices singing came to me across the water i sat there for a moment thinking about what i was going to do about shetland politics and how i would stand in law but block was in international waters out there i was my own master and if the permits were refused then i could still send the men ashore when gertrude had found replacements i started rowing again the rain coming in flurries hissing on the bowl of my pipe it was duncan who answered my hail as i came alongside he helped me climb aboard and i told him to get the engines started well be leaving as soon as weve fetched our anchor he didnt argue just nodded and said aye but yed better break it gently to the lads theyve got a bellyful of beer and theyll no think much of the idea ill they were crammed into the mess room aft their faces sweating in the naked light the table littered with beer cans and young per swaying to the tune he was squeezing out of the box the song died as i looked at johan sitting by the galley hatch youve got out of here at night before havent you i asked him you want to leave now if we dont go now we dont go at all and i told him what had happened he finished the can of beer he was drinking and got slowly to his feet ja we can try he pushed his hand up over his face rubbing at his eyes and swaying slightly what is the weather dark i said and raining and the wind still from the southwest gud then we know when we clear houss ness the thrum of the diesels started and he turned lars henrik he said something to them in norwegian then went down the alleyway pushed open the door to the deck and went out into the night not bothering about oilskins henrik followed him and lars came up to the bridge with me i didnt switch the deck lights on we needed night vision it was very dark so dark i could barely see them working on the foredeck the winch clattering and the chain beginning to come in a light shone out from the shore gertrude had drawn the curtains back and when the winch had stopped and johan had joined me in the bridge he got us out past the end of the taing on compass bearings taken on the faint glimmer of that light we lost it as soon as we were out into clift sound a slight swell under us and everything black we headed south on a compass course of with myself at the radar and johan watching the glimmer of the waves breaking against the cliffs i think he distrusted electronics for he conned the ship by eye and when we began to feel the full weight of the sea he ordered a change of course to the west he wasnt a navigator he couldnt handle a sextant he could barely plot a course on the chart but he came from luro and had learned how to pilot a boat fishing the inner lead up towards the lofotens we passed so close to houss ness that we could hear the roar of the waves breaking against the stacks he came in from the starboard gangway then okay we are clear now on due west in one mile groot ness is to starboard after that there is nothing between you and the bottom of greenland lars was already steering i went into the chart recess and switched on the light foula was the obvious choice whats the holding like in ham voe in this wind gud he leaned over the chart beside me his jersey sodden foula is okay nobody bother us there he went below then and i switched on the bridge radio it was and i got the tailend of the late news something about an oil slick off the northumberland coast and the local mp to table a motion in the house about pollution and firmer government control of oil rigs in hull a meeting of shipyard workers to consider the latest offer was disrupted by militants with fish being imported to augment supplies and prices soaring the government is being pressed to intervene in the dispute i switched on one of the heaters and removed my oilskins waiting for the inshore forecast the news seemed remote another world as i listened to the sounds of the ship the slam of the bows as she fell off the tops of the waves all your life you work for something you believe in then three weeks of hard concentrated effort and it means nothing i crossed to the radar set but nothing showed and i stood there staring out at the black night with the waves coming at us as smudges of grey in the darkness the radio drowning the plunging impact of the bows three months and what at the end of it i was thinking of gertrude wondering what our relationship would have been now if sandford hadnt turned up a partnership she had said but the only experience i had had of partnership with a woman had disintegrated into ideological arguments and recriminations i switched the decca to maximum range and as the radius lines changed the outline of foula appeared little more than twentytwo miles ahead speed seven knots in three hours time gale warnings hebrides rockall and malin westerly gale force may be expected in the next two hours we would have to anchor close in to be under the lee and ham was sure to have a police station why was it that everything i did seemed to lead inevitably to a clash with authority and sandford there was something about him something familiar that i didnt understand i tried to see behind the bright aggressive eyes the truculence of his manner but instead i found my mind switching to the entry in that exercise book an agent but not one of ours and he had been on this ship in the cabin forard of the galley a matter for intelligence somewhere in some record office there would be an intelligence report i tried to imagine what it said but i couldnt think clearly i was tired my stomach queasy it was always like this at the start of a voyage just nausea i was never sick i leaned on the chart shelf pushing back my cap and wiping the sweat from my forehead two hours later the large comforting bulk of johan appeared at my side he had been into ham voe before so i left it to him and at we let go our anchor about a cable off the end of the pier it was still and very peaceful in the lee of the towering mass of hamnafjeld and i went to my bunk thinking i was clear of trouble tucked away here under foula we lay there all saturday and nobody bothered us until a fishing boat came in late that afternoon she had the letters lk and her number painted white on her bows and instead of making for the pier she headed straight for us the crew on deck putting fenders out i watched her come alongside and as henrik and lars took her warps i called down to the skipper to ask him where he came from what he wanted from scalloway he said leaning his head out of the wooden wheelhouse youre randall are you ive brought a mr stevens to see you he said something over his shoulder and a man came out of the door at the back of the wheelhouse a short man with thinning hair dressed in a dark suit he looked up at me and i saw the steeltrap mouth the hard unfriendly eyes the slight cast of the eye he didnt ask permission to come on board but went straight to the side and hauled himself up on to our deck a moment later he was on the bridge facing me johan was there and henrik too we had been playing cribbage these two of your norwegians the same quiet voice hard and flat and the odd sidelong look of the left eye you should have put them ashore whats it got to do with you my hands were clenched my voice strained how did you know where to find me i was remembering the coldblooded way he had threatened me wondering whether he thought id made a statement to the police as he stood there facing me saying nothing what made you follow me out here well talk about that in your cabin he turned abruptly and started down the companionway then realized it was at the back of the bridge i dont want you on board but he had already disappeared inside and the fishing boat had recovered her warps and was going astern i watched her sheer away from our side and head for the pier the name islandgirl on her stern then i followed him to my cabin he was sitting on my bunk with a packet of cigarettes in his hand he didnt offer me one this time shut the door he waved me to the single upright chair i take it you know something about the background of this drilling operation have you met villiers no but youve heard of him you know the way he operates the sort of man he is i know he runs a very successful finance company you admire success it wasnt a question more a sneer the word success made to sound obscene he makes money at the expense of others of course and ultimately its the workers who suffer you dont need to give me the propaganda line no he was watching me as he took a cigarette out of the packet and lit it just thought id remind you thats all its some time since you were a shipyard worker you were one of the leaders then a shop floor convener with a gift for turning on the heat when it was needed he paused drawing on his cigarette then he said before that you worked as a journalist in the city you didnt like it did you there are two sides to everything i said wondering where this was leading he smiled seeing things two ways can be confusing you didnt come out here in a fishing boat to tell me that no but youve been confused for some time and thats a pity youre in a very unique position at the moment unique from our point of view he was staring at me as though trying to make up his mind and i wasnt certain which of his eyes was focused on my face but then if you werent confused you wouldnt be here would you he said it reflectively the sound of the radio on the bridge almost drowning his words you wouldnt have come to shetland trying to find out about your father and landed yourself with this trawler so it was the trawler that had brought him here whats the trawler got to do with it but he ignored my question villiers now he murmured would you say villiers is typical of the city one aspect of it yes but not the city as a whole thats pretty mundane of course banks and insurance and unit trusts he smiled quietly to himself but thats not how the public sees it all they read about is the property developers the land speculators the ones that hit the headlines getting rich too quick while workers are declared redundant or fight management and government for increased wages that never catch up with inflation look at villiers with his finance companies and his villa in bermuda as well as his hampshire estate two aircraft and a flat in belgravia thats the capitalist image the public understands girls parties villas abroad and who pays they do in the end he leaned suddenly forward thats why were interested in villiers the face of capitalism at its ugliest he was very different from the militants i had met no warmth and talking in cliches villiers is happily married with two kids i said wearily and he works i thought you said youd never met him he was still leaning forward his eyes gone hard i havent but i read the newspapers i see he stared at his cigarette his mouth a thin line you are confused arent you he gave a little shrug well it cant be helped villiers is very suitable to our purpose and so are you it doesnt really matter that you think him so commendable i didnt say that youre twisting my words a silence then a long uncomfortable silence finally he said speaking slowly it may help you to understand the importance we attach to this if i fill you in on the background you know of course that we can call on the services of quite a few journalists wittingly or unwittingly recently we have had a very good man looking into the villiers takeover technique and the companies he has grabbed its the latest that concerns you an offer by villiers finance and industrial known as vfi for the whole of the capital of nevenclyde shipping the offer was very astutely timed last january when nevenclyde had just reported heavy losses on a harbour construction contract in brazil its of no interest to me i said im running a trawler now he jabbed a cigarette at me you think you can escape after all these years he was watching me the slant of his eyes more disconcerting than ever its not as simple as that randall we all have our backgrounds and the past produces its own obligations the hard mouth managed a smile as a boy you can run away to sea not as a man he leaned back slowly and his voice was quiet and relaxed as he continued nevenclydes trouble was that they diversified mostly into fields where their expertise was limited they lost money and they lost the support of their shareholders the vfi offer was declared unconditional on th march the attraction for villiers was the shipping offices in various parts of the world and the losses built up over the years which he can now offset against profits for tax purposes the construction business has already been sold off nc ceramics is on the market so too are nc textiles a small company specializing in panties and bras with a factory in belfast nc plastics producing dolls and garden furnishings and nc musicals a pop record company it took me back to my days as a journalist the wheeling and dealing that was part of the background to life in the city it had coloured all my thinking affected my whole outlook but now it didnt concern me now only the sea the sea at least was clean clearcut impersonal without hate or greed or bitterness an elemental force nothing more nothing complicated but i couldnt explain it to a man like this his voice droning on all this is much too complicated to capture public imagination stripping propertydealing even redundancies theyve had it all before and anyway a lot of it is above their heads but an oil rig he paused his eyes watching for my reaction as he drew on his cigarette two years ago nevenclyde bought their way into north sea oil with the acquisition of a company called startrion its only tangible asset was one of the first seagoing rigs built in this country a rig called north star which they purchased secondhand this is the rig that will be drilling here in block startrion operated it as drilling contractors but as far back as the auction they put in a bid for two areas west of shetland at that time the major oil companies were concentrating on the north sea proper north east atlantic areas were regarded as hazardous for the rigs then available also geophysically they were not fully evaluated startrion got them both on a very low bid are you implying that the rig is unsafe in these waters i asked yes i think so where theyre going to drill the sea is almost two hundred metres deep about the limit for north star certainly the public can be made to see it that way fishermen particularly if the result was heavy oil pollution result of what i demanded what the hell are you suggesting a strike on board that for a start theres never been a strike on a seagoing rig not that ive heard no not yet not a proper one he drew slowly on his cigarette what did you think i meant anybody who can arrange for a mans house to be deliberately set on fire you were never in northern ireland were you anyway they didnt know the little girl was in the house would it have made any difference if they had he shrugged watching the smoke curling up from his cigarette you send those four norwegians ashore and replace them with our men he said quietly thats all you have to do i shook my head garrards warning clear in my mind its not a strike youre calling its something else isnt it he raised his eyes and stared at me is it your future youre worrying about he didnt wait for me to reply but went straight on youre wrong when you say theres never been a strike on a north sea rig there was one last october but the contractor managed to keep it out of the papers they were scots mainly so he flew in two new drilling crews all americans there was a fight on board and one or two men got hurt but he got the strikers off his rig he was smiling quietly to himself the only trouble is nobody will work on the rig now except foreigners so it costs a lot more what rig was that never mind what rig weve infiltrated several drilling teams as a result weve got our foot in the door of three rigs maybe four if north star accepts our men as replacements for two roustabouts whove got into trouble ashore then why do you want your men on board my ship he looked at me hesitating then he said i told you north star is an old rig and unsuitable for the north east atlantic if it breaks loose and drags the threat of a disaster at sea is always news and we get a chance to publicize our demands on grounds of danger drillers would be glad of some publicity on rates of pay the public thinks even a roustabout gets paid a fortune he doesnt he works twelve hours on twelve hours off and every other week hes ashore he doesnt get paid for that so you have to divide his weekly pay packet by two and your men will ensure that the anchors drag is that it he shrugged theyll probably drag anyway but youre going to make sure they do i stared at him who was he this cold hard little man always working in the background thats sabotage he didnt deny it all he said was nobodys going to get hurt how do you know how can you possibly know when youve seen the size of the rig youll realize its out of the question but it will make the headlines and then villiers will be seen as a capitalist gambler operating with obsolete equipment in dangerous waters its not your neck youre risking i said nor yours the flat hard voice was suddenly sharp you send those four norwegians ashore and replace them with our men thats all you have to do i shook my head my hands sweating my body cold inside theres something more isnt there that reference to northern ireland he was coldblooded enough for that too there has to be something more or you wouldnt be going to all this trouble he stubbed out his cigarette not for you not as weve planned it he was watching me and now the squint had a strangely menacing quality so that i had the feeling that it was this slight physical disability and it was only slight that had warped him mentally a pay dispute a halt to operations that would focus attention on the rig and if we can involve villiers directly so much the better then if the rig drags at the moment they strike oil he shrugged a lot of ifs but the seismic survey completed just after villiers took the company over makes an oil strike a strong possibility he was talking quietly but there was an urgency in his voice his mind locked on his plans then we could have a major environmental disaster and villiers would be branded as a man intent on making millions by cashing in on oil without any regard to the environment or to the fishermen who earn a living by the sea and he added emphasizing his words hes tailormade to our purpose he paused then stubbing out his cigarette ive told you more than i intended but you would have to know in the end and its better that it comes from me so that you understand what is at stake his head jerked forward something else you should understand nothing not you or anybody else is going to stand in the way his hand came down on the locker beside him nothing you hear this ship of yours and you the master of it well never have an opportunity as good as this again youre on charter out here for three months in less than a month nobody will even notice youre there youll be accepted as part of the scenery he got to his feet the first hole will take about five weeks to drill thats our information ill send the replacement crew and the equipment well need out by a local boat in about three weeks time i reminded him that mrs petersen was responsible for crew replacements you wont get her to accept your men but he brushed that aside shell have no alternative sandford will see to it that your norwegians dont get their work permits and with the pressure well be putting on the fishing community no shetlander will volunteer i was standing facing him then a deep void inside me a small insignificant little man with a cast in his eye and i was afraid of him deep inside he had me scared who are you i asked him a name didnt matter but where had he come from what was his background his face was blank not a muscle moved that skipper said your name was stevens even a name might make him seem more human alf stevens the voice so quiet and that thin smile it might just as well have been bill smith you realize the police know im here an inspector garrard from london theyve nothing against you they have my record a dossier several files he laughed its like i told you the past sticks with you theres no escape and with brutal frankness he added they cant charge you not unless our witness talks and he wont do that so long as you cooperate all right he looked at me oneeyed the left squinting off into the corner where i had been sitting now if youd sound two blasts on your siren he turned to the door then so sure of me apparently that he didnt need an answer it was that absolute blind assurance that turned my fear of him to anger two steps and i had him by the shoulder spinning him round my face close to his i could sail out of here straight to aberdeen and hand you over you could indeed his face was without expression no fear nothing my word against yours and political power behind me you can try it if you like but you wouldnt win therell be fifty or more men on that rig you expect me to endanger their lives i told you nobody is going to get hurt he took my hand from his shoulder looking at me as though i was somehow to be pitied take after your father dont you how do you mean i think you know youve been making enquiries i know he was brought out of norway he was compromised and afterwards he shrugged rehabilitation can be a long process not many survived i stood there rooted to the spot what are you trying to tell me my voice sounded strained my mind gone numb hes alive is that what youre saying he looked at me intently would that make any difference he asked softly but i was too surprised too shocked to say anything suppose you were able to talk to him i couldnt believe it i didnt want to believe it those lines from browning the little plaque its not true i heard myself say and there was a tightness in my throat its not possible he laughed i think your inspector garrard would tell you differently and he added his voice gone hard again but you cant go to him can you he knows too much about you you cant go to the police anybody so you do as we tell you otherwise youll never know another moments peace and thats what you want isnt it to be left alone he nodded well after this you will be so long as you cooperate he stared at me a moment then turned and went out of the cabin i heard him ask henrik to sound two blasts the sound of his footsteps in the gangway and i stood there unable to move unable to think i didnt go to the bridge until i heard the fishing boat alongside he was already on board he turned and looked at me and then he disappeared into the wheelhouse and the boat pulled away from us i watched as it steamed down ham voe the tonktonk of its diesel echoing back until it disappeared beyond baa head it was past six then and the crew were already feeding i had mine on the bridge alone and afterwards i went to my bunk but i didnt get much sleep and at we got our anchor and left foula for our rendezvous with north star part two the rig chapter one there was no sign of the rig when we arrived at the location shortly after on sunday th april the decca ship was lying hoveto ahead of two marker buoys in line the danbuoys marking the position of the eight anchors were already laid spread uniformly round the drilling site which itself was marked with a yellowflagged buoy all the danbuoys had lights i steamed within hailing distance of the decca ship and asked her skipper when the rig would arrive you on standby he was a small man with a bright red woollen cap on a round bullet head last i heard the eta was but shell be later than that the tugs underpowered for the job and even with the two supply ships towing they made barely a knot and a half yesterday the wind veering may help theyll be anchoring at night then sure they will and that could be a fine ballsup so keep well clear unless they start hollering for help only a few weeks ago i fished one poor bugger out it was black as a crows arse and when we did get him we found the anchor hawser had taken half his head off you tell your crew to watch those boys doing their stuff on the flatiron decks of the supply ships then theyll realize what cushy jobs they got he grinned waving and turning back into his bridge the cook was standing at the rail below me and i heard him say aye but theyre in town several nights a week not stuck out here for three bluidy months his name was flett and he came from orkney we could hear the rigs radio traffic but none of it voice and shortly after midday we picked the blip of it up on our radar by then the sea had gone down only a slight swell the wind was southeasterly light visibility good and about an hour later she began to come up over the horizon the shape of her grew very slowly and we lay wallowing in the swell playing cribbage until late in the afternoon the decca ship steamed up alongside and asked us to take station four cables on her port side to form a gate leading to the location marker buoys by then the rig was standing out of the sea like a colossal steel water beetle her size accentuated by the fact that she was riding high on her four torpedoes which had been deballasted to within about twenty feet of the surface she was still more than two miles away and as we moved into position a last watery gleam from the setting sun shone on the high antenna of the drill tower the name north star showing clear on the side of the platform she was turning now very gradually to enter the gate against the tide our radio picking up the barge engineers instructions to the two supply ships and the tug which was already dropping its tow north star to bowstring as soon as we are in position over ze marker i tell you then you leave rattler to hold us and lay out ze first anchor is it roger north star is number two anchor ze virst one a dutchman by the sound of it and in that last gleam we could see two figures on the helicopter deck one with a walkietalkie to his mouth as he acted as towmaster roger out and then the other ships captain youre relying on the tide to hold her but suppose we get a crosswind ze forecast is good so ve lay anchors vast and everyzing okay is it is it the voice crackled with emphasis you dont have to lay the bloody anchors in the dark mate then ve lay them again tomorrow if zey are no good the dutchman replied imperturbably and much fainter another voice see they lay them right first time pieter i dont want any holdup when the drilling crews the voice faded but something in the crispness of it made me wonder if that was villiers standing up there beside the barge engineer i remembered reading some years back that he had had a narrow escape when the prototype belonging to a small aircraft company he had acquired crashed while doing landing and takeoff tests he was the sort of a man who would get a kick out of being on the spot at the start of a new venture the lurid gleam of sunlight vanished the rig moving ponderously dusk came fast with low cloud rolling in the huge structure abreast of us twenty steel columns riding high on submerged pontoons with the derrick a latticed finger thrusting at the overcast the ruby glow of its warning lights giving it a festive air decca to north star north star to rattler our bridge radio crackled with instructions as the rig a blaze of lights now approached the tiny pinpoint of the location buoy it was night before north star was in position and bowstring the smaller of the two supply ships closed sternon for her towing hawser to be let go the time was an arc light swung as the rigs crane moved one of the crew clinging like a fly to the deck rails hand on the heavy hook guiding it into the eye of an anchor pennant the brontosauruslike head of the crane reared up to lift the anchor clear of its housing on the underwater section of the column then bowed downwards as bowstring backed in men moving on the flat deck of the supply ship balanced on the stern just clear of the roller reaching out with gloved hands to connect the pennant to their winch hawser and the mate standing with his walkietalkie to his ear i had closed in to watch how it was done the crane head rising again and bowstring pouring a white froth from her stern as the winch roared the pennant dragging at the ton anchor till the big shackle at the top of its stock came clear of the water held hard against the fat round barrel of the sternroller the heavy clamp secured by a strop to the bulwarks was snapped on the men on deck shackling on the long pennant wire attached to one of the threeton anchor buoys and a winch drum high up on the corner of the rig paying out cable as the tow began out to the pinprick light of the anchor position marker rising and falling in the swell it took almost an hour to lay that one anchor the men on the supply ship never still moving so nimbly as their flat craft wallowed with its load that they looked like ballet dancers on the lit stage of the after deck by midnight the second anchor was down and rattler released from her tow had joined bowstring the crane in almost constant motion as it fed pennants and buoys to the two of them and all the time we lay hoveto and rolling just clear of the anchor cable lines our radio tuned to the walkietalkie talk there was only one hitch and that was towards dawn north star to duchess close in to no ve haf no anchor jammed and are zending divers down two divers in wet suits with aqualungs on their backs were lowered by crane in a steel cage their torches shining like sea luminosity as they swam around the column housing of no the pennant wire had wrapped itself round one of the anchor flukes and we lay there with the rig towering above us while the pennant was cleared and dropped and a new pennant shackled on the anchor hoisted clear by an auxiliary winch on the rigs deck it was daylight by the time that last anchor was laid and the rig held by all eight winches under correct tension bowstring was already over the horizon rattler hulldown both on their way back to aberdeen the decca ship had gone during the night only ourselves left now a lone trawler keeping watch around the rig it was and i handed over to johan and turned in i had hardly closed my eyes it seemed before a hand was shaking me and henriks voice said the rig has sent a boat for you it was an inflatable rescue boat with one of the divers at the outboard motor an italian with dark curly hair and thin olive features issa mr villiers e wanta speak wiz you it was a bumpy ride and the boat driven at speed and the northerly breeze kicking up small waves only snatches of talk possible his name was alfredo and he was one of the divers who had been down clearing the anchor issa very cold si where is my ome it is milano but not in a long time i mean he had been in the north sea for two years now before that in nigeria si i have a wife and two bambini thosea boys they are growing with a scotch accent white teeth flashing with laughter and the bows dropping as we swept in under the giant piershadow of the rig the slop of waves against the columns the swirl of the tide running and then the rusty iron of an endless stairway embracing a column and rising to the distant glint of sky high above you go to toolpushers office they tella you where is mr villiers okay even though the ballast tanks had been blown and the torpedoshaped pontoons sunk from the towing to the drilling depth of almost sixty feet i reckoned it was well over fifty feet from sea level to the helicopter deck i came out just beside the monstrous drum of no winch the toolpushers office was a steel shack the entrance leading off the helicopter deck and behind it was the pipe deck piled high with pipe steel casing drill bits all the ironmongery of drilling some tons of it beyond the pipe deck was the steel skid for lifting pipe to the derrick floor and reared above it like an enormous pylon the derrick tower itself i pushed open the door of the toolpushers office and a leatheryfaced man wearing a bright red peaked cap looked up from the girlie picture mag he was reading behind him was a complicated diagram with the emergency indicators for blowout prevention of course they would have precautions and that diagram so detailed so comprehensive i stood there for a moment staring up at it pipe rams blind shear i cant remember all of them but four or five failsafes each with a red warning light to beam out its danger signals once action had been taken with all those safety measures there did not seem much danger of a dragging anchor causing oil pollution you looking for somebody the man in the peaked cap was regarding me suspiciously mr villiers i said more than anything else the sight of that diagram brought home to me the nature of this colossal machine the complications of operating deep under water and deeper still into layers of rock below the seabed offhandedly he directed me to the barge engineers office this was one deck down into the crews quarters right opposite the ballast control room i caught a glimpse of an engineer seated at an enormous console full of pressure gauges and the whole wall facing him taken up by a diagram panel with red and green lights flanked by ballast indicators that looked like giant temperature gauges then i was into the office and two men were standing at a table in the corner poring over a large design sheet their white safety helmets perched on a pile of books they turned as i entered and one of them a short bulky man with hair that stood up like a brush and very blue eyes in a crinkled sunworn face folded the design leaning on it with his hands he wore a faded anorak over a grubby tshirt the other was dressed in a skyblue sweater with the clean collar of a white shirt showing above it and neatly creased immaculate trousers he was taller thinner with livelier features you the skipper of that trawler he asked i nodded and he held out his hand vic villiers his grip was firm his eyes on my face summing me up a long night eh i had just turned in i said sorry about that how would you like to be running one of those supply ships i think i might have a nervous breakdown he laughed youve never seen a rig laying anchors before no nor had i fascinating there was an undercurrent of excitement in his voice this is pieter van dam he turned to the man beside him god knows how many times hes done it eh pieter and not an ulcer in his belly the dutchmans stolid face broke into a smile as he made an exaggerated effort to pull in his protruding stomach the ulcers only come ven you begin losing lifes is it well youre not losing any here there was a subtle change in villierss manner the smile gone and the moment of humour with it youre off on the first flight arent you ill see you before you go he gave a brief nod of dismissal and turned to me sit down he waved me to one of the chairs drawn up round a low table littered with empty coffee cups and oil industry magazines the door closed behind the dutchman and we were alone the room was stuffy full of stale cigarette and cigar smoke the glare of fluorescent lighting i was nervous and suddenly very tired the allpervading hum of machinery a soporific you wanted to see me i murmured he was standing there staring at me and i wondered whether he suspected anything is it about the work permits if it wasnt about the work permits we had a report of course putting to sea like that was a little highhanded the sort of thing that upsets the locals but he was smiling as he sat down opposite me ive had fuller open an office in scalloway now hell fix it for you in any case you dont have to worry about work permits here he stretched out his legs leaning back the light on the dark stubble of his jaw what did you think of fuller by the way i shrugged what the hell did he expect me to say hes a good man from your point of view no hard feelings what about his hand had moved to the table long sensitive fingers beating a light tattoo that charter he pulled a fast one on you didnt he i imagined it was your idea to buy the mortgage well that much of it is to your advantage so long as you do the job and stay on station he sat there for a moment staring at me not saying anything and i had a feeling he was trying to make up his mind about something the fingers still tapping at the table top youre wondering why i got you over here after weve both of us been up all night his tanned face was handsome almost boyish his eyes dark under dark brows his hair almost black you probably think that because i deal in company finance im not interested in people but running a business or running a trawler its the same thing everybodys got to fit you for instance he shifted a little forward in his chair what made you salvage that boat and then take on a threemonth charter its suitable employment for an old trawler and you like the sea he smiled leaning back again he knew it didnt answer his question but he let it go asking me instead about the salvage and how we had managed to get her off the rocks and repaired in time he seemed genuinely interested it was a side of him i hadnt expected an enthusiasm for physical practicalities and as i tried to answer his detailed questions i began to understand what it was that had induced him to gamble in oil why he was out here taking a personal interest in the anchoring of this rig he had acquired more or less by chance and because he seemed impressed by what we had done i found myself warming to him it was very naive of me but i was tired and the atmosphere relaxed and when he progressed to enquiring about my background it seemed quite natural i suppose i was a little flattered too and because i thought his questions stemmed from a businessmans desire to make the fullest use of anybody associated with him i told him just enough about myself to give him confidence so your stepfather was an industrialist yes a small arms factory that was during the war afterwards he switched to consumer durables and you came over to england to study at the lse and work as a financial journalist but instead of asking me why i hadnt stayed in journalism he began discussing the present economic outlook the fuel situation and the future of the country in a monetary world dominated by the oil revenues of middle east potentates he was even more optimistic than the press or even the politicians believing that offshore oil could solve britains whole balance of payment problems it was a long time since i had talked to anybody of his calibre and tired as i was i found it immensely stimulating so we have this chance to become rich again to change the whole economic climate of the country but what about the political climate will that change and without thinking i said yes the political climate depends on the economic doesnt it and i added conscious that i was now giving form to thoughts that had been vaguely in my mind for some time this is something our political leaders certainly our union leaders have been slow to grasp the mass of the people of course they havent a clue not about economics but the political climate thats different they are the political climate and in some subtle way they sense a change without understanding the cause you really think that yes i do you change the economic climate then the political climate must change too he shook his head i see your point but i cant go along with you its the chicken and the egg the economic climate is dependent on union cooperation no union cooperation no change in the countrys economy maybe thats what they want eh the militants yes i said they want anarchy but thats not what the rank and file of the trade union movement wants im convinced of that he looked at me a quick appraising stare changed your spots havent you the question brought me up with a jolt how do you mean your background he said you missed out on a few details his manner had toughened the friendliness gone perhaps if i tell you an inspector garrard came to see me at my offices in london to warn me about you the tiredness came back a sense of weariness of deflation why the hell didnt you tell me i got to my feet suddenly furious furious because i knew garrard had been right to warn him but to spring it on me like this if you want to break that charter agreement youll have to buy me out youll fight is that it yes i havent spent a month of my life slaving to get that trawler ready for sea but what was the use everything i did all my life that devil stevens had been right the past would always dog me i have a police dossier but how you read it depends whose side youre on i couldnt keep the bitterness out of my voice seeing him sitting there a man who had got himself to a position of power by using money the way a militant like scunton would use a mob what was the difference sit down he said quietly but i didnt move seeing him as representing everything i had fought against and that voice of his so accustomed to command he didnt have to shout it was men like villiers who turned youngsters into anarchists sit down he said again and as i hesitated he added now ive talked with you i have a proposition he waited until i was seated and then he said garrard showed me your file yes and i agree that most of it is open to different interpretations according to whether youre a capitalist or a socialist but it was somewhat alarming from my point of view he paused except for one thing it doesnt explain what induced you to become a trawlerman or why a man with your record of industrial action should commit himself so wholeheartedly to the salvage and management of a vessel for gain thats capitalism by my reckoning he raised his hand no dont interrupt me please and dont look so stubbornly defensive im not going to enquire your reasons i wouldnt get a sensible answer anyway in fact i doubt if you really know yourself whats your proposition i said but he ignored that i have to consider the safety of the men on this rig and thats not all theres a lot of money locked up in the rig itself that would be better employed elsewhere if there were any real risk also of course and this is between ourselves we are very confident that we are sitting on oil right here this minute his fingers were drumming a tattoo again as he stared at me speculatively suppose you were going to sabotage north star how would you go about it the question so abruptly flung at me came as a shock i havent thought about it i told him well i have he said its something all rig operators have had to face up to for several years now indeed everything going on to a rig has to be checked for the possibility of explosives it would have to be explosives wouldnt it pieter van dam and i were discussing it just before you came in abruptly he got up from his chair and crossed to the corner table come and have a look he unfolded the design sheet again it was a drawing of the rigs underdeck layout there and there he said stabbing his fingers on the junction points of the crossstruts two large limpet bombs mines perhaps but if those struts go then the column towers will fold inwards with the weight of the drill tower and all the mud and fuel and pipe we carry he gave me a sidelong glance our achilles heel that and blasting holes in the pontoons why are you telling me this my mouth felt dry you dont have to be an engineer to identify the weak points of a rig like this one he said quietly anybody with any imagination can see it at a glance it would mean divers of course and theyd have to be transported out here by sea youre the guard ship the orders youll be given require you to make sure no vessel comes within the circle of the anchor buoys only the supply ships the crews on those ships have been thoroughly screened he turned looking me straight in the face that leaves you doesnt it that trawler of yours is the only ship that has a right to be here and that im not sure about put like that i could see his point if you dont trust me i said uneasily then youd better find another ship he shook his head as you say its very suitable employment for that trawler of yours youd require compensation and anyway there isnt another in shetland not thats available he turned away and began pacing the room finally he said no what ive got to do is make certain of you he had stopped and was facing me again thats the answer isnt it he went back to his chair and flopped into it drumming with his fingers on the table top vulnerable was the word garrard used youre vulnerable because of an incident in hull theres a suspicion you might have set fire to the house yourself is that what he told you he didnt put it as bluntly but that was the implication he stared at me waiting and when i didnt say anything he went on fuller went into this charter blind knowing nothing about you it was a mistake and now i have to make up my mind whether to employ you or not you werent there by accident were you have you been in touch with the police handling the case i asked yes i phoned hull myself what do they think either you threw that petrol bomb believing the house to be empty or you were there because you knew something like that was going to happen they havent made up their minds but dont imagine theyve closed the case it was almost two months ago the memory of that night blurred and unreal here on an oil rig cocooned in power plant heat the smell of oil and the background hum of the rigs machinery you may not like my record i said but i dont go around throwing petrol bombs but you were there why l i hesitated he had no right to question me but it could be a way of clearing myself with the police so i told him about the meeting i had attended in hull that evening how it was packed with militants most of them brought in from industrial towns farther north and some who had no right to be there at all it was a particularly ugly meeting a union official who had come up from london was howled down and virtually kicked off the platform theyd got pickets on all the shipyard gates a busload of them from the tyne and some from liverpool even the clyde pierson watt were nonunion they whipped themselves up into a mood where they were ready to march on the offices and smash them up and a man kept yelling for them to be set on fire then somebody i dont know who it was just a voice shouted that the foreman was the bugger to get the mood was pretty violent by then half the room on its feet and everybody worked up somebody else shouted ill fix the bastard that was when i left to go and watch the foremans house to warn him i knew entwisle id been mate on a trawler when it was into pierson c watt for repairs but there was no answer when i rang the bell i thought they were all out so you hung around yes fortunately as it turned out and afterwards why didnt you wait for the police why should i nobody was hurt a mans property was set on fire thats arson the fisher maid was sailing at first light and my hands hurt they were cut and slightly burned so you went off on a distant water trawler and when you got back instead of returning to hull you headed for shetland and got involved in salvaging the vessel weve now chartered he smiled shaking his head some people would regard that as pretty strange behaviour but you dont depends what your motives are i think i can guess knowing your background and now that ive talked to you you want to make something of your life before its too late i could help you there i started to tell him i didnt want his help that his whole outlook was entirely opposed to mine but he stopped me of course our outlooks are different youve been switching from one thing to another experimenting with drugs and ideological theories ive kept to one single basic tenet the profit motive you probably abhor that but youre running your own business now youll learn you cant run even a brokendown old trawler unless your cash flow is sufficient to keep the damn thing afloat i stood there silent knowing it was true and that i hadnt considered what would happen when the charter ran out the scrape of his chair as he got to his feet interrupted my thoughts youre an awkward cuss he said i was going to make you an offer a gamble i suppose youd call it i dont gamble i told him no then why did you salvage that trawler he i i was smiling his tanned strangely handsome face suddenly alive im not talking about cards or betting on horses im talking about pitting ones wits and ones energies against the odds in life thats what im doing drilling out here with this rig its what youre doing with that trawler the rigs old and so is your ship both of us taking a chance he turned abruptly towards the door had any breakfast this morning no nor have i he pulled it open lets go and feed ill tell you what i have in mind over our bacon and eggs we went down a flight of metal treads to the lower deck of the crew housing it was hot and airless with the same stale smell of food and oil combined with salt to be found on a ship the shower was running in the mens room the glimpse of a fat white body towelling itself and inside the mess a long aluminium counter with two cooks in white chatting behind it bacon and eggs twice villiers said he handed me a plate try the rolls they bake their own on the night watch the room with its three long barescrubbed tables was almost empty we got our coffee from a machine set between windows looking out to an empty sea the wind had freshened occasional whitecaps breaking across the low line of the westerly swell the barge engineer was there sitting over his coffee with a dutch cigar we joined him and the talk centred on the drilling crew coming in on the first helicopter flight a man named ken stewart would be relieving him the toolpusher was american a hard driver van dam said ed dont waste any time how long before we start drilling villiers asked depends on the zeabed the divers are going down in the bell now if the zeabed is okay then maybe tomorrow pity i have to be in holland tomorrow then you give my love to rotterdam eh and he added better you go today iz full ouse ven both drill crews are ere the bacon and eggs came and villiers began discussing gale conditions up to what wind force the supply boats could keep going and whether the proper tension could be maintained on the anchor cables so that drilling could go on uninterrupted except that he was unshaven it was hard to believe that he had been up all night his voice quick and concise his brain sharp he was brimful of energy and i wondered how many years it would be before he burnedhimself out every now and then i glanced out of the windows but the sea remained empty no sign of the trawler or any other vessel in that cold northern light at last van dam left the whiff of his cigar lingering as villiers reached for another roll how do you ever keep your ship stocked he asked three nights at sea no exercise and im so damned hungry you know the time ive spent on this rig its given me an idea city rents have reached a point where it would pay to build an office block on pontoons and moor it off the coast no rents no rates and with the sort of radio equipment weve got on north star theres not iso much business you cant transact what do you think of that personnel i said drilling i imagine is like trawling its a way of life he nodded his mouth full a week on a week off cant do that with office staff but what about sparks his stint is three weeks its what you get used to isnt it he was silent a moment chewing over the idea sea city the ideas not new of course and there are problems as you say but this rig is obsolete now an easy conversion and if the experiment came off wed do a lot better than the scrap value he glanced at me wheres your wife now youre not divorced ive no idea she was brought up a catholic irish i believe yes communist i didnt answer so you hide yourself away at sea well it would make a nice job for a man like you the first ever sea office block skipper is that your proposition i asked him he threw back his head and laughed a gold tooth showing no not really but its an idea he pulled out his diary and made a note you go and talk to sparks if youve got a girlfriend ring her up tell him i said you could i know a lot about planes nothing about ships or rigs but i got through to frankfurt and sydney yesterday just as quickly as i could from my office in london and with the fax machine scrambling teleprint messages can be made safe he buttered the other half of his roll that reminds me i said id call rotterdam he glanced at the clock over the door and i knew his mind was switching to whatever business deal it was that required his presence in holland you said something about an offer i reminded him he looked at me the eyes shrewd and calculating it was a mistake i had been too eager he smiled are you prepared to stay on station until we finish drilling how long will that be you tell me how many holes we have to drill before we strike oil and ill tell you how long we could strike it first go but if we dont then well go on drilling till we do theres no other rig available not for this year anyway and no other trawler none as suitable anyway did you know that when you told fuller your plans for salvage and took him down to see her he smiled shaking his head no of course you didnt otherwise you wouldnt have been such a fool as to sign that charter he leaned back wiping his mouth and screwing up his paper napkin nor did fuller we only discovered that after garrard had been to see me you looked for a replacement then of course we did but it would have meant delay and it would have cost more on a gamble like this i dont believe in spending a penny more than i have to but if it comes off he looked at me a slight lift is to his dark brows if it comes off ill see you get a fat bonus over and above the charter that good enough for you he wouldnt say how much depends on the strike but large enough to give you a future it also depended on our remaining on station throughout the period of drilling i didnt say anything to him money was the answer to everything hed worked it all out striking a proper balance in that clear calculating mind of his but he didnt have to lie out there in the seas that we should have to face if north star continued drilling beyond the end of the summer well thats settled then he took my consent for granted he was that sort of man so sure of himself i must go now or sparks will be paging me on the tannoy he got to his feet i wouldnt want anybody out there in charge of the guard boat who bears me a grudge he was smiling making a joke of it but then he added just dont try anything randall you look after my interests and ill look after you paternalism i think you people call it but loyalty to one man can be a lot better than owing allegiance to a faceless bureaucracy nobody who has worked for me has ever had cause to regret it okay he nodded turning quickly and walking to the door i watched him as he went out to his appointment over the ether with some executive in rotterdam god how i envied him that selfassurance i got myself another cup of coffee lit my pipe and sat there wondering where it would all end would they strike oil and if they did would i still be here i was remembering what he had said about offshore drilling and the countrys future his incredible optimism by he had said a saving of perhaps ј million in foreign exchange the envy of the world our industry booming our currency the strongest in europe tell that to the men in the shipyards or the docks but he had believed it that bloody overbearing selfconfidence of his and i had been swept along by his optimism into making statements just as wild did i really believe that the political climate was governed by the state of the countrys economy you change the economic climate i had said and the political climate must change too if i were a capitalist knowing what i did of grassroots politics would i back that statement with my own and other peoples money a sudden scurry of feet in the passageway outside and a voice shouted coming in now rod i got up and went out past a door marked sick bay and up two flights into the open where men were already gathering with their suitcases the sun was shining and there was an air of expectancy van dam appeared at my side looking diminished and somehow ordinary in a dark blue suit anda velour hat iz come yet he asked and at that moment i heard it a shadow passed across the pipe deck the roar of engines growing then a rush of wind and dust blowing three men in safety helmets dashed out from the shelter of the toolpushers office the engines died the whip of the rotor blades subsiding to a whisper the passengers began to appear a motley crowd that would only achieve the coherence of a team when they had changed into the rig gear of overalls rubber boots gloves and safety helmets i watched their faces as they passed me piling down the stairway to their quarters somebody dropped a bundle of newspapers at my feet and i saw the headline north sea rig strikebound but as i bent down to see what it said a voice hailed me a short tubby man with sandy hair and a bright yellow sweater remember me glasgow wasnt it i nodded he was one of the clydeside men who had been with me when we had clashed with the police outside the marston yard what are you doing here i asked him im a motorman now and you i told him and he said aye i heard yed gone into trawlers weel ill be off now and get settled in he gave me a quick grin and i remembered his name as he hurried on down the stairway after his mates it was rory rory sullivan he had been a member of the boilermakers union when i had last seen him i turned to look again at the packet of newspapers but it was gone now the helicopters engines were roaring and in a moment it lifted clear of the rig slanting skyward i watched it disappear behind the derrick dwindling to a speck as it headed southeast on the sixtymile flight back to sumburgh head then i went down to the radio room thinking about sullivan and unconscious of the bustle around me the radio room was on the lower deck of the crews quarters and had telecommunications on the door villiers was no longer there only the radio us operator seated at the doublesideband earphones clamped on his head his thumb on the key rattling out a message he wore a white nylon shirt opennecked and with sleeves rolled up his arms and face were pale a cigarette burning in a tobacco tin beside the telex there was a chair at a desk in the corner and i sat down staring at the bank of equipment that filled the far side of the room from floor to ceiling trying to think out what i was going to say how i was to get the information i wanted it was too good an opportunity to miss there was so much traffic going out from north star that it was unlikely anyone would take note of what i was saying and though sparks would probably be standing at my elbow listening it wasnt the same as having my own crew overhear the conversation rumours flying round the ship and endless speculation i was still thinking how i was going to frame my questions when the door opened and two men entered one of them with a sheet clipped to a board well there it is ed two of them so youd better keep your fingers crossed that nobody jams their hand in a winch or gets hit on the head by the kelly he was a soft rather oldmaidish little man with a high piping voice the other was a big hardfisted looking american split em up then willya their room matesll soon tell em enough about your ideas of first aid to keep em outa that lil sick bay of yours the belly laugh was without humour an tell em this lennie anybody starting a strike on this rig swims for it is his voice was harsh and grating one scotch one irish you say jeez he gave a shrug and walked out the sick bay attendant pulled out a bench and flopped on to it taking a pencil from behind his ear and making a note on his pad poor bastards he muttered to nobody in particular edll pass the word to his drillers and theyll drive those boys so hard he turned to the operator as he finished sending and spiked his message any news on sunray ii eds feeling sore about it he knows the toolpusher sparks nodded his eyes magnified by his glasses from what ive picked up so far it appears two of the roustabouts came to blows and were ordered off the rig one of them refused to board the supply ship and his mates stopped work until the order was cancelled so the strikes over the little man got to his feet id better tell ed he wants to know what happened tell him his pal gave in to them thatll put him in a fine good humour and as the sick bay attendant went out sparks turned to me a look of enquiry on his pale face i asked him if he could get me a london number and i wrote it down for him you from that trawler yes i gave him my name he nodded mr villiers mentioned it a girlfriend he said havent you got rat on board its old equipment i said i can talk to you but stonehaven and the gpo are outside my range he nodded again and moved over to the big singlesideband set he had to wait his turn to get through to stonehaven then he asked for the number listening with the phone to his ear while i stood beside him ringing now he said and handed it to me my mouth felt dry the ringing tone very clear then a voice said can i help you and i asked for inspector garrard there was a long pause finally a different voice came on the line im afraid inspector garrard is not available at the moment if you care to give your name and tell me what its about but it was the voice of officialdom abrupt and businesslike and no chance he would understand what i was talking about it doesnt matter i said and handed the phone back to the radio operator not there he terminated the call and hung the phone back on its hook just as well perhaps i have a message for you he rummaged through the papers beside the morse key and handed me a telex sheet inform master duchess of norfolk mrs randall booked on air anglia flight arriving sumburgh tomorrow the dispatch time was given as the previous day but no indication of who had sent it do you know where it came from i asked our aberdeen office he hesitated then said you forgotten to pay the rent or something he was looking at me smiling and i was suddenly reminded of the radio operator on fisher maid his love of gossip i glanced down at the telex again wondering who had sent her to the startrion office and where had she come from london dublin belfast maybe but why she was cityborn she hated the country the sea anywhere that was empty of people she liked crowds intrigue excitement and argument i could hear the quick clatter of her tongue voicing the thoughts of her sharp brain incisive persuasive unstoppable as a gorge full of water tumbling over rock and there had been other times when the celtic lilt in it was gentle as rain the hard tinkle of her words softening to seduction then shed had a lovely voice warm fullbodied christ how was it possible to love and hate a woman at one and the same time do you want me to contact the office for you they may know where shes planning to stay no i said no it doesnt matter fiona in shetland why why now but i knew i knew it in my bones they werent sure of me and they were stepping up the pressure how else would she have known where i was or how to contact me i turned walking blindly to the door and almost collided with the sick bay attendant he handed me a sheaf of typescript standing orders for the guard boat he said ken stewart asked me to give them to you i nodded and went down the passage i wanted somewhere quiet time to think but the quarters were pandemonium with men changing moving to their work stations calling to each other asking questions home news mixed with technicalities like the first day in college and out in the open there were men already on the pipe deck climbing the long stairway to the derrick floor and villiers in the open doorway of the corrugated iron shelter a safety helmet on his head only the helicopter deck was clear and i went and stood near the edge looking down at the whitecaps breaking and the duchess small in the distance rolling sluggishly in the swell what dya think youre doing i turned knowing who it was by the grating voice enjoying a bit of quiet i said before going back to my ship he nodded the hard face breaking into a smile i know who you are then his voice was softer a southern drawl as he held out his hand ed wiseberg mike randall i said okay mike you go back to your ship now youll get no quiet here i got another whirlybird due in shortly ill need the divers boat he shook his head call up your own guys and have em come over for you nobody here i can spare and one other thing the mouth had hardened the tired grey eyes watching me vic told me something about you i want you off this barge and fast theres been a strike on one of the north sea rigs i wont have any trouble like that here understand you stay off this rig an if youve got anything to talk about you talk to me nobody else see ill tell the radio op and ill have him call your boat for you his tone though firm was quite amiable and he smiled as he patted my shoulder good luck then glad i dont have to pitch around out there with you i went slowly across to the massive drum of no winch and started down the long staircase that led into the chill shadowed world below the platform as i descended the sound of the sea slopping against the columns became magnified a hollow eerie sound the crossbracing of tubular girders a visible reminder of villierss words as we had examined the design drawing i reached the bottom and stood waiting just clear of the waves rolling under my feet the colossal deadweight structure reared above me water jetting from cooling and sewer vents the hum of the rigs machinery muffled now it was calm calm for these waters the wind westerly about force i tried to picture it in storm force winds with sixty to seventyfoot waves piling in and breaking i could just see no anchor cable running down the side of the corner column leg and stretched taut as an iron bar what would the tension be with a gale blowing and the anchor over feet down and more than yards from the rig the boat came henrik nosing it into the stairway i stepped down into the centre of it and as we came out from under the platforms shadow i was thinking that perhaps i would rather be on the duchess it might be uncomfortable but in a trawler there was at least freedom of manoeuvre chapter two what exactly the divers found on the seabed was not reported on the air but something caused ed wiseberg to have the rig shifted ten metres to the northwest they did it on the winch cables which meant of course some thirty feet less cable holding the rig on the side from which winds blow hard at the tail end of a depression ken stewart wanted anchors and relaid but with only a single supply ship servicing north star ed wiseberg overruled him he was spudded in by then and finding the going better than expected he needed mud and drill casing and he wasnt going to have rattler wasting time frigging around with the bloody anchors we listened in to it all as ken discussed it with the rattlers skipper sometimes by walkietalkie sometimes on the r t bemoaning the fact that yankee toolpushers didnt know the difference between a semisubmersible off shetland and a drilling barge moored in the shallows of the gulf of mexico its not right jock its my responsibility if we drag but because were drilling he makes the decisions and the other laughing and saying every barge engineer says the same ye canna win can ye they had started drilling on the rd and as april ran into may and the sea stayed calm the danger of the rig dragging receded from my mind it was a glorious spell of weather the wind light and the sun shining day after day except when there was a sea mist often by noon we were stripped to the waist the ship just lyingto or drifting close along the rig with both engines shut down we were saving fuel and a lot of wear and tear during those first ten days in that time we saw only two other ships both small drifters out of lerwick and with the sun moving steadily north the nights were shortening the period of maximum alertness a little less each day it was a pleasant interlude after all the hard work we had put into the ship except for the monotony of it and the continuous racket of the rig the drawworks the big diesel up on the derrick floor never stopped an endless roar that only changed its note when they were using the winches to disconnect and screw on another ninetyfoot length of pipe to the drilling string that was steadily moving down its casing as the bit thrust deeper and deeper into the seabed sediments and added to the racket of the drawworks was the steady continuous hum of the power plant even when we had drifted beyond the circle of the anchor buoys the sound of the rig was almost as loud the noise of it bouncing off the surface of the sea and for me there was the sense of waiting the certainty that this was no more than an interlude pacing the bridge in the dark hours or in my bunk turning restlessly and trying to sleep there was always at the back of my mind the fear that the work permits would be refused or something else would happen to disturb the new life i was trying to build for myself it was the loneliness more than anything else it preyed on my nerves i was so goddam lonely stuck out there beside that steel monster drifting back and forth over the same patch of sea with nobody to turn to no living soul i could discuss it with once i started writing to gertrude but i soon gave it up the things i wanted to say were not the things i could put in a letter and she was so businesslike always concerned about our supply of fresh meat vegetables and fruit rattler was based on aberdeen but periodically the supply ship put into scalloway and then as well as stores there was always a note for me because gertrude had sailed so often in the duchess she understood very well that our chief enemy would be the monotony and emptiness of life out here she sent us ground tackle so that we could amuse ourselves fishing and incidentally augment our food supplies for free she sent out records and the new cribbage board i asked for after henrik in a fit of temper had thrown the old one overboard intending it for fletts head little things were already beginning to assume largerthanlife proportions the atmosphere among some members of the crew moving towards flashpoint then the weather broke and we had other things to keep us busy the wind which had been mainly northeasterly backed into the southwest force gusting low cloud and rain a series of deep lows swept up between us and iceland and we had three fronts pass over us in quick succession after that it was unsettled and with a big sea still running we had difficulty going alongside rattler when she finally came out to us with the stores was the usual note from gertrude i didnt read it until we had finished standing by the supply ship while she hitched herself sternon to the rig below the crane with both springloaded mooring hawsers made fast a woman came to see me today she says she is your wife i was in my cabin then and i stood with the note in my hand staring out of the window the wind had veered a little and increased in strength but i barely noticed it balancing automatically to the swoop and twist of the ship it was hard to imagine fiona in that house by the taing fiona with her pale pointed face the small determined chin the high white forehead surmounted by the black fringe of her pageboy cut and deepsocketed eyes the small mouth that bitter tongue and gertrude big and fair and solid as a rock utterly reliable pity i could not fuse the two of them i laughed at the thought thinking of the result and wondering if it was true that the attraction is towards opposites what these two had got that i hadnt other than a bosom and the means of satisfying me but fiona had meant more to me than that much more she had been a force in my life for a time at is any rate we had met in glasgow at a teachin on che and his place in the selfawareness of emergent peoples i was remembering how she had looked she is nice i think but very nervy she stayed for tea and we talked mostly about you or i think perhaps it is more accurate to say that she do the talking while i listen some of it i do not understand she is i think a most political woman she talk and talk that is the nerves i would suppose is that why you are separated she told me she also told me you are wasting your life in trawlers that you could be a very important man she is a progressive she tells me i could not help smiling at that fiona had been so many things at various times a trotskyist a maoist she had been a member of the wrp the pd now apparently she was a good oldfashioned progressive she want to know how she can get in touch with you i tell her if she wish to write she must send it to aberdeen to go out by the supply ship but she dont agree to that she want to meet you it is not easy to convince her that you are out there for a long time and not coming ashore i think maybe you get a letter from her by the boat after this one what do you want she seems very worried about you for what reason she do not say the last i had heard of fiona she was in dublin but that was more than a year ago and even if she had been working for the ira i doubted whether she would still be with them her allegiances never lasted long there had to be a cause but always something different she had never been consistent except that she was anti the present social order and for her that had always meant the british social order presumably because it was the one she had grown up with and was thus able to identify as the root of all that was wrong in society to claim she was a progressive could mean almost anything but whatever her current cause it didnt explain what she was doing in shetland visiting gertrude petersen and trying to contact me i called up rattler on the r t and asked them to come alongside again before they cleared for aberdeen then i handed over to johan and shut myself in my cabin to compose a letter but to explain fiona to somebody like gertrude was impossible if i could have talked to her but even then it would have been difficult i didnt understand fiona myself we had lived together almost four years in a miserable little tenement house looking up the clyde to the old john brown shipyard there had been times when we were happy together fleeting moments in each others arms or when she was high but mostly i remembered the arguments the overintense voice the relentless pressure of her restless mind i never knew what she took only that it had the effect of soothing her nerves she was very emotional then often lovable with something of the kitten about her even now the ache was still there but none of this could i explain to gertrude twice i started that letter and tore it up then as i tried again lars called to me that i was wanted on the r t it was the rigs radio operator with orders for me to report to the barge engineer on board he can talk to me on the radio he wants to see you personally why he didnt tell me why the metallic voice sounded remote and uninterested if you can get yourself on to the supply ship he says theyll lift you on board by crane okay roger i said johan took the ship in for me and i made the leap from the high point of our bows rattlers crew watching with their fenders out they put me in the net clipped it to the big hook on the end of the crane hoist and i was whisked up to be dumped like a sack on the oilslimed pipe deck beside a pile of stores and new drill bits it was van dams week on duty and i found him waiting for me in the same little office where i had talked to villiers ah zo they get you up all right an no bones broken eh he had a telex in his hand virst you read this he said and held it out to me then you tell me vat it eez all about it was from the startrion office in aberdeen and read inform captain randall standby boat duchess of norfolk we have received notification from the clerk of the crown court in hull that he has been called as witness for the prosecution in a case of arson due to be heard on june solicitors for the crown insist that the witness be in hull at least hours before the case opens and holds himself at the disposal of the prosecution you are to notify eta sumburgh and we will book onward flight confirm please veil the barge engineer enquired as i stood gazing down at the flimsy my mind leaping to the courtroom and the crowns qc questioning me crossexamination would follow and the court listening faces in the public seats youll never know a moments peace it eez an order of the court i do not know the law in your country but i think you ave to go eh i nodded two weeks in just over two weeks i would be in that court a witness and the shadowy figures i had seen running would be standing in the dock facing me scunton would be there others too watching me waiting to hear what i said vat i tell them and i would be under oath how fiona would laugh she had never believed in god she was an atheist and the oath an establishment trick an anachronism harking back to an age of superstition when there was a heaven and a hell and fire and brimstone i think you ave to go is it i nodded yes ill have to go for all the marching and the talk the strikes and demos the system was still the same tell your office to book the onward flight so that i get to hull on rd june accommodation too okay i tell them iz not very nice i think appearing for a prosecution he was smiling sympathetically that is vy i do not tell you over the radio then everybody know kind of you i murmured and conscious of the need to say something that would satisfy his curiosity i added two youths set fire to a house and i am supposed to identify them vandals ja ve haf that in holland alzo too much i went back to my ship morose and silent cursing myself for not having gone to hull directly the fisher maid docked in aberdeen it would have been over and done with then my statement given to the police instead of in open court and no threats nothing they could have done about it now whatever i said one side or the other would hold it against me may ended as it had begun in a blaze of fine weather the days passing in the slow monotony of patrolling back and forth the crew were relieved one at a time and the norwegians stayed fuller had succeeded in fixing their work permits there had been an outcry about it and there was a picture in the local paper of some fishermen demonstrating in front of the startrion office in scalloway gertrude did not bother to send us the national papers knowing the rig was supplied by helicopter anyway we got the world news over the radio but she did send us the shetland times and in the issue of th may there had been a short paragraph stating that mr ian sandford of the root stacks hotel burra firth had acquired the hamnavoe fishing vessel island girl built in he now intended to use her for supplying oil rigs operating off shetland gertrude had marked the news item and in a note to me she said think this is possibly why we have had no more trouble from him on the evening of nd june the day before i was due to leave for hull the drawworks suddenly went silent they had started pulling pipe shortly after noon and rattlers skipper jock eraser told me over the radio the rumour was it was a dry well this was confirmed when bowstring came on the air to say she had cleared aberdeen and her eta would be around hours next day i went on board the rig shortly after the drawworks were running again and sparks told me they would be lifting anchors and moving to a new location just as soon as they had cleared the seabed the helicopter that would take me to sumburgh was not due until i left my case under the sickbay attendants desk and went in search of ed wiseberg i found him down on the spider deck with ken stewart and several others they were standing just inside the pump room in front of a big steel cabinet equipped with a tv screen the picture was vague a flickering image of some white object that wavered uncertainly guess well have to trim again ken the angles still wrong the barge engineer went over to the pumps and stood considering the mud tanks rising in bulky curves behind him he stepped forward pressing levers holding them as the pumps hissed ed wiseberg was at the console of the tv cabinet the picture shifting the object becoming clearer as he adjusted the position and focus of the camera on the seabed the atmosphere was tense electric with frustration and concentration through the open door i could see the spider with its girders slotted in to the deck structure and the guidewires leading down into the depths it was the retrieving tool that showed up white on the tv screen and they were trying to stab it over the top of the casing which protruded through the main guide base this was on the seabed and the casing had already been cut about twelve feet below the mgb i chose what i thought was a suitable moment to tell ed wiseberg i would be gone for a few days but he ignored me his face like granite his eyes on the screen jeez we nearly got the bugger then a little more ken forard again yeah forard a little starboard too i watched as they juggled with the positioning of the rig the casing suddenly quite clear on the screen the retrieving tool seeming to float above it occasionally a fish swam in front of the camera it was just after that tool and casing merged the white engulfing the black the toolpusher was on the phone ordering the hydraulic rams to be closed and in a moment the whole rig was shaking as the drawworks laboured to break the casing out a sudden jolt the big diesel up on the derrick floor changing into high gear running fast now and everybody smiling ed wiseberg put the phone down with obvious relief looks like well make the first flight after all he was smiling looking pleased goddam your bloody regulations he said to me at that depth what in hells it matter if we leave a bit of pipe he put his hand on my shoulder where you making for when we get ashore hull i said oh yeah i remember youre a witness eh well mebbe we can have a drink together in aberdeen christ i could sure do with one right now he turned in to the workshop a tired man moving slowly we bin juggling with that damned retrieving tool since four this morning itll be good to get home youre married then he nodded twentytwo years and you i told him and he said yeah well i guess theres not much difference between trawling and drilling some women can take it some cant enid and i weve lived so many goddam places we got married in tampico she had one boy in curacao the other in edmonton the two of them are just about grown up now so she gets lonesome at times why dont you retire then i asked him retire he pushed his hands up over his eyes pausing and staring round him as we reached the changing room full of oilstiff overalls and safety helmets a litter of discarded clothing yeah mebbe i will one of these days but i bin drilling all my life i dont know he shook his head smiling quietly to himself theres always the next hole you see right now we drilled a dry one next time next time we strike it eh he grinned and pushed open the door to the quarters i gotta change now see you on the chopper but i didnt get a chance to talk to him on the helicopter he slept all the way to sumburgh and on the air anglia flight to aberdeen he sat with ken stewart he was two seats ahead and i could hear his harsh grating voice they were discussing the new breed of anchorless drill ships that maintain station by computerized control of a dozen engines ken stewart was a much younger man he had only come into the oil business when the north sea started up but ed wiseberg with his experience it seemed strange that he was content to operate on an old rig like north star his wife was waiting for him at dyce airport a thin fair woman in a bmw i watched them greet each other perfunctorily and drive off i was the only one booked to newcastle and from there i caught a train arriving at hull in time for a late meal at my hotel the strike was over it had been settled almost a month ago but the shipyards were still working overtime to catch up before turning in i went for a walk there was not much traffic about the streets almost deserted it had always been a quiet place after about ten oclock i thought a walk would help me work things out but my mind seemed disorientated by the sudden switch from the endless empty sea to the atmosphere of a big town i must have been tired for i slept heavily that night and i had barely finished breakfasting in my room when the phone rang it was edward hall of morley hall the solicitors he wanted me to make a statement to the police as you were not called at the committal proceedings before the magistrates a copy of your statement as additional evidence will have to be served on the defence before the trial and if i dont make a statement i asked then you will have to be subpoenaed i see on the presumption that you are a willing witness i have arranged with the police id rather see you first i said he tried to press me but in the end he arranged to see me in his office at two oclock i had only just put the phone down when the desk rang to say a detectivesergeant gorse was asking for me i saw him in the lounge a big man with a slow not unfriendly manner now mr randall you recall the night of th february we wanted to interview you then but you know that there was a mild note of censure in his voice youve had a somewhat isolated job recently but i presume you know were holding bucknall and claxby on remand that was the decision of the magistrates court and the case is being heard in the crown court tomorrow they are charged with arson i nodded you were there and you saw what happened i was there i said you broke into the house got the entwisles little girl out and handed her over to one of the neighbours a mrs fenton then you vanished from the scene i was a mate of a trawler sailing at dawn we know that and we radioed the fisher maid to say we wanted to interview you but when you landed at aberdeen you booked out on an air anglia flight to shetland under an assumed name why i dont have to answer that no but its something youll certainly be asked in court if we had known where you were he pulled out a notebook settling himself in his chair no matter we got a committal and now if i could have your statement im seeing mr hall this afternoon he frowned but his manner was still mild as he said dont you think youve delayed long enough and when i didnt say anything he added now lets start at the moment you arrived in washbrook road what time was that i shook my head a statement to the police was official and irrevocable i didnt want that not yet if you dont mind sergeant ill leave any statement im going to make until ive seen mr hall he hesitated reluctant to leave it at that it would save a lot of time ive already spoken to him and explained that i prefer to see him first he sighed and put his notebook away getting heavily to his feet as you wish his tone was distant and there was a hardness in his eyes as he stood looking down at me i think i should tell you we know about you hotheads meeting in the congregational hall youd be wiser to make a statement now he hesitated and then with a sudden burst of feeling he said dont be a fool randall dont try and shield those bastards little amelia could have been anybodys child yours mine anybodys he turned abruptly as though regretting his outburst and went out through the swing doors walking quickly time passed slowly for me that day i had nobody to talk to nobody to turn to and like a fool i put off going to the trawler owners office to collect the pay and bonus due to me i couldnt face it i didnt want to have to talk to people i knew and with only myself for company my nerves were on edge when i finally had my interview with hall he was a small deceptively quiet man in a grey check suit and at first i thought him rather lightweight he went through the police report of what had happened that night his voice quick and very quiet almost a mumble he had been in court all morning and i got the impression he was reading it as much for his own benefit as mine they had all the details even the time i had arrived in washbrook road where i had stood and i sat there feeling dazed conscious that i was being involved in legal procedures and still uncertain what i was going to do it was an untidy mustysmelling office most of the space taken up by the oversize mahogany desk at which hall was sitting behind him were dustylooking shelves stacked with books ledgers and files i think it was the books and papers that gave the place its musty smell the windows were shut against the noise of the traffic deed boxes some of them open lay strewn around on the floor but though the office was untidy and archaic the desk in front of me was equipped with the latest tape recorder phone and intercom hall came to the end of his reading and looked across the desk at me he had taken off his glasses and was polishing them gently with a very white handkerchief there was a lull in the traffic the room suddenly very quiet his eyes fixed on me and i found myself swallowing knowing this was the moment of decision i had had all the time between corses visit and this meeting in which to think about it for much of that time i had remained in the hotel i had been expecting scunton or one of the others certain they would fry and pressure me or at least appeal to my brotherly feelings but nobody had come they had left me strictly alone hall leaned forward were you listening while i was reading that yes of course you didnt comment his voice was crisper now then i take it you accept the report as being correct more or less what does that mean that you have reservations he didnt wait for me to answer and his words had a bite to them as he went on you realize your absence hasnt made it very easy for the police in the magistrates court they had to rely on the depositions of other witnesses in your absence these could hardly be conclusive but the magistrates were satisfied that there was a prima facie case and because a childs life had been endangered they committed the accused for trial at the crown court he paused looking at me over his glasses well now you are here lets try again is that account correct i hesitated in the main it was so what else could i say but yes he nodded thats better he looked at the report again you notice there is no reference to the reason you were standing there in the dark watching the foremans house also of course nobody knows what you may or may not have seen prior to the moment you broke down the door and got the little girl out he stared at me the silence dragging and his long hands stretched out on the desk in front of him now i am going to ask you three very simple questions his voice was quiet but very determined his eyes fixed on mine i want answers to those three questions and i want the truth i suppose it was the reference to getting the little girl out but all i could remember as i faced the hard stare behind those glasses was the sergeants voice that morning shaken by the violence of his feelings as he said she could have been anybodys child yours mine anybodys ill tell you the truth i heard myself murmur he nodded briefly just answer yes or no please first question were you waiting in the dark because you suspected an attack would be made on entwisle or his family or his property yes you saw the petrol bomb thrown can you identify the persons who threw it through the window my voice sounded thin and remote as i answered yes and they are the accused you will see in the dock tomorrow harry bucknall and john leonard claxby yes good and now one final question you realize of course that you will now be the chief witness for the prosecution that if we succeed we will be putting two dangerous young men behind bars i hope for a long time i know something of your background and it could be that you will be under considerable pressure not only from some of the men you know in this port but also from within yourself when you are in the witness box will you give the same answers to those questions that you have given me here i hesitated but there was no turning back now yes i said good george sayre will be acting for the crown and hell be glad to know weve got a statement out of you at last particularly as lawrence mendip is defending a willing witness is always better from counsels point of view and after that he took me through the events of that night writing the statement out in longhand when he had finished he read it through to me made a few alterations and then called his clerk and arranged for it to be typed while this was done i waited in the outer office it took about half an hour and then i was in his office again reading it through finally i signed it he rose then holding out his hand to me a flicker of warmth in his eyes i realize this has been very difficult for you but truth is something absolute a rock on which the conscience of man can rest secure his words as i set them down sound pompous but they did not seem so at the time and then he went on a copy of your statement will have to be served on the defence as additional evidence and i should perhaps warn you that lawrence mendip has something of a reputation but then he added quickly of course sayre will have established everything by then and crossexamination can never shake a witness who is telling the truth he smiled encouragingly as he showed me to the door i think you will find it all very simple and straightforward ill expect you at the guildhall at ten tomorrow morning a brief nod and i was in the outer office going past the counter down the stairs into the crowded street walking back to my hotel my mind was on tomorrow and the court wanting to get it over now tomorrow one day in my life and once that was behind me it would be finished the past everything i could forget about politics the tortuous twisted minds that had shattered so many of my ideals i could concentrate then on simple material things i was thinking of the duchess still riding out there beside the rig and gertrude downtoearth matteroffact with not a political thought in her head how much simpler life would be if one were not involved that evening i had an early meal and went out to the cinema a man followed me but not anyone i had ever seen before and when he sat a few seats away i knew i hadnt imagined it and that it must be the police keeping an eye on me the film was an old charlie chaplin and to laugh at the eccentricities of human behaviour did me a lot of good back at my hotel i had a quick drink at the bar then got my key and went up to my room i hadnt been there more than a few minutes when the phone rang and a mans voice said there was a woman in the lobby asking for me i thought for a moment it must be a reporter but he said no she wasnt anyone from the local press and she wouldnt give her name i think i had a premonition then tension gripping me as i asked him to describe her i knew who it was before he had even finished all right i said tell her to come up im not sure that would be wise sir she seems a bit disturbed better if you see her down here its my wife i said there was a pause and then he said very well ill send her up there was a click and the phone went dead leaving me standing there my nerves taut so this was why they had laid off me they were relying on fiona it was so typical getting at me through her why didnt they come themselves did they think after all these years she still meant something to me there was a knock on the door a light almost hesitant tap i opened it and she was there in the passage facing me her eyes enormous she smiled it was a tentative flicker of a smile that betrayed her nervousness come in i said and the tone of my voice was not exactly welcoming she came in moving slowly as though uncertain of her reception her face looked very white the pageboy cut was gone her jetblack hair swept back from her forehead and falling to her shoulders it made her look more feminine it also accentuated the pallor of her skin that and the little black coat she was wearing the long sensitive fingers poking out of the sleeves white with blue veins showing i closed the door and for a moment we stood looking at each other in silence finally i said what do you want she tossed back her hair a new gesture to go with the new cut thats a fine way to greet me the smile was suddenly easier her nervousness receding arent you going to kiss me and when i didnt move she laughed it was a brazen excited sound she was enjoying the drama of the moment and i knew she had taken whatever it was she took i could see it in her eyes in the sudden changes of mood the loss of control i used to be able to turn you on just like that she clicked her fingers her mouth wide open laughing at me were both older i said you may be she said tartly im just the same she slipped the coat off and threw it carelessly on the bed her movements as sensual as they had always been and the little pale blue dress very effective in revealing the slim boyish shape of her body the small firm breasts what do you want fiona she turned her voice low as she said what do you think and she came slowly towards me her lips parted the white teeth showing and her hands held out to me we can talk later i saw it in her face then she really did want me and i was shocked after almost six years she came close her body touching mine her hands moving stop it i said why should i her face was lifted to mine her eyes staring up at me irises and pupils merged to form dark pools and she whispered my poor mike youre starved i took hold of her arms pulling them away and pushed her down on to the only chair now stop it i said just sit there and control yourself and tell me why youre here you fool she said softly you stupid fool and suddenly she burst into tears theyll get you you know theyll get you who will they they you dont expect names do you how long since you were in ireland ive never been involved with the ira who then cfj and she spelt it out for me community for freedom and justice what is it leninist trotskyist maoist another of those splinter groups operating under the is umbrella she shook her head tears in her eyes as she stared up at me i came to warn you about what who sent you nobody you know i went all the way up to those islands the shetlands looking for you so i gathered she wrote to you did she she said she would the tears were drying on her cheeks and i sensed another change of mood coming she smiled whats she like that woman she stared at me then burst out laughing dont tell me youre running her trawler on the basis of pure altruism its a business arrangement i said now please explain a business arrangement she giggled and me thinking its in love with her you are because why else should a man spend weeks at sea if not to build up enough steam to close his eyes and make an image of beauty out of a big blonde blowsy lump of a girl her fat buttocks strapped into patched denims her big bosom encased in shetland wool i slapped her then not hard but enough to stop the spate of words she gazed at me wideeyed you are in love with her would it matter to you after all this time it might i shook my head were finished you knew that so why did you go to shetland who sent you she didnt answer and i reached down to her bag which was lying on the bed beside her coat she tried to take it from me but i pushed her away shaking the contents out on to the coverlet what are you doing her voice was high a little wild there were no instructions nothing in writing but she had money five ten pound notes and some ones where did you get these my job what is your job she turned away none of your business i caught her by the shoulders and swung her round so that we were face to face somebody paid your fare to shetland paid you to come down here who she stared at me woodenfaced was it a man called stevens i dont know any stevens i described him to her and i saw the flicker of recognition in her eyes but she wouldnt admit it let me go youre hurting how long were you in ireland its my own country were you in ulster i caught hold of both her shoulders shaking her is that where you met him but she only shook her head whats his real name i dont know i dont know who you mean i came because you were in trouble and behaving stupidly whats it matter that a mans house was burned down the insurance company pays it had to be burned a warning men like that men who stand in the way of progress you cant reason with them you have to force them to see sense she pulled my hands from her shoulders holding them tightly you must understand mike its like ireland nobody listens to reason until you make them stormont the b specials all the everlasting persecution of catholics nobody likes bombs but without bombs nothing would have changed and a lot of innocent people would still be alive all the old arguments that had bust up our marriage then it had been wildcat strikes and pickets using force now it was bombs if the cause is right oh yes i know the end justifies the means even if the whole fabric of society is destroyed and the people with it she began to cry again cant i make you understand dont i mean anything to you any more her grip on my hands tightened her fingers interlaced with mine please mike dont do it for your sake for mine do what dont shop those boys they did their duty thats all youre a witness for the prosecution tomorrow all you have to say is that it was too dark to be certain who did it it doesnt matter what you told that lawyer man this afternoon tomorrow when youre in the witness box how do you know i saw hall they had the offices watched hall came back from lunch sharp at two you were there a little before you left about threethirty theyre convinced whos they she stared at me the community the organization the militants if you like whats it matter who they are theyre organized they know what they want and how to get it i dont have to tell you that surely and they stick by their own people you shop those boys tomorrow and theyll nail you scunton and his crowd she shrugged im just warning you thats all they thought it was your doing when those boys were arrested that youd shopped them thats why i went to the shetlands oh yes youre right my fare was paid all expenses i was to talk you into a more sensible view of things it never occurred to me you wouldnt be coming ashore that the petersen girl she let go my hands turning quickly away and starting to gather up the contents of her bag when she had put them all back she got into her coat well thats it mike ive done what i promised ive warned you who did you promise myself she smiled a little sadly chiefly myself i know we argued a lot and fought but it was good while it lasted at least it was for me wasnt it for you she stared up at me a wistful look wasnt it mike and when i didnt say anything she gave a snort youve changed a sea change my god and i loved you i loved you you fool and with sudden violence she shouted at me go on shop them ill be there in court to see you do it so will others shop them you bastard and see what happens she turned so abruptly that the skirt of her coat swirled and i watched her storm out the door banged behind her i sat down on the bed the room suddenly empty and nothing to do but think about tomorrow with the smell of her scent lingering and her words of warning still in my ears chapter three the guildhall was in alfred gelder street and when i arrived there a crowd of about a dozen had gathered around the entrance mostly students by the look of them somebody called out thats him and they surged round me i dont recall what they said only their hostility it was an unpleasant experience and the uniformed constable on duty had to clear a way for me the courts were on the ground floor and the witnesses in all the days cases waited in the corridor time passed slowly occasionally as police went in and witnesses were called the door to the crown court momentarily opened and we caught a fleeting glimpse of the darkpanelled interior it was just short of eleven when the usher came out and called michael randall i got up and followed him into the courtroom to take my place in the witness box standing there the testament in my hand and repeating the oath i had a clear view of everybody the judge sayre a tall thin man looking dignified in black gown and wig the massive bulk of counsel for the defence the two men in the dock bucknall his pallid freckled face framed by long hair and wearing a suede jacket over a gailycoloured shirt constantly shifted his feet his eyes downcast claxby much tougher an older heavier face with a drooped moustache and long sideburns stared back at me sullen and watchful the clerk finished administering the oath and there was a general stir as people settled themselves i glanced up at the public gallery most of the seats were filled the back of the court too i saw scunton there several others i recognized and fiona i think she smiled at me but i couldnt be sure it might have been a nervous fluttering of the mouth you are michael mouat randall sayre was on his feet facing me across the court his brief all his papers on the desk in front of him quietly crisply he took me through the events leading up to the moment when i had stood waiting outside no washbrook road and you walked from the congregational hall to washbrook road yes was it a dark night yes pretty dark raining in fact a light drizzle when you left the hall the meeting was still in progress i nodded how long did you have to wait before the bomb attack took place less than half an hour you were standing in the shadow of some bushes at the entrance to an area of waste ground known as the stonepit you remained in that position all the time without moving until the light in the porch was broken yes he reached down for a sheet holding it and looking at the judge milord i have here a plan of this section of washbrook road also copies for the jury it shows the distance from the gate of no to the bushes where the witness was standing as fortyseven feet it also shows the distance to the nearest street lamp this is on the opposite side of the road twentytwo yards from no and thirtyfive yards from the witness all measurements taken by a member of the surveyors office who also prepared the plan he handed the sheet to the clerk who passed it to the judge and copies were distributed to the jury sayre turned back to me was there any light on in the house not in the house there was a light on in the porch it was the first thing they broke but you were able to see who they were you recognized them yes are they here in court i nodded the witness must answer so that we can all hear the judge interposed sayre looked at me and i said yes would you point them out to us please i indicated the prisoners in the dock and he nodded we have already heard from another witness that they parked their car in neighbouring ellsworth terrace presumably they were on foot as they approached no yes was it the street light that enabled you to identify them no they were on the opposite side of the road to the light the same side as no they had their heads turned towards the houses i think they were probably checking the numbers so at that point their faces were in shadow when did you positively identify them when they opened the gate to no an earlier witness who had picked them out at an identity parade has admitted under crossexamination that she could have been mistaken if she could be mistaken how is it you are so positive because the light from the porch was full on them they had their collars turned up but from where i was standing its a lie claxby was thumping the edge of the dock hes lying i was never there go on please sayre said ignoring the outburst from where you were standing from there i had a clear view of both their faces as they turned in at the gate what were they wearing cloth caps and raincoats both of them yes can you describe their clothes in greater detail the raincoats were rather shapeless and one of them had a muffler no particular colour i think it was bucknall and his cap was in some dull check anything else not that i recall who broke the light in the porch claxby and who threw the petrol bomb claxby i said again and he yelled at me from the dock you bloody liar i was never there an you know it you threw that bomb youre just trying to cover a policeman grabbed him from behind there was a scuffle and then quiet as lawrence mendip moving with remarkable speed for such a heavy man began whispering to him urgently in an icy voice the judge said i must warn the prisoner that if he interrupts again i shall have him taken down to the cells he leaned a little forward over the high desk addressing himself directly to claxby outbursts such as you have just made tend to leave a bad impression on the jury proceed mr sayre and so it went on sayre taking me step by step and in great detail through those few vivid crowded minutes and all the time at the back of my mind was the thought of claxbys outburst and by the time you got the child out the neighbours had already gathered yes three of them i think two women and a man and you handed the child to mrs fenton i didnt know her name but one of the women yes did she say you must wait for the police no i think the man said that why didnt you i was mate on a trawler we were due to sail at first light and my hand was cut by the broken glass i wanted to get a dressing on it thank you thats all and he sat down there was a rustle of movement in the courtroom the sound of feet shifting and people coughing lawrence mendip was on his feet standing with his head bent staring down at his papers his head came up and he was looking at me his eyes small and very sharp you say it was a dark night a light drizzle i think you said yet you saw the faces of these two young men very clearly in the light from the porch it was only a few yards from the gate to the porch and as they went in through the gate did you move to get a better view of what was happening not immediately not until i heard the bulb break but you didnt show yourself no not then and you didnt call out you didnt try to stop them i wanted to see what they were going to do if i had known and when the bulb was broken it was suddenly quite dark then how did you know it was claxby who broke the bulb there was still the light of the street lamp across the road oh yes the street lamp a single bulb lamp not a fluorescent standard and his back towards you are you sure it was claxby quite sure i felt easier now it was like all the courts i had been in before the defence trying to shake the witness on matters of detail i had reached a point where i could look over the hedge as claxby came out of the porch did he try the door i dont know all i saw was him coming out of the porch and going round to the window yes where was bucknall he was already facing the window his back towards you yes there is virtually no difference in their height bucknall is five foot ten and claxby five foot ten and a half how tall are you five foot eleven and what were you wearing a blue raincoat and a cap a seamans cap so according to your evidence there were three of you there all about the same height all dressed roughly alike you say you were in the road peering over the hedge and there were these two figures standing in the little garden facing the window and you say claxby threw the petrol bomb how do you know it was claxby i saw him come from the porch the two of them were standing together for a moment they seemed to be arguing then bucknall took something from the pocket of his raincoat and handed it to claxby could you see what it was it looked like a bottle youve heard the phrase a molotov cocktail would you say it was that type of a bomb i imagine it was something like that a molotov cocktail is a very simple form of petrol bomb it has a wick in the top of the bottle this has to be ignited who struck the match im not certain i think it was probably bucknall since claxby was holding it but you cant be sure no at that point they were crouched down so claxby might have set the bottle on the ground and lit the wick himself yes in fact it only needs one man to ignite and throw the thing is that right i thought he was trying to establish bucknalls partial innocence and i said yes not seeing it as a trap you have identified the accused as the two figures crouched in the front garden of no did you know their names at that point or have you only realized who they are since you decided to give evidence no i knew who they were you had seen them before in fact yes could you tell us when you had seen them before i explained that i knew bucknalls father and had seen them together several times that i didnt know claxby but had seen him at the meeting was bucknall at the meeting yes what was he wearing i didnt notice but he was there yes and claxby he was there too yes what was he wearing a leather jacket you particularly noticed that i saw what he was wearing he began asking me about the meeting then about the atmosphere of it and why i was there and you had a hostile reception i was shouted down anybody speaking moderately in fact you left the meeting and went straight to washbrook road thinking somebody was going to attack the entwisles or their house wasnt that a somewhat extraordinary supposition to arrive at you werent at the meeting i said you mean if i had been i would have done the same he didnt expect an answer for he went straight on there is of course another interpretation that could be put on your behaviour that you went to washbrook road for the precise purpose you impute to the accused that you went there with the purpose of proving you were as militant as the others at that meeting i saw what he was driving at then and i said sharply are you suggesting i had something to do with the attack i am his massive jaw thrust suddenly forward i am suggesting that you are lying that all your life you have been trying to prove your militancy thats what your record suggests well doesnt it and before i could think of an answer he had picked up a sheet from the desk in front of him and was reading it out he had been very thoroughly briefed for he had it all there all the convictions everything and when he had finished he turned to the judge milord i think you must accept that this is not exactly a normal witness if he were he would have waited for the police or at least come forward when he knew they wanted to question him the judge nodded you are i think suggesting that the witness had a motive in not coming forward is that it that is exactly it milord i am not only suggesting he had a motive im suggesting his whole testimony is a tissue of lies he swung round on me his heavy jowls quivering and his finger pointing im suggesting that you threw the bomb that you went to washbrook road with that intention with a bottle of petrol in your pocket that you broke the porch bulb that you lit the wick and threw the bomb through the downstair window i stood there gripping the brass rail shocked into numbness and remembering fionas words remembering too the words flung at me on the fisher maid in aberdeen i had been warned but i still couldnt believe it nor could the judge he leaned quickly forward his voice quite sharp as he said am i to understand that you are accusing the witness yes milord im saying the police made an error when they arrested the prisoners they should have arrested randall furthermore i intend to prove it are you also saying he did not save the little girls life no milord im saying that he thought the house was empty when he threw the bomb but the little girl heard the crash of broken glass and when he saw her face at the upstairs window he panicked there is no other explanation of his subsequent behaviour avoiding being questioned by the police abandoning his job with the trawler fisher maid and vanishing under an assumed name mark you to the remotest part of the british isles to shetland most of this had been addressed to the jury not to the judge now he swung round on me again isnt that the truth i put it to you that you threw the bomb saw the child got her out and then fled you dont believe that i said it was such an incredible reversal of the truth you cant believe it but i knew my voice had failed to carry conviction i was too appalled by the deadly reasonableness of it the certainty that the net was closing sayre was on his feet youre just trying to confuse the jury you cant prove that youve absolutely no oh but i can prove it mendip turned to the judge again milord since the accused were before the magistrates court very vital additional evidence has come to light a new witness the judge asked yes milord a man who has only recently come forward rather like the witness here the judge nodded making a note and counsel for the defence sat down the courtroom stirred and i stood there remembering halls warning about mendips reputation his crossexamination could not have ended more dramatically and though sayre reexamined me trying to nullify its effect by drumming home the identity of the accused it was obvious that the jury everyone were now waiting upon the defence my evidence closed the case for the prosecution by then it was lunchtime the court adjourned and as i stepped slowly down from the witness box i heard sayre saying to mendip thats an old trick and a very dirty one if i may say so and the other laughing and patting his shoulder as they went out together hall came across to me i was feeling slightly sick by then the stuffiness of the place and my stomach knotted he cant prove something that isnt true last minute evidence like that you did much the same and the defence not sure how damaging your evidence would be not damaging enough apparently anger was taking hold overlaying the nervous tension to them it was just a game these lawyers bustling past with their wigs and their briefcases full of their own damned importance wait here will you ill just have a word with counsel in the robing room hall left me and i stood there feeling suddenly conspicuous as several members of the public came out of the courtroom and then fionas voice at my elbow i warned you mike i told you theyd nail you i looked at her the high forehead the thin crimson mouth in the pallid face i tried to warn you she said again yes you did didnt you my hands were clenched tight if they think theyre going to get me shut away in a bloody prison for something i didnt do and fiona clinging to my arm and saying mike for gods sake listen get away now while you can while youre still free run for it what else you wouldnt listen and now theyve got you her fingers tightened on my arm get out now her voice was urgent nobody is watching you theres nobody to stop you but after this afternoon is that what youve been told to do scare me get me on the run so that truth becomes a lie no no mike youre wrong thats not the reason i just dont want to see you in prison i dont want you convicted for something you didnt do if you know it then the court will know it i had to believe that oh my god she cried you bloody intellectuals you never understand until its too late do you truth isnt some sort of knightly armour truth is what determined people persuade others to believe she looked at me a moment and i thought how that had been at the bottom of so many of our arguments but to believe that was to believe that man was a soulless servile creature without dignity i think she misread my silence for she said how can i make you understand her hand was on my arm the nails digging into me they dont care about those two boys theyre expendable its you theyre after but i didnt believe her im not that important i said i never was you know that but if those two are convicted its intimidation thats what you idiot her grip on my arm tightened intimidation who cares whether it was intimidation its that trawler they want the target is north sea oil now were hitting at the oil companies hitting at capitalism where it hurts where its most vulnerable and with the sort of headlines she stopped there and i said villiers but her mouth was a tightshut line get out now she breathed urgently go while you can youll be safe then i laughed with the police after me better the police than a bomb or a shot in the back i stared at her shocked by her words so you were in northern ireland why else would her mind run on bombs and murder youre crazy i said seeing the wildness of her eyes and the distortion of the pupils your imagination always did run away with you when you got yourself oh my imagination is it her voice was high and strident and you accusing me of being drugged thats what youre saying isnt it you always accused me of that when you couldnt think of anything else to say when youd lost your temper as well as the argument her tone had become venomous god it took me back one day she breathed darkly ill tell you why i do it then mother of god maybe youll understand she was staring up at me breathing heavily but why should i bother why the hell and then in a quieter voice just so long as youre out of the way thats all that matters she said it like somebody in a dream but when i asked her what she meant she shrugged and turned away go to hell she said in a choking voice and dont say i didnt warn you and she left me then walking listlessly down the corridor it was almost empty now i watched her go thinking about what she had said theres nobody to stop you but after this afternoon i was still thinking about that wondering how she knew and who had sent her when hall returned he says well just have to see what the defence has turned up but what about the other witnesses i demanded im afraid they didnt stand up too well under crossexamination i told you mendip had something of a reputation old mrs rogers from no became a little flustered and confused she was wearing glasses and mendip concentrated on that finally getting her to admit her sight wasnt all that good especially at night sayre didnt press her very hard on reexamination he was relying on you and what about the witness who saw them park their car a young man standing against some railings with his girl friend its not conclusive and mendip leaned on him heavily getting him to admit that he was otherwise occupied he thought they went into washbrook road that was all and he was vague about the time so it was as stevens had said my word against that of his new witness i asked hall who he was but he didnt know better get yourself some lunch the court resumes at two i think at that stage i still believed sayre could dispose of a witness i knew to be lying but when the court resumed and i saw the man in the dock i wasnt so sure his name was edward bradshaw a pale rather gaunt man with thinning hair and a hesitant slightly earnest manner he claimed he had watched it all from the front room of no prompted by counsel he gave his evidence in a quiet voice that had hardly any trace of a local accent and his evidence was totally different from mine no he had not seen either of the accused that night there was only one man in the garden across the road and he added i remember quite clearly he stood up suddenly from a crouched position and i saw his arm swing back then he threw something and the window shattered i thought it was some hooligan heaving a brick then the flames started leaping and spreading the curtains caught fire and i saw the little girls face at the upstairs window counsel stopped him there youre certain only one man was involved definitely and you saw his face not in the garden but when he came up the street you saw him in the street light thats right he was the same side of the road as me then and i saw him plain as well very clear i was a bit nervous laike so i was watching him and thinking he might never mind what you were thinking counsels voice cut in quickly do you see him in this courtroom hes raight there behind you he lifted his arm his finger pointing at me thank you thats all lawrence mendip sat down sayre did his best to discredit the man under crossexamination bradshaw admitted he was not the owner of no or even a visitor he had happened to be passing had seen the gate open and had gone in out of curiosity i think you said you were actually in the house when observing what happened at no opposite how did you get into the house well the back door was open you see so you entered the house out of curiosity thats raight where were you when you saw mr randall pass under the street light in the front room doing what just looking round casing the joint would be a more accurate term wouldnt it there was a moments silence and then sayre said this is not the first time is it youve been caught breaking and entering before i didnt steal anything not a thing you cant pin that on me an i wouldnt be here but for a sense of pooblic duty when i read that these two young men had been accused for something they never did you admit you went into that house with the intention of thieving just looking for some spare cash thats all youd do the same i wouldnt wonder with five kids and no work because of the strike he was facing towards the jury then not sayre all raight i would have taken any cash left lying about i admit that but if some fool leaves his door open he turned back to sayre in answer to a question no i never used force on it the door was open i tell you and then i was in that room in the dark when i heard his footsteps that man he nodded towards me i didnt know what he was and then standing in the shadows opposite naturally i watched to see what he was up to thats how i saw what happened an thats the man sitting there sayre was able to show that in one particular bradshaws evidence was inaccurate the curtains could not have caught fire because mrs entwisle had taken them down for cleaning two days before he also got an admission out of him that he had served a sentence for theft but he could not shake him the man stuck to his story and the fact that the occupants of the house were away and that he had entered with intent to commit a felony seemed somehow to make it all the more convincing it explained his reluctance to come forward it made his presence in the witness stand at the risk of prosecution an unselfish act that called for some sympathy not disbelief reexamining counsel for the defence was able to drum these points home no other witness was called neither of the accused gave evidence and in his first words to the jury mendip emphasized that though they might have reservations about accepting the evidence of a man who admitted he had once been convicted for theft they had to bear in mind that the main witness for the prosecution had also been in prison though for different reasons so you have two witnesses two entirely different statements both given under oath they are absolutely contradictory you are not required to decide which is the truth all that is required of you is that you determine whether in view of the fact that there is no satisfactory evidence to support either testimony you can possibly convict these two young men both protesting their innocence i say you cannot you cannot convict when doubt extreme doubt you may feel has been cast on the case for the prosecution the judge in his summing up took a similar line but less firmly and with some reluctance of one thing there is no doubt the witness michael randall entered the burning house and rescued amelia entwisle at some risk to himself if the other witness is telling the truth then you may reasonably ask yourselves why he did not attempt to rescue the child himself or at least to offer assistance to the man who did after all once he was out of no he ceased to be a trespasser and became just a passerby there is therefore no reason at all why he should not have gone to randalls assistance instead according to his evidence he remained concealed a watcher taking no part offering no help you may feel that only proves him to be a nervous perhaps frightened man at the time or you may feel it indicates that his testimony is false are you to believe him or are you to believe randall it is not easy for the jury when the two main witnesses are suspect one of these men is a liar and it is for you to decide which but then he added however this is not your prime responsibility your prime responsibility is to the prisoners are they guilty or not guilty here doubt alone is sufficient if such conflicting testimony raises a doubt in your mind a reasonable doubt then you must give the prisoners the benefit of that doubt but if you accept randalls testimony then there is no doubt just as there is no doubt about his rescuing the child you will now retire and consider your verdict the jury were out barely ten minutes they found both the prisoners not guilty and there was a murmur of approval from some of the public and as the judge dismissed the case and ordered the prisoners to be released a constable appeared at my side i was hurried out of the building by a back entrance and into a police car i wasnt taken back to my hotel i was driven instead to hull central police station and put in a room with a uniformed constable i didnt argue i think i was too shocked by what had happened i have always differentiated in my mind between law and justice the law is part of the establishment the rules by which the system perpetuates itself but strangely i had always respected british justice the laws might be wrong but within the limits set by those laws i believed british men and women did dispense justice now a lying witness suborned to pervert the course of justice had led judge jury and lawyers by the nose convicting me there in that court though i was not on trial and fiona had known she had warned me you shop those boys and theyll nail you she had known that justice like truth could be turned upside down an image in a distorting mirror and i hadnt believed her i had let slip the opportunity to escape convinced that justice could recognize truth and sayre hadnt even recalled me to the witness stand the rules of the game did not allow it instead he had thrown in his hand and in doing so had branded me a liar the door opened and an officer in plain clothes came in and sat down at the table opposite me he had the usual form name please and he began filling it in as i answered his questions and when that was done he said are you prepared to make a statement my statement is in the court records but that wasnt good enough for him he wanted a completely new statement and he cautioned me are you going to charge me he shrugged that will depend on your statement in any case its not for me to decide and so i went over it all again and he wrote it down laboriously in longhand then took it away to be typed when he returned and i had signed it i said i want to speak to inspector garrard and i gave him the slip of paper with the number on it i think hes a special branch officer he looked at it and then at me its unusual so is what happened in court today i told him angrily ill see what i can do he nodded to the phone on the table well put it through here if we get him he left me then and i was alone in the room maybe i could have walked out but it never occurred to me i was too busy thinking what i would say to garrard if they managed to get through to him it was a long wait and then suddenly the phone rang and i picked it up inspector garrard yes randall i said you told me to ring you go ahead i began to explain what had happened in court but he said i know all about that what is it you want to tell me i told him then about the man calling himself stevens how he had come on board the fisher maid in aberdeen and then about the second meeting when we were anchored off ham in foula the name meant nothing to him but when i had given him a description i thought i detected a sudden interest you say its villiers hes after not villiers personally but his reputation its the rig chiefly what can he do to the rig i tried to explain but sitting there in an office in a police station the rig sounded very remote the loneliness of the sea area west of shetland impossible to convey and then i asked him about my father is he still alive do you know have you any reason to believe he is only that you were right when you said he was brought out of norway in the duchess picked him up and stevens implied that you would know there was a moments silence what exactly did he say ill x that rehabilitation is a long process and not many survived i think he was referring to men returned to russia after the war what else nothing except he suggested it might make a difference if i were able to talk to him but you havent no of course not otherwise i wouldnt be asking you for confirmation that hes still alive there was a pause then he said i cant answer that im not sure and then i heard him murmur reflectively he couldnt possibly hed be too old too old for what i asked him but all he said was no its out of the question and this man stevens wheres he operating from i dont know and you dont know his real name a faint sound like a sigh came over the line well ill have the local police check on sandford at least we know where to find him but another long pause and then he said look ill be honest with you i talked with detectivesergeant gorse youre suspected of committing perjury when was your meeting with this man stevens weeks ago wasnt it well wasnt it and when i admitted that it was over six weeks ago he said then why the devil didnt you contact me before i tried to i said i rang the number you gave me from the rig but you werent there you could have left a message his voice had sharpened youre in trouble and you cant blame me if im left with the feeling that youre trying to use me to get yourself off the hook i gave you my number on the chance you might find yourself involved in subversive activities and be prepared to give evidence what youve been telling me isnt evidence its supposition based on two conversations conversations that may be no more accurate than the evidence you gave in court i started to tell him that my version of what had happened that night was the truth but he cut me short then why didnt you make a statement to the police you knew they wanted to interview you i reminded you of that when we met and he added i also said you were vulnerable but that hardly applies now he rang off then and i was left with the certainty that he hadnt believed a word i had said it was some time before anyone came once i opened the door and looked out into the corridor but the desk was at the end of it and no hope of slipping away unobserved at last the plainclothes man came back you can go back to your hotel now i got up wondering what that meant you accept my statement then its being considered but youre not detaining me youre requested to notify the duty officer here of your destination on leaving your hotel thats all for the moment he opened the door for me and i walked down the corridor and out past the desk into the street i was free for the moment while they made up their minds garrard hadnt believed me nor had sayre so why should they at the railway station i bought a copy of the hull evening paper it was there on the front page crown witness accused and inset a picture of myself being mobbed as i entered the guildhall that morning they were waiting for me when i reached the hotel a reporter and a photographer the flashlight snapping and questions being fired at me i started to brush past them but then i stopped it was a moment to fight back a chance i might not have again i took them up to my room and made a statement accusing bradshaw of lying of perverting the course of justice accusing scunton and others i didnt name but militants who had no connection with hull or the shipyard strike of intimidation and the object of it all is the offshore rigs you find a man calling himself stevens a man who has probably had a hand in the irish troubles hes the man behind it all and i described him to them but i could see they didnt believe me the vulnerability of offshore rigs was too remote the whole thing too fantastic and the bitterness i felt it was in my voice and that was against me too the reporter didnt even bother to write it all down i couldnt blame him he was a local reporter interested only in local news and what i was telling him must have sounded wild and unconvincing in the mundane setting of that hotel bedroom in the end they left and i flopped on to the bed feeling utterly drained i must have fallen asleep for i woke suddenly with the light from the street lamp shining on my face a door banged the sound of voices loud from the bar i looked at my watch it was past ten i got up stripped and had a bath then i packed my case wrote a note to the hotel manager instructing him to send the account to the startrion office in aberdeen and went out leaving the key in the door i had less than ј in my pocket the lobby was empty now except for the night porter behind the desk and a man sitting by the entrance with a paper on his knee i watched him for a while he wasnt reading the paper and i didnt think he was a guest he could have been waiting for somebody but he looked more like a man on duty there was a garage at the back of the hotel and after a little searching i found the door leading out to it it was not far to the central station and a couple just leaving the forecourt of the royal station hotel gave me a lift as far as melton it took me a further two hours and three separate lifts to reach the al near pontefract but a little after two in the morning i was in the cab of a longdistance container truck bound for musselburgh chapter four i think it was the trawler i worried about more than myself as i sat slumped in the heat of the drivers cab thundering north up the al perhaps i clung to her as the only reality left to me so that my mood of depression was overlaid by a sense of urgency what had happened to me in hull had made me realize i was dealing with people who did not make idle threats it was dawn when we arrived in musselburgh i got a bus into edinburgh had breakfast in the station buffet and caught the first train to aberdeen the startrion offices were in one of the solid residences near mansfield road not far from the river dee dock some attempt had been made to modernize the place but the effect was makeshift as though the company were on a temporary lease and might move out at any moment there was a telex machine in the outer office and a big fair girl at a typewriter i told her who i was and asked her to book me a cabin on the night boat to lerwick dont you have a return ticket by air she asked you cant just walk on to a flight i said but it was the closer check at dyce that worried me the isolation of the sumburgh terminal nobody stopped me boarding the boat and in the morning when i disembarked at lerwick i didnt see a single policeman it was as though with the release of those two men they had lost interest in me i was so anxious to see gertrude and get back to the trawler that i didnt stop to consider there might be another reason i grabbed a taxi and drove straight to taing the air was luminous with a light drizzle the hills all green and the lochs limpid not a breath of wind the sun broke through as we came down to the voe no trawler now and the house solitary and alone the stonework glistening with moisture i think i knew she wasnt there before we had even reached the house it had an empty deserted look no answer to my knock and when i tried the door it was locked nobody locks their door in shetland unless they are away i tried the back but that too was locked and then i drove to scalloway i hadnt seen fuller since that night i had taken him down to view the duchess he was wearing the same dark business suit and looked like a fish out of water in that little port he had taken over two rooms in the local hotel his only equipment a telex a telephone and a filing cabinet lying on the desk in front of him was a copy of the hull daily mail my picture staring up at me and the headline crown witness accused so you know what happened ive read the report you had the local paper sent up specially no it came in the post yesterday since then ive been trying to get a skipper you mean you didnt order that paper it came unsolicited he nodded sit down he said ive also been trying to contact mr villiers it doesnt concern villiers but he didnt agree hell have to be told and now that youre here perhaps youd like to give me your version then ill know what to advise him when i get through advise him what do you mean we have a contract but i saw by the look on his face he had made up his mind wheres gertrude petersen i want to see her and i want to get back on board where is she she left on a trawler yesterday evening after she had read the report she insisted she must get out to you showed it to her i didnt have to shed seen it already do you mean somebody had sent her a copy too but all he could tell me was that she had had the paper with her when she came into his office after lunch now if youll fill in on the details for me he sat there waiting his hands folded across his stomach his stolid heavy face impassive i gave him my version of what had happened and some indication of what was behind it finally i said somebody wants me out of the way and they want that contract scrapped so that youre in the market for another standby boat he didnt say anything his face blank have you been offered a replacement he leaned forward staring down at the paper as though weighing the headlines against what i had told him you think the rig is in some sort of danger is that it yes i said but i could see he didnt believe me any more than that reporter or garrard he leaned back his eyes staring beyond me it could be said youre the real risk and reading this report his thick fingers dabbed at the headlines is it true your father was a russian agent he was suddenly looking straight at me who told you that an inspector from special branch the softness of his voice had gone as he added well is it true i wouldnt know i said i never knew him but you he murmured your record he was frowning shaking his head i dont know what to say if i believe you he paused still frowning but it doesnt make sense it would be very difficult to tamper with a huge structure like north star certainly not if the guard ship is doing its job and he added thats my difficulty you see and yours isnt the only trawler available not now you have been offered a replacement then he smiled oil companies are always being offered things at a price the smile vanished his lips pursed but if there is the remotest possibility of danger to the rig then the price becomes irrelevant and another thing i have to bear in mind is that your view of what happened in court or rather what was behind it is not likely to be the police view they could arrest you at any moment in fact im surprised they havent done so already they cant arrest me out there i said they cant board my ship in international waters youre employed by us he said sharply and we would facilitate any action the police might decide to take he got abruptly to his feet leave it with me now randall ill have a talk with mr villiers and well see where we go from there all right i didnt argue there was no point come back after lunch he said opening the door for me ill let you have our decision then the door closed and i went down the bare wooden stairs the drizzle had lifted the sun glimmering through i crossed the road and walked to the pier where a couple of purseseine fishing boats were unloading their catch gulls wheeled screaming and the water calm i lit my pipe leaning against the rail and letting the peace of it soak into me that deep instinctive feeling that this was where i belonged all that had happened was of no importance then obliterated by the sense of familiarity the feeling of contentment and then i heard the fishermen talking and reality broke in again they were talking about their rights in the fishing grounds chased off like that what right have they got any more than us just because theyre a bluidy oil company aye we should have told the bastards to go to hell and the skipper leaning on the bulwarks and saying what dyou expect me to do risk a collision he was a broad bigbellied man in a shetland jersey with a brown beret on his head shes bigger than us ill report it but i doubt if the council can do much its the government in london they want oil they dont depend on fish for their living a bitter laugh the slam of a box and a voice saying aye that they dont and now theyre drilling off this side of shetland soon well be ringed by oil rigs fenced in like a lot of puir peerie sheep time the council took note of us the skipper nodded theres a meeting tomorrow and ill be there so will a lot of others were not the only boat i turned away my peace of mind shattered politics couldnt i ever get away from politics i went in search of some food knowing that it could only have been my own trawler they had been cursing shortly after two i was back in fullers office he had spoken to villiers and had orders to get me back on board the duchess dont ask me why he sounded annoyed i tell you frankly it was against my advice but hes got troubles of his own so maybe he doesnt want to be bothered by a little matter like you and your trawler the london papers had arrived and he had the daily telegraph in front of him open at the city page all right then he was looking down at the paper not at me and i had the impression that his mind was on other things the taxi will be here shortly to take you to sumburgh theres a helicopter flight leaving about four oclock you passed on what i told you for what its worth yes what did he say he looked at me then what did you expect him to say with this hanging over him and he slapped the paper shetland is a long way away and what seems important to you will be looking a lot less important viewed from an office in the city with the pack in full cry but just remember this any trouble on the location and youre out ill get replacement guard boats on my own responsibility and if the police decide to arrest you dont try and rely on the fact that youre in international waters i wont stand for that ive enough trouble dealing with fishermens complaints without getting involved with the police we come under the law is that understood you may accept that you come under the law i said but others dont ill wait for the taxi downstairs and i turned and walked out of his office the anger and bitterness back why the hell couldnt somebody just for once let me get on with the job of running a trawler and making her pay i was seething all the way to sumburgh my mind turned inwards so that i no longer saw the peace of the hills no longer felt i had come home again and then in the little airport building at sumburgh i bought a copy of the daily telegraph and saw the mess villiers was in the details are not important though i had plenty of time to study them as the helicopter rattled noisily northwestward out to the rig tailormade to our purpose stevens had said and now i could see it for myself the man was being accused of assetstripping for his own personal gain and the full glare of publicity was being focused upon him all of it adverse he had acquired startrion through an investment company managed by vfi startrion had then been broken up and the assets sold off these sales with one exception had been to companies unconnected with himself the exception was the oil assets consisting chiefly of the north star rig and the licences to drill in blocks and these had been acquired by a nominee company controlled by vfi and the price had been fixed by villiers himself rigged was the word used by a solicitor acting for one of the investment companys major shareholders villiers had issued a statement to the effect that the price had been based on an independent assessment of the breakup value of north star that his decision to operate the rig on the startrion licences had been taken in the countrys best interests and that it was being financed by his own company and was a total gamble he was quoted as saying to commit the funds of an investment company managed by vfi to such a gamble would have been most improper in the circumstances no value can attach to the licences west of shetland and i consider the breakup value of such an old rig the only real basis for disposal it was a specious argument or seemed so to me as the helicopter slanted down to land on the rig for there it was not in the breakers yard but out in the atlantic a hive of activity with the drawworks roaring and the drill biting steadily into the sedimentary rock deep under the sea as i ducked under the turning blades i caught a glimpse of the duchess out to the northeast standing guard like a sheepdog between the anchor buoys and three shetland boats she was rolling gently in the swell the bridge windows intermittently reflecting the late afternoon sun then i was in the shelter of the toolpushers office and a thick dutch voice was saying ach zo you ave com back eh van dams hand gripped my elbow i am glad he told me alfredo was waiting for me with the divers inflatable and he added that young woman she is not tough enough it needs a man like you out there those shetland boats are a dam nuisance they ave no business fishing zo close the shetlanders dont see it that way i said they claim theyve a right to fish where they like not inside the buoys too dangerous you get them out of ere okay it was on the tip of my tongue to tell him that there would be trouble if we got too tough but his relief had arrived and he was being called to board the helicopter i waited until it had taken off and then went down the iron stairway to the waiting boat with the sea calm it didnt take long to reach the duchess nobody greeted me as i climbed on board no sign of gertrude and johan staring at me from the bridge windows like a bear in his den i yelled for the cook tossed him my bag and told him to get me a mug of tea i was in a filthy mood as i went through the gangway and pushed open the door to the bridge wheres gertrude johan stared at me as though i were a stranger he didnt reply and lars at the helm looked straight ahead both of them woodenfaced cant you answer when youre spoken to she is in there he jerked his head towards the rear of the bridge then fetch her out i saw him hesitate but the habit of shipboard obedience was strong and he turned towards the companionway dont bother ill go myself i had control of myself then and conscious of the mood on board and who must have caused it i didnt want to face gertrude there in the bridge in front of the crew she had taken over my cabin her things strewn about and she herself lying stretched out on my bunk her eyes closed but she wasnt asleep i was sure of that there was a tenseness about her a feeling of hostility in the air i stood there looking at her not saying anything and the anger building whos there she said at last you know damn well she opened her eyes then but she didnt look at me she lay there staring up at the steel plating over the bunk and i knew she was holding herself in ive seen fuller i said then why are you here she sat up swinging her long legs off the bunk she was dressed in sweater and slacks her hair a mess and her eyes redrimmed i was expecting somebody else who i dont know he said hed find somebody for me a replacement skipper ja it was either that or scrap the contract she stared at me why did you do it risking lives burning a mans house why i thought at one time all you wanted was a trawler something to work for but it isnt that is it its politics disruption anarchy nothing else its all you care about destroying things the words poured out of her in a sobbing breath who sent you that newspaper my voice sounded cold and i felt cold cold with anger that she should believe it of me somebody sent it to you who does it matter i started to tell her what had happened in court i wanted her to understand but she brushed my explanation aside what do i care about what happen in that court its all there in the newspaper report and that girl fiona i dont believe what she tell me i dont want to believe but now now i know what sort of a man you are she gave an angry shrug and she is your wife you dont tell me you have a wife so that was it my god i said do i have to share my private life with you she is your wife you live together for four years now when you want to be rid of her i was across the cabin then grabbing her by the shoulders and shaking her you stupid little fool i was beside myself with anger shed infected the whole ship the crew everybody against me get your things packed i told her i want you off this ship now this evening she stared up at me her body rigid her eyes wide with disbelief is my ship and mine i reminded her i was bending down staring her in the face my hands gripped on her shoulders i cant run this ship with you on board not unless i have your confidence understand slowly her gaze dropped well she hesitated i dont think she wanted a row she wasnt an aggressive person emotional yes but she was also very practical and this had the effect of concealing her emotions if mr fuller has confidence in you still it was villiers not fuller fuller is like you he believes what they want him to believe now get packed and ill have the boat lowered i let her go then taking my hands from her shoulders and turning abruptly for the door just a minute please her voice sounded troubled you asked me who sent that newspaper mr fuller also received a copy the rig probably has one too i dont know who sent it your wife perhaps perhaps she got up slowly and came towards me she wasnt crying but there were tears in her eyes you are in trouble i stared at her not answering not willing to admit it even to myself now that i was back in command your evidence in court she was standing quite close to me the lips of that toobig mouth of hers parted her eyes enormous will you swear to me that it was the truth if you swear oh go to hell i said and slammed out of the cabin i heard her call after me but what did she take me for what difference would it make swearing that i had told her the truth if i were the sort of man she believed the engineroom telegraph interrupted my thoughts i was in the bridge then johans voice calling for port wheel and the deck trembling to the increased revs a fishing boats mast framed in the starboard window slid astern and johan rang for slow again pushing his cap back on his head and turning to me with a grim smile they play silly buggers like that too many times and somebody get hurt i leaned my head out of the window watching the little blackpainted vessel swinging in our wake it was a hamnavoe fishing boat the white lettering clear on its bows been having trouble i hear johan nodded ja last night is very bad more than a dozen i think and some shooting inside the buoys their seine nets close in to the rig the bloody fools i thought risking their nets inside the circle of the anchor buoys did you threaten to use the hose on them he shook his head why not i told you if we use the hose there will be trouble he reached for the mug standing on the chart table and passed it to me your tea therell be trouble anyway i told him so use it the tea was half cold it seemed to typify the general state of the ship any boats shooting nets inside the anchor buoys get the hose turned on them after a warning through the loudhailer is that understood he stared dumbly straight ahead i said is that understood ja how many were seinenet fishing inside the buoys he shrugged i dont know ask gertrude i turned then he must have seen her reflection in the glass of the window for she was standing at the head of the companionway right behind me it was very thick last night fog how long before you chased them off she shrugged what does it matter there is no law against purseseine fishing and it is their nets they risk and suppose one of them had had divers on board with bombs she laughed does your mind run on nothing else i tell you they were just fishermen earning their living the way we once try to earn ours how long i repeated it was johan who answered the fog came down shortly after midnight it was about two hours after dawn before the last of the fishing boats made off five or six hours then i was thinking what a welltrained frogman could achieve in five or six hours but it was no good telling gertrude what was in my mind she wouldnt believe it she wouldnt believe that there were forces at work planning the destruction of that monster lying motionless off our starboard quarter i found it difficult to believe myself were you both on watch i asked you and johan both or you yes all through the night yes of course they are shooting their purse nets inside the circle of the buoys drifting them close by the rig and in that fog it is very risky i do not want to steam across the nets i do not want any trouble with these shetland fishermen it explained the tiredness the edginess the general air of a ship that was without proper order and authority tell flett to get me some food right away hot food not lukewarm leftovers like this tea i handed her the mug and call me at dusk ill stay on watch through the night after that it will be normal routine i left them and went below to find a vacant bunk hoping johan would have the sense to make the most of the nights rest i was offering him flett came in with a tray just as i was getting into the bunk there was coffee as well as a shepherds pie and both were scalding hot the twilight was darkening in the west when i was called clouds building up like a ragged mountain range peaks of cunim black against the last dying glow of sunset they have all run for home gertrude said i think you have a quiet night has johan turned in apart from lars at the helm she was alone on the bridge i think so well check that he has i dont want a tired mate or a tired crew those purseseiners will be back and unless were tough with them its going to be hard to keep the area clear she went through into the chart recess entered up the log and then turned and went to the cabin behind the bridge without another word her silence lingering as the last flicker of the days warmth was snuffed out by the growing cloud cover soon it had spread right across the sky the light fading and the movement of the ship increasing as wind and sea rose i circled the rig just inside the buoys the threeton cans difficult to see and not a ships light anywhere only the rig blazing like a factory the derrick jewelled with rubies all the long night stretched ahead of me and nothing to do but think about my situation and what it was i had to guard against for a time i tucked the duchess close in under the rig seeing myself as a marauding fishing boat bent on sabotage and trying to work out how they would do it what method they would employ but the sheer size of the rig made a nonsense of the exercise no bomb carried by a diver could possibly do more than superficial damage and to get at the weakest section of the crossbracing a frogman would have to climb well above the level of the sea at hours i got the financial news the reference to villiers came near the end he had held a press conference and had attacked the directors and shareholders of the old startrion company for letting their assets go to waste as for the north star rig and the shetland licences what had the company ever done to establish whether there was oil there or not they hadnt dared risk their money so why attack him for risking his perhaps i was biased by the fact that he had ignored fullers advice and supported me but i couldnt help a sneaking admiration for a man who fought back so strongly when forced into a corner somehow it gave me strength the forecast for inshore areas followed fifteen minutes later the depression deepening with wind westerly force rising to gale force we were already hoveto our bows pointing just south of west i switched off and after that i had nothing but my thoughts for company at midnight henrik relieved lars for a moment the two of them were there by the wheel whispering and glancing at me then lars went below he returned a moment later with a steaming mug of cocoa and handed it to me without a word it was shortly after that when we were nosing westward into a rainstorm to check for fishing vessels that something hammered at the soles of my feet i thought for a moment the old girl had fallen off the top of a rogue wave but it wasnt that we were in a trough with the sea gone dead in one of those lulls that happen sometimes the empty mug was on the floor clattering towards the side of the bridge and the glass of the rev counter had a crack running across it i dont know why i went for the buoys it was purely instinctive my hand seemed to leap out for the telegraph and without any thought on my part i had rung for full speed and had ordered henrik to steer nornorwest i had the spotlight on but with the rain driving across it we had hells own difficulty locating no buoy i got it in the beam and then couldnt hold it but it was there all right and so was no henrik his mind concentrated on the wheel hadnt felt a thing if it hadnt been for the mug and that crack in the rev counter glass i might have thought i had imagined it we steamed south and checked nos and buoys nothing wrong with them and i turned for the rig calling the operator on duty to ask whether they had felt anything but of course they hadnt they were too high above sea level and the drawworks and the power plant were going all the time i steamed close alongside the five southfacing column legs then back up the north side everything was normal the big tubular crossbracings solid and undamaged by then gertrude was on the bridge her fair hair tousled and a duffle coat over her pyjamas she had been roused by the changes of engine note and the wildness of the movement and she wanted to know what the hell was going on nothing i said just been checking the western anchor buoys thats all i didnt tell her i thought i had felt some sort of explosion it seemed too ridiculous with the rig towering over us and blazing with light everything so obviously normal ever seen that crack in the glass there i asked her pointing to the rev counter she looked puzzled staring at it and then at me yes she said its been there ever since i can remember now it is a little more noticeable why i shrugged i hadnt noticed it before and i walked over to the mug and picked it up all imagination and gertrude standing there looking at me very oddly was i beginning to suffer from some sort of persecution mania i could have convinced myself of that too i think but just as i had told her irritably to go back to bed and get some sleep henrik drew my attention to two men high up on the helicopter deck they were peering down over the edge of it and one of them was pointing to the column leg below winches and a wave reared up and i was flung against the side of the bridge gertrude was close beside me what is it she asked we were coming back on the other roll the ship broadside to the seas as henrik took her down the westfacing side of the rig towards the corner where the men standing high above us had been joined by several more all of them leaning over the edge gazing down at the cable stretched from the winch to the underwater block i rang for slow and turned the boat headtowind watching from the gangway as men began running to the far side of the rig what is it gertrude called out again and this time there was a note of urgency in her voice i didnt say anything i didnt know ed wisebergs burly figure appeared and stood there for a moment then he too was galvanized into action the rain slammed down a sudden squall that blurred the scene when it had passed i saw ken stewart there with a walkietalkie to his mouth while he struggled to get an oilskin on over his shortsleeved khaki shirt i ducked inside the bridge pushing gertrude out of my way and switched on the vhp barge to duchess calling duchess his voice was loud and clear above the noise of the wind do you read me and when i had switched to receive and acknowledged he said check no buoy the cables slack and we could be dragging i repeat check no buoy i already have i told him bracing myself against the radar as a wave rolled under us well check again the tension gauge is right down and it doesnt make a damn bit of difference winding in on the winch it was on the tip of my tongue to tell him i suspected an explosion but i checked myself in time this was not the moment what about no cable i asked him were watching it stay out by those buoys and keep your radio on roger i switched to loudspeaker and rang down for half ahead we were bucking in to it then the waves breaking against our bows and seething along the deck it was almost dark no twilight now only the beam of the spotlight sweeping back and forth and showing the break of the waves as they swept down at us out of the night and all the time my mind trying to sort out what had happened the cable slack but the buoy still in position if no buoy was still on a line with no then the anchor couldnt have moved that could only mean one thing the cable itself had parted i was thinking of the colossal strain it was under a slender line of twisted steel like an umbilical cord snaking down in a long halfmile curve to act as a leash between the anchor a hundred fathoms deep on the seabed and that huge monster of a rig and the gusts up to fortyfive knots now slamming against its superstructure i glanced at the bridge clock which was on greenwich mean time the hands at it must have happened about ten minutes ago and that slam against the hull it could have been the tensioned cable parting and curling up to crack like a whip against our underwater plating convinced of my reasoning i made the following entry in the log tension on no winch cable gone suspect cable parted deep underwater it took us longer this time to locate the buoy and then it was more by luck than judgement for the radar was virtually useless the object so small and the seas breaking we fell off the top of a wave and there was one of the buoys right alongside we wriggled clear and held it in the spotlight till we could identify it as no having found that one it was much easier to locate no for both buoys were correctly positioned in relation to each other i reported to the barge engineer both buoys in position and no indication that either of the anchors have dragged but by then they knew what the trouble was while we had been searching for the buoys they had been winding in on no winch we got most of the cable up now but the end of it is in a hell of a mess and jammed in the tower block looks like it parted close by the anchor winds southwest i said and gusting up to but he knew that knew the whole weight of the rig was now on a single windward anchor his voice was high and anxious as he called to me stay out there by no buoy no patrol between and i must know any change of position eds hauling up on the drilling string now but if no parts then hell have to operate the pipe rams hang off the drilling string at the bop so watch those buoys and warn me the instant no starts dragging got it roger the door to the gangway slammed and johan was there his yellow oilskins streaming water there is a ship out there he rubbed a big paw over his wet face peered at the compass and added about westnorthwest of us i switched off the spotlight and peered through the clearview circle of revolving glass i dont see any lights are you sure it was a ship ja she is without lights but i see the break of a wave against her bows he lumbered across to the radar switching to short range his big frame very still now in concentration as he watched the sweep there to starboard he shifted to give me a clear view the screen was flecked with breaking waves blurred with the rain now sweeping across us again but there on our starboard beam a brighter blip appeared below the sweep gradually fading to brighten again as the sweep completed its circle it was just over half a mile away and moving slowly in towards the rig i ordered starboard wheel and called down to per to increase the revs i had the blip right over the bows then and we were running downwind the duchess twisting and rolling in the quartering sea closing the gap fast but either she had picked us up on her own radar or she could see our steaming lights for halfway in to the rig she suddenly turned north and at the same moment ken stewarts voice came over the loudspeaker barge to duchess tension gone on no cable report position of buoy over the time was picked up the phone duchess to barge have unknown vessel on my radar screen steaming without lights inside the line of buoys am closing to identify over but when i switched to receive it was to hear his voice on a note of panic shouting i told you to stay on station by the buoys get back at once and report on no if its dragging we may have to go to emergency disconnect i must know now i started to argue with him but i might just as well have been talking to myself for i got no reply hardly surprising if the rig had started to drag the anchors were his responsibility and i could imagine what ed wiseberg would be calling him if the rig was being driven out of position with the line of drilling string still in the hole i stood there with the phone in my hand and johan staring at me waiting for my order to head back to the buoys gertrude too they were all staring at me waiting but instead of giving the order to turn i switched off the navigation and steaming lights picked up the engineroom voice pipe and called for maximum revs gertrude was instantly beside me her hand on my arm what are you doing going after her of course but why and johans voice as he stood over the radar there is no need she has seen us and is heading away from the rig henrik too was waiting for the order to turn and i knew so little about drilling that i was blind to the problems of a man with feet of twentyinch casing stretching down to the seabed i moved to the radar screen estimated the intercept course and ordered him to steer it i saw him hesitate his eyes flickering from gertrude to me and back again steer i repeated no gertrude was beside me again two angry spots of colour flaring in the pallor of her face we must turn back to the buoys when weve got the number of that fishing boat no now you heard what the barge engineer said a wave slammed against the port side she clutched at me and i held her as the ship plunged watch your helm i told henrik letting go of her and moving to the wheel to check the compass as he slowly brought her on to course hold it at that the atmosphere in the bridge was tense i had a feeling that if gertrude had ordered him to steer back to the buoys he would have obeyed her and with johan there i would have been quite impotent unable to enforce my orders against his massive bulk but she just stood there palefaced and tense her eyes staring at me with a sort of fascination it took us just over ten minutes to close the gap then suddenly we were right on top of her the spotlight pinpointing her black hull rolling on the crest of a wave she was a fishing boat all right and i closed right in until i could read her number i veered away then steering past her stern and as it lifted to the seas the spotlight picked out her name island girl and underneath the one word burra island girl the boat that had followed us to foula with stevens on board i turned to gertrude sandfords boat i said remember you sent me a cutting a west burra boat from hamnavoe she was staring out at the blunt stern now falling away in a trough her mouth half open whats she doing out here i demanded the paper said hed bought her as a rig supply boat she shook her head a surprised incredulous look on her face and the bridge silent only the sound of the engines the noise of the sea perhaps she would believe me now the boat was gone the night swallowing it as we swung away in a wide turn and headed back the rig barely visible a blurred glow through the rain she certainly wasnt fishing no then what was she up to what was she doing out here when every other fishing vessel has headed in for shelter a breaking wave cascaded over our bows solid water slamming against the windows i cut the revs straddling my feet bracing myself against the forward pitch as we slammed into the trough you think im crazy talking about bombs and sabotage but please her voice was wild her eyes suddenly bright with tears i dont want to think about it and she turned abruptly and went blindly back to the cabin christ i thought women why couldnt she be logical face up to the facts the rig was coming closer the lit bulk of it rising solid the red warning lights on the drill tower giving a warm glow to the lowscudding clouds i switched my mind back to the fishing boat trying to understand the reason for its presence it couldnt possibly have been responsible for the cables breaking we had been between the rig and the buoy when no cable had parted no sign of it then and it had been well clear of no cable when that had gone so a mine or some sort of a depth charge was out of the question anyway in this weather there was no way of dropping an explosive device directly on to the slender line of a cable under water so what was it doing and then ken stewarts voice crackling out of the speaker barge to duchess cancel previous order proceed to no and no buoys and stay with them weve got a shift of wind northwest in the gusts now and were holding but theres a lot of strain on the marine riser if either of those buoys move call me over i ordered a small change of course and reached for the phone duchess to barge im heading for them now and stewarts voice again i cant see your lights where are you he didnt wait for an answer but added stay on top of those buoys and if you think theyre dragging his words were cut off but he still had his hand on the transmitting button and faintly i heard him say whats that no christ wind in on that bloody winch wind in we were so close to the rig by then that i could see him running along the edge of the helicopter deck i think they are in trouble johan said i nodded it wasnt easy to visualize the turmoil up there on the high platform of the rig but in my minds eye i saw the headlines an obsolete rig moored in waters too deep and too dangerous and villiers trying for a fortune by risking mens lives theyd roast him if it ever leaked out that north star had cut adrift in a gale was that what sandfords boat was doing watching for trouble i was back with politics again and i cursed under my breath visualizing another headline with my own name in black type a blip johan called out and he made way for me so that i could see for myself there was the rig showing on the screen like a great moon in the milky way of breaking waves i was remembering gertrudes words as she had fled from the bridge i didnt want to think about it either there johan pointed a thick finger two of them now the rain had stopped and we were closing the area northwest of the rig the two little blips becoming clearer a few minutes later we picked up no can in the spotlight at slow ahead we moved on to no it was out of position i tried to report it but no answer through the glasses i could see men standing around the winches on the corner of the platform nearest to us i kept on sending as we lay hoveto keeping station on the buoy and watching for any further movement but it seemed to be holding and finally stewart came through his voice quieter now a note of relief weve full tension again hows it looking out there okay i think out of position but not by much ive been trying to call you no can doesnt seem to have moved much since the rain stopped and we got sight of the two of them thank christ he murmured weve definitely got a shift of wind if we hadnt got that the riser casing would have snapped under the strain a hell of a mess but were holding on and now tension constant stay on top of those two buoys beam your spotlight on us if you think either of them is shifting position ill have somebody keep watch on you from up here i darent rely on the tension dials only so watch it we stayed patrolling between those two buoys the rest of the night the wind gradually steadying in the northwest around it blew very strong from that quarter but the two anchors held and by dawn the wind was dropping and the sea with it the night of panic was over and north star almost back in position above the drill hole now the hustle was on to clear up the mess and get the rig operational again divers were down at first light and the radio traffic was incessant as scrambled fax reports were transmitted and ken stewart called for rattler to bring out new cable and relay anchors and and then just after he called the duchess and ordered me to report on board at eds holding a meeting to establish just what happened and what needs to be done so bring the ships log with you part three storm chapter one it took three days to get new cables sent out and wound on to the winch drums some of the big oil companies had established a supply base at lyness in orkney and were beginning to move backup facilities to lerwick but startrion was an independent and had to get supplies where it could mostly that meant aberdeen which was a long haul another day was lost in retrieving the anchors and relaying them so that it wasnt until late on th june that the drilling string was connected up again and the rig operational the meeting in ed wisebergs office had established nothing both the cables had parted at their extremities close to the length of chain shackled to the anchor this was confirmed later when rattler winched in both buoys and the anchors at the end of their pennant wires no had fifteen feet of cable still attached to the chain no seven feet this seemed to support the conclusion reached at the meeting that the cables were old and suffering from fatigue and that replacement of all anchor cables was essential for the safety of the rig since the discussion had centred on the condition of the cables i was not involved except to the extent of justifying my departure from ken stewarts instructions in order to identify the fishing boat island girl my action was accepted as being reasonable in the circumstances ed wiseberg merely insisting that in future i adhere strictly to the barge engineers orders i made no reference to that moment when i thought i had felt an explosion under water in view of what was discovered later it would have been better if i had but with everybody convinced that cable fatigue was the cause it would have introduced a new dimension i did however point out that the fishing boat island girl had been steaming without lights but they merely put that down to the determination of shetlands fishermen to shoot their nets close in to the rig they thought it was a political move since the purseseiners normally worked closer inshore and the absence of lights was attributed to a natural desire to avoid being sighted by the guard boat immediately following that conference i had arranged to get gertrude ashore i had never had a woman on board a trawler before and the fact that the crew were so accustomed to her presence that almost unconsciously they looked to her for decisions made my own position considerably more difficult than it would otherwise have been johan in particular had a great fondness for her as though she were a close relative as well as the owner in any case we needed i her back at base to organize supplies there was no room for her on the helicopter but when the new cables came out i got her away on rattler after that i was able to reestablish my authority and get a grip on the ship and her crew there was a great deal of activity during the days it took to get the rig fully operational again but once they had resumed drilling everything settled down to normal and the dullness of our patrol the steady routine of watchandwatch about made things considerably easier for me throughout this period the shetlanders gave us no trouble indeed for the better part of a week we never saw a single fishing boat johan thought they would be fishing either west of sumburgh or out by fair isle for the weather was fine and clear it was midsummer now the days so long there was almost no night only a weird pinkish twilight before the sun edged up over the horizon again twentythird june and another clear silky morning i was just coming off watch when the rig called us i was to report on board immediately ed wisebergs orders i found him alone in the toolpushers office his hard leathery face even more craggy than usual youve seen this have you it was a copy of the shetland paper with a headline dragging rig a danger to lives no we havent had any papers sent out yet he grunted then you wont have seen the stories in your national press the morning star is the worst of course accusing villiers of gambling with mens lives but theyre all on to it the times express telegraph the whole goddam lot all screaming for our blood he flung the pile down in front of me staring at me angrily as though i personally had leaked the story the intercom phone rang and while he answered it i picked up one of the papers my eye caught by several lines of print underlined in red it is not the first time things have gone wrong for this yearold american driller in the past six years he has had a fire a blowout and an accident in which two men were killed regarded as something of a jonah by his fellow toolpushers it is hardly surprising that he now finds himself in charge of the oldest rig in the north sea operating west of shetland in the most dangerous sea area of all no wonder he was angry i turned to the telegraph here too the story was front page news but at that point i suddenly became interested in what he was saying over the phone something about fishing boats and he had mentioned gertrude petersens name he reached for a pad made a note and then looked across at me okay george i think thats a pretty smart deal yeah i guess that should cool the whole thing down locally at any rate when dyou reckon itll be on station thats fine rattler can stand by till it arrives yeah ill tell him hes here with me right now and he put the phone down that was george fuller he said for a moment he didnt say anything more just stood there facing me his brows drawn down and his face grim he was looking older than when i had last seen him the lines of his face deeper the shoulders sagging the effect was to make him seem less than life size as though the weight of responsibility had diminished his stature the silence hung heavy what was it about i asked him you he paused still frowning then he straightened up squaring his shoulders first id better tell you the results of the laboratory tests on nos and cables we sent the whole lot ashore including the broken ends from both anchor chains it wasnt what we thought no indication of cable fatigue know what it was he was suddenly leaning on the desk his head thrust aggressively forward sabotage i was so shocked by the boldness of his statement that all i could think of was that moment on the bridge when something some force had slammed against the soles of my feet so id been right it had been an underwater explosion that surprise you he glowered at me no i bet it doesnt i can see it in your face you know damn well they were ripped apart by a bomb are you accusing me im not accusing you of anything all i know is that your political record stinks and yours was the only boat with the opportunity what about that purseseiner i reported steaming without lights but i knew island girl hadnt had time to undertake what would have been a very tricky operation he knew it too that fishing vessels got nothing to do with it mebbe you havent either god knows how it was done but there it is theres the laboratory report he picked up a telex and tossed it across to me read it if you want to the frayed ends of those cables all showed indications of heat metamorphosis traces of carbon other more technical details it all adds up the findings conclusive and something else you should read he reached for the local paper and handed it to me his finger pointing to the second column of the front page story that boat you saw it wasnt fishing it was tailing you read it but it couldnt possibly read it then ill tell you what weve decided it was a statement by ian sandford the rigs only standby boat is the duchess of norfolk manned partly by foreigners this is not the sort of boat that should be permitted to harry our fishing boats which have an ageold right to fish those waters nor should a man with a police record be in command of the one boat with the right to come and go around the rig this should be a shetland responsibility my own boat was in fact present in the neighbourhood of the rig at the time it began to drag the man on watch saw the duchess out by the windward buoys but then she forced island girl to leave the area the implication was obvious and it went on mr sandford who was recently elected to the zetland county council drew a hairraising picture of what could happen if this rig were to break adrift at the moment when the drill bit had penetrated an underwater oil reservoir it could mean he told our reporter vast quantities of crude oil gushing out into the waters west of shetland every fisherman knows the effect this would have on his livelihood but its not just the fishing that would be hit with the prevailing winds all the west of shetland could be totally polluted the whole coastline black with crude oil the beauty of our islands the bird life everything that attracts the tourist would be ruined his solution a modern selfpositioning drilling ship in place of the obsolete north star and in the interim proper surveillance with two shetland boats sharing the guard duties and manned by shetlanders so that was it the man had turned politician and was using his new position to get us out and his own boats in i looked across at the big toolpusher and knew by the look on his face i hadnt a hope of changing his mind youre ditching us is that it call it that if you like i told you when i first met you i didnt want you on my rig now i dont want you anywhere near it or your ship nor does george youre a political liability and to my way of thinking a potential danger to the rig he was looking down at the paper again his voice thick with anger as he said a dynamic stationed drill ship that shows their goddam ignorance a dynamic stationed ship in these waters theres no heave compensator invented could cope with the pitch and movement of a drill ship in the waves well be getting out here later in the year but i wasnt interested to hell with drill ships and technicalities all i cared about in that moment was the duchess and gertrude myself too weve a contract i said and provided we can keep on station his fist came down hammering at the desk i dont give a damn about your contract no doubt youll get compensation if thats what youre worrying about george can sort that one out with the petersen woman now get back to your ship and get it out of here okay rattler takes over from the duchess as of now i was so angry i had to push my hands down into my pockets to stop myself doing something stupid have you thought about how an explosive device could have been attached to the cables close to the anchor stocks in feet of water i was holding myself in my voice tight and controlled you think about that a bomb slid down the pennant wire from buoy to anchor would cut the buoy adrift and mark the anchor when it exploded i saw those anchors as rattler hauled them up they were undamaged and the buoys didnt break adrift both pennant wires were intact and if you think somebody could slide a device down the cable from the rig end of it on a snap block then you just try it see whether it gets anywhere near as close as the point of break on those two cables i had his attention then okay how do you think it was done then it was a matter i had given some thought to but i hesitated suspecting a trap when a man has virtually accused you of sabotaging his anchor cables you dont expect him to enquire about the method used without some ulterior motive but ed wiseberg wasnt built that way he was a rugged straightforward drill operator and there was no guile in the grey eyes waiting upon my answer their expression was one of puzzlement and it came as a shock to realize that the man was out of his depth and profoundly worried he really was seeking my advice christ you expect me to tell you not if you had a hand in it no he shrugged and then suddenly that craggy face broke into a smile but im asking you all the same you know about the sea i dont i laughed i couldnt help myself you asking me the bloody nerve of it all right i said ill tell you and i cursed myself for a fool but you couldnt help liking him and he knew how to handle men it could only have been done by a ship towing a grapnel i cant think of any other way if a grapnel were towed just the rig side of one of the anchor buoys it would be bound to grab hold of the cable the device could then have been slipped down the grapnel line a good lead weight on top of that then cut the line adrift and let it sink and how do you set it off delayed action either that or fasten a thin connecting wire to the side of the anchor buoy so that you can detonate by radio signal even as i said it thinking the method out as i went along the real reason for the presence of that fishing boat flashed into my mind since they need a gale to make the operation worthwhile radio signal would be the sensible method of triggering the bomb off so we inspect the buoys a daily routine he nodded yeah thats the answer he came round the edge of the desk i guess you think im being pretty rough hm well nothing i can do about that i got the rig to consider and the bloody shetlanders on my back he held out his hand the tough leathery features lit by a smile of surprising charm i hear the fishings good now so no hard feelings eh i shook his hand what else it wasnt his fault and no good telling him that in getting rid of me he was losing the one person who knew enough to give the rig some protection good luck i said and i meant it remembering that paragraph in the express underlined in red he nodded reached for his safety helmet and gloves and then he was gone striding out on to the helicopter deck i watched him through the window as he headed for the derrick floor back to the world that was his life the world he knew and understood i thought then and still think that the division between toolpushers and barge engineers is a dangerous one how can you expect a man who has spent most of his life drilling on land to adapt himself to the sea in middle life ed wiseberg at fiftyone couldnt be expected to think in terms of a real shetland gale he couldnt even conceive what it was like yet so long as north star was drilling he was in charge i went slowly out on the deck pausing a moment to see his heavy figure climbing the long iron stairway at the base of the derrick that led from pipe deck to derrick floor climbing with a sort of punchy swagger he flung open the corrugated iron door and stood there for a moment surveying the scene a lone figure standing right above the pipe skid the noise of the drawworks blasting out and the men inside dancing a strange ballet around the kelly the tongs in their hands and the winches screaming then he stepped forward into that hells kitchen of machinery and closed the door behind him safe now among the tools that were his trade god help him i thought as i turned away wondering how he would measure up if he was caught in a real storm the duchess was wallowing in the bright sunlight out by no buoy i went down the stairway then to the waiting boat and as the outboard pushed us clear of the cold cavern of the rigs undersection i was considering how i would break it to the crew they had been out here for over two months now sacrificing shore time for the benefit of their ship i wasnt angry i was past that but the humiliation of it sickened me knowing that they would have nobody to blame but myself and later when we reached shetland there would be gertrude to tell i climbed on board and went straight to the bridge lars was at the wheel and i told him to turn in towards rattler she was still moored sternon to the rig unloading stores i steamed close past her bows hailing her skipper and telling him it was all his now he wished us luck and i was thinking i could certainly do with some as i swung away to point our bows towards mainland of shetland then i called the crew to the bridge and told them why we were leaving i could see the shock and dismay in their faces and i didnt wait for the inevitable questions but ducked into the chart recess to lose myself for a moment in the practicalities of working out the course for scalloway johan followed me shortly afterwards so we get compensation and gertrude pays off the mortgage then we go fishing ja he was smiling and i guessed what he was thinking that close positive relations between them would be resumed and everything would go on as it had before he put a great paw on my arm what will you do then to my surprise there was real concern in his voice i havent thought about that i said he nodded well time you think about it he hesitated his head turned away from me staring out through the doorway as he said you are a good captain a good seaman ja but for you it is not enough to fish he spoke slowly awkwardly as though afraid of giving offence fishing is a good life but not for you you need something bigger politics peraps or oil you may be right i said and gave him the course he didnt say anything after that for him it had been a long speech we had moved into the bridge and we were silent both of us wrapped in our own thoughts the only sounds the sounds of the sea and the hum of the engines the evening was deepening into twilight as we steamed through the middle channel into scalloway and we had barely dropped our anchor under the castle ruins when a boat put out from the shore and came alongside the old man at the oars wore a fishermans cap he said his name was mclver and that he had a note for me from gertrude petersen all this in a high piping voice like the call of a curlew i bent over the bulwarks and took the note from his outstretched hand ripping open the envelope and reading it by the light of the deck light it was dated rd june at i think perhaps you do not come into the taing but go direct to scalloway in case this is to tell you that a detectivesergeant from hull came to the house this morning he is asking for you but will not say why his name is gorse and he is waiting for you at the hotel in scalloway i think you may like to know so i am leaving this note for terry mciver of dun croft to give you as soon as you arrive it is more trouble for you i think so let me know if there is anything i can do g and she had added a ps sandford now has the startrion contract he is providing two shetland boats to replace the duchess i looked across at the lights of the little port thinking there wasnt much time now to do what i had to do any moment a boat would put out from the pier and i had no doubts as to why gorse was here do you have a car i asked the old man but he shook his head know anybody who could run me over to taing aye my son hes got a ford van i told him to wait and went to my cabin hurriedly stuffing the things id need into my grip i took my anorak and sea boots as well shouted to johan that he was in charge now and a moment later i was in the boat and being rowed ashore money and a vehicle and i didnt wait for the inevitable questions but ducked into the chart recess to lose myself for a moment in the practicalities of working out the course for scalloway johan followed me shortly afterwards so we get compensation and gertrude pays off the mortgage then we go fishing ja he was smiling and i guessed

boat and being rowed ashore money and a vehicle standing uncertainly looking up at that lighted window the night was very still the fine drizzle soft on my face and i was suddenly seeing it from her point of view the contract cancelled and myself coming like a fugitive out of the night i dumped my things in the land rover and then moved hesitantly towards the door no longer sure of my reception and conscious of robbie watching me curiously my knock sounded loud in the stillness light streamed out as the bedroom curtains were whisked back then the window opened and gertrudes voice called down to enquire who it was mike randall i said can i talk to you a moment i want to borrow the land rover there was a pause then she said wait a minute and ill come down she came to the door in her dressing gown her hair was held with a band of ribbon and she had an oil lamp in her hands its very late she was staring past me at the van is that robbie yes mrs petersen he answered her gaze came back to me you put in to scalloway then there was a long pause her eyes looking directly at me a puzzled expression as though she couldnt make up her mind and then suddenly she was smiling to herself as though at some private joke so thats why youve come for the land rover i nodded how long do you want it for three or four days i said i could see her working that out and then she standing uncertainly looking up at that lighted window the night was very still the fine drizzle soft on my face and i was suddenly seeing it from her point of view the contract cancelled and myself coming like a fugitive out of the night i dumped my things in the land rover and then moved hesitantly towards the door no longer sure of my reception and conscious of robbie watching me curiously my knock

and called to robbie that he neednt wait captain randall will take the land rover and i will settle with your father okay mrs petersen thank him will you please she called as the vans engines started up again i raised my hand but he was already backing and turning i watched as the red tail lights climbed the hill and disappeared over the top everything was still then and we were alone are you coming in or do you want just to take the land rover and go she sounded uncertain of herself her voice sharp and trembling slightly i need some money i said for petrol then youd better come in you need to explain too all right i went in then and she slammed the door behind me you like some coffee or something stronger coffee please ill be driving all night she led me through into the flagstoned kitchen and as she set the lamp on the table she looked at me angrily you dont think of my reputation do you coming here at this time of night it will be all over hamnavoe im sorry i said i was thinking of the last time i had been in this house the difference in my reception i needed transport so you come to me she began filling the kettle first my ship and now she turned the tap off anybody else anybody at all and we would have kiss just a mutual longing for sympathy and underlanding and her face was wet with tears we stood like that for a long time oblivious of everything and we were relaxed we were no longer righting each other we had surrendered to something stronger than ourselves and standing there with my inns round her the softness of her body the pressure of her lips i felt a strange surge of confidence a feeling that i had found myself at last that i knew where i was going now and had the strength to get there it was a marvellous quite ecstatic feeling and not explainable in any way the kettle she murmured and pushed me away the kettle was boiling its head off and we were suddenly both of us laughing for no apparent reason except that we were happy she leaned forward and switched off the gas she was smiling now holding out her hand to me and leading me out of the kitchen the bedroom looked straight out across the voe and i remember a pale line of light to the west reflected on the water then we were together and for a long time it seemed the world stood still and there was just the two of us everything beyond that tiny room beyond the absolute harmony of ourselves and our bodies as though it had never been all stress gone an obliteration in ecstasy i had never had this sort of an experience before the giving and taking without restraint love is not a word normally used by trawlermen but at least i knew a when it happened and afterwards there was a lot to talk about sitting smoking together over coffee in the kitchen she put up a parcel of food for me and by then it was full dawn with the cloud all gone and the greenish pink glow of the sun just beginning to limn the line of the hills on the far side of clift sound we kissed and she clung to me a moment murmuring something about being careful and not doing anything stupid but she didnt try and stop me she knew it was a thing i had to do there are ordnance survey maps behind the seat she called to me as i drove off i waved and then i was up the track and over the hill with time to wonder what the hell i thought i was doing when i could have stayed with her but that i knew would have been anticlimax after what we had just experienced at least i was doing something not waiting around until gorse arrived up by scalloway i turned on to the main road and kept going north along the shores of asta and tingwall lochs with the sky a brilliant green shading to ducks egg blue and the steep slopes of the hills standing back above the water as the suns glow increased in the east there were flecks of mackerel cloud ahead and soon all the great bowl of the dawn above the peat hills was aflame by then i had put gertrude out of my mind my thoughts were now concentrated on the journey ahead and what i would find up there at burra firth the sun was bright in the mackerel sky and it was warm as i drove through the dale between the black peat hills of mid and east kome coffee and sandwiches by loch of voe then more blackpeat diggings to dales voe and up over swinister to sullom voe where a ship was offloading material at the jetty and the wartime camp had been adapted for the use of the contractors building the oil terminal for the brent and dunlin fields i was able to fill up with petrol here and in the hotel now full of contractors men instead of tourists a surveyor who had just arrived gave me a copy of one of the london papers i hadnt had a chance to read a newspaper for several weeks but the world didnt seem to have changed i glanced at the headlines over my coffee and it was all gloom strikes disruption shortages and britain as always on the verge of bankruptcy it seemed incredible that union bosses and more of the media men didnt come to shetland and see for themselves the brighter hopes for the future an hour later i was at toft a north wind driving down yell sound the waters broken and streaked with white standing on the pier i couldnt help thinking what a target shetland could become when half the lifeblood of industrial britain was passing through these islands on mainland of shetland the people were of fairly mixed race infiltrated over the years by scots and others but when i crossed into yell and farther north to the last island of unst i would be among purer viking stock men closer to the faroese the icelanders and the norwegians than to britain and if iceland became wholly communist or the russians moved across the pasvik river into finnmark in the north of norway how would these men react in this watery land touched with the old glacial hand of the last ice age england seemed very remote and london a whole world away sitting in the land rover reading the paper while i waited for the ferry i came across the headline villiers hits back as vfi shares tumble it ws an account of the dti enquiry in london into the startrion deal and villiers was challenging his detractors to risk their own money on the west shetland shelf the trouble with our country is that politicians and their bureaucratic masters are only interested in equality in poverty in how a meagre cake can be shared more fairly when they should be bending all their energies instead towards increasing the size of that cake by every means in their power this is what i am doing and shall go on doing whatever the cost whatever the risk call me a buccaneer if you like that is a term of abuse thrown at me by mr swingler my own conservative member all right i am a buccaneer and when times are hard as they are now britain is the loser that there arent more of us but when north star brings in another field as i am confident it will you wont call me a buccaneer then youll pay tribute to my sagacity claim me as the shareholders friend while others will call me a capitalist and scream for nationalization of my company the ferry was halfway across now and i sat watching it crawl like a steel beetle across the foamflecked waters of the sound seeing in my mind the man i had talked to on north star at bay in that courtroom angry and obstinate fighting back with all that extraordinary vitality and energy of his i turned to the city page there had been a run on vfi shares now standing at a new low and less than half the price they had been when the market as a whole had bottomed after the arab oil embargo i was thinking of north star then of its loneliness out there in the march of the westerlies and of its extreme vulnerability under the orders of a man near desperation and periodically under the control of a toolpusher whose luck appeared to have run out tailormade to our purpose the ferry berthed while i was thinking about that purpose about who would gain not the workers nor industry certainly not britain the direction my thoughts were taking scared me and i drove on to the ferry feeling as though in crossing the sound i was moving into another world a step nearer the destiny to which all my life had been a preparation it was not a nice feeling from flukes hole on the other side i took the lesser road that ran up the western coast of yell from gutcher it is only just over a mile across bluemull sound to the island of unst and then six miles on a good straight road to the main port of baltasound another two to haroldswick there in a little house behind the harbour up near the school an old man who understood the use of words took me into a strange wild world of myth and legend he had bright birdlike eyes intensely blue in the dark windwrinkled face large gnarled hands and a voice so soft so lyrical in speech that to hear him talk was like listening to music his name was robert bruce thats no a verra good name to have in the island of unst i thought he was referring to the early scottish king but no he was harking back to a laurence bruce the great foud of zetland he called him a tyrannical landgrabber who from his castle at muness had held all unst in the thrall of scottish law during the last days of the first elizabeth when james was still only king of scotland it was a strange haunting story a romeo and juliet legend of the north and at first i did not understand why he was telling it to me when i had arrived in haroldswick i had gone to the post office and because i had to explain my need of accommodation i said i was an ornithologist birds were the main attraction for visitors and it would allow me to walk the hills around burra firth without exciting comment the bruces had just had a cancellation so i had been sent to them but robert bruce a retired schoolmaster living with his sister now occupied his time helping with the preservation and marking of seabirds on the western cliffs and i dont think it took that shrewd beadyeyed little scot long to realize i was no ornithologist so instead of talking about birds he told me the story of edwin and helga and how to escape the wrath of her people whose leader had been murdered by one of bruces minions she had rushed her lover to the familys little boat and sailed for yell in a northerly gale past the great cliffs of vallafield to be lost for ever in the roaring tide race off the entrance to bluemull sound it is too long a story to repeat and i have forgotten i much of it and in any case the beauty of it was in the telling but what i do remember is bruces guile and greed his despicable ruthlessness and the fierce lawabiding determination of the islanders who had sailed an open boat three hundred miles to scotland to lay their just complaints before the king in edinburgh and do you ken why the scots were in zetland bruce asked me his bright eyes fixed on me like the ancient mariner because the islands were handed over to them as a pledge for a danish princesss dowry the people were subject only to the scots king retaining their own laws and customs but history is strewn with conditions of treaty unfulfilled and bruce as gauleiter for the crown violated them with a vengeance looking at me very closely he added in this lonely island of unst we are very vulnerable to big northern shifts of power and then as his sister took the blackened kettle from the hob and made the tea he began telling me an older island story of the pictish inhabitants a thousand years ago who when their brochs were destroyed and all their lands taken by vikings from the fjords of norway had been forced to retreat into the great caverns of the southwest from which they emerged only at night they were the trolls you know the little people of superstition call them dwarfs gnomes fairies its all the same you watch for them at night mind your children dont get stolen and put out offerings to placate them thats what the early norse did and only coul the old priest man captured from the celts of the south ever saw the caves in which they had found refuge and he died just after they had let him go he told me the story then of gletna kirk the church coul tried to build and which they destroyed in the night thinking it was to be another of the invaders strongholds but by then my head was nodding it had been a long day and i drank my tea and went to bed to wake once briefly in the night and remember how the old man had harped on successive waves of northern invaders in the morning after breakfast i went with him up the road to burra firth about a mile and a half to where a track branched northward youll not be finding many birds up there not unless you go right to the noup and thats a good long tramp by saxa vord the blue eyes watched me curiously from under his peaked cap better you come with me up milldale to tonga theres all the birds you could ever want there and i can show you goturms hole i thanked him and he nodded suit yerself he halfturned then paused take the right fork in half a mile and itll bring you to buel houll theres a good view there of the ness on tother side of the firth with fiska wick beyond and a fishing boat close inshore youll see in your map theres a track from just near buel houll that winds round housl fiel and straight back by the school and then he asked me youve no glasses no he slipped his own from off his shoulder youll need them im thinking to see what you want to see he nodded then and left me walking with a steady tireless stride his body bowed a little into the west wind i examined the glasses he had given me they were zeiss small and very compact but of extraordinary clarity and brilliant magnification birdwatchers glasses but hed known when he handed them to me it wasnt birds i had come to watch i went up the track and before i had reached the fork i could see the black hull of the fishing boat anchored off a sprawl of buildings on the far side i took the left fork and where the track ended i turned north along the edge of the fifth it was very quiet only the sound of the seabirds and the lap of the water on the rocks root stacks was right below me and i lay in the grass watching the buildings opposite across the narrow strip of water white puffs of cloud sailed over the hills and it was warm the breezeblock sprawl of the root stacks hotel basking in the sunshine through the glasses i could see the sign quite clearly a painted board on the stonebuilt front of what must have been part of the old original steading and just below it on a wooden bench an old man sat dozing in the sun his face strangely twisted he had a stick beside him and there was a dog at his feet a black and white collie curled up on the sheepcropped grass it was all very peaceful and nothing stirred for a long time then shortly after eleven the dog uncurled itself and began to bark a land rover was coming down the track the old man stirred and lifted his head the disfiguring line of a great scar showing the land rover stopped and three men got out one of them was sandford the old man shook hands with the other two and they all went into the house including the dog and after that the stillness and the quiet descended again i must have fallen asleep for i woke suddenly to the sound of the dog barking five men were loading packages into the land rover the old man watching them leaning on his stick they piled into the land rover sandford driving it up the track that disappeared behind the ness to where my map showed the narrow gut of fiska wick ten minutes later the quiet was shattered by the sound of an outboard and an inflatable with four of them in it nosed out from under the ness and headed for the fishing boat i watched them as they climbed on board but it was impossible to tell whether they were shetlanders or not and though the sound of their voices reached me across the water i couldnt hear what was said the land rover was back at the hotel now not a soul in sight the vessels engine started up figures on the foredeck and the clank of the chain coming in and when the anchor was housed she steamed down the firth hugging the farther shore and disappearing westward through the gap between herma ness and muckle flugga i lay back in the peat moss again thinking of the rig and that damned fool fuller exchanging the duchess for one of sandfords boats i lay there scarcely moving until late in the afternoon when the clouds thickened and it began to drizzle and by then i knew i was wasting my time i had discovered nothing except that in the right weather sandford used the firth as a base for his boats and i got to my feet climbing towards housl fiel and the track that led back to bruces cottage he came in a little after me the tweed of his jacket glistening with moisture his ruddy face flushed with exertion i could have shown you a snowy owl he said his bright eyes laughing at me a snowy owl meant nothing to me and he knew it you saw the purseseiner leave did you i watched it from the top of libbers hill it was steaming southwest to clear the clapper and the islands north of mainland he talked about birds until we had finished our meal and then he began telling me the story of goturms hole how the son of the jarl of stackhoull had been killed returning from a raid into norway and the man who had killed him had had his boat wrecked on the rocks northwest of unst he climbed the cliffs to the hole named after him and there he would have been killed but for the young mans sister who had some contact with christianity and couldnt stomach vengeance for vengeances sake goturm was a dane and became a king of the danes and years later when the norse people in unst had been overrun by yet another invasion from norway he repaid the debt he owed for his life sending one of his captains with a great treasure to the girl who had saved him now a woman and no longer living in the great hall at stackhoull but in a little cot on the milldale burn i may well have walked on the ruins of it this very day a wild place captain randall this island of unst and nothing ever certain in an uncertain world why are you telling me this i asked him bobbie loves telling the old legend stories his sister said aye he nodded filling his pipe and watching me his eyes full of curiosity ysee i taught history as well as english and geography a bit of natural history too of course i love this land of ours so rugged bleak and beautiful it fascinates me but you had a purpose i insisted all your stories are of invasion and retribution your name he said and you salvaging the duchess we may be lonely island people but we do get the shetland times i waited while he lit his pipe staring at me over the flame now thats a strange coincidence you and the duchess it was during the war and that same trawler putting in to the firth here in a westerly gale the winter of it would be and i rowed out to her a young naval lieutenant was in command and she was on her way back to sullom voe from the norwegian coast there was a randall on board there a man with his face all twisted and the scar of a gash that had bit deep into his skull i heard he was some sort of an agent a russian agent so the story went but it was later i heard that there was a long pause and i thought i knew what was coming but then he said theres nobody here walks the cliffs of tonga saito neap and toolie all the way out to humlataes as often as i do not much happens in the neighbourhood of herma ness that i dont know about and often i catch a glimpse of those big trawlers that hang around our coast with more aerials and scanners than they have fishing gear about two months ago it would be and i was up on tonga with the sun shining brightly and a grey greasylooking bank of fog hugging the sea sticking up out of it were the masts and antennae of one of those big trawlers and coming in from the north the tip of a single mast cleaving the fog like a submarines telescope it was a queer sight i can tell you the two of them coming together and voices drifting up through the swirl and the shriek of the birds whats this got to do with the man you saw on the duchess all those years ago aye itd be thirtytwo years now but a man so disfigured hes come back is that what you mean the man on that bench in the sunshine old now and walking with a stick my god and the two of us separated only bythat narrow strip of water hes at the root stacks hotel thats it isnt it he nodded and his eyes gleamed with the certainty that here was another story a week after i had seen that trawler rubbing shoulders with a fishing boat in the fog i came down off sothers brecks to join the track at fiska wick and there he was are you sure it was the same man no doubt at all bruce said though his name is not randall now but a name doesnt matter not with the mark of a terrible wound like that and he added he was sitting there this morning you must have seen him i nodded feeling it couldnt be true but remembering the old mans face in the glasses the twisted broken features about the right age too and root stacks run by anna sandfords son mouat he calls himself now his middle name and mine and i knew it must be true bruce leaned towards me thats a common enough name in shetland but mouat isnt his real name its randall his large hand gripped my knee and your name is randall and whatever you may say captain youre not here to look at the birds no then what are you here for i shook my head not sure i had really known until this moment i think that man may be my father i said and after that i told him a little about myself enough at any rate to satisfy his curiosity do you know if a man calling himself stevens is ever at the hotel but he shook his head and when i gave him a description he said he had never been to the hotel had never seen any of them close to is he irish he asked i know theres an irish lad works there and others they come and go claiming theyre birdwatchers same as you and a mixed lot they are by all accounts ill be going up there this evening he nodded ask mouat where he was in itll be the same man im sure i left just after nine and he walked with me as far as the neck of land that separated loch of cliff from the burra firth there was a lot of cloud and the light was fading if a new invader were to come to our islands he said this is as good a place as any its happened many times before but so long ago nobody remembers only old men like me who know the history of the islands i looked at his weatherbeaten gnomelike face the bright blue eyes a man so deep in the legends of his land so close to the wildness of it that for him the prospect of a new horde landing on the rocks was not beyond the bounds of credibility there are more subtle ways i checked myself conscious of the dark hills against the clouds and my thoughts running away with me a light gleamed down the track beside burra firth a door opening then it was gone dont wait up for me i said i saw him hesitate but then he nodded the door will be on the latch i left him and went down the track along the waters edge the root stacks buildings were dark in the shadow of mouslee hill and as i approached them i was thinking back to that night on board the fisher maid with shetlands hills black lumps against a cold green strip of sky it was then that i had decided to come north to the islands seeking some knowledge of my father that would help me to understand myself barely three months yet it seemed an age and now here in the dark of unst with my mind stuffed full of the ghosts of old legends in the dark shadow of these buildings my pace faltered and for a moment i stood listening unsure of myself and reluctant to face him the dog was barking and i walked quickly up to the door and knocked i could hear voices but it was some time before anybody came the dog protesting from its kennel at the back until a shout silenced it the door opened and a man stood there short and squat in an island jersey what is it if its a drink youre wanting mr mouat i said id like a word with him mouat eh are you sure of the name now quite sure i thought he was going to close the door in my face and i put my foot against it better call sandford i said he hesitated looking at me curiously finally he turned and called out ian theres a man here asking for mr mouat the lampglow in the stoneflagged hallway brightened as a door was flung wide and sandford appeared his shirt open at the neck and a drink in his hand the skipper of the duchess eh he was smiling all right paddy he can come in he waved his glass in invitation i wondered how long it would be before you called on us you knew i was here oh sure word of a stranger gets around pretty fast in a place like this come on in and have a drink youre out of a job i hear the same harsh breezy manner but there was something in the eyes an uneasiness and the cheerful smile seemed somehow forced come on you dont hold it against me that ive got the north star contract now do you i stepped into the narrow hallway full of stuffed seabirds in glass cases the old mans gone to bed he said leading me through into the lamplit room where a quiet bearded man sat at a table littered with glasses and the remains of a meal whisky sandford picked up a bottle and poured me a drink without waiting for an answer were short of a skipper interested there was a peat fire burning in the grate and it was warm his round smooth face shining with perspiration as he handed me the drink small eyes watchful waiting for some reaction you offering me a job i asked the whisky was colourless a home brew from some local still could be it depends on what how badly you need it i didnt come here for a job i said and i didnt come to see you i came to see the man who calls himself mouat his eyes flickered towards the farther door the uneasiness there again and his face changing a hardening of the mouth i told you hes gone to bed i moved to the farther door then something he hadnt expected and before he could stop me i had thrown it open the old man was sitting there in a wing chair a lamp beside him and a book open on his lap the gashed side of his head was in shadow so that all i saw was the smooth transparent skin of an older version of the face that stared at me every time i shaved the likeness vanished when he turned his head but the shock of that moment of recognition was so great that i didnt resist the grip of hands seizing hold of me let him be ian his voice was very quiet his eyes glinting in the lamplight a searching stare he knows who i am i can see it written all over his face they let me go then and i stood there feeling numb as he went on its something of a shock isnt it at your age to find your father isnt safely dead and buried was there a note of bitterness there of regret who put that plaque in grund sound church i asked my voice so choked it was almost a whisper he contrived a smile that was more of a grimace i did or rather i arranged for it to be placed there the twist of his mouth gave a curious lisp to his words leave us alone now ian we have much to talk about and things must be said that id rather you didnt hear but sandford stood there frowning angrily and unwilling to leave us he didnt trust me and the old man laughed the two of you here together with me for the first time we should kill the fatted calf that ghastly smile and the blue eyes gleaming wickedly up at me in the lamplight you met anna i believe anna sandford in hamnavoe his eyes slid away from me still with that terrible smile twisting his face and i turned and stared at ian sandford knowing now what it was he had meant with that reference to the prodigal returned christ almighty two sides of the same coin and i was looking at the other half wondering how much of the same blood each of us had whether hidden behind the smooth roundness of my halfbrothers face was the same devil of selfdoubt chapter two i was alone with my father in that room for about an hour it was a difficult very disturbing interview for the twisted features that terrible gash left by the shell splinter that had ploughed the side of his skull shocked me deeply it had marked all the left cheek split the ear and cut deep into the side of his head and the wired up remains of his jaw gave a lisp to his speech yet he wasnt a man you could pity he was too withdrawn too selfcontained and old though he was he still had some of the fire that had driven him to fight for a cause he admitted he knew was lost before ever he had embarked for spain that plaque i asked him what about it making out that you were dead when you werent what was the point you have your mothers tidy mind he said harshly how is she by the way she died two years ago he didnt say he was sorry just shrugged as though accepting the inevitability of death but theres something of me in you too isnt there he smiled grimacing you see ive checked up on you why why not youre my son arent you as soon as ian told me he hesitated ive been expecting you knowing you were bound to come he leaned a little forward what brought you to shetland seeking out my past it wasnt affection or filial regard it was something else something youd been told no what then i tried to explain but it wasnt easy with him sitting there smiling crookedly he was remote a stranger and i sensed an underlying hostility as i told him of the doubts that had gradually ended my early admiration for him so i was a hero to you eh at first and you left your mother turned your back on the capitalist wealth of her new husband and set out on your wanderings i wanted to live my own life we all want that when were young later it becomes more difficult i thought he sighed and for you more than most you were pulled two ways thats your nature michael you dont mind me calling you michael most people call me mike your friends and those you work with perhaps have you any friends i stared at him angrily thinking he probably had a liking for getting under peoples skin the bitterness of a man forced into loneliness youre a solitary is that it he nodded and again that crooked smile i think i know you now a wanderer a boy who has never grown up to be a man isnt that right every time you come up against the rawness of the world we have to live in you run away from it seeking escape in drugs or that was only a phase i said quickly annoyed that i felt the need to justify myself or some eastern religion i had never told anybody about that only fiona buddhism wasnt it then playing with communism and running away to sea you went to sea yourself i was angry now and that annoyed me even more for i knew he was goading me and the knowledge that fiona must have been here before she had gone to see gertrude presumably what are you after i demanded prying into my private life asking questions of my wife just trying to understand you when youve never met your son before youve a reason i cut in hotly perhaps but its natural isnt it and so it went on a verbal duel between us each trying to learn something about the other but he was more adept at it sidestepping direct questions and shrewdly needling me until there wasnt much he didnt know only once was i able to probe a little beyond the ruined mask of his features he had introduced gertrude into the conversation not very nicely since he had implied that the only thing i had ever done that showed any promise of success was going into partnership with a woman maybe thats the only way you can demonstrate your manhood what do you mean by that you wouldnt have gone into partnership with ian for instance would you no or any other man i never had the opportunity feel safer with a woman eh think a womans easier to handle or are you in love with her what would you know about love he was silent then and i remembered the strange letter he had written anna sandford like you i never had the opportunity not after this it was just a flat statement no bitterness his hand touching the scars but he kept clear of gertrude after that switching to the north star contract and to villiers youre a loner thats your trouble now ians got the contract and deserves it he gets around that boy lots of friends and hes a shetlander oil companies men like villiers they dont think about the islanders or their livelihood just as they never thought about the arabs until it was too late youve met villiers havent you yes admire him somebody else asked me that a man called stevens well im asking you now the name didnt seem to have registered when a man changes his mind about the social structure he wants he often leans so far over in the opposite direction i havent changed my mind i told him if anything has changed its the society in which we live militants are less concerned with justice they want anarchy now do they you know they do i know nothing of the sort i think its you who have changed im not an anarchist i said i never have been so now youre against all progress towards a fairer more equitable world i laughed you dont believe that any more than i do the worlds never been fair never will be men are not born equal and if you dont recognize that then all i can say is that its you that has never grown up youre still a communist i take it he hesitated yes a russianstyle communist if you like you came here from russia during the war from norway in on board the duchess and i added hoping to get something positive out of him you were an agent up in the north of norway a foreign agent i saw his eyes narrow whose side were you on russias or ours britain and russia were allies and that salves your conscience but now what side are you on now he sighed does there have to be sides nobody is at war not here no not in the old sense of the word i said but a new style of warfare economic war ah yes the london school of economics just because your head has been stuffed with economic fallacies you dont have to turn your coat at the first whiff of the real thing and even if the world is temporarily short of energy it doesnt meanthat men like villiers should gamble lives and risk the future of the shetland fishery to keep themselves and their city friends afloat villiers in particular hes stripped others assets so often it would only be poetic justice if his own assets were stripped for a change you surely dont support men like that of course i dont then what are you doing coming up here trying to resolve your doubts by digging up your fathers past and then salvaging a trawler and pretending youre a capitalist only this i said i think its time we started picking up the pieces instead of trying to destroy everything before its too late and i added you ask my reasons but what the hell are you doing here you forget im a shetlander i belong here but that was not the answer stevens i said a man calling himself stevens not a muscle of his face moved no sign of recognition not even when i described the man to him the hard mouth the slight squint but when i repeated what he had said about rehabilitation and not many surviving i thought he winced a muscle on the right of his jaw tightening were you returned to russia after the war he laughed a conscious effort what are you a nationalist now an empire loyalist patriotism in place of communism that you speak of russia as though it were a hostile power i was never a communist i said in theory yes but not a party member and now what are you now he was suddenly leaning forward his eyes fixed on my face and when i said that perhaps that was what i had come to shetland to find out he smiled seeking the answer in me eh in my life he let his body fall back the wings of the high chair framing his face well now youve found me and i have no answer for you he sounded tired then as though talking to me had proved too exhausting or was it the memory of the long years that were a locked secret in his mind you mentioned a need for picking up the pieces i could help you there how i have some influence with ian otherwise i wouldnt be living here in his hotel you and he have this in common you both want to be owners you know hes got three of the larger fishing boats working for him now two will share the standby job on north star the other which he has just arranged to charter will ferry stores out to one of the rigs on the dunlin field and that doesnt worry you that hes working for villiers and the oil companies a slight movement of the shoulders almost a shrug he wants to make money why not hes only doing what everybody else is doing it was on the tip of my tongue to ask if he knew north star had had two of its anchor cables cut by an explosive device but i checked myself wheres he find the capital borrows it from you are you providing him with funds i never had any capital i dont believe in it how long have you been here his mouth was a tight line and he didnt reply was it a fishing vessel put you ashore about two months ago you ask too many questions he said and i knew by the set look on his face that he would never disclose where he had come from or what he had been doing all these years its your own position you have to consider not mine im told youre out of a job and on the run is that right suddenly his manner the atmosphere between us had subtly changed ian had a call yesterday to say the police were making enquiries about you in lerwick why should anybody telephone to tell him that my throat felt dry the net closing again and my liberty threatened the boys in local politics and his friends keep him informed he paused and then he offered me the way out he needs a skipper for his new boat hed give you the job if i told him to and on a supply run to the dunlin field youd be clear of the police he left it hanging in the air and reached for his stick no need to make up your mind immediately sleep on it he got to his feet im going to bed he smiled and now that i could see the other side of his face more clearly the smile sent cold shivers down my spine be nice for an old man to have both his sons with him for a while and if i dont take the job he looked at me the smile gone and the blue eyes hard you will he said it emphatically youve no alternative and nor have i in view of some of the questions youve been asking you cant keep your mouth shut and if the police got hold of you i cant risk that he was frowning the scars showing in the glow of the peat fire and then theres that girl of yours he added i dont know whatyouve told her about me but if she were to learn that you had found me still alive and here at burra firth he moved slowly to the door think about it my boy youre committed now youre one of us he was at the door then and he smiled at me just remember that and he nodded good night i couldnt help it i suddenly blurted out so youre the organizer are you they sent you here to organize the organizer of what the oil my voice faltered before his steady gaze oh i dont know i said i just thought you should have learned by now to keep your thoughts to yourself and he turned and went out leaving the door open behind him i dont know whether he meant it as a warning or whether he was simply giving me the benefit of his own experience i heard the sound of his voice then the tap of his stick the slow tread of his feet on the stairs and i went out into the other room to find ian sandford waiting for me the others had gone and he was alone well now youve talked to him do you want the job he was smiling a gleam of humour he says you can have it if you like you do what he tells you do you he laughed sometimes why didnt you offer me a job that day you took me down to see the duchess didnt know anything about you did i besides im just the old mans bastard makes a difference doesnt it i didnt know i said well now you do he turned and reached for the bottle on the table like another drink before you go no thanks but he poured it all the same handing me the glass and topping up his own heres to our better acquaintance he was grinning i raised my glass perfunctorily the whisky raw in my throat and my mind on the future he said you needed a skipper to run supplies to a rig on the dunlin he nodded deepwater iv thats right youd be skippering the mary jane thats the boat ive taken on charter the usual diesel job about sixtyfive feet long registered tonnage fortyfive he finished his drink the old man said youd like to sleep on it why offer the job to me i asked he shrugged why not youre my halfbrother he was grinning again theres always fiddles running supplies for big contractors whose only concern is speed so keep it in the family thats what i say makes sense doesnt it maybe i muttered and i put my glass down ill be going now he nodded seeing me to the door the lamp in his hand and the likeness to his mother very pronounced ill see you in the morning he said the door closed and i was alone in that strange twilit world that was neither day nor night with the glimmer of water lapping the rocks below me the moon was just rising ragged patches of cloud drifting across it and a glimpse of stars i walked slowly back up the track going over in my mind that strange meeting and feeling trapped trapped by the sort of person i was and by the system which didnt allow me to escape from my own past the things i had done before i turned to the sea if only they would leave me alone but i knew they wouldnt and now my own father the man whose past i had come north to seek for support for strength and he was there in that straggle of buildings a part of the net that had closed around me what had he been doing all those years he hadnt said of course he had evaded all my questions but instinctively i knew some deep communication between us that plaque that quote from browning it still applied a man deeply unhappy alone and embattled within himself it wasnt just the face the terrible twisted features i had seen it in his eyes he too was unable to escape the things he had thought and done as a young man i felt weighed down utterly crushed by this glimpse of an older distorted reflection of myself my god was this the road he had trod drifting along the line of least resistance and myself doing the same knowing what my answer would be i had known it ever since he had offered me the job i couldnt face another court the police prison and my own world against me anything was better than that even working with that little bastard sandford i laughed at that laughed so loud i frightened a seabird from the verges of loch of cliff the shadow of it taking wing against the clouds if only i were a bird and could take wing but i was grounded and the earth hard and hostile his face grinning in the lamplight i reached the cottage at last and went to bed alone and my mind in a turmoil of selfhate as it had so often been i couldnt sleep and the moon came clear its shadows moving slowly across the tiny room with its sloping ceiling close under the eaves two days later i took over the mary jane in balta sound she was a typical island fishing boat her wooden hull painted black two tallish masts and a neat little white wooden wheelhouse the crew were all shetlanders and she stank of fish we hosed her out and scrubbed her down but in the three and a half months i operated her for the sandford supply coy we never entirely got rid of the smell and i suspect that everything we carried out to deepwater iv particularly the meat became tainted in the course of the passage in all that time i had no word from gertrude ian had delivered the land rover back to her and when she had read my letter she had just taken the keys and slammed the door in his face i hadnt expected her to understand how could she when i didnt understand myself all the labour of getting that trawler back into service the problems and difficulties we had faced together the shared experience of that one night all thrown away i had asked her to phone me but i knew she wouldnt it was finished an episode the reality was here on this scruffy boat with a bunch of men who among themselves talked a language that was almost foreign even jamie the mate who came from yell at first we loaded at toft on the mainland side of yell sound later when ian learned that the police were satisfied i had shipped out in some trawler we loaded direct at lerwick to save the cost of the truck journey north he was careful with his money the only new piece of equipment on the boat a shiptoshore radio and he had a signwriter paint the name of his company on each side of the wheelhouse he was inordinately proud of the fact that he was chairman and managing director of the sandford supply coy ltd it was a fairly good summer for weather and with not even a gale to relieve the monotony i seemed to live in a sort of vacuum unconscious of the world outside once when we were in lerwick i took a taxi out to the taing but the house was locked the voe empty so presumably it was true what jamie had heard that the duchess had gone back to her old trade of fishing and gertrude with her we listened to the radio a lot and sometimes i heard the news but it didnt seem real little but gloom and violence and north sea oil the only ray of hope they seemed to think the drillers could magic the stuff ashore and in the utopia that would follow inflation and unrest would disappear in a cloud of fairy smoke at the end of august i think it was ian came on the r t to tell me north star had drilled another dry hole and the very next day on our way into lerwick i heard on the radio that half the board of vfi had resigned a fortnight later the results of the dti enquiry came right at the beginning of the news bulletin the companys licence to operate as a bank under section revoked and the report such a damning indictment that i wondered where villiers would find the money to go on drilling his vfi shares almost worthless now and his financial reputation equally low and then deepwater iv reached her planned depth in a dry hole and we stayed with her on standby for the three days it took them to clear the seabed and move to the nearby cormorant field she was on summer contract only up here in northern waters for she was one of the new generation of drilling ships that maintain station over the drill site with variable direction screws linked to a computer beamed on the seabed no cumbersome equipment like north star no anchors no cables and winches it was impressive to see the economy of time as she moved from dunlin to cormorant the divers down in their bell the instant she was locked on to the seabed sonar and no supply ships risking mens lives and costing money to anchor her as soon as she was spudded in we were relieved by a large trawler the deepwater contractors were operating for a different consortium now and a spanking new supply ship straight from a norwegian yard began ferrying sealed containers of food with the drill pipe and other equipment we were out of a job and ian ordered us back to balta sound during the whole of this period i had only seen him twice on each occasion he had been in lerwick for a meeting of the zetland council and he had had little time to spare for us coming on board for a quick look around and then leaving in a hurry as soon as i produced my list of requirements but at balta sound he sat down in the wheelhouse and went through my whole list agreeing almost everything have you had a win on the pools or what i asked him ive been badgering you for new warps new anchor chain think i didnt look the boat over before i chartered her my sarcasm seemed to have caught him on the raw for his voice was tense as he went on youve never worked an island fishing boat before distant water thats all youve known and a wealthy company to foot the bills he leaned towards me speaking very loudly the way some people speak to a foreigner i grew up in the postwar years when every penny counted and everything was scarce if you wanted something then you looked around until you found it or made do with something else even though it was rusty as hell or halfrotted through with damp thats the world i grew up in and thats why i dont throw my money around and then with something near to a sneer he added but i dont expect you to understand that your world was very different you never had to scrimp and save not in the home you grew up in not then i said but ive made up for it since he grinned and that made me like him a little better well nobody gets it good all the time not even men like villiers they say hes bust if north star doesnt hit it with the next hole then youll have two boats out of a job oh not me i got other jobs lined up for them and theres always the fishing to fall back on he got to his feet lets have a word with harry priest now he says he needs at least a week to do a complete overhaul on that clappedout old engine of ours well he can have it a week but thats all what about spares or is that the owners responsibility no its mine now he said the boats no longer under charter ive bought her there was pride in the way he said it an air of cockiness and i laughed seeing him in his own imagination already halfway to rivalling the big greek shipowners whos paying for it i asked your father the old man he shook his head borrow from the masses thats what he says banks insurance companies pension funds or from the oil companies never risk your own capital hes a shrewd old devil but just not interested not for himself anyway is it that easy to borrow money now i was thinking of all the problems we had had with the duchess he grinned at me it is so long as the boats earn more than my backer charges in interest i asked him if his backer was a local man but he shook his head a property dealer from the south who likes playing around with boats there was a note of envy in his voice its just a leisure occupation like birdwatching is to some of the visitors i used to have goes out periodically and tries new ways of fishing whenever hes up in shetland on business owns some land on sullom voe and with all the oil companies negotiating for terminal facilities well it helps my being on the council is that how you met him through your work on the council no it was the old man he put me in touch with him but when i asked his name he closed up on me and got to his feet none of your business he said sharply as though afraid i was about to steal the source of his capital he poked his head out of the wheelhouse door calling for harry priest he was about two hours on board and when i saw him over the side we were anchored off at the time he said see harry keeps at it a week thats all youve got then youll relieve island girl i stared at him and he nodded thats right on standby to north star ive had to send the other boat down to lerwick for repairs damaged herself alongside one of the supply ships and sprang a leak he jumped down into the row boat see you in a few days time that night i lay in my bunk listening to the lap of the water against the wooden sides conscious of the quiet on board with all the crew except priest gone to their homes and wondering who wanted me back with north star and why an accident ian had said the island girls relief boat damaged and he had bought the mary jane on the old mans advice was ian sandford just an unwitting pawn in a game he didnt understand or was it all in my imagination the feeling that i was cast in the role of scapegoat in the week that followed as priest overhauled his engine and new gear came aboard i thought a lot about that halfbrother of mine and the strange father we shared i could have taken time off and gone to see him at burra firth but i didnt somehow i couldnt face him again that twisted face the fact is i was scared of him we sailed on rd october and ian came down to see us off with two bottles of scotch and instructions that all r t communications were to be handled by jamie does fuller know whos skippering this boat i asked him no and if he did he wouldnt care hes got other things to worry about with men leaving and difficulty with mud and other supplies everything is in short supply and startrion has to compete with companies that carry a lot more weight he shrugged when i asked him why men were leaving they say the rigs bad luck and the man driving them a jonah ed wiseberg you mean thats right and villierss name stinks you realize my name is on the ships papers i said he laughed nobodys going to look at them not with the heat on and those that have agreed to stick it out on north star hellbent to grab the bonuses theyve been promised it was getting late in the season too late i thought for an old rig anchored in those waters north star was farther north and a lot farther west than transocean iii when she went down they must pull out soon but he shook his head not till theyve drilled hole no theres even talk that theyll stay out there all winter if necessary he finished his whisky and pushed open the door of the wheelhouse anyway not your worry and not mine he held out his hand to me something he had never done before have a good trip and stay off the r t it gives them confidence if they hear only shetland voices it was a dull grey morning with a light rain falling as we headed out round the nev turning north to take the tide round the top of unst the glass was falling the forecast bad and by nightfall we were bucking a heavy sea it was dawn before we sighted north star the rig slowly coming up over the horizon and the waves breaking in a white smother of foam against the columns of her legs long before we had reached the eastward anchor buoys island girl met us the skipper wishing us joy of it over the loudhailer as he steamed past i left jamie to talk to him keeping out of sight until he was well past us headed for scalloway with the wind behind him we had an uncomfortable week of it doing the round of the buoys rolling our guts out and lying hoveto headtowind as a series of small fronts passed through rattler did not come out once during the whole week the sea was too rough for her to lie stemon to the rig and anyway they were fishing for a broken bit we heard about it over the radio van dam trying to explain the holdup to fuller and then late on the monday morning when they had started drilling again i picked up villierss voice clear and very controlled wanting to know how long before they reached depth and van dam answering two weeks maybe if ve dont ave no more trouble information like that given over an open line to london indicated the urgency of villierss situation nobody had any time now for lifting and relaying the windward anchors i had jamie check with the barge engineer on duty it hadnt been done since they had spudded in on the new location and when i did manage to get a proper fix i found they were well to the west of the first drill position the water was deeper the risk greater and the summer gone now they were into the period of deepening depressions and stronger winds no time for a small supply ship like rattler to be fooling around with anchors and it would probably mean hanging off the drilling string in case north star dragged a man as desperate as villiers must be to go on drilling into the start of winter would hardly tolerate such an apparently unnecessary delay the wind turned northerly at the end of the week and when island girl relieved us on the saturday morning the sky was clear and cold with crossseas breaking on the westerly swell she came close alongside and the skipper shouted across to jamie yere to proceed to rispond in northwest scotland to pick up some equipment ian sandfords orders therell be a lorry on the jetty there at hours tomorrow evening three cases and youre to deliver them back to burra firth okay jamie nodded and swung the helm turning away to the south fortunately we had chart on board and jamie knew the place a wee gut they used to call the port o the north ah knew a man once who could remember the time when they sailed open boats oot of rispond round john o groats and all down the east coast to great yarmouth for the fishing aye they wore like vikings hard boggers all of them rispond was a tiny inlet on the northwestern point of loch eriboll completely sheltered from the north and east the distance was about miles i had the engineer check our fuel there was plenty to get us there but not enough to get us back to burra firth well be able to take on diesel at kinlochbervie priest said they all seemed to know the area running south that evening the crew grumbling about how they could have been coming into scalloway with the prospect of four days ashore i wondered why ian was sending one of his boats all the way to scotland to pick up a few cases when it would have been so much cheaper to ship them up in the steamer from aberdeen and why such a tiny unfrequented little gut you go in on the top of the tide jamie had said youve got to an if ye cant load the cases fast then yere stuck there for twelve hours dried out alongside a bit of a stone jetty i didnt like it kinlochbervie would have made more sense unless there was something about those cases and secrecy of prime importance but at least we were running with the cold north wind up the old girls skirts and we made fast time of it arriving at the entrance to loch eriboll shortly after the wind had backed westerly and we lay hoveto under the lee waiting for the tide to make the sky had already clouded over and as the daylight began to fade mists came down thick over the flanks of creag na faoilinn to form a black mass at the bottom of the loch shortly before seven oclock we began closing the entrance to the little bolthole nosing very slowly into the gut till we could see the small stone jetty and a trade van waiting at least ian had got his timing right the tide now almost at the full but even at high water it was still only a gut the rocks closed in on either side as we crept forward watching the echosounder and then we were through the rocks and there was a house a nice house standing white beyond the jetty with a gravel drive and a bit of a lawn right beside the water a man got out of the van as our bows touched the stonework he took our warps and told us to hurry he sounded nervous theres the cases he had the doors open before we had made fast and when we had got the cases aboard he made me sign for them and then he was into his van and away a mick jamie said and spat i looked at the cases all three of them had handle with care stencilled in black across the top and marine electronics on the side better get them below they werent heavy enough to contain explosives but all the same i wanted them out of sight time enough to consider what was in them when we were out of the gut i let jamie handle her and he worked her on a springer round the end of the jetty until our bows were facing outwards and then we steamed out on a stern bearing the break of our wash against the rocks unpleasantly loud we lay the night under an t aigeach and in a cold green cloudless dawn we hugged the coast round cape wrath taking advantage of the constant westgoing stream and carried a fair tide southward to loch inchard coming into kinlochbervie sutherland looking a wild land with the great humps of arkle and ben stack looming over the end of the loch i was very conscious that i was in mainland britain now not in the remotest islands of the north it was the first time in over four months and i felt suddenly uneasy as the little port opened up to the north and we turned in to drop our hook astern of two scottish trawlers there were others moored along the quay a line of buildings and more activity than i had expected i sent jamie ashore to see about refuelling and he came back with the information that the two trawlers anchored ahead of us were waiting to refuel and more expected that evening ah told him wed only be alongside a few minutes just for water and fuel and he agreed to squeeze us in if those two boggers dont take all afternoon we had a meal and hung around waiting until shortly after five when the second of the two trawlers pulled away from the quay and we were signalled in we had barely got the fuel line aboard when a brand new trawler with flared bows steamed in a sister ship close behind her they had fish to land and they lay close off the quay their engines throbbing gently in the evening stillness by six we were anchored off again there was a mission for deep sea fishermen on the quay and i sent the crew ashore in the boat they needed a break and i wanted to be alone as soon as they had gone i went down into the hold it was dark down there the fish smell lingering and in the beam of my torch the three cases looked strangely menacing alone there in the dark hollow of that empty space i stood staring at them for a long time wondering what the hell they contained where they had come from there was only one way to find out and i got a hammer and cold chisel and went to work they were nailfastened and no possibility of breaking into them without it showing but by then i didnt care i had to see what was inside the result was puzzling the first case contained what appeared to be some sort of radio equipment a grey metal box with tuning dials and an electrical lead neatly coiled the whole thing carefully packed in a moulded plastic container the second contained a completely sealed torpedoshaped object there was a large towing eye at one end it was swivelled and had an electrical socket in the centre of the eye the case also contained a heavy reel of plasticcoated wire one end of it fitted with a watertight plug i stood there for a long time staring down at those two pieces of equipment in the light of my torch against the rough boards stained black with fish oil they had a deadly futuristic gleam or was that my imagination again explanations leapt to mind i knew nothing about electronics but the torpedo was obviously for towing behind a vessel and the other for sending or receiving some sort of signal it could be some advanced scientific way of locating a shoal of fish in which case marine electronics was a fair description i was remembering what ian had said about his backer trying new ways of fishing remembering too what had happened out there by north star in june it was four months ago now but the memory was still vivid this sort of equipment could equally be for locating something on the seabed an anchor for instance or a wellhead after the rig had left the site or broken adrift in the end i packed them back in their cases and nailed the boxes down again i did it as neatly as i could but the marks of the chisel were there for anyone to see and the wood was split in places i didnt bother about the third case and when i went up on deck glad to be in the fresh air again i was sweating several more trawlers had come in i lit my pipe and sat on the bulwarks staring across at the fights on the quay thinking about north star out there to the west of shetland a trawler was pulling away from the quay another nosing into the vacant berth but my mind was so engrossed in considering whether the equipment we carried in our hold was connected in any way with the future of the rig that it was some time before the shape of that trawler registered as familiar and then suddenly i was on my feet staring across the water at her as she moored alongside the quay she was against the lights in silhouette her hull black as the water that separated us but when you have worked on the hull of a ship when you know every inch of her you cannot mistake her lines no doubt at all it was the duchess lying there against the quay and my boat ashore no means of getting to her i forgot about marine electronics after that i was thinking of gertrude of what i would say to her when we met would she slam the door in my face and if she didnt what then all the explanations the fight to try and clear myself nothing else would do i knew that and suddenly i realized she was the crossroads in my life she was the focal point of all my doubts the centre around which i could rebuild my life if i had the guts the boat came back about ten oclock by then the duchess was anchored off and i had drunk a lot of whisky i decided to leave it till morning in the morning i would be sober enough and clearheaded enough to face her but when i went across to her in the cold grey light of dawn her decks were deserted the other trawlers had all gone or were getting under way but the duchess lay there silent and asleep nobody answered my hail and when i climbed on board and went through the starboard gangway into what had been my cabin it was empty her things were there her clothes in the locker but the bunk had not been slept in i routed johan out and he stared at me as though i were a ghost wheres gertrude i asked him ashore he growled at the hotel no she is gone to inverness i felt at a loss utterly deflated the confrontation for which i had prepared myself was suddenly not there what the hells she doing in inverness a message we have over the r t when we are fishing and there was hostility in his voice as he added it is about you so we have to haul our gear and come in here about me ja what was the message that is for gertrude to say i hesitated but it was obvious i wouldnt get anything more out of him the relationship i had so carefully built up with the big norwegian was gone now i left him and went back to my boat i didnt even bother to leave a note i had nothing to say and not much hope that he would have delivered it anyway we sailed immediately and as we motored out i could see the crew of the duchess my crew all the old faces standing on the deck staring at us we passed less than half a cable from her her hull showing streaks of rust her superstructure dirty with lack of paint and there was a green fringe of weed along her waterline i would have given anything to be back on board her it was a grey dirty morning with cloud low on the sutherland hills and it stayed grey all the thirtynine hours it took us to raise the light on muckle flugga the time would have been about tenthirty a pitch black night and we lay hoveto with a good offing till dawn by then we had the tide against us so that it was an unpleasant passage until we were out of the stream and into the quiet of burra firth ian came off as soon as we had anchored to check the cases i left him to go down into the hold on his own and jamie followed him a few minutes later he came storming up into the wheelhouse banging the door to behind him theres two of them been broken into jamie says it was you i nodded he had discovered it when they had lashed the cases down on our way out of loch inchard why did you do it they might have contained contraband or explosives explosives he snorted you have the most fertile imagination why send me all the way down to scotland for them if you own a ship you might as well make use of her he snapped and its not for you to query your orders or break into cargo youd no right it would have been a lot cheaper to have them sent up on the boat from aberdeen and a lot slower why the hurry because dillon is due up here this weekend hes my backer hes had this equipment made specially and he wants to try it out where how should i know wherever theres fish thats where he turned to the door and a shaft of watery sunlight showed as he opened it ive told jamie the men can go ashore as soon as they like theyre due a few days rest what about the cases theyll remain on board an engineer will be out shortly to install the equipment and dont go monkeying around with it when the crew have gone and youre on your own he left me then and i sat there smoking my pipe and wondering what sort of a man dillon would prove to be and how he was going to get a weekends fishing with the crew gone to their homes and only myself on board later i went out to see the men away in the boat the sun was glinting on the water and the old man sitting on the bench outside the hotel the left side of his face was in shadow so that he looked like any harmless old gentleman taking the sun he was so still i thought he must be asleep but when i looked at him through the glasses i could see his eyes watching me below the hooded lids and his lips were moving as though he were mumbling something to himself i could have hailed him and asked to be brought ashore was that what he wanted i could almost feel him willing me to come to him it would have been the natural thing for me to do but in other circumstances what would be the point now to resume our probing of each other i sat on the deck in the sunshine my back against the side of the wheelhouse it was warm and i closed my eyes but i couldnt sleep too many thoughts were chasing through my mind the sun went in and i wished i had gone ashore to stretch my legs on the steep slopes behind the hotel i could have walked across mouslee hill to goturms hole perhaps had a word with robert bruce bored with myself i went into the wheelhouse and switched on the r t almost without thinking i turned to the frequency used by north star but there was no traffic probably i was too far away and i began idly playing with the dial picking up scraps of talk but all very faint and then suddenly a voice said through a blur of static ready for me i was almost on the frequency for the norwick voice channel and something about that voice made me hurriedly adjust the tuning i went too far and missed something but then the same voice came in loud and clear the hurry where are you speaking from i knew who it was then that slight lisp the ferry have ian meet me in the land rover and hes to take the boat back to lerwick tell him as a member of the council thats where he should be now got it and then a different voice came on thank you norwick thats all over and out i switched the set off and stood there thinking about that scrap of conversation dillon presumably and in a hurry to get to the mary jane why i was still thinking about that when the inflatable came alongside ian was at the outboard and another man in the bows he was young with a wisp of a beard and shoulderlength hair blowing in the breeze under a grey woolly cap he looked like a student his eyes magnified by round glasses as he handed a metal toolcase up to me the old man wants to see you ian said to me as the engineer climbed aboard i hesitated torn between a desire to talk to the man who had come to install the equipment and the urge to get ashore all right i said and got my anorak from the wheelhouse but when i joined him in the boat he knew nothing about the telephone conversation he had only just got back from haroldswick we landed on the little beach at fiska wick and walked to the hotel the old man was waiting for me in the room where we had talked before there was a peat fire still glowing in the grate and the single window looked out on to the green slopes of the hill behind he fixed ian with his eyes a hard flat stare waiting until he had left and the door closed behind him then he turned to me and said its some months now since we had our first talk now its time for you to reach a decision he was silent a moment trying no doubt to think how best to put it to me but i didnt give him the opportunity was that dillon on the phone a while back he looked surprised and when i explained that i had picked up the conversation on the boats radio he said then you know what that north star has struck oil chapter three the news came as a shock we had had our first flurry of snow the previous evening and there had been a drift of white on hermaness hill as we had come into burra firth winter here and north star striking oil everything suddenly come at once and my father demanding i make a decision what decision but i knew i could see it in his cold blue nordic eyes who is this man dillon i asked him and i think i knew that too youll be meeting him in a few hours a property man ian said with an interest in fishing but its not fishing is it the equipment in those cases you broke into them why i dont think he expected an answer and after a moment he said sit down he waved me to a seat on the far side of the fire then slumped into the wing chair theres no more time his voice was so quiet it was almost a whisper and there was a look of weariness on his face i wish now you hadnt come he gave a little shrug i suppose it was inevitable but he took out a packet of cigarettes and lit one twisting his mouth around it i could have wished it had been some other time its north star is that what youre trying to tell me he didnt answer sitting there watching me you have to make up your mind now what are you planning to do but he ignored that ive given you a job kept you clear of the police what are you planning to do i repeated thats not for me to say its not my plan once yes but i only came into this because of ian and the hotel here that twisted smile again i hardly expected the two of you and then he said im getting old you see and its been a hard life he seemed to brace himself but im still alive very much alive and hes right we can do a lot with this rig its a very good situation if its handled right and it will be his eyes were closed his voice very quiet and i had the feeling he was talking to himself is ian in on this his eyes flicked open good god no of course not he made a dismissive movement of the hand money thats all hes interested in its the beall and endall of his existence the weariness was back in his voice anna was like that under the skin under the lovely bloom of youth he shook his head perhaps thats why i didnt marry her so pretty so sweet but under the skin nothing no love of poetry no inkling of the ideological turmoil the reaching out to the stars his voice faded yet you wrote to her from spain oh yes he smiled she showed it to you did she i nodded and asked you for money i hadnt any he smiled at me and the twisted mouth made a mockery of it youre different arent you different stock and you had it as a child money i mean you could afford to turn your back on it nobody can buy you did you buy ian yees i suppose you could call it that to what end and when he didnt say anything i told him how we had sighted island girl that night the rig had had her windward anchor cables cut there was no other vessel there so ian must have been responsible but he shook his head ian wasnt on board dillon he nodded its not fishing hes interested in then its sabotage there was a long pause and he sat there drawing on his cigarette and staring at me its a rough world he said very quietly the peculiar lisp coming through strongly some day man will learn to organize it so that he can live in peace but not yet you have to accept that you have to accept the reality of the world in which you live he leaned forward his voice urgent life is a battlefield a political struggle you see and were all a part of that struggle we take sides get involved his cigarette stabbed at the air you me all of us you made your decision you involved yourself just as i did and now you cant escape that involvement now he paused breathless and i said what are you trying to tell me that i should be a party to locating a wellhead and then destroying it his eyes widened slightly and i thought i had guessed the purpose of that equipment a man calling himself stevens followed me into foula when i was skipper of the duchess and we had the north star contract he said what youve just been saying he said villiers was vulnerable capitalism at its worst and that there was political advantage to be had out of it and with ian on the zetland council my god he had manipulated it all so cleverly and you a shetlander i cried you were born on the west coast are you prepared to see the whole of that coastline scummed with oil a massive pollution that will destroy the livelihood i tell you its a rough world he said sharply and there are always sacrifices think of the loss of life in the war twenty million in russia alone the destruction the appalling conditions and this is war he nodded slowly as good a name for it as any and im to be in the front line with you bringing unnecessary pollution michael you cant help yourself i bloody well can i had got to my feet and stood over him hating him for what he was for what life had done to him youre so twisted in your mind its a pity that shell didnt kill you he sat very still looking up at me and there was something almost pitiable in his expression you didnt mean that and when i remained silent the two of us staring at each other his face gradually hardened thats your answer is it he got slowly to his feet reaching for his stick i had hoped that id cooperate the anger and disgust in my voice seemed to touch him on the raw that youd have more sense he snapped at me and then that strange disfigured face softened again would you like some lunch its almost time no thanks i said ill go for a walk he nodded good idea give you a chance to think it over theres nothing to think over no he smiled well maybe not but just remember what ive said theres no escape the police against you and your ship the only one they know was there when the cables of that rig were cut go for your walk and think it over your liberty your future he left it at that still smiling and a devil lurking in his eyes as though in me he saw a reflection of himself come back not later than five dillon will be here then and well be running tests in the firth before dark and he added the north star strike is only a rumour based on core samples flown to aberdeen theres still some time yet still time i went out on to the track and walked slowly back to fiska wick the little beach was empty the inflatable gone and the water was like lead under a leaden sky i went out on to the ness where i could see the mary jane lying like a black rock against the pale glint of the water she was swinging to the tide the inflatable snugged against her side and the cases were all on deck the engineer and another man opening them up and getting the equipment into the wheelhouse i watched for a while but it was cold and no way of getting out to her so i turned to the slopes behind and began climbing mouslee hill regretting now that i had refused the offer of lunch still time he had said and i could claim that he misled me but it wouldnt be true where a decision is required the fault lies always in ourselves from my experience of the sea i should have known that mistakes compound to produce disasters the mistake i made that afternoon was to do nothing there were things i could have done i could have gone into haroldswick and phoned the police or made an anonymous call like the bombers do i could have gone aboard the ferry and radioed to north star direct or i could have simply gone to bruces cottage and lain low there watching to see what happened but instead i did nothing i couldnt make up my mind i walked west across the backs of the hills to the high bold cliffs of tonga not a soul to be seen not even bruce and conscious all the time of the solitude the remoteness of this wild northern land and of my own isolation i stood for a while on the peat moss slopes above tonga stack which is joined to the land and north and south of me there were other isolated stacks with the seas breaking against them birds everywhere the air flecked white and shrill with their cries and below me the water seethed a chill northwesterly wind churning the flood tide into a welter of overfalls the wildness and the solitude were overwhelming it was not the place to consider the merits of political activities and the role of economic warfare in an industrial society here only the elements counted nothing else i walked south across libbers hill and sneuga as far as the brough on flubersgerdie and all the time i was walking i had the feeling that nothing beyond the peat moss hills and the distant glimpses of granite cliffs had any reality under that vast expanse of grey sky here was nothing made by man nothing controlled by man all was free and uncontaminated and power lay in the wind in the drive of the great depressions endlessly marching up to the white fish grounds from their birthplace far out in the atlantic i was tired and hungry and no nearer a decision when i came down the slopes above fiska wick the mary jane looking like a toy ship in the pale slash of the firth the inflatable was back on the beach the land rover backed up and two men loading cardboard boxes they were the same two i had seen when i had first come to root stacks and they were waiting for me as i came down the beach will you be going aboard now the irishman asked they were standing in the water in their sea boots ready to push off the old man said to take you out if you wanted has dillon arrived but he only motioned me to get in the two of them holding the tubed sides to steady the boat it was only when we were under way that i realized they had their own gear with them youre going out tonight then i had to shout to make myself heard above the noise of the outboard the quiet bearded man nodded he was lying sprawled across the stores spray whipping over him as the laden boat slapped into the wavelets if everything works all right i asked him what his name was but he just stared at me he had a soft gentle face very full in the cheeks he didnt look like a seaman more like an intellectual a teacher possibly a writer or a lecturer and there was a tenseness about him his brown eyes staring the engineer was waiting for us as the outboard died and we came alongside there was a big fair man with him they called him the swede and the way he grabbed the painter and made us fast i knew he was used to boats i gave them a hand with the cases and when it was all on deck the outboard started up again the swede casting off and the inflatable swinging away from the side and heading back for the wick i went straight to the wheelhouse but the door was locked the engineer stood watching me wheres the key i asked him in my pocket give it to me i said you dont keep me out of my own wheelhouse he backed away at the tone of my voice you dont give orders youre not the skipper now he said it with the truculence of a young man who resented all authority i held out my hand give me that key but the swede moved between us and his hand closed on my arm holding me gripped nobody goes into the wheelhouse now only mr dillon i stepped back and the grip on my arm relaxed when will dillon be here i asked the man with the beard glanced at his watch and said in a voice that was as gentle as his manner any minute now the engineer brushed past me i got to get the engine warmed up and he disappeared down the afterhatch the other two began humping the stores below and i went with them to the little galley the diesel started into life as i was cutting myself a hunk of bread and some ham i was still eating when i heard the outboard alongside and the clatter of feet on deck i poked my head up out of the afterhatch to see the swede making fast the outboard stopped abruptly and a dark face with lank black hair appeared above the bulwarks he might have been a south american indian or perhaps he was arab it was difficult to tell against the leaden glimmer of the water as he vaulted on board and then he leaned over to help my father up the old man steadied himself against the wheelhouse looking at me and breathing a little fast i was told you were here the grimace of a smile came and went im glad and for the first time i saw a glimmer of warmth in his eyes he turned at the sound of a voice and his hand reached out to my arm a restraining gesture i could see paddys face as he stood holding the boat alongside and another man just swinging his leg over the bulwarks his back towards me he was wearing a dark blue anorak with a shetland wool cap on his head dillon the old man murmured in my ear and there was a note of warning the man turned and i was looking at the hard set face the cold elusive eyes i had last seen at foula you know each other i think my father said dillon nodded staring at me stonily and i thought he smiled but i couldnt be sure the tightlipped mouth compressed so youre coming with us my mouth was dry and i didnt answer wondering if he knew how the sight of him affected me the feeling of being trapped his wandering gaze appeared to fasten on my father hes your responsibility he said not mine there was a note of censure in his voice then he turned to me the hard mouth smiling grimly as he said no doubt well find a use for you he seemed amused but there was a tenseness about him and then the engineer was there and the two of them went into the wheelhouse in less than ten minutes the inflatable was lashed to the stern the anchor up and we were moving down the firth the man with the dark indian features in the wheelhouse connecting up the electronic gear just beyond the fidd they streamed the little torpedo like a tin fish from the stern letting it out on a terylene line and unreeling the wire connecting it with the transmitter we motored almost to the entrance then slowed to take bearings the old man came and stood beside me you dont like him do you the straight line of our wake was bending now as the mary jane swung away in a wide circle no i said you should try to hide your feelings more why hes one of our top men we were standing in the shelter of the wheelhouse facing the stern and i watched as we completed the turn whats his background a professional like myself but the right age and the right time too democracy finished all the countries of the west even america degenerate and vulnerable we were headed north again the speed picking up and the beat of the engine increasing wheres he come from i asked what nationality scotsirish started in the midlothian coalfields moved to liverpool docks hes politically astute and quite ruthless remember that and do what he says i thought i detected a note of respect of envy even as though in the pecking order of that shadowy world to which they both belonged my father knew his place the wake was straightening out now and i kept my eyes on the pale taut line to the submerged torpedo somebody joined us from the wheelhouse but i didnt shift my gaze if the marine electronics gear was some sort of an impulse transmitter then i knew what to expect and i wanted to see it the light was fading the clouds very louring and suddenly our wake erupted in a jet of spray the sea heaving beneath it then the shock wave of the seabed explosion hit the soles of my feet as it had done that night in the duchess out by no buoy i turned my head it was dillon standing beside me a quiet look of satisfaction on his face our eyes met and he nodded north star he said and there was tension in his voice the charges are already laid and he added sharply a job you could have done the anchor cables again i was thinking of the rig adrift in a big sea and the driller working in a frenzy to disconnect the marine riser there are safety devices i said pipe rams blind shears the whole emergency disconnect drill he nodded i havent wasted my time in aberdeen i guess i know almost as much as a driller about how the blowout preventer works but it takes time and theres always the human factor so youre going for pollution youre going to try and flood the whole sea with oil he looked at me that thinlipped smile and a sardonic note in his voice as he said still worrying about moral principles he clapped me on the back the only time i had seen him in high good humour with luck well set that rig adrift at the critical moment when theyre testing for pressure and you can watch it the smile vanished tension in his voice again but dont try to interfere and stay out of the wheelhouse darkness was falling as we turned west under muckle flugga we were very crowded with only two on watch and the tiered bunks all occupied i couldnt sleep for thinking how utterly defenceless that rig was a sitting duck to the heterogeneous group we had on board the forecast had not been very good a cold front passing through and a deepening depression moving in from the atlantic about i went up on deck the wind was nornorwesterly force a beam sea and the old girl rolling like a cow i found the man with the dark indian face clinging to the rail capping of the bulwark and shivering uncontrollably he was moaning and when i asked him if he was all right he only groaned and retched with a rasping empty sound into the back of a breaking wave as it rolled under us whats your name i asked him paulo he gasped wheres your home mexico he pronounced the x as an h so that i didnt get it at first and when i asked him what he was doing over here he looked up at me his face green in the starboard navigation light his teeth showing in the flash of an exhausted smile you are not a freedom fighter or you know we are international like a a club eh the boat swooped sickeningly on the long atlantic swell twisting and rolling as her bows ploughed into the sea white water creaming past stars showed through ragged gaps in the clouds and it was cold i got him into the wheelhouse and he leaned shivering against the side of it paddy was at the wheel nobody else there this your first trip i asked him he shook his head speechless youre the electronics expert are you he stared at me uncomprehendingly the bows slammed down spray slashing at the windows and above the roar of the water i heard paddys voice youre not supposed to be here i looked at him at the tough lowbrowed unimaginative features he might have gone overboard sure and he never has hes always sick the first few hours hes done this trip before has he there was no answer and i turned to the mexican how many times he was still shivering his brown features a sick grey two times he murmured why what do you do he frowned in concentration youre an expert at what ah si the teeth flashed explosives i am trained in explosives i glanced at the impulse transmitter at the back of the wheelhouse and the vessel yawed as paddy left the wheel you better get out now we stared at each other but he was a compact powerfullybuilt man watch your helm i said as the bows fell away in the trough the top of a swell breaking against our starboard side solid water crashing against the wheelhouse okay you steer then i took the wheel and he lit a cigarette standing right behind me youve been a trawlerman have you i asked coasters but he wouldnt say what run or where he came from and after a while i handed the wheel back to him and went below to my bunk that short spell at the helm the feel of the boat under my hands had relaxed me and i slept i woke to a change in the motion it was just after and we were hoveto the light was on and i heard somebody moving in the bunk below me i stayed there wrapped in the cocoon of my blankets my eyes closed and unwilling to stir twelve hours just about the time we should reach north star but there was no movement on deck and when i did open my eyes all the bunks were occupied only my father getting into his clothes are we there i asked him not yet we wait here till nightfall and then we relieve island girl so i still had a whole day i closed my eyes again sleepless now and wondering what the hell i was going to do what could i do and cutting the rig adrift wouldnt necessarily result in massive pollution i didnt know much about drilling operations but i had seen the blowout preventer panel in the toolpushers office i had seen how quickly they had been able to operate the pipe rams to hold the drill string suspended in the hole that night the windward anchor cables had been cut there had been a strong wind then now there was very little i knew that by the feel of the boat she was rolling to the swell but that was all i turned over away from the light and dozed for a while it was eightthirty when i finally got up only two of the bunks occupied now and the ship still hoveto with the engine running slow there was coffee on the galley stove eggs and bacon beside the pan i was just sitting down to my breakfast when paulo came down feeling better i asked him he nodded okay now whats happening on deck nothing they wait to make a radio telephone to the other sheep what time ninethirty he went past me through the door we had cut in the bulkhead to the hold he had a torch and a plastic case that looked as though it contained tools i finished my breakfast then went through into the hold to see what he was up to he was crouched over a butane gas cylinder screwing a plug into the head of it where the control valve is normally sited just behind him was another cylinder with two wires trailing from it what is it a depth charge it had to be something like that he looked up at me puzzled detonator he said pointing to the head of the cylinder he was working on an underwater bomb his eyes shifted nervously the whites showing in the torchlight bomb yes whats it for i was thinking of the force that would be generated by gelignite or even a homemade explosive packed into such strong cylinders and the inflatable still with us lashed to the stern they could float the cylinders down in that and if they were detonated against the riser when oil was coming up the pipe on full pressure i was suddenly very scared seeing in my imagination the vast explosive burnup the whole rig engulfed in a searing mass of flame christ almighty i exclaimed you cant just think i had reached down gripping hold of his shoulder there are more than sixty men but he had leaped from under my grasp a reflex action like a coiled spring triggered at the touch of my hand the torch blinded me but i saw the knife in his hand heard the tension in his voice as he hissed you go please he was poised like a man cornered its all right i said soothingly i didnt mean to alarm you but he just stood there the steel blade of the knife glinting in the torch beam and in the silence i could feel the tautness of his nerves i turned with deliberate slowness anxious not to upset him further as i moved to the bulkhead door the skin crawling between my shoulderblades back in the galley i glanced at my watch it was almost ninethirty and i got my anorak and went up on deck to find the sun glimmering through a layer of cirrus the wheelhouse door was closed but through the glass sidepanel i saw they were all there and dillon with the mike of the r t transmitter to his mouth i slid the door open and heard his voice island girl mary jane to island girl come in please island girl over no answer he tried again and then loud and clear over the loudspeaker came a shetland voice identifying himself as island girl and asking why the hell they hadnt been relieved that morning well be with you some time tonight dillon said ill call you again at hours whats the weather like out there over he knew damn well what the weather was like for we must have been just over the horizon from the other boat but he waited while island girls skipper talked about a heavy swell with a layer of cirrus overhead and the mornings weather bulletin forecasting a series of depressions moving in from the atlantic then he asked what was happening on the rig theres rumours ashore that theyve struck oil over aye theres been a great coming and going these last two days theyve been running an electrical log and getting ready for what they call a drill stem test to check the pressure and rate of flow of the oil did you not listen to the news this morning it seems the company announced the strike officially late last night but when dillon asked him whether they had started testing yet he answered not yet but there was a helicopter flight came in yesterday with service company lads theyre running a gun down the hole and theres a bloody great steel boom rigged out over the side ed wiseberg was on the r t to us a few minutes ago warning us to keep clear of it from noon onwards so i reckon youll see some fireworks when you arrive this evening and he added whos that im talking to its not jamie no its his relief dillon said jamie and his lads were due for a bit of a break so youve a different crew eh and the voice went on have you a man called randall with you i heard there was cos the trawler duchess of norfolk arrived last night with gertrude petersen on board asking for him is he there now over the mention of gertrude the memory of that explosives expert crouched over the cylinders i flung the door back dillon denying my presence and my voice shouting im here randall tell ed wiseberg but dillon had dropped the mike grab him i saw paddy with his head low and out of the corner of my eye the big swede and i leaped at dillon in the grip of fear and a sudden terrible desire to smash him before they got me i saw his hand reaching into his anorak his eyes widening and then he ducked my fist caught him on the side of his head slamming him back against the radio i saw him fall a shocked surprised look on his face and then a hand gripped ray shoulder swung me round and something exploded in my belly the swede was a blurred image as i doubled up with the pain and then his fist crashed into my jaw and i lost consciousness the next thing i knew i was being dragged to my feet and a voice dillons voice said something about the chain locker i saw my father the twisted side of his face and his eyes hurt as though in doing what i had i had done him a personal injury he looked at me and didnt say a word no attempt to stop them as i was dragged out of the wheelhouse unconsciousness closed in on me again the pain in my guts overwhelming and when i came to it was in darkness with the hard feel of the anchor chain under me and the occasional slam of the bows reverberating through my head a hanging length of chain sliding across my body i dont know how long i lay there in a half coma dimly conscious of the salt sea smell of the stowage locker and of the links damp and hard against my limbs it was freezing cold and i thanked god for my anorak conscious of the roll and swoop as the boat lay motionless headtoswell but conscious of little else until i had recovered sufficiently to drag myself to my feet and with consciousness i cursed myself for my stupidity for the blind rage which had sent me for dillon i should have gone for the impulse transmitter i should have found something with which to smash it and i cursed myself for not having thrown those cases overboard guessing what they were why in gods name hadnt i got rid of them when i could instead of delivering them to burra firth the excuse of time time on my side christ all my life i seemed to have been living on borrowed time and wiseberg stewart men i had met a total of more than sixty all at risk and myself to blame their executioner no not their executioner but a party to it i stood there in the blackness of the seastinking hole the chain coming down through the hawsepipe coiled like a cold steel snake under my feet and nothing i could do nothing nothing shut in behind a thick barred wooden door in a space i couldnt even stand up in properly my head bowed by the wooden deck beams i sank back on to the dank hard bed of the steel links breathing deeply easing the pain until it was no more than a numb ache time passed slowly the luminous dial of my wristwatch the only visible companion in the darkness and nothing there that i could use on the door nothing to do but wait and waiting my mind focused incessantly on that scene in the hold the cylinders with wires trailing from the detonators a freedom fighter my god what sort of freedom was that to roast sixty innocent men alive increasingly as the power to think returned my mind dwelt on the duchess the knowledge that she was out here fishing in these waters and gertrude asking for me at irregular intervals one or other of the men who had jumped me came into the hold to check the door and make certain i was still there the first few times i answered them demanding water food anything to get a brief respite from the cramped hole but theydidnt even reply and the next time i stayed silent it was paddy and he called me several times then he went away and a few minutes later he came back with the swede the door opening and the beam of a torch blinding me i hesitated and then as i moved the door slammed in my face shortly after midday the door was opened again and a mug of beer with a thick wadge of ham and bread was set down in a coil of the chain the swede watching me all the time i tried asking about the weather anything to get them talking but they didnt answer i knew the weather was worsening there was considerably more movement the bows lifting and falling so violently that at times i had to grip hold of the chain otherwise my body was left suspended for an instant to be slammed down on the hard steel links as we hit the troughs sometimes i thought i could hear the wind i could certainly hear when the seas broke could feel them too as the vessel staggered flinging me against the wooden side of the chain locker it was after a particularly bad slam that the ship came alive with the prop turning the sound of it merging with the increased power from the engine to produce a steady vibration transmitted through the timbers all the rest of that afternoon we were under power in order to stay headtowind and slamming into it like that the swoop and plunge of the bows became unbearably exhaustingly violent i no longer cared about anything all my energies were set on keeping myself from being battered to pieces and then when i thought i could stand it no longer the vibrations of the engine increased and the vertical movement eased changing to a slow deep roll we were under way with the seas almost broadside and through the thickness of the hull i could hear the water hissing and creaming past the time was eight thirtyfour it would be dark now and i thought of the rig again wondering how long it would be before we reached it and what was happening on that huge platform half an hour later the beat of the engine changed it was no longer under power and we lay wallowing with occasional waves breaking aboard i thought we had arrived but then i heard the sound of a much more powerful engine i could hear it very plainly a solid throaty roar magnified by the fact that i was lying below the waterline that too slowed and i thought i heard very faintly the sound of a hail and voices shouting they were still shouting when the churn of a propeller close alongside drowned all sound merging with the heavy beat of an engines exhaust so close beside me and so loud that it seemed like a hammer drill attacking the walls of my prison i thought my eardrums would split it made such a thundering noise then it faded into a churning of water close alongside we lay wallowing in its wash and after a while we got under way again i thought it was island girl that had come alongside us and that we had now taken over the standby duty from her but time passed and we held our course rolling wickedly with the waves breaking against us on the starboard side so that i knew we were steering south we stayed on the same course for almost three hours then the engine slowed and i heard the beat of another boat passing us to port and after that it was all i could do to save myself from injury for the seas were big now and we were headed straight into them the fall and crash of the bows sudden and very violent i heard the sound of movement on deck orders being shouted but only vaguely through the din of the waves and then we turned and the roll threw me against the side i was still lying against the side clutching the links of the chain under me desperately trying to hold myself there when i felt the first explosion through the timbers at my back not heavy more like a sharp tap against my shoulders but i knew what it was and lying there in the dark i could visualize the scene on deck the fishing lights probing the darkness for the anchor buoys and that wicked little torpedo trailing astern sending its impulses through the water to some submerged receiver on the end of a trailing wire that went down feet to the explosive device grappled to a cable on the seabed clinging to the links i counted the minutes on my watch four five and at five and a half the second tap of a detonation hit the timbers two of the anchors gone the windward ones presumably and then we were turning but not into the seas away from them downwind footsteps in the hold and the door opening the beam of light dazzling after the darkness on deck a hand grabbed hold of my arm hauling me to my feet pulling me out of the locker and i was so cramped and exhausted i could hardly stand they dragged me up the narrow companionway that led direct into the wheelhouse and forced me to stand propped against the closed door i saw dillons face but only as a blur the wheelhouse lit by a weird glow it shone on my fathers twisted face and i blinked my eyes weeping after the long darkness you heard the anchor cables go dillon said you heard did you i nodded wondering what he wanted of me and desperately trying to recover myself i was sore all over a deep ache your ship has cut numbers one and four your ship what did he mean by my ship his face was strangely lit a livid red his cheek puffed and a scab of dried blood on the side of his head where i had slammed it against the r t transmitter slowly i turned my weeping eyes narrowed against the glare the bows swung wildly the break of a wave lashing the windows and suddenly i saw it heaving and tossing in the glass panel opposite dillons face no longer red his head in silhouette it was the rig it rose up out of the wildness of the seas no more than three cables away towering above us and lit the way i had so often seen it like a factory complex with the tall finger of the derrick climbing into the night a tier of ruby lights but now from the very top of it a long gas jet streamed in the wind and at deck level thrust out from the side of the platform at the end of a steel boom a huge tongue of burning oil a great flare of flame like a dragons breath pulsed into the night spray jets of water shooting out in a lurid flare the moment weve been waiting for dillons voice was tense his eyes glowing with a deep inner excitement only two anchors holding her the wind around thirty knots gusting forty and yours the only ship here i looked at my father sitting wedged in the corner of the wheelhouse a crumpled silent figure quite ruthless his words came back to me as dillons voice tight with tension said were turning now for the final run and when we cut those two remaining cables shell go just like that he banged his hand on the flat of the ledge we used as a chart table and the boat completing its turn his face was lit again by the red flaring of the oil the skin shiny with sweat his eyes glowing they wont have time to disconnect or operate the kill and choke and at the end of it all its you theyll blame and he added but once youre in the inflatable you wont care you wont care about anything youll be too frightened my mind was slow and confused unable to grasp his meaning still thinking of the rig and the cold ruthless drive of this man who could see the killing of so many men a group of fellow workers the destruction of the rig as justified as part of the struggle you could have done it for us he said you could have done it so easily and i asked you i came to you im not a murderer i said my voice strained and hoarse you think its murder his voice had risen how can it be murder when youre fighting a war the man at the helm reported on course but he took no notice korea vietnam angola a soldier doesnt call it murder when he destroys defenceless villages or a pilot when he bombs a town spreads napalm and burns up innocent children and if anybody dies out there itll be their own fault theyve got safety rafts scrambling nets theyre testing i said cutting short his outburst of selfjustification theres oil flowing up from thousands of feet down under pressure and this ships a floating mine and who will they blame not me he laughed but no mirth in it and his eyes cold with contempt i gave you the chance to prove yourself think of villiers with the oil flowing and his shares booming hell make millions out of this is that the sort of world you want destruction doesnt build a new world i said what do you care about a new world youre not a fighter youre not one of us youre nothing a little shit of a bourgeois radical who cant make up his mind which side hes on radicals he spat the word out get him into the boat the old man stirred in his corner hes my son he said but hands were gripping my arms the wind roaring in solid with spray as the door slid back i was thrust out into the gale and i saw a buoy in the spotlight riding the crest of a breaking wave and right below me the inflatable bouncing alongside the vessel rolled in the trough hands thrusting me against the bulwarks and above the noise of the sea i heard a voice say let him be a wave rolled under us the deck heaving and i turned on the swede as the roll caught him off balance hitting out at him and in that moment i saw the old man standing in the gap of the wheelhouse door let him go the grip of their hands relaxed i was suddenly free the twisted side of my fathers face lit by the oil flare the deep gash a lurid red his voice saying he comes with us he was facing dillon and dillon saying no he takes his chance and whether he survives or not doesnt matter he gets the blame the bows crashed down a roar of water the ship staggering under the impact and his voice whipped away in the wind out of this you were only brought into it because youre a shetlander and knew the rest i lost as another gust hit us the ship leaning away from it and the old man clutching at the door frame not looking at dillon now but at me i thought his lips framed the words my son again but there was no determination no fight only acceptance i shall never forget that helpless hopeless look on his face a man acknowledging his own son yet acquiescing in his destruction there were tears in his eyes and the wind tore them away and thats all i remember that and dillons face and the fist in my guts as i tried to wrench myself free of them and then the hard top of the bulwarks against the small of my back a voice high in the wind saying over the side and i was falling the black plastic fabric of the boat coming up at me on a crest it was halffull of water and for a moment i lay clutching at the smooth rolled air cushions as the wave broke over me lifting me almost to the level of the deck the swede was fumbling at the painter the nylon cord difficult to handle a riding turn in that moment with the swede right above me holding a torch and working at the cord with his other hand the meaning of dillons words dawned on me the reality of my situation suddenly very clear a wave broke under me lifting me in a smother of foam and i heard the swede call to paulo saw him reach out his hand for the knife and in that moment i dived for the bows gripping the cord shortening up on the painter that torch was my only hope the next wave broke hissing behind me the inflatable lifting me to the bulwarks again the swede sawing at the cord and on the crest of that wave i reached out and grabbed hold of the torch the boat fell away in the trough my whole weight on his arm and the fool didnt let go the trawler rolling and his body coming with the roll sprawling over the side to hit the airtight slippery curve beside me as i fell back the nylon cord parted the mary janes hull sliding past faces looking down the whole scene vivid and red in the glare i lay in the water gasping and the swedes face close beside me disappeared his hand scrabbling at the drumtight curve of the fabric then suddenly i was alone the boats engine a distant beat in the wind gradually fading it was quiet then the wind almost soundless as i drifted with it and only the hiss of the wave crests i didnt even feel the shock wave as they cut no cable sprawled in the bottom of the boat my fingers gripping the slats of the floorboards and my head lifted to peer over the side i saw the mary jane steaming across the line of the buoys and twisting round i could see the rig growing in size the gas jet high in the sky the oil flare licking the night soon i could hear the roar of that flame the sound of the power plant the whole factory blaze of the giant structure going on about its business apparently oblivious that only one of the windward anchors remained and the wind and the sea sweeping me towards it to pass i thought just seaward of that blinding searing tongue of flame now looking like a beautiful frilled monster with the sprayjets gleaming red a glorious coloured ruff a mouth wide open pouring out fire already i was only catching glimpses of the mary jane and then when she too was on the top of a wave i thought she had turned and was heading north and at the same moment a klaxon blared on the rig i could hear it even above the wind the platform so close above me now the gas flare at the derrick top was snuffed out the tongue of flame at the end of its boom flickered withdrawing itself into the darkening circle of spray suddenly it was gone the sea black and only the lights of the rig to show the white of the waves rolling under me i was almost abreast of the rig then drifting fast downwind to pass a cable perhaps a cable and a half to the north then for a while the rig seemed stationary again spotlights picked out the underside of the platform the round fat columns with the waves breaking against them and the big tubular bracings smothered in foam i could see the guidewires leading down to the seabed and the casing of the marine riser and guidewires and riser were no longer vertical they were slanting away from the wind the angle increasing and i was moving down past the rig then the whole huge structure held anchored by a inch casing reaching down almost feet to the bop stack on the seabed and then it snapped and the rig was moving with me the guidewires trailing men crawling like monkeys high in the night releasing scrambling nets checking the winch drums at each of the four corners of the platform the rig stayed with me for perhaps ten minutes the time it took to drift over her downwind anchors to drag the cables and then she held and i was being swept past it again lying there clinging on to the slats my head twisted sideways watching the rig i was too scared of what might happen to think of myself at any moment i had expected the whole structure to be engulfed by flames but something had given them the few moments theyd needed to choke the oil flow maybe dillon had been so tense so disturbed by the loss of the swede overboard that he had mistaken no buoy for no that would explain the quick turn and the northward run whatever it was the rig was safe for the moment no drill hole run amok and blazing oil nobody roasted alive in a holocaust of fire it was only then that i remembered the torch my urgent reason for grabbing it and i shone it up at the small figures loosening the nets high above me three dots three dashes three dots i kept flicking it on and off until my thumb ached with the pressure and i was losing sight of the rig in the troughs it was when i stopped sending that hopeless sos that i realized i was shaking with cold the water i was lying in warmer than the wind blowing through my sodden clothing i never saw her come up on me out of the night she was just suddenly there a trawler with her fishing lights on her spotlight swinging back and forth across the waves i began using the torch again and for long minutes i thought shed never see me then very slowly she began to turn her bows swinging till they pointed straight at me and she was growing larger v she layto a short distance to windward rolling her side decks under and drifting down on me smoothing the seas out and blocking the wind a heaving line came rushing through the glare of her lights missed me by a few feet another whistled straight across me and i grabbed it wrapping it round my body as the rusty steel plates of her side rolled down on top of me then the line tightened round my chest dragging me into the sea and yanking me up to swing in a blinding crash against the ships side i remember nothing after that until i found myself sprawled on the deck and johans bearded face hovering over me chapter four i remember putting my hand up to my head blood on my fingers and johan saying it is gertrude you must thank and the next thing i knew i was on a bunk with the light in my eyes and they were pulling off my clothes i felt dazed and i wanted to be sick a voice a long way away said hes coming round it was gertrudes voice and i tried to raise myself wanting to ask about the fishing boat but i couldnt form the words instead i was sick leaning over the edge of the bunk and retching up seawater i was shivering then and gertrude said you are all right now blankets were heaped on top of me and i tried to push them away thinking of the old man and dillon the swedes hands scrabbling and the little torpedo echoes to the seabed the anchor cables exploding a kaleidoscope of impressions with the blurred vision of johans bearded face and gertrude looking down at me with huge eyes full of pity and at last i found my voice heard myself say the radar get that boat on the radar its all right the rig is all right and no need for you to worry its not all right a big hand thrusting me back myself struggling stop them if those bastards blow the last four anchors and gertrudes voice relax nothing you can do but i knew there was if the rig went adrift if they succeeded its a lee shore i gasped i saw it in my mind the rig stranded and battered on foula or on the mainland shore of shetland and the disaster blamed on me the boat gone nobody else but me get me some clothes i pushed the blankets back holding on to my stomach and forcing myself up on my elbow you cant michael some clothes quick for christs sake i swung my legs off the bunk forcing myself up stark naked thinking only of that deadly dangerous little man and what he had planned not the others the others didnt matter not even my father it was stevens dillon whatever the coldhearted bastard liked to call himself some clothes damn you i said through gritted teeth a jersey trousers carpet slippers much too large for me somehow i got into them and dragged myself through the door to the bridge lars was at the helm henrik at the decca beyond them the rig wavered a lit tower block canted at an angle and rising and falling in the glass of the windows as the duchess steamed at slow ahead into the waves the bows fell away and i lurched down to push henrik away and watch the sweep lighting the screen in its steady radial circling it is all right gertrude said again she was close behind me it is holding on the other anchors the screen blurred by the break of the waves was difficult to read my head throbbing my eyes not focusing properly wheres that boat now i asked henrik is that it over the bows no is a buoy i think the boat is starbd bow i waited till the sweep swung round through northeast and there it was out beyond the pinhead blips of the two buoys beyond the first distance circle i reached for the telegraph rang for full ahead the bell answered just as a voice crackled out of the loudspeaker it was ken stewart calling on us to stay by the rig and patrol the buoys of the four anchors that were still holding is randall able to talk now i reached for the phone randall here and i told him briefly what had happened how his own standby boat had cut the four windward cables by trailing a sonic beam transmitter shes out by nos and buoys but were going after her now she wont cut any more cables and well keep after her by then we were almost on top of the two buoys and the blip was moving away to the north fast he wanted us to stay by the buoys of course but i ignored him blowing into the engineroom voice pipe and calling for maximum revs i was remembering the mexican fixing the cylinders in the hold the powerful engines of that other vessel hammering at the wooden sides of the chain locker and gertrude behind me said no no theres no need for that a hand fell on my shoulder gripping me tight and johan said you hear what gertrude said his voice was thick and obstinate and still gripping me he reached out for the telegraph and put it back to slow again i think i was crying then crying with frustration certainly there were tears in my eyes as i faced gertrude telling her how i had been set adrift dillon intending my body to be the only evidence and my father acquiescing the scene was still so vivid my anger my hatred of that man so intense that when i turned on johan hitting out at him there was a wildness running through me he was a beerdrinker too fat in the belly and that is where i hit him gertrude screamed at me but then the voice pipe whistled and i picked it up and heard duncan asking what the hell was going on but i couldnt answer my legs suddenly weak and buckling under me i heard gertrude say something but her voice was a long way away and then i was being lifted up and the next thing i knew i was on the bunk again and she was holding a mug of something hot to my lips drink it then you feel better you shouldnt have hit johan her voice was reproachful tell him im sorry i murmured i dont know whether it was exhaustion or the sedative she had mixed with the drink but i was asleep before i had finished it when i woke dawn was just breaking and we were running before a big sea i knew that by the swooping corkscrew motion the pitch of the engines the occasional sound of a wave breaking aft it meant that we had left the rig and were headed east for shetland i closed my eyes again nothing i could do about it now nothing i could do about anything and i was tired god i was tired i didnt wake again until gertrude brought me some food on a tray it was past nine then and when i asked her where we were she said approaching papa stour it is blowing very hard so we go to aith it is nearer and soon we will be under the lee what about the rig when we leave it is dragging but not much and they have sealed off the drill hole the choke and kill that is what ken stewart call it and they do that before the marine riser casing broke so eat your food there is nothing to worry about it was eggs and bacon and a mug of coffee just the smell of it made me hungry i havent thanked you i said if you hadnt been standing by north star it is not me you have to thank it is your wife fiona the coffee was thick and sweet in my mouth as i gulped at it what the hells fiona got to do with it i was staring at her seeing her largemouthed competent face thinking how comfortable and practical she was in comparison with fiona i dont understand she did a very wonderful thing for you she spoke very softly a note of sadness almost of pity in her voice she loves you i think very much its finished i said i didnt want to talk about it not with her i began eating feeling confused and wondering what was coming for you maybe she said quietly but not for her there was a long pause and then she said she is something to do with those men on the fishing boat i think probably i was remembering how she had followed me to hull what she had said the last time i had seen her in the corridor outside the court what happened to the boat i asked you dont have to worry about the boat it made off to the north you didnt follow it no would the police accept that would they accept that there had been a boat and that it was dillon not me who was responsible for cutting the cables i was still thinking about that and eating at the same time when she said you do not want to know what fiona did does it matter yes michael it does matter and she went on a note of urgency in her voice listen please we came into the taing and there was a letter for me from aberdeen she wanted to see me urgently about you a matter of life and death she say and god help me i think she is just dramatizing so i dont do anything until we are fishing off the hebrides and i get a telegram from her over the r t a telegram is something i cannot ignore so we put into kinlochbervie and i telephone her we arrange to meet in inverness the next day and it is there she tells me what is going to happen about the rig ja and she nodded her fair hair falling over her face but it is not only about the rig she is convinced the man in charge of the operation will make it look so that you are responsible she is afraid for you she thinks perhaps it is your dead body did you report this to the police no that was a condition she made she was concerned for you not the rig surely you warned ed wiseberg yes as soon as we reached north star i talked with him by loudhailer i tell him something is planned to happen to the rig but he thinks the duchess is there to cause trouble to frighten the men or something he tell us to eff off she smiled he is very tense you know already occupied with his testing so then i ask the standby boat if you are on board or perhaps on the relief boat but they dont know anything about you so we stay around the rig watching and when it is dark and the relief boat arrive we keep downwind of her with our lights turned off she told you i was going to be put in a boat no she dont say that but johan and i we think it is possible we just dont know what is going to happen only that we must stay in the vicinity of north star then ken stewart say there is a torch blinking an sos in the water and thats how we come to pick you up and she added very quietly so you dont s owe your life to us but to fiona she was gazing at me wideeyed waiting for some reaction but there was nothing i could say and i went on eating feeling helpless propped up in the bunk and thinking of fiona risking her liberty perhaps her life because of something that was finished dead buried in the past what the hell could i say she sat there waiting until i had finished my food then she took the tray and stood there holding it in her hand and looking down at me do you want me to send a message i know where she is staying tell her im safe i said i already send a telegram to say that but she will expect something more a message from you she reached down to the locker beside the bunk and handed me a writing pad and ballpoint you think it out we will be in aith in about an hour then you can send it yourself she left me then apparently thinking my reluctance due to her presence i stared at the pad knowing there was nothing i could say that wouldnt encourage fiona to think there was still something left of our marriage she loves you i think very much it was gertrude i wanted to think of not fiona gertrude who had brought her trawler north to stand by the rig in the hope of finding me and she had done that after three months without a word from me knowing that i was somehow involved one hour she had said then we would be in aith tied up at the pier i thought of all the telex messages being sent out by north star to fuller to the aberdeen office to villiers in london and the news broadcasts it would have been on the radio this morning tv would have it by midday newspaper presses rolling the story out a rig broken adrift and suspected sabotage aith might only be a small place but it was on mainland and once we were in press reporters police they would all be there a wave crashed aft as we were pooped but i barely noticed it i hardly heard the strange noises the hull made as the plates worked under the pressure of the seas i had one hour just one hour to myself to get a clear statement down on paper i was still tired my head throbbing but i knew it had to be done and once i had started i found myself writing fast and with concentration so that i barely noticed the decrease of movement the growing quiet as we came in under the lee i hadnt quite completed it when i felt a bump on the starboard side the sound of feet on deck and voices we were alongside and a moment later gertrude came in followed by a tall stooped figure in a tweed jacket inspector garrard she said he wants to see you alone the inspector came forward ducking his head to avoid the steel angle irons of the roofing before the reporters get at you he said he waited for gertrude to leave then pulled up a chair and sat down opening his briefcase since im not sure whether youre one of the villains or not i suppose i ought to caution you you want a statement is that it he nodded yes ill need a statement ive just been writing it for you i said and handed him the pad good that saves a lot of time he took it and there was a long silence as he read it through when he had finished he said with what mrs petersen has told me and the messages weve had from north star this is about what i had expected he hesitated smiling slightly we kept tabs on you of course from the moment i had them release you from the hull central station weve been following your movements but at a distance the trouble was we werent sure exactly who was involved and how it would be done we hoped youd lead us to that but then it all happened too quickly it was a shock to realize that this quiet academiclooking man had been making use of me so deliberately but my reaction was only one of relief what about dillon i asked his real name is mckeown until now hes always worked in the background weve been trying to yes but whats happened to him where is he now he shrugged youre probably right in saying theyve destroyed the fishing boat after transferring to another vessel but you dont know you dont know whats happened to them he shook his head a navy ship is out there now searching but im afraid we moved too late and he added weve pulled in sandford of course he doesnt seem able to tell us much but what he has told us tends to corroborate your statement he stayed there for about half an hour asking questions and checking my answers against information in a file from his briefcase finally he rose i have to be getting back to lerwick now like you i wish we knew what happened after the rigs cables were cut but its been a bad night out there north star has dragged about three miles and one of the remaining anchor cables snapped under the strain but the forecast is for less wind so the rig should hold and villiers arrived by plane this morning hes in scalloway now hell want to see you also the media theyll want the story too he put the file back in his briefcase and snapped it shut then he stood looking down at me and i sensed a sudden awkwardness one other thing mrs petersen said she told you your wife was in aberdeen i nodded something in his expression warning me so that i think i knew what was coming you saw her in hull at your hotel and she was in court that day we kept track of her after that so we knew where to pick her up for questioning he hesitated im sorry about this randall but i had a call from the aberdeen police just before i left lerwick when they went to her lodgings last night they found shed been taken to hospital that morning suffering from an overdose of barbiturate he didnt have to tell me i knew from the expression on his face dead yes im afraid so she was dead on arrival at the hospital i didnt see him go i just lay there staring at the rusting paint of the roofing thinking of fiona alone in some wretched boarding house was it my fault was i to blame if id been there if i hadnt left her if id gone back to her that night when she had come to my hotel room but it wouldnt have been any use i knew that it was something in her makeup the restlessness the nervous vitality the constant shifting from one cause to another and drugs her only solution poor fiona i should have wept for her but my eyes were dry and i felt no loss only a sense of relief that it was over the door opened and gertrude came in he told you did he her eyes were enormous and i saw they were full of tears im sorry michael theres nothing to be sorry about i said and i meant it remembering the lost years and what her life had been how can you say that and she went on you dont see her as i saw her that day in inverness her voice was trembling with emotion she was so lost so alone and frightened i think but not for herself for you i got out of the bunk then going to her shocked that it was she not me that was crying for fiona and i wanted to comfort her to tell her that fiona was all right now the long internal struggle over but she pushed me away swallowing her tears and saying in a quiet matteroffact voice there are people journalists wanting to see you they are in the bridge i came to tell you i got dressed and went through into the bridge and saw them there rain beating at the windows and the hills on either side of the little port lost in cloud it was still raining when the last of the reporters left but the clouds had lifted slightly so that the long bank of burgins was just visible and the island of papa little at the end of the voe i was just going below for lunch when a taxi drew up and villiers got out standing bareheaded in the rain talking to the driver a bright red anorak slung carelessly over his shoulders two other taxis followed nosing between the houses he glanced at them his hair already wet his square jaw jutting angrily then he turned walking quickly on to the pier climbing over the bulwarks and coming straight to the bridge randall he held out his hand glad to see you safe i saw inspector garrard on the road he showed me your statement youre lucky to be alive he glanced round the empty bridge wheres mrs petersen and when i told him she was below he said id like to see her please both of you ive got to get out to the rig and in this weather yours is the only boat can get me there he didnt waste time as soon as i had called gertrude and we were both of us with him in my cabin he said now can we come to some arrangement weve got an oceangoing tug on the way but it wont be there for another twentyfour hours at least george fuller got me a met forecast just before i left scalloway theres a break coming in the next six to eight hours but theres another low moving in and worse to follow did garrard tell you weve had one man killed and two injured apparently they had been winding a new cable on to no winch drum with the intention of trying to hold the rig on a spare anchor when the cable got out of control unfortunately it was ken stewart who was swept over the side the other two men theyre all right one has a broken arm the other cracked ribs but with stewart gone theres nobody i trust on board to handle navigation if the rig starts drifting again he was looking straight at me how fit are you i want somebody out there with me who can take charge in an emergency im all right i said but how do you think youre going to get on board even if there is a break therell still be a hell of a sea running he nodded i appreciate that but its something ive got to try he hesitated we already owe you quite a lot you and mrs petersen but theres no standby boat with the rig now and this is the only trawler in the area big enough to stay by north star till the tug gets there you can state your own terms but dont lets waste any time okay the terms we agreed covered any damage gave us a hefty bonus if the duchess stayed by the rig until it was reanchored and provided for a longterm charter thereafter at favourable rates i called to johan to get the crew up and we cast off with the tv cameras set up on the pier taking pictures and the producer shouting for villiers to come out on to the deck gertrude was already writing out the charter agreement and it was signed before we were in to swarbacks minn and meeting the full force of the northwesterly wind the tide had only just turned against us and i took her through the sound of papa a big sea running as we came out from under the lee of papa stour it was no more than twentyfive miles to north stars new position but it took us almost six hours twice villiers talked to the rig and on each occasion ed wiseberg was not available the anchors were still holding apparently but they had done nothing further about the spare anchor and i got the impression they were simply waiting for the tug to arrive i dont know who he was speaking to sparks probably but on the second occasion i heard him say well for christs sake tell ed i want to talk to him hes got to get that bloody anchor rigged and over the side then hes got to think of some way of getting us on to the deck i didnt hear any more for our bows fell off the top of a breaking wave and a great burst of spray crashed against the bridge then he was beside my chair leaning over me peering down at the chart folded on my knees how far off now his voice was tense anger only just controlled a little over five miles he glanced at his watch another hour more i said then you must increase the revs and when i shook my head he said its past five already at this rate our bows slammed again and he was sent flying across the bridge but he was back at my side almost immediately its useless to ask ed how hes going to get us on deck you got any ideas well see what the sea conditions are like when we get there i put down my pencil and looked at him then he wasnt scared only very determined almost desperate to get on the rig you any good at jumping and clambering up heights i asked ive done a bit of rock climbing why theyve got scrambling nets i remember seeing them being unrolled as i was drifting past the rig with a bit of luck johan could get the ship in close enough for us to jump that is if youre prepared to risk it i was looking at him but all he said was good god as simple as that why the hell couldnt they think of it because theyre not seamen i told him and then sensing that he was a man who needed to have action in mind i said half an hour from now get on the blower to them and have them unroll the nets and well want oil tell them to have some containers full of oil ready to pour into the sea on the windward side there wasnt much light left when we finally raised the rig visibility was less than a mile in steady rain so that we saw it as a blur of light the factory blaze just as i had seen it so many times except that the tier of red warning lights on the derrick were no longer vertical but tilted at a slight angle i had johan take us in close the nets were down hanging like a wide mesh curtain below the catwalk that ran the length of the crews quarters unfortunately the nets faced north almost into the wind i was looking at the seas cascading through the columns a welter of foam and broken water trying to estimate the height of the waves against the meshes of the net theres a hell of a rise and fall i said what about the oil he asked it wont make any difference to the height of the waves but there could be a little northgoing tide left so it may help tell them to start pouring it but slowly so that it spreads and not on to the nets i had already briefed johan and he was on direct engine control you think you can do it without the ship slamming against the columns i asked him ja but can you make the jump he was laughing v i looked at villiers you realize if you miss theres not much chance of being picked up he nodded its the same for you i looked at gertrude if either of us misses the net and falls into the sea youll only search clear of the rig youre not to take any chances with the ship is that understood of course she was looking at me searchingly are you fit enough michael im fine i said she nodded accepting my assurance good and that was all no argument no doubts both of us in harmony knowing what the risks were youll make it all right she said smiling both of you i put you right into the net johan said and he was as good as his word he took the duchess in a wide slow turn upwind of the rig and when she was sternon to the waves and drifting down on to it villiers and i went up into the bows neither of us had lifejackets we had both decided the restriction of movement outweighed the safety factor but crouched on the stem of the boat clinging to a ring bolt i wasnt so sure the wave height averaged fourteen feet but it seemed much more the movement very violent a vertical lift and fall that was like riding the national on a giant steeplechaser it seemed an age that we were clinging there the rig gradually appearing to lean over us as the slant of our drift brought us under the superstructure the net coming closer and then suddenly we were falling off the top of a wave and the net was there right above us bulging widemeshed and streaming water the bows touched it dragging it taut then something caught tearing a gap in it and we were rising again i felt the screw going full astern and i yelled to villiers to jump saw him lean out and grab hold and then we were on the net both of us clambering like spiders in a web as the bows fell away beneath us the net sprang tight under my hands and i clung there not moving feeling it rip again then suddenly it was slack the trawler backing clear and another wave rolling in water licking up to my sea boots and my body being swung under the rig into the welter of foam thrashing through the columns and the crossbracings it was like that all the time we were climbing our bodies swung back and forth faces peering down at us our arms aching the roar of the sea and the damp smell of metal the reek of oil then at last hands reached down gripped hold of my arms and a moment later i was standing exhausted on the catwalk beside villiers not as bad as i feared he said his dark handsome features streaming water from the spray his dripping anorak globuled with oil he turned to one of the men who had hauled us on to the catwalk a complete change of clothing for both of us and a pot of coffee he said in the barge engineers office i think i want ed there and kens assistant whats his name hans hans smit the high voice the oldmaidish manner it was lennie the sick bay attendant another dutchman eh well get those clothes quick and a couple of towels villiers nodded to me and led the way into the quarters ignoring lennie who seemed scared and wanting to tell him something it was quiet in the barge engineers office no sound of the sea only the hum of the power plant you reckon they can get that spare anchor rigged without any more casualties he asked me as we stripped off our clothes lets get a forecast first i said and then well need to know when the tug will arrive and whether she can start the tow in the sea conditions then expected there are three anchors still out if we get another one rigged thats four to retrieve or cut loose before the tow can start a galley hand came in with coffee followed almost immediately by a lean sallowfaced man of about thirty with a crew cut and heavy hornrimmed glasses hans smit he said sorry i am not there mr villiers when you come up but i am talking vit the tug conditions are no good it vill be at least twentyfour hours before he is here and he thinks he must go through pentland firth zo it vill even then depend on the tide villiers nodded whats the latest forecast but smit didnt know the last weather chart he had seen was for noon but is improving all the time i think whats the helicopter situation then villiers asked has ed arranged to fly the drill crews off no nothing has been decided you see where the hell is ed i could tell by the tone of his voice that his patience was running out i want to see him now smits mouth opened a look of surprise giving place to doubt didnt lennie tell you tell me what and at that moment the sick bay attendant came in with towels a bundle of freshly laundered clothes overalls gloves and safety helmets smit turned to him didnt you tell mr villiers lennie shook his head looking nervously round the room i tried honest i did but i couldnt seem what is it villiers demanded where is ed and smit answered awkwardly ve dont know ve think he gave a shrug but that is just a guess the last i see of ed is at midday when he is eating alone in the mess ve dont know what happened to him hes disappeared is that what youre telling me villierss voice sounded incredulous youve searched ja ve search the whole goddam barge everywhere smit shook his head when was this when did you discover he was missing ve dont discover he is missing you see it is not like that there are so many places on the rig so many things he could be checking zo it is not until i dont see him for several hours he shrugged again an expression of helplessness then i start enquiring that was about vife this afternoon he is in his office for a short time after the midday meal then as far as i haf been able to discover the last person to see him is one of my engineers who is checking no winch max says he saw him by no that is close to the stairway leading down under the rig there was a long silence then and i was thinking of the last time i had seen ed wiseberg sitting at his desk with the papers in front of him and that paragraph underlined in red his luck run out and now on top of all his record of things gone wrong this rig possibly the last rig he would ever get cut adrift and dragging a barge engineer killed and two men injured and villiers his boss the man who owned north star who had given him the job coming out in a trawler to risk his life jumping for the scrambling nets i could see him walking down that iron stairway the same stairway that i had gone down to my waiting boat walking perhaps with that cocky swagger but not into a calm sea into a roaring inferno of breaking waves it was as good a way to end it as any and i glanced at villiers his face was set the shadow of this new disaster showing in the sag of his shoulders in the shocked look of his eyes start searching again he said in a hard tight voice have every man on board who is in charge of anything search his particular area and report back to you when he has done so smit nodded and went out quickly obviously glad to escape glad of the excuse to do something instead of just standing there trying to explain the loss of the top man on the rig lennie scuttled out after him and villiers turned to me not much hope im afraid all the vigour and decisiveness had gone from his voice and theyll blame me of course at scalloway there were about half a dozen of them reporters and their questions he shook his head i could tell by their questions what they were thinking he picked up a towel and began drying himself vigorously get some clothes on and well go to the radio room and see about that forecast it cost him an effort to make even that show of decisiveness and i knew that ed wisebergs disappearance had hit him very hard indeed the latest met information was that the next depression was moving in from the atlantic faster than expected and would reach us probably by midnight it was already millibars and still deepening wind force gusting possibly more two further depressions were building up in the atlantic one of and the other millibars we were still in telecommunications when smit reported that all areas of the rig had been thoroughly searched and no sign of wiseberg are you sure theyve checked everywhere villiers asked all the compartments with doors that could lock or jam smit nodded i go down in the lift and search the torpedo compartments myself all storerooms refrigerator plant ve even open the store on deck for sea safety equipment he is nowhere on the barge villiers didnt say anything he didnt thank him he just stood there staring at the bank of radio equipment in the end he sat down and drafted a telex message to ed wisebergs wife he read it through made several corrections then handed it to the operator send that right away please and we went to the galley for a meal which he ate quickly hardly saying a word afterwards i went up on to the helicopter deck it had stopped raining and the wind had fallen right away i could see the trawlers lights quite clearly bobbing up and down about four cables to the south of us i was there about half an hour thinking of the big texan toolpusher and about his wife and the sons that had been born in different oil areas of the world a strange wandering life it must have required a lot of courage for him to end it in this alien element going down into the seething surge of the waves beneath his last rig and fiona the two of them so different each seeking a way out i felt sad and depressed as i turned at last to go below in search of smit the wind had already backed into the southwest and increased a little it was raining again and i could no longer see the lights of the duchess i found the dutchman in the radio room talking to sparks and i suggested he get the spare cable and anchor ready just in case then i went in search of villiers he was in the barge engineers office again standing at the table with chart b spread out in front of him if the remaining cable broke he said how far jo you reckon we could drift in twentyfour hours depends on the wind force of course say an average over the whole period of thirty knots and the general direction westerly i had joined him at the table staring down at the chart i have a pretty good idea of the drift of a trawler but this thing i shook my head i just didnt know the windings must be colossal what would a trawlers drift be ignoring tidal current about one to two knots say around thirty to forty miles over the full hour period and papa stour only twentyfive miles to the east of us we could be on the rocks there in less than twentyfour hours not necessarily i said against the windings you have to reckon on the pontoons the drag of the columns it could work out about half the drift of a ship j perhaps even less but if the cables dont break under the strain then the anchors will hold us or if they drag the drift will be slowed until the anchors hold again as we drag into shallower water so were all right if the anchor cables dont break he nodded thoughtfully better see if you can organize smit and his men ive already advised him to get that spare anchor ready but i dont think we should drop it unless were in real trouble and then only in much shallower water we argued about that for a time in the end he agreed but as i was leaving to go on deck he said so long as nobody gets hurt i dont want anybody else men dont try and get themselves killed i said sharply and no good warning them it only makes them think about it and then they get scared these things either happen or they dont i left him then and went up to the pipe deck where the engineers and a whole gang of roustabouts were working in the glare of the spotlights to wind the new cable on to no winch it would have been better if they could have rigged it on no winch which was facing due west now but as smit pointed out to me it had to be a winch within reach of one of the two cranes since there was no other way of hoisting a fifteenton anchor out over the side it was past midnight before they had it all set up the anchor shackled on and bowsed down to the deck by then the wind was strong to gale force from the southwest we all went down to the mess for coffee then turned in villiers and i had taken over ed wisebergs quarters and he was already occupying the upper berth of one of the twotier bunks it was very hot in the cabin the blowers full on and he stirred as i switched on the light everything all right blowing hard i said and theres a big sea running down here i was more conscious of the movement of the rig a slow rise and fall the floor of the cabin sloped and rolling slightly under my feet theyve rigged the spare anchor and set a watch on all three cable tension indicators he grunted well just have to hope for the best then i switched from the overhead light to my bunk reading lamp stripped to my borrowed underwear and was asleep as soon as my head touched the pillow it was villiers who woke me shaking my shoulder and telling me the last anchor cable had just parted the light was on and he was fully clothed his rig issue overalls gleaming wet a safety helmet on his head whats the time i asked just on sixthirty the tension indicators were showing over threefifty kips on the dials i dont know what that is in tons but it was too much the first cable parted shortly after four i swung my legs off the bunk reaching for my clothes you should have woken me nothing you could do that was true whats the wind force between fifty and fiftyfive knots a lot more in the gusts and its coming out of the northwest now so the depression was passing to the north of us and moving away well need to fix our position hourly to check the rate of drift i think hans is doing that and the radio operator on duty is getting on to the met office for the latest forecast and the tug i asked hoveto off the northeast of scotland he says the pentland firth is out of the question and he cant make the east side of orkney because it means a beam sea across the entrance to the firth he waited while i finished scrambling into my clothes and then we went along to telecommunications it was the same operator i had met months ago and hans smit was still there he handed me the weather sheet depression of millibars almost stationary to the ne of the british isles expected to clear all areas by noon followed by shallow ridge of high pressure with winds northerly knots backing sw as deep depression of moves in from the atlantic this depression still deepening and storm or violent storm conditions with hurricane force winds locally expected in sea areas bailey hebrides faroes fair isle within next hours any chance of getting helicopters out before that lot hits us i was thinking of all the men we had cooped up on board with nothing to do and the duchess out there she ought to run for shelter now while she had the chance depends what sort of clearance we get when that ridge of high pressure comes through villiers said but we never got any clearance and the ridge of high pressure did not materialize all that day the depression to the northeast of us stayed almost stationary and the wind did not lessen drifting us southeastward it was impossible to stand on the helicopter deck and clinging to the guard rail just outboard of the toolpushers office i stared through slitted eyes at the waste of water below i was accustomed to seeing heavy seas but from the deck of a trawler or in the shelter of its bridge perched up here sixty to seventy feet above the water i was looking down on to an ocean on the move long lines of great shaggy wave crests marching endlessly toppling and bursting dense streaks of foam streaming out along the direction of the wind flurries of rain and in between therainstorms i caught glimpses of the duchess pitching madly rolling her guts out and i thought of gertrude worrying about that patch in the hull worrying about the engines and how long the ship could go on taking it villiers had refused to let me order her to run for shelter shes under charter to stand by us shes the only boat weve got the one chance if were driven on to shetland what do you imagine people ashore will say if we let her abandon us that was what worried him most what people would say and it worried me too the ocean was on the move wind and water and waves driving us southeastward at somewhere between a knot and a knot and a half and nobody coming to our aid nobody out here except the duchess and so i left it to gertrude and johan to make their own decisions i talked to them i gave them the latest met bulletin our estimates of drift position twice i had quite a long chat with gertrude but at no time did she suggest running for shelter it was not even discussed at one oclock we listened to the bbc news and again at six it was a strange experience slightly unreal to hear the dispassionate voice of the announcer stating that the rig north star after striking oil had dragged its anchors and was adrift in heavy seas west of shetland and that vic villiers the wellknown and somewhat controversial head of villiers finance investment was himself on board the rig supervising attempts to reanchor no mention of sabotage nothing about the duchess or how we had got aboard not even a hint of the danger threatening us the extreme conditions we were facing it was only in the world at ten later that evening that the seriousness of our situation was indicated in an interview with the manager of the aberdeen office and with a shell expert on north east atlantic conditions by then the depression had moved away and the wind had dropped the tug took advantage of the lull to cross the entrance to the pentland firth it was now steaming north up the east coast of orkney but still over fifty miles away and still no helicopter had taken off our position at this time was dangerously close to foula we had been monitoring our distance off all day knowing that it lay in the path of our drift and was a major hazard in the afternoon when visibility had temporarily improved we had seen the island quite clearly through the windows of the toolpushers office it was then about three miles to the south of us visibility closed in again and after that we relied on radar there was still two hours of northgoing tide and gradually we were pushed clear of it so that by the time we had listened to the news the north end of the island was almost four miles west of us no danger now of the tide carrying us south on to the rock shallows of haevdi grund only foula shoal still a possible hazard for anybody going about his routine business in the body of the rig or for the drilling crews who had nothing to do now but lie in their bunks reading and waiting for the next meal it was very difficult to appreciate the danger we were in there was a film being shown that night in the recreation room and villiers took the opportunity to tell the men what was happening and what was being done on board and ashore to meet the situation but he did not attempt to explain to them what conditions would be like in the morning though he flew his own plane he still did not have any real idea of what a severe storm in the north atlantic would be like he could not even explain to them clearly why the tug was tucked under the lee of orkney only forty miles away to them that made it four hours steaming they talked about it of course as they dispersed and went to their bunks but i could see they had no conception everything around them so solid so orderly themselves cocooned in the hot warmth of the heating plant from the elemental forces building up in the night outside they were technicians and in their pride i think they really thought man had nature licked we went to the barge engineers office then villiers had called a meeting of senior staff and it lasted just over half an hour there were clearly only two ways by which we could reduce the speed of our drift we could increase the seawater ballast thereby lowering the height of the rig and so reducing the windage or we could let go the spare anchor smit had already experimented with ballast control during the day but as the waves had increased in height and strength he had been forced to deballast for fear the quarters would be stove in he wanted to use the anchor the others agreed finally villiers asked for my opinion i didnt expect them to like it i wanted the anchor held in reserve as a last resort when we reached shallow water i advised that all personnel be evacuated from the quarters up to the derrick floor and the rig submerged to maximum depth all day i had been gradually coming to this view i hadnt suggested it before because of foula until we had cleared foula it might have increased the danger of our drifting on to the island if i submerged to maximum smit said and this depression becomes as bad as you say then everything goes quarters mess communications offices the deck will be swept clean of pipe everything will go but not the rig i said he rounded on me then vat do you know about it during the last few hours he had been carrying a heavy load of responsibility and his face was tense and overstrained you know about trawlers but this is a drilling barge you dont know anything about drilling barges and he turned back to villiers it is my responsibility all right hans its your responsibility i agree but what do we do let go the spare anchor now while it is more quiet and if the cable breaks i asked him then the cable break but ve dont know about that until ve try and you dont know he added glaring at me resentfully you dont even know the breaking strain of a fourinch cable or ow many tons the anchor shackles are manufactured to stand it was difficult for any of them to realize what a depression of millibars that was deepening could mean in terms of wind force they were all of them including villiers thinking of damage to equipment and machinery the problems of replacement the lost time and in villierss case i am quite certain the financial cost at this stage their minds refused to face up to the prospect of total loss they just could not envisage what it would be like stranded on rock in hurricane force winds how could they sitting there in the barge engineers office no sound of the wind outside just the hum of the power plant the movement under their feet no more than the gentle bowing of a colossus to the sea and so villiers agreed to let hans smit send the spare anchor overboard and after that i went into the radio room and asked the operator to call the duchess for me it was johan who answered not gertrude and that made it easier i told him to make up towards foula and get into the shelter of the island you speak with gertrude he said that is for her to decide no it is for you to decide i told him theres nothing you can do for the rig if anybody is swept overboard hes gone no hope of your saving him and i asked him how the patched plates were standing up to the hammering he admitted that duncan had had the pumps going all day theres worse to come i told him and you know it and i added once it really starts blowing you wont be able to make up to the island against it there was a long silence while he thought it out ja okay we lie under foula but you talk to gertrude first over ill talk to her when youre safe in ham voe i said not before over and out and i cut him off before he could argue further villierss voice sharp and angry behind me said youve no right to dismiss that trawler without reference to me its under charter to stand by us under charter i had turned and was staring at his tired handsome face seeing the selfishness of the man his certainty that agreements money power were everything charters dont buy lives i said have you any idea what its been like in that trawler z today what it could be like tomorrow do you want to stand in the toolpushers office with the stability of this huge structure under you stand in your shirtsleeves in warmth and comfort and watch a little ship founder with half a dozen people on board is that what you want youre thinking of that girl he said waspishly yes i am im thinking of her of a scots engineer named duncan of johan a big bearded norwegian of men who saved my life and by their seamanship got you on to your bloody useless obsolete rig he was silent then and i was suddenly sorry for him do what you like he said quietly the anger gone and his voice lifeless then he turned and went quickly out the spare anchor was hoisted over just before midnight the wind speed was then thirty knots gusting to thirtyseven i took the reading myself unbelievably the rig was not equipped with a proper anemometer only a hand speed indicator for the use of the radio operator smit and his engineers the crane driver and quite a little crowd of technicians and drilling crews were gathered round the winch villiers was standing a little to one side a lone figure his back against the guardrails nobody said a word as the needle suddenly came alive swinging with a jerk round the dial wavering and settling at around the mark the anchor was holding and there was a sigh of relief now that the wind had lessened the seas had become higher the vertical movement of the rig under our feet considerable as the crowd drifted off to bed i saw the indicator needle begin to move soon it was fluctuating wildly reflecting the snatch on the cable as the rig rose and fell smit stood there watching his face set at one point the needle seemed to swing right off the end of its range i think he was wishing then that he had waited until we were in shallower water and i left him and went to my bunk anxious to get some sleep while the going was good villiers came in just as i had put my bunk light out its holding he said but the strain on it must be very heavy it wont last long i told him but there i was wrong it held for almost five hours for shortly after the wind dropped right away if the helicopter crews who were supposed to be standing by at sumburgh had been quick off the mark it is just possible they could have snatched most of the men off for the wind stayed light for almost three hours just before first light however it veered rapidly to and within less than half an hour it was blowing a gale from that quarter the next depression was upon us and it had already deepened to to appreciate the problems we faced that day it is necessary to realize the large number of men we had on board also their trades because in the event our lives were to depend on some of the skills we could call upon on board at that time were junior toolpusher assistant barge engineer rig technicians motormen crane operators labourers or roustabouts welders electricians radio operators sick bay attendant cooks and quarters staff divers and two complete drilling teams of men a total of in addition there was villiers and myself and the service company personnel who had been flown out to operate the pressure tests according to the log kept by the barge engineer the anchor cable had finally parted at but i didnt see that until shortly after eight nobody called me and when i finally opened my eyes it was because villiers had switched on the light he was dressed and i could see by his face he had been up half the night couldnt sleep he said after he had broken it to me that we were adrift again i dragged on my clothes and dived up the tilted stairway to the toolpushers office the wind was already screaming out of the southwest rain and spray lashing the windows and intermittent glimpses of the sea showed that the waves were shaggy combers thirty feet or more in height a hurricane all right i had brought the hand anemometer up with me and when i held it outside for a moment clinging to the rail my eyes half shut against the wind and driven spray the force of it was already beyond recording back in the radio room i got the duchess on the r t and talked briefly to gertrude they had two anchors out but even close under foula the cables were bar taut and the surface of the water being lifted off the voe will you hold all right i asked her maybe i dont know we watch and hope ja what about you michael i can have a hot bath or eat myself sick watch a film show read a book i stopped there for sparks was just changing the figures against the low on the weather chart it now stood at and then gertrudes voice was saying but you have shetland it is a lee shore there was a pause and then she said johan says the tide could help you i told her i knew that and she said fine and signed off wishing us luck it was the last time i was able to speak to her there was no decca navigator on board north star was not a ship it was not equipped to ride the seas unanchored and alone and once we lost sight of foula the rate of drift was largely guesswork i did some rough calculations knowing there could be only one answer total disaster the rate of drift affected the time the wind direction the place but nothing could stop us hitting the rockbound coast of shetland except possibly the speed and direction of the tidal flow smits view was the same as mine now evacuate to the derrick floor and submerge to maximum depth it was the only way to slow the rate of drift to give us more time tugs were gathering but even if any of them could have got out to us there was no hope of fixing a towline but when we reported to villiers who was lying stretched out in his bunk it seemed impossible to make him understand the gravity of the situation i thought at first he was thinking of the damage to the rig the difficulty of raising finance all the problems he would have to face when and if he ever got ashore but it was more than that he had withdrawn inside himself in the heat of the cabin in the warm security of his bunk he had reached the point where he felt that if he ignored it all the storm would go away but even down there in the depths of the quarters it was impossible to ignore what was happening outside the howl of the wind overlaid the sound of the power plant the crash of the seas pounding at the steel columns of the rig shook the whole structure the noise of it so loud we had to shout finally he said all right hans do what you like youre the barge engineer its your responsibility hans shook his head looking bewildered and scared my responsibility ja but vith you on board it is impossible that i tell the men to leave their quarters and go up into the vind they vill not accept it from me villiers didnt say anything he just lay there his eyes closed you must tell them hans said to go out into the vind is like going over the top into battle and the ballast control engineer who vill have to leave after he has flooded the torpedo tanks vill be lucky if he is not killed they vill do it for you but not for me not vith you ere on board villiers didnt answer time was passing and we had no time i ripped the blankets off him and yanked him out of the bunk come on i said for gods sake tell them now he stood there in his underpants looking vague were more than twenty miles from the coast he muttered seventeen i said nearer sixteen now its not necessary im telling you it is but he shook his head unwilling to accept it i grabbed hold of him then why the hell did you bring me on board if you dont accept what im telling you i need you to advise me you said somebody to take charge in an emergency all right the emergency is now and i am advising you get the men up to the derrick floor and submerge to depth he stared at me his eyes blank and suddenly i knew what it was he was a financier not a leader he could read a balance sheet at a glance could figure out assets and financial gain like a computer he could talk a board of directors into submission by the cold logic of figures but he was no bloody good with men last night telling them about the storm to come it had been facts and figures not the reality of a hurricane blast and huge seas now with the prospect of death a cold terrible battering he was opting out okay i said you got me on board and my lifes at risk get dressed now and come to the messroom ill do the talking but youll be there and youll go with them up to the derrick floor you understand he nodded accepting it slowly yes yes of course and he began to dress it was incredible under orders the blankness had left his eyes i told hans to get every single man on board into the messroom as an outsider with villiers standing there i thought i could do it and i did it was in fact easier than i had expected they werent seamen but most of them had lived with the sea long enough to understand its power and they werent fools they could hear the wind feel the seas thundering against the base of the structure they were ready for action it took almost an hour to get them all up to the derrick floor with their lifejackets on and the rig submerged to depth hans stayed with the ballast control engineer insisting that it was his duty it meant two lives at risk instead of one but they both made it though they were caught by a wave on the catwalk above the pipe deck and hans was swept against a crane and badly bruised in that hour before the rig was down to maximum depth the galley staff had managed to get food and drink up to the derrick floor lennie had collected his first aid kit and blankets clothes bedding the welders had got their equipment up every department had thought for themselves and brought whatever they considered necessary the divers had even dragged their inflatable up and in that wind it was remarkable that they achieved so much without loss of life for the work went on after the ballast tanks had started to flood in the end of course the quarters were left deserted and sparks closed the radio room after that we had no means of communicating with the outside world but somebody had brought a portable up and we huddled round it listening to the one oclock news describing the buildup of tugs and ships and aircraft all waiting to get out to us as soon as the storm had passed the wind was westerly now i dont know what the force was high up on that platform i felt it was beyond anything i had ever experienced the forecast had not been specific hurricane force winds with speeds over a hundred knots the depression had now deepened to a shattering millibars worse still its rate of movement had slowed and it was not expected to clear the north of shetland before midnight the derrick floor normally a demoniac centre of activity with drawworks roaring winches screaming the clatter of tongs and the turntable turning was now still and packed with men but not silent there was more noise on that platform than ever there had been when north star was drilling the wind roaring through it howling at the doors banging and slamming at the corrugated iron shelter sheets tearing them loose whirling them away and below us the pipe deck even the helicopter deck a welter of foam as the combers roared and broke aboard the toolpushers office was the first to go the sea breaking it into matchwood the wind picking it up and hurling bits of it past our refuge pipe and great lengths of casing were swirled back and forth till the guardrails were torn out of the steel deckplates and they went over the side the catwalk was buckled and curled up like the slide in a giant childs playground and all the time we worked to keep large pieces of equipment from breaking loose to shore up and fasten the flapping shield of iron sheet that was all the protection we had everything chaos and the thuds of the waves thundering beneath the rig crashing against it could be felt through our bodies the movement sickening the halfsubmerged rig had a dead feeling it was like a rock awash one of the roustabouts a man called wally was the first to sight land that was shortly after two oclock and he only caught a fleeting glimpse of it i didnt doubt him because it was downwind of us just where it should be and he said it was lowlying the wind was still westerly by the handbearing compass i had brought with me and on my calculations we would go ashore on the west burra coast possibly just south of it i thought perhaps it was havras island he had seen and i wished johan was with us he would have known because the havras marked the entrance to clift sound and the duchesss home voe of taing but in fact it must have been st ninians isle that brief sighting the knowledge that we were so near to disaster finally decided me on a desperate course of action something i had wanted to do but had not dared for fear it would kill us all i looked at hans leaning over my shoulder staring at the chart and helping me to hold it flat on the oilscummed floor the tide turns in just over an hour i said and he nodded knowing what was in my mind i knew what he was thinking too if only we had that spare anchor if only we could use it now now that we were in shallower water it could have held us till the tide turned but then of course we could never have got it over the side there was no electric power and anyway the crane nearest to no winch had already been forced off its mountings the jib leaning at a drunken angle and banging to and fro i got up and lurched across to villiers who was working with a gang of men to shore up the sides of the drillers office i told him what i wanted and he nodded cheerful and seeming almost to be enjoying himself okay go ahead and he turned and continued with his work seemingly indifferent to the risk and the ultimate cost if we survived it seemed an age that the two welders were hanging in their chairs held by ropes as they worked with their torches to cut through the windward legs of the derrick they cut them one at a time and as they worked on the second the rig was slowly turning there was a moment when i was sure i had made a terrible error of judgement and that the whole hundredodd feet of steel would collapse on top of us standing there watching them i could see in my mind the ghastly result as the weight of the crown wheel crashed down on to the packed group of men around me but the rig kept turning and suddenly there was a rending sound somebody screamed a warning a rope flew and one of the welders swung across our heads his torch still burning to be brought up short by the oxygen hose and looking up i watched incredulously as the whole eiffel tower structure trembled and began to move the crown wheel and the traveller swinging dizzily across the scudding clouds the scream of steel on steel the whipcrack of metal breaking and then it was gone just like that i dont think any of us really saw it go one minute it was there the next there was nothing over our heads the tide must have turned about the time the derrick went over the side and i think the absence of it may have made all the difference for in that force of wind the air almost solid with the power of it the derrick must have been acting as a great sail at any rate just over an hour later we began to hear a deep thunderous noise like an artillery barrage this gradually got louder until it was an appalling shattering sound visibility was poor rain and spray screaming past us so that we seemed almost into the backwash surf of the wave breaks before we saw the land the roar of sound was so great then that we were just standing there aghast holding on to whatever we were clinging to frozen into stillness and then downwind of us through the torn and battered iron sheets there was a darkening of the waterlogged air a great mass looming up out of the maelstrom of broken water ever since the barrage of sound had started hans and i had guessed what it was the atlantic hurricane waves pounding at the nearthousandfoot cliffs of fitful head we both of us knew what that could mean but now that we could all of us see the towering mass itself i do not think there was a man among us who did not believe his last hour had come but though it seemed so near we were still out beyond the ten fathom line and the cliffs were moving sliding past the rig being carried southeast by the tide at almost three knots soon we could see the headland of siggar ness and when the tide swept us past it there was open sea wind and tide with us both carrying us southeast towards horse island and the sumburgh roost it was almost dark then and as night fell nothing to see in the pitch black fury all our senses were in our ears and in the feel of the rig under our feet i dont know when we hit the roost the rig was like a halfsubmerged wreck and there was such a pandemonium of breaking waves and crashing gear that it was impossible to tell whether the chaos was the effect of the race or shallows but i didnt care we were in the clear and so long as the pontoons did not strike a reef i was sure a structure as massive as a rig would survive it and then suddenly sumburgh light came clear of the land its revolving beam haloed in the winddriven spray the light bore roughly and within a very short time it was due north of us i knew then that we were in the grip of the great tidal race that streams round the southern tip of shetland i remembered reading all about it in the pilot and on the mary jane i had found an old admiralty tide book ships in it frequently become unmanageable and sometimes founder those words had undoubtedly been written with the fishing boats in mind but the statement it should be given a wide berth was as applicable now as then when we entered the race the tidal flow was with the wind so that we were moving eastward at a considerable speed but the pilot which i had brought with me from the barge engineers office warned that in the roost the tide only ran eastward for about three hours there was then a still of about half an hour after which the tidal flow was westward for nine hours thus we had only a short period of the eastward thrust left the still came and there was less sea the light on sumburgh head blurred and almost stationary bearing roughly that night i was convinced the rig would break up shortly after midnight there was a terrible rending of metal the whole structure shaking to a series of powerhammer thuds the mud tanks had broken adrift they went on rumbling and crashing hour after hour as we lay huddled together for warmth our bodies soaked and shivering with cold it was a terrible night and the pounding went on and on they finally smashed a way through and went over the side shortly after four it suddenly seemed almost quiet the seas were lessening too and sumburgh light bore northeast we were out of the roost an hour later we were back in it again the tide had turned and was carrying us eastward no rain now and with visibility much improved we could check our progress by the bearing of the light in the space of just over an hour it moved from northeast through north to almost northwest that was when we were finally spewed out of the roost by the eastward flow and came under the lee of the land the wind died away and the sea with it dawn found us roughly four miles east of sumburgh head a battered wreck being carried slowly northward on the tide an raf nimrod came over flying low and an hour later the first tug was coming up over the horizon we raised a cheer as it steamed close alongside but though we cheered the tugs arrival we were too cold too dazed to do anything about it the iron staircase to the derrick floor was gone the pipe skid our only way down nobody had the energy to be lowered on a rope to struggle through the tangled wreckage and get a towline fixed we had been inactive so long that we clung to inactivity immobilized by the long dreadful night by the memory of our fear of death so narrowly averted it wasnt for another two hours when there were three tugs and a navy ship milling around us that men boarded us and one by one we were got down from our refuge lowered into boats and taken on board the destroyer villiers was with me in the naval pinnace and i remember my surprise at the extraordinary resilience of the man the sudden return of confidence his squarejawed face was dark with stubble his eyes redrimmed and bloodshot from the shattering force of the wind and his right hand lacerated by a piece of flying metal was still wrapped in the bandage lennie had fixed and yet he could talk about the future about the huge possibilities of the oilfield north star had found maybe it was nervous reaction words pouring out of him as he thought aloud but i couldnt help admiring him if he had had phones beside him he would have been rapping out orders raising finance the rig doesnt matter if we lost half a dozen rigs the cost of them would still be nothing id still have merchant bankers falling over themselves to lend me money if you lose rigs i said you lose lives but he brushed that aside we didnt lose any not during the storm not one and the rig is covered by lloyds how long do you reckon it will take to get it repaired ive no idea i answered tersely i didnt care about the rig i was worrying about the duchess anxious to check that she hadnt dragged her anchors and been forced to put to sea in that maelstrom of a night he pushed his hand up over his face rubbing at the caked salt i have to think of the future he said what this oil strike means to the company a lot of reorganization new management he looked at me then room for somebody like you and he added i owe you a lot randall and youve got brains education financial training even shipyard experience the knack of handling men too the boat was slowing now manoeuvring to come alongside the destroyer and he leaned forward would you like to come down to london for a few weeks get the feel of things whatever for i asked dully thinking of gertrude i dont know yet the rig for a start somebody will have to be cracking the whip then theres the shetland office that will have to expand fast it will be first priority and ill need somebody with a shetland background he was thinking aloud and then he said anyway you come down to london with me ill be needing men like you i looked at him then realizing he was serious ill think about it i said but i knew i wouldnt not if i had gertrude i might be able to handle it but i couldnt see gertrude fitting into the sort of life he was offering me and gertrude was all i wanted thats what the night had taught me she was the rock i was now clinging to without gertrude i would be adrift again but together creating something of our own a service up here in this wild beautiful world we both understood i was thinking of the taing that house the ship lying off and the voe as i had once seen it in moonlight from the bedroom window that was what i wanted my life worthwhile and with purpose not something handed to me readymade and only to be managed something not my own i clambered up the destroyers side and asked the lieutenant who greeted us if i could use the ships r t youre captain randall of the duchess are you your ship will be up with us in about an hour and i have a message for you will you check with mr villiers that she is to resume standby duty under the terms of the charter i looked at villiers and suddenly we were both laughing authors note north star is a natural progression from earlier travels in search of background i was in canada in when the discovery well at leduc was flaring and the first rigs were moving into the redwater field the result was campbells kingdom six years later i was ashore in oman with the first oil expedition on the arabian coast of the indian ocean and wrote the doomed oasis it was inevitable therefore that i should become fascinated by the search for oil off the coasts of my native land i started writing north star in the autumn of with the intention of finishing it late in but world events caught up with me the arabisraeli war the oil embargoes the shortages the price rises and in britain a miners strike and the threeday working week the unions bringing government down a general election suddenly north sea oil was on everybodys lips the one bright spot in the prevailing gloom in these circumstances i felt it essential to bring the book forward and if any errors have crept in then this is the reason however i have had a great deal of technical help primarily i am indebted to shell and to sir david barran who made me free of their staflo rig on a long tow down from the brent to the auk later tammo appelman their seabed expert cleared up many questions of technical detail tricentrols chief exploration manager a f fox was most helpful in pinpointing the location for north stars drilling west of shetland and i am also indebted to him for a final check on drilling technicalities and in the northwest of scotland sir reginald rootes introduced me to the little port of the north opposite his house north star was the name of my rig and also my title right from the first page of writing and here i ran into difficulty at a late stage i discovered that there was in fact a real rig called north star it was of the jackup type drilling in the persian gulf and owned by the offshore company of houston texas however their president w h moore raised no objection when i wrote to him of my problem and i would like to express my appreciation of his understanding and emphasize that there is no connection between the semisubmersible north star rig of my story and his jackup finally i would like to thank charles forret for his help over details of speech in shetland mike burton of newington trawlers and the lowestoft fishing vessel owners association and captain meen for clarification of equipment and layout of the duchess jim mitchell of the hull daily mail for court background and many others who have been of assistance to me during the very concentrated period of writing this book including all those on staflo who gave me of their time and knowledge
