known to the public as professor hemmenway who announced himself on the programme of his entertainment as the magician of madagascar though he freely confessed to his confidential friends that he had never seen the island of that name the two boys were harry vane and jack pendleton american boys of sixteen one had come to australia as assistant to the professor and had been accustomed to sing one or two popular songs at the magical entertainments which he gave besides rendering himself generally useful jack pendleton was a young sailor who had resolved to try his fortune in the new country either at the mines or in any other employment offering fair compensation before resuming his profession harry and the professor had been passengers on board jacks ship and the two boys had struck up an enduring friendship the ship had been wrecked and they had spent some weeks together on an uninhabited island from which they were finally rescued as related in a preceding story facing the world it had been the professors intention to give a series of performances in melbourne and other parts of australia but the unexpected delay had led him to change his plans and he now proposed to return to america at once harry vane however having no near family ties for he was an orphan felt inclined to stay with jack and try his luck for a time in the new world which appealed strongly to his imagination and youthful love of adventure the day had arrived for the professors departure and he and the two boys were waiting for the lighter to take him down the yarra yarra river to the point of embarkation eight miles distant harry said the professor kindly i dont like to leave you here you are only sixteen and i feel that it is a great undertaking for you to attempt to make a living so many thousand miles from your native land i shall feel anxious about you i dont feel anxious about myself professor said harry with the confidence natural to youth i am young and strong and i mean to succeed but suppose you fall sick then jack will look out for me you may be sure of that harry said the young sailor with a glance of affection at harry you might both fall sick is it best to borrow trouble said harry smiling i think we shall come out all right but i am sorry you wont stay with us professor professor hemmenway shook his head i am three times your age harry he said and am not as hopeful or sanguine as you besides i have a wife and children at home who are already very anxious at my long silence i did indeed mean to make a professional tour of australia but the shipwreck and those lonely weeks on the island changed my plans henceforth i shall restrict myself to america i have a competence already and can make an income at home twice as large as my expenses why should i incur any risks i dont know but you are right professor but jack and i are not so fortunate neither of us has a competence and our prospects are probably better here than at home remember harry that if you return i shall be glad to continue your engagement and will even increase your salary jack pendleton fixed his eyes anxiously on harrys face he feared that he would yield to the professors persuasion and leave him but his anxiety was soon removed thank you professor said harry but i dont want to leave jack if i return in bad luck i may look you up and see whether the offer still holds good do so you will always find a friend in me but that reminds me harry of an important consideration if you are to remain here you will want some money i have sixty dollars which i have saved up in your service and how much have you jack the young sailor colored and looked a little uneasy i have only ten dollars he answered that is we have seventy dollars between us jack said harry promptly that is too little said the professor shaking his head you must let me be your banker on one condition professor with thanks for your kindness what is that a gentleman at home mr thomas conway president of the craven county railroad has charge of two hundred and fifty dollars belonging to me i was fortunate enough to save a railroad train from destruction and this is the money the passengers raised for me i will give you an order on him for the amount of your loan that is unnecessary harry i am willing to wait till your return to america something might happen to me professor and i shall feel more comfortable to think that my debts are paid have your own way then harry shall i give you the whole amount no professor i am afraid it would make me less enterprising how much shall it be jack and i have seventy dollars between us a hundred more ought to be sufficient as you please harry but if you get into trouble promise to communicate with me and send for assistance i will sir at this moment a carriage drew up in front of the inn it is the carriage i ordered to take me to the lighter said the professor you and jack must go with me to the ship and see the last of me with great pleasure sir come along jack the hackman put the professors trunk aboard the carriage and they set out for the banks of the river it was a new trunk bought in melbourne for the professors trunk and clothing had been lost at the time of the shipwreck his first care had been to get a complete outfit in melbourne and he was now as well provided as when he left new york the two boys found the trip down the river a pleasant one the trip by land would have been considerably shorter but the professor preferred the river the distance to the mouth is nine miles vessels would be able to ascend the river but for two bars which obstruct its course the city of melbourne is situated chiefly on the north bank and is at present a handsomely built and prosperous town of about five hundred thousand inhabitants at the time of harrys arrival it had less than half that number the country bordering the river is not particularly inviting but it was new and the two boys regarded it with interest the soil was barren and sandy and the trees which were numerous were eucalyptus or gum trees which do not require a rich soil but grow with great rapidity on sterile soil what peculiar leaves said harry they look like leather true said the professor and you notice that instead of having one surface toward the sky and the other toward the earth they are placed edgewise soon they reached the mouth of the river and there just beyond the bar rode the good ship arcturus on which the professor was to sail for boston his baggage was hoisted on board and then the professor himself followed will you come on board boys he asked no sir we will go back by the lighter then goodby and god bless you and bring you good luck harry could not help feeling sober as he bade farewell to his good friend the professor i have only you now jack he said i dont know what lies before us but we must stick fast to each other in sunshine and in storm jacks only answer was to seize harrys hand and press it warmly nothing more was needed chapter ii planning for the future the two boys returned to the crown hotel in time for dinner of which they partook with the zest to be expected of boys thoroughly healthy when the meal was over they repaired to the public room now jack said harry it is necessary for us to settle on our plans all right said jack have you anything to propose no harry you are smarter than i am and i leave it to you thank you jack for your confidence but we are on a par here neither of us knows much about australia we have a great deal to learn then you had better decide for us both very well i accept the responsibility but i prefer to talk over my plans with you first of all then shall we stay in melbourne or strike for the mines just as you say harry but i would prefer the mines i feel that way myself and for that reason i have been making some inquiries there are three principal localities ballarat bendigo and ovens we might try one of the three and if we dont have good luck make ourway to another which shall we try first i have thought of bendigo i hear of one party that cleared two thousand pounds out of one hole how much is that asked jack who was not very well acquainted with any but united states currency it is equal to ten thousand dollars answered harry thats a big pile of money said jack his eyes sparkling true but we mustnt expect to be so fortunate it isnt everybody who succeeds as well as that i should be satisfied with a thousand harry and what would you do with it jack convey it home to my mother harry but i would fix it so that my stepfather couldnt get hold of it you are a good boy jack for thinking so much of your mother i wish i had a mother to provide for and harry vane looked sober do you know how far off bendigo is harry about a hundred miles that is it is seventyfive miles to mount alexander and the mines are twentyfive miles to the north of that it wont take us long to travel a hundred miles said jack hopefully on the contrary it will be a long and difficult journey as far as i can find out the country is full of bogs swamps and moist land then we cant walk no the custom is to charter a cart drawn by oxen which will give a chance to carry a stock of provisions the roads are not very well marked and are often impassable this description rather discouraged jack who was more used to the sea and its dangers than to land travel i wish we could go by water he said so do i jack but unfortunately bendigo happens to be inland however youve got good stout legs and can get along as well as the thousands that do go besides it will give us a fine chance to see the country yees said jack doubtfully for he had very little of the travellers curiosity that prompts so many to visit strange lands theres another difficulty besides the mud continued harry thoughtfully whats that the bushrangers who are they havent you heard of them asked harry in surprise i heard two men speaking of them last night but i didnt take much notice they are highwaymen robbers who wander about and attack parties of miners and travellers and unless successfully resisted strip them of all their property are we likely to meet them said jack eagerly i hope not but we stand a chance of doing so when are we going to start asked jack with alacrity do you want to meet these gentlemen jack inquired harry with a smile therell be some fun about it responded jack harry shrugged his shoulders i dont think therell be much fun about being robbed he said i would rather they would give us a wide berth for my part jack did not answer but from that time he was eager to set out for the mines the hint of danger invested the journey with a charm it had not hitherto possessed in his eyes while the boys were conversing a tall man with heavy black whiskers and wearing a rough suit and a slouch hat appeared to listen attentively at this point he rose from his seat and lounged over to where harry and jack were seated young gentlemen he said do i understand that you are thinking of going to the mines yes sir answered harry surveying his inquirer with some attention and you talk of going to bendigo yes do you know anything about the place i ought to i only came from there last month what luck did you have there may i ask pretty fair i brought back about a hundred and fifty pounds in gold dust and how long were you there four weeks that is pretty good pay for the time thats so especially as i made little or nothing the first three weeks i struck it rich the last week what do you say to that jack said harry turning to his companion nearly eight hundred dollars in a month that pays better than being a sailor answered jack smiling i should say it did when do you expect to start asked the stranger as soon as we can get ready harry replied you are right there have you got money why asked harry rather suspiciously it will cost something for an outfit yes we have a moderate sum with us that is well said the stranger approvingly do you know he continued meditatively i have a great mind to go with you then you are not satisfied with your pile said harry theres very little left of it said their new acquaintance you havent spent a hundred and fifty pounds in a month said harry in surprise pretty much i may have twenty pounds left you must have been living high then no i have lived plainly but the faro table has taken most of it im so near broke that i may as well go back to the mines for a fresh supply before my money is all gone we shall be glad of your company sir may i ask if you are an australian i was born in england but i have been out here half a dozen years and have not made your fortune yet it is my own fault i have been unable to keep money after i got it we are from america i surmised it said the stranger that is a country i want to visit before i die you have mines there too yes but they are a long way from where we live my name is fletcher dick fletcher my friends call me i am harry vane and my friend is jack pendleton we will drink to our better acquaintance here john addressing the barkeeper three glasses of ale here if you wont mind jack and i will take sarsaparilla fletcher stared at them in amazement you dont drink ale he said we belong to the temperance society said harry smiling you wont keep that up long at the mines said fletcher shrugging his shoulders harry did not reply but quietly resolved that he would disprove that statement chapter iii fletcher acts suspiciously one circumstance led harry to hurry his intended departure he found to his dismay that the hotel charge for their very plain accommodations was a pound a day for each of them the crown inn was what would be called in an american city a onehorse hotel there are plenty such to be found in the united states where the rate charged is but a dollar a day but melbourne was full of strangers drawn thither by flaming accounts of the richness of the mines and the bright prospects of acquiring sudden fortunes and war prices were prevalent everywhere five dollars a day exclaimed jack in openeyed amazement do they take us for millionaires i began to think they were imposing upon us said harry till i made inquiries elsewhere i find a pound a day is about the usual tariff for such accommodations as we have but we have only a small bedroom and the meals are very common that is true but it seems to make no difference our money will soon be gone at that rate said jack soberly mine is already gone no it isnt jack we are going to share and share alike you know but that is imposing on you harry protested the young sailor earnestly let me judge of that jack id a good deal rather have your company and half of the money than be alone and have the whole thank you harry you are a true friend i cant do much for you but ill do what i can if i had known of the high prices i would have drawn more money from the professor continued harry however i can make this do but i want to start tomorrow if possible we shall then be owing four days board each and that will make forty dollars at this point fletcher joined them by the way said he nonchalantly i want to ask a little favor what is it asked harry unsuspiciously i am rather short of money can you lend me five pounds jack looked at harry in alarm he was afraid harry would grant the favor knowing his obliging disposition but he didnt know our hero harry was ready to do anything for a near friend but he was too prudent to waste his money on acquaintances who had no sort of claim on him i am sorry to refuse mr fletcher he said but jack and i are ourselves very poorly provided with money and just before you came in we were considering how we could manage to pay for the necessary outfit havent you got five pounds asked fletcher quickly of course we have or we should be unable to get to the mines then i think you might oblige me he continued looking very much displeased i am the best judge of my circumstances said harry shortly fletcher looked hard at him and saw that the boy he had to deal with had a mind of his own and was not to be imposed upon easily still he made a farther effort then i think he said coldly i shall not be able to assist you in your preparations just as you please answered harry promptly as you volunteered i accepted your proposal now i will act for myself i have heard of a party about to start and i will arrange to join it fletcher felt that he was outgeneralled he did not mean to let harry and jack slip through his fingers for he had an idea notwithstanding harrys disclaimer that he had a large sum of money and thought he would be a good party to hang on to he saw that he had made a false move and hastened to repair it excuse me he said assuming a hearty tone i was hasty and i apologize you are right and i like you too well to cut up rough just because you cant do me a favor there take my hand and we will make it all up with pleasure answered harry as he accepted the proffered hand and jack followed his example nevertheless fletchers demand had produced an unpleasant effect upon him the coarsegrained selfishness of the man had shown through his outward varnish of goodfellowship and he felt that henceforth he must be on his guard i may have to ask for some money however continued fletcher in an offhand manner for it is necessary to buy supplies for our journey you know we shant be able to put up at hotels on our way but must furnish our own meals so i have heard answered harry what is it customary to take well it will be best to buy a bag of coffee a sack of flour some ship biscuits potatoes and sugar that will do to start on and we shall vary our diet by what we are able to kill on the way what can we kill well kangaroo meat isnt bad and we can bring down a few birds occasionally then we shall need guns yes it will be well to have them this was another expense upon which harry had not calculated he began to think that he had been very improvident the professor would readily have left him a hundred dollars more and as it would have been repaid with his own money he was sorry he had not availed himself of it how much do you think the supplies will cost asked harry well you had better let me have ten pounds i think that will be sufficient for the whole or for our share asked harry pointedly for your share answered fletcher after a pause it seems to me you are very suspicious really he had intended to make the two boys pay for the whole stock of provisions and save his own purse for he had in reality as much money as they i only wanted to understand clearly said harry quietly as we are in some sort partners that is fair is it not oh yes returned fletcher but he did not respond with any alacrity im always fair and above board i am no man can say that dick fletcher ever tried to get the best of him why if i was better fixed i wouldnt let you two boys pay a cent id shoulder the whole thing myself your offer is a very kind one mr fletcher dont say mr fletcher call me dick interrupted their new acquaintance i will if you wish it though as you are so much older it hardly seems proper what i was going to say was that jack and myself are determined to pay our share we couldnt accept any such favor as you mention thats all right now if you let me have the ten pounds ill take all the trouble off your hands and have everything ready for a start tomorrow morning i would prefer to go with you and help select the articles fletcher looked disconcerted oh well if you think i aint capable he began i think nothing of the kind but i want to learn as much as i can i may have to do it alone some time it was well harry adhered to his determination it saved him three pounds and fletcher was forced to pay his share as he had not intended to do while they were making purchases they were accosted by a tall loosejointed man whom it was easy to recognize as a yankee goin to the mines boys he asked in a strong nasal tone yes answered harry so am i id like to hook on to your party if you aint no objections for some reason dick fletcher did not appear to relish the proposal i dont think we can accommodate you he said abruptly i think we can said harry who was beginning to be distrustful of fletcher and felt safer in adding another to the party there are but three of us and we shall be glad of your company dick fletcher looked angry but did not venture to oppose the plan further chapter iv a timely rescue on the last evening spent in melbourne the boys decided to take a farewell walk about the city not knowing when it would again be their fortune to see it neither fletcher nor their new yankee acquaintance was at hand and they started by themselves they did not confine themselves to the more frequented streets but followed wherever fancy led they had no thought of an adventure but one awaited them as they were turning the corner of a narrow street their attention was suddenly excited by a sharp cry of blended surprise and fright what is it jack asked harry grasping his companion by the arm he did not need to await a reply for by the indistinct light he saw two men struggling a few rods further on one appeared to be an old man with white hair the other was a man of middle age clearly it was a case of attempted robbery run jack run said harry in excitement let us help the old man im with you answered the young sailor briefly harry had in his hand a heavy cane his only weapon but he did not stop to consider the personal risk he was running as he drew near the old man whose feeble strength was quite unequal to a conflict with a man so much younger swayed and fell backward his assailant bent over him and despite his feeble resistance began to search his pockets at the same time indulging in savage threats the old man gave himself up for lost but help was nearer than he anticipated so occupied was the villain with his disgraceful work that he did not hear the approaching footsteps his first intimation of them came in a sounding blow over his shoulders given by harrys stick which was laid on with a good will he jumped to his feet with an oath and darted a rapid glance at his two assailants then much to the surprise of harry he turned and ran rapidly away it was a piece of great good luck harry thought for he was not at all sure that he and jack combined would have been a match for the highwayman are you hurt sir asked harry bending over the old man not seriously was the reply will you kindly help me up with jacks help harry got the old man on his feet he was a tall man of splendid aspect over sixty years of age he looked like a gentleman of wealth and position you have had a narrow escape sir said our hero yes indeed answered the old man thanks to your brave interference it surprises me that my brutal assailant should have run away from two boys i am surprised also sir i feared we should have a hard fight i suppose his object was robbery yes he must have heard in some way that i had a large sum of money about me thanks to you it is safe i am very glad sir do you mind accompanying me to my house this attack has made me timid with pleasure sir the old gentleman lived perhaps a quarter of a mile distant in a handsome house he pressed the boys to enter and they did so he questioned them as to their plans and then selecting two banknotes of large denomination urged the boys to accept them as a recognition of the help they had given him at a critical moment the boys however declined positively to accept any compensation but expressed their satisfaction at having been of service at least said the old gentleman you must promise to call on me when you return from the mines there is my card that we will do with pleasure sir answered harry he looked at the card and read the name of henry a woolson harry said jack as they resumed their walk do you know that robber had a look like fletcher so i thought jack but i had only a glimpse and could not be sure i wish he were not to be in our party we must be on our guard i dont fancy him much when the boys saw fletcher in the morning he appeared as usual and they were disposed to think they were mistaken yet the lurking suspicion occurred to them from time to time and made them feel uneasy the next day they set out on their journey accompanied by dick fletcher and obed stackpole chapter v starting for the mines harry may be considered rash in his immediate acceptance of his yankee acquaintance as a member of their party but there are some men who need no letters of recommendation obed stackpole certainly was not a handsome man he was tall lean gaunt in figure with a shambling walk and his skin was tough and leathery but in spite of all there was an honest manly expression which instantly inspired confidence both harry and jack liked him but dick fletcher seemed to regard him with instinctive dislike what made you accept that scarecrow into our company he asked when stackpole had left them to make his own arrangements for leaving the city harry smiled he isnt a handsome man he replied but i think he will prove a valuable companion you took no notice of my objection to him said fletcher frowning our company was too small returned harry from inquiry i find that parties seldom consist of less than half a dozen i know all about that said fletcher impatiently you might have been guided by me i shall be to some extent answered harry but not implicitly i am going to have trouble with that boy thought fletcher wait till we get on the road aloud he said if you had mentioned the matter to me i would have found someone to go with us you had better tell this yankee that we havent room for him and i will do it now fletchers persistence only aroused vague suspicions in harrys breast he felt glad that stackpole was neither a friend nor likely to prove a confederate of dick fletcher and was resolved to hold on to him i have invited him and i wont take back the invitation he said how old are you asked fletcher abruptly sixteen i should think you were sixty by the tone you assume said fletcher with a sneer do i understand mr fletcher asked harry steadily that you claim to control our party seeing that i am more than twice as old as you are i am the natural head of the expedition i cannot admit any such claim if you are not satisfied to be simply a member of the party like the rest of us i shall not be offended if you back out even now this however did not suit fletcher and with a forced laugh he answered you are a strange boy vane i suppose its the way with your countrymen i dont want to back out as you term it i fancy we shall get along together i wish he had decided to leave us said harry when the two boys were alone somehow i distrust him i dont like him myself said jack but i dont see what harm he can do us nor i but i feel safer with this yankee addition to our party about ten oclock the next morning the little party got off it is needless to say that obed stackpole contributed his full share of expense and more too for he furnished the yoke of oxen that were to draw the cart which conveyed their provisions and other outfit i dont want to push in where i aint wanted he said but im used to oxen and if you want me to ill drive these critters and you three can foller along as you please thatll suit me said fletcher with unusual graciousness ive no doubt you understand the business better than i do i ought to understand it said stackpole i was raised on a farm in new hampshire and used to drive oxen when i wasnt tall enough to see over their backs i never thought then that id be drivin a team in australy what led you to come out here mr stackpole asked harry well a kinder rovin disposition i guess a year ago i was in californy but things didnt pan out very well so when i read accounts of the gold fields out here i jist dropped my pick and started and here i am didnt you find any golddust in california asked fletcher with sudden interest well i found some answered the yankee with drawling deliberation but not enough to satisfy me you see he added ive got two to make money for and who are those two inquired fletcher the first is my old dad hes gettin kinder broken down and cant work as well as he could when he was a young man hes got a thousanddollar mortgage on his farm and i want to pay that off itll kinder ease the old mans mind that a very excellent object mr stackpole said harry who felt still more drawn to his plain ungainly but evidently goodhearted companion i think so myself said obed simply the other person is your wife i fancy said fletcher i expect she will be my wife when i get forehanded enough replied obed its suke stanwood one of farmer stanwoods gals we was raised together and weve been engaged for nigh on to five years very romantic said fletcher but there was a veiled sneer in his tone as he scanned with contemptuous amusement the ungainly figure of his yankee companion i dont know much about such things said obed but i guess suke and i will pull together well you are not exactly a young man said fletcher youve waited some time im thirtynine last birthday said obed i was engaged ten years ago but the girl didnt know her own mind and she ran off with a man that came along with a photograph saloon i guess its just as well for she was always rather flighty it is very strange she should have deserted a man of your attractions said fletcher with a smile harry was indignant at this open ridicule of so honest and worthy a fellow as stackpole and he wondered whether the yankee would be obtuse enough not to see it his doubt was soon solved it looks to me as if you was pokin fun at me fletcher said obed with a quiet steady look at the other im a goodnatured fellow in the main but i dont stand any nonsense i know very well im a rough looking chap and i dont mind your sayin so but i aint willin to be laughed at my dear fellow said fletcher smoothly you quite mistake my meaning i assure you i am the last person to laugh at you i think you are too modest though you are what may be called a rough diamond i accept your apology fletcher said obed if no offence was meant none is taken i dont know much about diamonds rough or smooth but at any rate i aint a paste one a good hit bravo laughed fletcher you are a man of great penetration stackpole and a decided acquisition to our party im glad you think so said obed dryly if i remember right you didnt want me to join you at first i did not but i have changed my mind i didnt know you then and i dont know you now said obed bluntly if you dont mind spose you tell us what brought you out here fletcher frowned and regarded the yankee suspiciously as if seeking his motive in asking this question but his suspicions were dissipated by a glance at that honest face and he answered lightly really there isnt much to tell my father was a merchant of manchester and tried to make me follow in his steps but i was inclined to be wild incurred some debts and finally threw up business and came out here have you prospered as far as youve gone yes and no ive made money and ive spent it and the accounts are about even that means you havent much left right you are my friend but in your steady company i mean to turn over a new leaf and go in for money and respectability now ive made a clean breast of it and you know all about me in spite of this statement there was not one of his three companions who did not feel sure that there was much in fletchers history which he had kept concealed and possibly for very good reasons chapter vi a night incident the path of a goldseeker in australia was beset with difficulties the country about melbourne and far inland was boggy the soil being volcanic and abounding in mud which appears to have no bottom the road to the mines was all the worse for having been ploughed up by bullock teams and worked into a slough which proved the discouragement of mining parties some were even months in traversing the comparatively small distance across the country to the goal they sought but the attraction of money which is said to make the mare go enabled them to triumph at last over the obstacles that intervened it was not long before our party began to understand the nature of the task they had undertaken the cart sank up to the hubs in a bog and the oxen stood still in patient despair well if this dont beat all creation ejaculated obed ive been in the western states and i thought i knew something about mud but australys ahead i say fletcher is there much of this that weve got to go through muds the rule and dry land the exception answered fletcher coolly well thats comfortin remarked stackpole drawing a deep breath i spose people do get through after a while yes generally i was six weeks getting to the ovens once i wish we had some ovens to bake this mud said obed with a grim smile at his joke it would take a powerful large one there was nothing for it but dogged perseverance it took an hour to get the oxen and cart through a bog a hundred feet across and the appearance of the party when they finally reached the other side was more picturesque than attractive how would clinton get along here suggested harry i can imagine the poor fellows despair his trousers would suffer some said jack i think it would break his heart the sea is much nicer if we could only go by water and the young sailor looked down at his mudbedraggled clothes and his shoes caked thickly over with the tenacious mud yes the sea would be cleaner at any rate i agree with you there jack arrived on the other side of the bog they were obliged to give the tired cattle a rest indeed they needed rest themselves at the end of the day they made an encampment as well as they could judge they were about eight miles from melbourne eight miles and how far is the whole distance asked harry about a hundred miles answered fletcher at this rate we can go through in twelve or thirteen days then you mustnt expect this rate of speed said fletcher we shant average over five miles well i hope well get paid for it said obed if we dont id better have stayed in californy we havent any such mines as this in that country youd better have stayed there said fletcher dryly and he evidently wished that his companion had done so varietys the spice of life as my old schoolmaster used to say responded obed i kinder want to see what australy is like all the same i dont want to stump through to the other side of the globe the travellers encamped for the night in a dry spot among a group of gumtrees and it may readily be believed that all slept well the boys felt dead tired and it was with difficulty they were awakened in the morning about five oclock fletcher opened his eyes he was one who slept fast so to speak and obtained as much refreshment from an hours sleep as most people do from a period twice as long he had been lying on the ground wrapped in a blanket as was the case with the other members of the party raising himself and leaning on his elbow he saw that they were all fast asleep he nodded with satisfaction and getting on his feet he approached obed stackpole with noiseless tread the yankee was sleeping with his mouth wide open occasionally emitting a sonorous snore through his aquiline nose he was not beautiful to look upon as fletcher evidently thought illfavored brute he ejaculated id like to choke him if any special advantage had been likely to accrue to him fletchers conscience would not have been likely to stand in the way of violence but his purpose now was different the fellow must have gold about him muttered fletcher i wonder whether i can get at it without waking him up obed seemed to be in a profound slumber but it was a peculiarity of our yankee friend to wake at the least touch this of course was not known to dick fletcher who felt that there would be no risk in a careful exploration of obeds pockets he thrust his hand into one of the yankees pockets with the practiced skill of a pickpocket when an entirely unexpected result followed why you skunk what in creation are you about exclaimed obed suddenly seizing fletcher by the throat let me go said fletcher struggling violently but ineffectually to free himself not till youve told me what you are after let go and ill tell you obed loosened his grip saying sternly are you a pickpocket my enterprising friend or what is the meaning of all this business you had better not insult me said fletcher angrily im no more a pickpocket than you are then what is the meaning of your little game maybe you got up in your sleep no i didnt i just waked up and thought id like to have a smoke but had no matches i thought you might have some in your pocket why didnt you wake me up and ask me you looked so comfortable and i thought you needed rest after a hard days work so i decided to help myself it looks like it responded obed dryly so thats all you were after was it of course said fletcher regaining confidence what else could it be well it strikes me its rather takin a liberty with a gentleman to search his pockets while hes asleep thats all in californy fletcher if you had been caught doin it ten chances to one youd have been lynched and lynchin isnt usually regarded as comfortable or desirable wheres your cigar i havent any but ive got a pipe well i do happen to have a few matches in my other pocket but id rather youd ask for em next time i will the fact is i ought to have brought some with me its very strange old traveller as i am it would have been a little better than borrowin them of a sleepin man without leave dont do it again fletcher im not very likely to borrow them of you again except when youre awake said fetcher with a short laugh do you always wake up so easy he asked in some curiosity always i sleep mighty sound but the least touch wakes me up i shall remember that thought fletcher this yankee is rather a dangerous man to tackle i wont attempt it again unless i have the decided advantage i hope youll excuse me mr stackpole he said aloud in a smooth tone i used to travel with a friend a great chum of mine and we never stood on ceremony with each other i ought to have remembered that you and i are comparatively new acquaintances perhaps it will be best said obed dryly you see when i wake up i dont always have my wits about me and i might cut up rough before i had time to think oh no apologies i beg said fletcher waving his hand whos apologizin demanded obed in surprise never mind its all right i thought you were apologizing for seizing me by the throat as you say you waked up suddenly and didnt have your wits about you well i know ejaculated obed half to himself i didnt think of that way of puttin it youre a cute fellow fletcher thank you mr stackpole now i will have my smoke and fletcher though he did not care for it by way of removing any lingering suspicion lit his pipe and puffed away with apparent pleasure chapter vii parting company i mistrust that man fletcher said obed to harry vane the next day taking the opportunity when at one of their rests the man referred to had sauntered into the woods i dont like him myself said harry have you any particular reason for mistrusting him he was searchin my pockets last night when he thought i was asleep answered obed and he related the incident of the night before it looks suspicious said harry i have not much money but i dont care to lose what i have i should like to shake him but i dont see how we can very well hes a reglar member of the party we can be on our guard at any rate said harry ill tell jack and advise him to be careful also at this point dick fletcher returned he looked suspiciously from one to the other under the impression that something had been said about him he asked no questions however and no information was volunteered he could not but observe however that there was more or less restraint in the manner of his companions toward him and that they were not disposed to be social that day they made nine miles the road being slightly better than the day before about five oclock they reached a rude wayside inn over the door of which was a swinging sign on which was printed travellers rest we might as well stop here instead of camping out said fletcher im agreeable said obed if the tax isnt too high oh linton is moderate in his charges said fletcher ive known him a good while hes a good fellow this was not a very valuable recommendation in the opinion of obed and the two boys but they had no objection to becoming guests of the establishment it was a rude building and the accommodations were very limited in fact there were but two sleeping rooms one of these fletcher occupied and the other was given up to the other members of the party there being two beds id rather bunk in with you if you dont mind said stackpole to harry i dont feel easy in the same room with fletcher we shall be very glad of your company mr stackpole if i snore just come and turn me over i dont want to disturb nobody i think jack and i will be too sound asleep to be disturbed by your snoring said harry with a laugh however if there is any occasion i will follow your directions the landlord was a broadshouldered man of moderate stature who had lost the sight of one eye the other being covered with a green shade gave him an ill look his manner however was hearty and showed a bluff offhand cordiality as he welcomed the party to the hospitalities of the travellers rest he was familiarly called larry by fletcher who greeted him like an old comrade the supper consisted in part of their own supplies with some small additions from the larder of the inn it was at any rate an improvement upon their camp fare and the boys enjoyed it after supper they sat down on a settle in front of the inn but presently fletcher strayed away into the woods at the back of the house some fifteen minutes later larry linton also got up but ostentatiously went in a different direction im going a little ways to a squatters to speak about some vegetables he said if you dont mind company ill go along too said obed better not answered larry theres a boggy spot which a stranger is likely to fall into ive had enough of bogs said obed shrugging his shoulders seems to me you havent got much besides bogs out in australy so linton went off by himself after he was fairly out of the way obed said turning to the two boys did you think i wanted to go off with linton i supposed so as you made the proposal i only wanted to find out if he wanted me or not i have my suspicions what kind of suspicions harry was the speaker as usual for jack never took the lead when harry was present fletcher and linton are too thick together to suit me answered the yankee looks as if they was in league together do you think they have arranged a meeting thats just what i do think but they have gone in different directions objected jack bless your simple heart my boy thats done on purpose said obed cant they fetch round together without our knowing it i didnt think of that jack admitted mr stackpole said harry after a moments thought if you and jack will keep each other company i will explore a little myself i may happen to be at the conference be careful if you do harry said obed dont run no risk ill look out for that in the rear of the house and almost reaching to it was a forest of eucalyptus trees it was unfavorable to harrys purpose that these trees rise straight from the ground and are not encumbered by underbrush it was very pleasant walking though and harry sauntered along at his leisure he almost forgot the object of his enterprise until some half an hour later in the stillness of the woods his quick ear caught the sound of voices he was instantly on the alert the voices he doubted not were those of dick fletcher and larry linton he moved forward cautiously and soon espied the speakers they were sitting on the ground under the overreaching boughs of a gigantic tree harry managed to get near enough to listen to the conversation being himself concealed from view behind the trunk of a neighboring tree is there much money in the party he heard linton ask i cant tell you the boys havent got much but that longlegged yankee has probably got considerable what sort of a man is he hes likely to prove a troublesome customer he is muscular as you can see and not easily scared has he any suspicion of you yes i put my foot in it the other night hows that i saw him sleeping like a boy and thought there was no danger of his waking up so i took the liberty to explore his pockets before i could say jack robinson he had me by the throat and wanted to know what i was after that was awkward how did you get out of it lied out told him i was looking for matches as i wanted a smoke did he swallow it down he didnt contradict me but it has made him watchful and suspicious if id got the money i was ready to make tracks and leave them to find their way as they could at this point the two rose and walked away leaving harry in his position behind the tree as soon as he thought it was safe he came out and made the best of his way to the inn getting there about fifteen minutes before fletcher appeared but without the landlord during that interval he had time to communicate what he had heard to obed stackpole just what i expected said obed the treacherous skunk so hes in league with the landlord is he ill fix him he cautioned the two boys not to show by their manner that they had made any discovery but to appear as usual the next morning the party started as usual they plodded on for almost a mile when obed turning quickly to fletcher said let me look at that weapon of yours a minute fletcher unsuspiciously handed it over i think i shall keep this fletcher said obed eying him steadily im pained to have to bid you goodby what does all this mean blustered fletcher it means that your room is better than your company wed better part would you rob me that revolver is mine and i paid for a share of the things in the cart ill allow you the vally of them and pay you on the spot but we cant go on together suiting the action to the word mr stackpole handed over a handsome sum of money but i dont want to sell my revolver repeated fletcher what am i to do out here alone and unarmed youd better go back to your friend larry linton hell look out for you you will regret this highhanded proceeding exclaimed fletcher angrily maybe i shall and maybe i shant answered obed indifferently ill risk it fletcher halted a moment as if undecided then turned back and was soon out of sight chapter viii a victim of treachery all the party felt relieved to be rid of fletcher without being able to prove anything against him all believed him to be unworthy of confidence now they were a united party and whatever might be the hardships of the trip they were ready to sympathize and cooperate with each other they had already learned that it was no holiday trip they had undertaken the bogs have already been referred to in addition the heat was oppressive in the middle of the day then the numerous insects that infest australia the ants flies and scorpions were most troublesome they had to be very careful to avoid being bitten for the bite of any these is severe and dangerous on the day succeeding their parting from fletcher they accomplished but six miles the road being unusually swampy i feel about tuckered out said obed about the middle of the afternoon just after he had extricated the team by great personal effort from a morass if id a known as much of the country before startin i wouldnt have started at all its a long road that has no ending said harry smiling he too was very tired but youth is hopeful its the worst country i ever travelled in by a long shot if i ever make my pile ill take the first steamer back to frisco whos that suddenly exclaimed jack obed and harry looking up saw a forlornlooking figure approaching them it was a man of middle age and emaciated in appearance looking the image of despair he tottered rather than walked from exceeding weakness for heavens sake give me something to eat i am almost famished he cried why certainly friend answered obed rising and advancing to meet the stranger we dont keep a firstclass hotel but youre welcome to what weve got are you travellin alone yes if you call it travelling ive been dragging myself along for several days hoping to find somebody that would give me aid well youve found somebody here sit down for you dont seem able to stand and well provide for you harry bring some biscuit and cold meat wont you and jack had better build a fire a cup of tea will put new life into you my friend the biscuit were soaked in water and given to the stranger he devoured them like a man in the last stages of hunger go slow my friend your stomach must be weak said obed if you only knew the gnawing at my vitals said the newcomer i have not tasted food for three days i never was in that fix though i did go hungry for twentyfour hours once in californy youd better believe i pitched in when i got to where victuals were how did that happen mr stackpole asked harry i was lost in the mountains answered obed and couldnt find any trace of a livin creature except an old miser who pointed a musket at me and didnt dare to let me into his hut i dont think i could have stood it three days that goes to the right spot said the stranger after he had gulped down two cups of tea now im ready to die without complaining if its all the same to you i think youd better get ready to live said obed id rather die now than suffer as i have done in the last three days you wont have to weve got plenty and to spare but i have no money i have been robbed of everything robbed how is that its rather a long story you may not have patience to hear it weve got time enough and patience enough but perhaps you dont feel strong enough to talk i didnt before you relieved my hunger the food and the tea have put new life into me as you predicted they would then go ahead stranger were all anxious to hear your story i am an englishman began the unknown and my name is ralph granger when the report reached england of the richness of the australian goldfields i sold out my business and was among the first to come out here by the sale of my business i realized about five hundred pounds three hundred i left with my wife i have no children to keep her while i was gone it is very fortunate that i took this precaution and left her so well provided for since had i brought all my money with me it would all have been lost the three adventurers looked at each other soberly the ill fortune of their new acquaintance did not augur very well for their good fortune then you had bad luck said harry inquiringly on the contrary i had good luck replied the stranger good luck repeated harry in surprise then how how did i come into this plight that is what you were about to ask yes you will soon learn on reaching this country i was in doubt whether to go to ballarat or bendigo but finally decided upon the latter we are bound for bendigo said jack so i inferred ballarat is in a different direction very well i reached bendigo three months since for a time i was unlucky i found next to no gold and the prices of living used up about all the money i had left after the expense of getting there just when i was on the point of giving up in despair my luck turned i made a strike and during the next six weeks i unearthed gold to the value of a thousand pounds that certainly wasnt bad luck it was extraordinarily good luck and naturally drew the attention of the rest of the camp this was unfortunate for in such a settlement as may well be supposed there are many reckless adventurers exconvicts and men utterly destitute of principle then you were robbed at the camp not then nor there i took the precaution to send the greater part of my money to melbourne by experts destitute and lost i have six hundred pounds in melbourne awaiting my arrival but for all that i should probably have starved to death but for my opportune meeting with you come then youve got something to live for after all said obed yes you are right let me once get to melbourne and i am all right i shall buy a passage ticket to liverpool and carry with me the balance of my money with all that i have lost i shall go home richer than i came but how did you lose your money asked jack who was eager to have his curiosity gratified when i got ready to leave the goldfields there was no party which i could join i did not like to go alone in this emergency a man who had been working an adjoining claim offered to go with me he professed to have been fortunate and to be ready to go back to the city i saw no reason to distrust him and accepted his proposal we bought each a horse made other preparations and set out together he won upon my confidence and i told him everything he was very comfortably fixed himself he told me and was glad he had fallen in with me as he had been afraid of being robbed on the journey all went pleasantly for three days but on the morning of the fourth day when i awoke i found myself alone a little startled i felt for my gold which i carried in a belt around my waist it was gone and so was my horse of course you guess how it happened my companion had robbed me during the night and left me in the woods utterly destitute what was the name of your companion asked obed quickly he called himself fletcher i thought so exclaimed obed slapping his leg with emphasis we know the gentleman a little ourselves chapter ix a disagreeable surprise you have not met dick fletcher said ralph granger in surprise yes we only parted from him this morning did he rob you no but he tried to here obed gave an account of fletchers searching his pockets during the night he thought i was sound asleep he continued and so i was but it doesnt take much to wake me when i gripped his throat he concluded hed tackled the wrong man did you part company with him then no he pretended he had been in search of matches and i pretended to believe it but kept a good lookout last evening we stopped at the travellers rest and harry here overheard him and the landlord out in the woods concocting a scheme to rob us so i just told the gentleman his room was better than his company and he cleared out i am afraid he will turn up again said granger apprehensively well try to be ready for him said obed coolly but i dont mean to borrow any trouble by this time their new acquaintance had satisfied his hunger he turned gratefully to obed stackpole how can i thank you for your great kindness he said earnestly i feel that you have saved my life tut tut said obed ive only done as you would have done in my place obed stackpole isnt the man to let anyone go hungry when he has enough and to spare but finish your story my friend how long is it since you parted company with that skunk fletcher i think it is only seven days but it has seemed a month and didnt you meet anybody humane enough to relieve your hunger yes during the first four days but not for the last three part of the time i lost my way and did not meet anyone i hope you will never know such torments as i have known in that time amen to that and now my friend what are your plans i should like to go back to melbourne said the stranger hesitatingly if you say so well fit you out with three days provisions and you can push on i hardly like to go alone i am sorry for your sake that we are going the other way you see we havent made our pile yet and must go on i wish we were on our way back with our pockets well lined although you have been robbed youve got a good sum waiting for you in melbourne true i shall be all right when i get there but as i am at present situated it seems very uncertain when i shall have that good fortune ill tell you what youd better do granger come along with us and join the first party we meet bound for the city you will at all events be sure of your victuals till then i believe your advice to be good and will accept your kind invitation when i met you i was about worn out but the tea and food have put new life in me and my strength has returned after an hours halt the little party resumed their march they were compelled to go so slowly in consequence of the difficulties of the way not caring of course to get ahead of the oxen that granger was easily able to keep up he proved to be a pleasant addition to the party and all were glad to have exchanged fletcher for him they were not destined to travel long together however for before nightfall they fell in with a party of eight persons bound for melbourne the two parties halted and had a conference grangers story being told they agreed to let him join their party in consideration of a fair compensation which he agreed to make on his arrival at melbourne goodby granger said obed as they parted i think youre all right now i wish you good luck for the balance of your journey thank you mr stackpole said granger grasping the yankees hand cordially if i do i shall feel that i am indebted to you for my good fortune i shudder to think what would have been my fate if i hadnt fallen in with you then dont think of it goodby perhaps we shall meet again granger also shook hands with harry and jack and so they parted on the best of terms i wonder whether we shall meet with any more of that mean skunk fletchers victims said obed hes in a pretty mean business theres no doubt about that said harry id rather live poor all my life than live by fleecing my neighbors toward the close of the day they entered a much pleasanter country in place of sandy clay baked hard in the sun alternating here and there with a moist bog they came to tall grass trees of great height and meadows suitable for grazing the cattle revelled in the rich feed and obed suffered them to eat their fill feeling that they had worked hard and deserved it though it was rather earlier than usual they decided to encamp for the night near the margin of a creek shaded by trees of a gigantic size harry looked longingly at the clear stream and a vision rose before him of a pond in his native town where he had been accustomed to bathe jack said he lets have a swim im with you said jack promptly ill bet you a shilling ill be in the water first ill make a try for it anyway but jack being more simply dressed was as good as his word and plunged into the creek first harry was scarcely half a minute behind the boys swam dived and frolicked as boys of their age will and were loath to come out at the last after their experience of mud and heat the bath seemed to them delicious i havent enjoyed myself so much since i came to australia said harry with a deep sigh of satisfaction i wish i could have a bath every evening so do i said jack i mean to have another tomorrow morning they slept soundly all night but early in the morning as consciousness returned harry was startled by the sound of hearty laughter he looked at jack and obed in amazement but both were fast asleep indeed the sound seemed to come from above he looked up into the tree beneath which they had encamped but could see no person concealed among the branches he did however notice a peculiar looking bird and it dawned upon him that the laughter proceeded from it he remembered now to have heard of the bird peculiar to australia popularly known as the laughing jackass this was the first chance he had had of hearing it and he woke up obed and jack to hear it also that beats all i ever heard said mr stackpole i wish hed tell us whats the joke and well laugh too this was not the only sound they heard a flock of white cockatoos were roosting on the tree and favored the party with their dissonant cries they are described as having most sharp and rasping voices if thats singing said obed i shant be afraid to try it myself dont you sing mr stackpole asked jack smiling i thought i could once when i was in my teens i attended a singing school and went in the attic one sunday mornin to practise soon my father was at the foot of the stairs and asked me what i meant by sawin boards up in the attic sunday mornin of course the boys laughed but in spite of obeds disclaimer thought they would prefer listening to him to the cockatoos they got ready to move at seven the boys having made sure of a bath first they were not destined to proceed far however about ten oclock as they were skirting the woods six men on horseback rode out from the leafy covert they seemed inclined to dispute the passage of the party what can they want ejaculated harry with a startled look i expect they are bushrangers said obed chapter x fletcher turns up again harry didnt need to be told that bushrangers in australia correspond to bandits in italy and highwaymen in other countries the escaped convicts and desperate characters who are naturally attracted to a new country readily adopted the wild and lawless life of the bushrangers stories of their outrages were common enough and among the dangers apprehended in a journey to or from the mines that of meeting with a party of this gentry was perhaps the most dreaded though obed stackpole betrayed no emotion but was outwardly quiet his heart sank within him when he saw the bushrangers strung along the road i guess our trip to the mines must be given up said he in a low voice to harry meanwhile harry had been scanning the faces of the men who confronted them and made a surprising discovery look obed he said eagerly at that man on the extreme right mr stackpole did look dick fletcher as im a living sinner he ejaculated but at this point the leader of the bushrangers broke silence do you surrender he asked in brief commanding accents i think we shall have to squire answered obed to whom the demand was naturally addressed but i would like to ask a question or two if you dont mind go on are we prisoners of war i didnt know for my part that there was any war in this country i have no time for foolish discussion was the stern reply you must give up what money you have about you its mighty inconvenient squire im a good many thousand miles away from home and peace fool produce whatever you have of value i havent got much youve tackled the wrong man squire fletcher search that man said the captain of the band dick fletcher dismounted from his horse and with evident alacrity advanced to the side of the yankee i think weve met before said obed significantly i think we have said the outlaw showing his teeth i told you we should meet again i cant say im overjoyed at the meeting however i respect you more now when you show yourself in your true colors than when you sneaked up to me at night and searched my pockets pretending all the while to be a friend take care how you talk said fletcher frowning yesterday you were three to one now you are in my power so youre a highway robber are you fletcher well i cant say im very much surprised i guess thats what youre most fit for do you want me to kill you said fletcher touching his hip pocket it isnt safe for you to insult me just so you have a right to be brave with all them men at your side what are you doing there dick fletcher why dont you proceed to business demanded the leader impatiently empty your pockets stackpole said fletcher in a peremptory tone all right the yankee plunged his hands into his pockets and produced in succession a jackknife a plug of tobacco a bunch of keys and a couple of buttons take them fletcher he said if you want em more than i do what do you mean with this tomfoolery demanded fletcher perceiving an impatient frown on the face of his chief hand over your money i guess youll have to search me fletcher youve done it before answered obed imperturbably ive mislaid my money and you may know where it is better than i do fletcher took him at his word and proceeded to search using some roughness about it be careful fletcher said obed im a tender plant and mustnt be roughly handled every pocket was searched but no money was found dick fletcher looked puzzled i cant find anything he said to the captain rip open his clothes said the leader impatiently he has some place of concealment for his gold but it wont avail we shall find it fletcher whipped out a knife and was about to obey directions but obed anticipated him ill save you the trouble fletcher he said as youre bound to have the money i may as well give it up just hand over that jackknife wont you fletcher hesitated not understanding his meaning oh ill give it back to you if you want it but i need it to get the money upon this the knife was given back to him obed cut open the lining of his pantaloons and drew out four fivepound banknotes they were creased and soiled but this did not impair their value i guess thats what you were after said obed i cant say youre welcome to them but that doesnt make any difference to you i take it is that all youve got demanded the chief of the bushrangers looking very much disappointed every cent squire the leader turned to fletcher didnt you tell us this man was well fixed he asked i thought so answered fletcher crestfallen i thought you knew it why this is a contemptibly small sum and doesnt pay for our trouble youre right squire said obed it aint worth carryin away you may as well give it back fletcher thats a different matter continued the captain once more is that all the money you have about you it is squire be careful what you say for if we catch you in a lie well string you up to the nearest tree its as true as preachin squire i never lie im like washington i dare say youve heard of him a further search was made but no money was found luckily for obed since there is reason to believe that the outlaw would have carried out his threat the fellow here fooled you fletcher said the captain sternly take care how you bring us any more false reports there are the boys suggested fletcher uncomfortable under the rebuke search them also this was done or rather it would have been done had not harry and jack fully realizing the futility of resistance produced promptly all the money they had so much however had been spent on the outfit that between them they could only muster about seven pounds humph said the captain contemptuously thats a big haul upon my word there are the cattle and supplies said fletcher they will be of use here peter do you and hugh drive the team into the woods and prepare some dinner for the band we will be there directly two men unmounted who seemed to be servants came forward and proceeded to obey orders hold on squire exclaimed obed in alarm you aint goin to take our team are you most certainly i am if you had had a large sum in money we would have spared you this as it is we must have them but we shall starve without money or food that is nothing to me well boys come along said obed in a despondent tone our prospects aint over bright but something may turn up meanwhile there was a quiet conference among the bushrangers hold said the captain as harry and jack were about to leave the scene with their older companion you can go turning to obed but the boys remain with us chapter xi taken captive harry and jack exchanged a glance of dismay to be stripped of all they had was a serious misfortune but in addition to be made prisoners by the bushrangers was something of which they had not dreamed obed too was taken aback he had become attached to his young companions and he was very sorry to part with them he could not forbear a remonstrance look here squire he said familiarly to the captain what do you want to keep the boys for they wont do you any good and itll cost considerable to keep em theyre pretty hearty harry and jack could not help laughing at this practical argument the captain of the bushrangers frowned i am the best judge of that he said you are lucky to be let off yourself dont meddle with matters that dont concern you take me if you want to said obed independently i shall be lonesome without the boys you had better go while there is a chance said the captain menacingly if you give me any more trouble i will have my men tie you to a tree and leave you here harry was afraid the threat would be carried out and begged obed to make no further intercession i have no doubt we shall meet again he said these gentlemen will no doubt release us soon he was by no means confident of this but he thought it politic to take things cheerfully the boy has sense said the captain approvingly well goodby boys said obed wringing the hands of his two young friends i shall feel awfully lonely thats a fact but as you say we may meet again goodby obed said each boy trying not to look as sorrowful as he felt obed stackpole turned and walked slowly away his prospects were by no means bright for he was left without money or provisions in the australian wilderness but at that moment he thought only of losing the companionship of the two boys and was troubled by the thought that they might come to harm among the bushrangers if i only knew where they were goin to take em he said to himself id foller and see if i couldnt help em to escape to follow at once however he felt would be in the highest degree imprudent and he continued to move away slowly but without any definite idea of where he intended to go when obed had disappeared fletcher came up to the boys and said with a smile so you miss that yankee do you yes i do answered harry you like him yes then i dont admire your taste hes rough and uncouth and is more fitted for a farm laborer than for society that may be said harry but he is honest and reliable he might perhaps unconsciously have emphasized the word honest at any rate fletcher so understood him and took offence at the implication look here young whippersnapper he said roughly youd better take care how you talk you are in my power and something will happen to you if you are insolent what have i said to offend you asked harry looking the bushranger calmly in the face i am not speaking of you but of mr stackpole you meant to insinuate that there was a difference between us that ought not to offend you as you have so poor an opinion of him harry evidently had the best of it and fletcher felt cornered for he did not care to court the charge of dishonesty perhaps you didnt mean anything he growled if so all is well but you had best be careful follow me men said the leader he turned his horses head and rode into the wood the eucalyptus trees are very tall some attaining a height of hundreds of feet they begin to branch high up and there being little if any underbrush in the neighborhood there was nothing to prevent the passage of mounted horsemen the ground was dry also and the absence of bogs and marshy ground was felt to be a great relief the boys were on foot and so were two or three of the bushrangers party as already intimated they were of inferior rank and employed as attendants in general the party was silent but the boys overheard a little conversation between the captain and dick fletcher who rode beside him you havent distinguished yourself this time fletcher said the chief in a dissatisfied tone you led me think that this party had money enough to repay us for our trouble it isnt my fault said fletcher in an apologetic tone the yankee completely deceived me he was always boasting of his money he doesnt seem like that kind of a man said the captain thoughtfully what could have been his object he must have meant to fool me i am ashamed to say he did couldnt you have found out whether his boasts were correct that is just what i tried to do answered fletcher i crept to his side early one morning and began to explore his pockets but he woke up in an instant and cut up rough he seized me by the throat and i thought he would choke me that made me think all the more that he carried a good deal of money about with him the boys too did you think they were worth plundering oh no i never was deceived about them replied fletcher promptly i concluded that even if they had money the yankee was their guardian and took care of it they are all americans you know he spoke glibly and the captain appeared to credit his statements the boys listened with interest and with a new appreciation of fletchers character they could easily have disproved one of his statements for they knew very well that obed never boasted of his money nor gave anyone a right to suppose that he carried much with him on this point he was very reticent and neither of them knew much of his circumstances however it would have done no good to contradict fletcher for his word with the captain would have outweighed theirs and he would have found a way to punish them for their interference in future said the captain i advise you to make sure that the game is worth bagging as it is you have led us on a fools errand that may be fletcher admitted but it wasnt so last time the scotch merchant bled freely you must allow yes you did better then as harry listened he began to understand that fletcher acted as a decoy to ingratiate himself with parties leaving melbourne for the mines and then giving secret information to the bushrangers with whom he was connected enabling them to attack and plunder his unsuspecting companions thats a pretty mean sort of business he said to jack when he had an opportunity to speak to him without being overheard id rather be a robber right out than lure people into danger so would i responded jack that fletchers worse than a pirate still they went on so slowly that the boys though compelled to walk had little difficulty in keeping up they were necessarily anxious but their predominant feeling was of curiosity as to their destination and as to the bushrangers mode of life at length they came out of the woods into more open ground chapter xii the home of the bushrangers on a slight rise stood a collection of huts covered with sheets of the bark of the gumtree held on by ties of bullock hide for the most part they contained but one room each one however was large and the boys afterward learned was occupied by the captain of the bushrangers another served as a stable for the horses of the party this harry judged to be the home of the outlaws for no sooner had they come in sight of it than they leaped from their horses and led them up to the stable relieving them of their saddles then the bushrangers sat down on the ground and lounged at their ease the attendants forthwith made preparations for a meal appropriating the stores which had just been taken from obed and the boys the captives were not sorry that there was a prospect of a meal for by this time they were hungry they followed the example of their companions and threw themselves down on the ground next to them was a young bushranger apparently about twentytwo years of age who had a pleasant face indicative of good humor how do you like our home he asked turning to harry with a smile it is a pleasant place answered harry how would you like to live here i dont think i should like it harry replied honestly and why not is it not better than to be pent up in a city here we breathe the pure air of the woods we listen to the songs of the birds we are not chained to the desk or confined from morning till night in a close office that is true but are there not some things you do not like about it asked harry significantly such as what is it not better to earn your living even if you are chained to a desk than to get it as you do harry felt that he was rather bold in asking this question but he was reassured by the pleasant face of the young outlaw well admitted the latter there are some objections to our life it would not do for all to get their living as you do that is true some must work in order that others may relieve them of a portion of their property are you not afraid of being interfered with by the mounted police yes we are strong enough to overcome them said the bushranger carelessly what is the name of your captain asked harry stockton no doubt you heard of him in melbourne harry shook his head the outlaw seemed surprised i thought everybody in australia had heard of ben stockton he said he has a great name he added with evident pride he is as strong as a lion fears nothing and his name is associated with some of the most daring robberies that have ever taken place in this country and still he is free said harry suggestively the authorities are afraid of him they have offered a reward for his capture but it doesnt trouble him he only laughs at it they were far enough away from the rest of the party to carry on their conversation unheard otherwise neither harry nor his informant would have ventured to speak with so much freedom at this eulogium however harry scanned with some curiosity the face and figure of the famous bushranger who was sitting about three rods distant he was a man of large frame powerfully built with hair and beard black as night and keen penetrating eyes that seemed to look through those upon whom they were fixed he had about him an air of command and conscious authority so that the merest stranger could not mistake his office about his mouth there was something which indicated sternness and cruelty he was a man to inspire fear and harry after a steady examination felt no surprise at the mans reputation how long has he been captain asked harry ever since i joined the band answered the young man i dont know how much longer how long have you been a member of the band five years you must have been a mere boy when you joined i was seventeen i am twentytwo now i should like to ask you a question but you may not like to answer it go on if i dont care to answer i will tell you so what induced you to join the bushrangers i will tell you said the young man showing neither offence nor reluctance i was employed in melbourne in a business establishment one of my fellowclerks stole some money and to screen himself managed to implicate me by concealing a part of the stolen money in my coat pocket i knew no way to prove my innocence and my employer was not a man to show pity so i escaped from melbourne and took refuge in the bush there i fell in with captain stockton who offered me a place in his band i accepted and here i am but for the act of your fellow clerk you would have been an honest business man today then very likely what a pity said harry regretfully for he was much attracted by the open face and pleasant manners of the young man so i thought at first but i became used to it after a while i grew to like the free life of the bush i dont call it free you cant go back to melbourne for fear of arrest oh yes i have been there several times said the young man carelessly how did you manage it asked harry puzzled i disguised myself sometimes the captain sends me on special business like fletcher asked harry quickly no i shouldnt like that work it suits him however i never should have taken you for a bushranger you look too honest the other laughed i think i was meant to be an honest man he said that is i am better suited to it but fate ordained otherwise fate yes i believe that everything that happens to us is fated and could not have been otherwise you think then that you were fated to be a bushranger i am sure of it that then accounts for it not troubling you you are right we cant kick against fate you know i shouldnt like to believe as you do said harry earnestly youll come to believe it sooner or later said the outlaw with an air of conviction then what is the use of trying to lead a good and honorable life thats just what i say there isnt any use harry had never before met anyone holding such views of fate he was interested but repelled he felt that he could not and would not accept any such idea and he said so youll change your mind after you become one of us said his companion after what ejaculated harry after you become one of us but that will never be how can you think such a thing because i know it is to be why do you think the captain brought you here he had your money and couldnt get any more out of you do you really mean what you say asked harry his heart filled with a sickening apprehension that this might be true of course i do the captain likes young people you two boys are smart and bright and he is going to make you members of the band he cant ill die first exclaimed harry with suppressed energy you will see but hush dont speak so loud for my part i shall be very glad to have you among us you will be companions for me you are only about a year younger than i was when i joined at this moment their companion was called away and harry bending toward jack whispered in his ear i am afraid he is right about the captains intentions we must try to escape as soon as there is any chance im with you jack whispered back chapter xiii a trial and its tragic finale harry was very much disturbed by the communication of his new acquaintance whose name he ascertained to be wyman it was not very pleasant of course to be a prisoner but this he could have borne being confident sooner or later of escaping but to be forced to join these lawless men and render himself like them an outlaw and outcast from respectable society seemed terrible he determined that come what would he would preserve his integrity and his honest name he might be illtreated but they could not force him to become a bushranger he talked the matter over with jack and the young sailor agreed with him presently the meal was ready and the two boys were served with the rest notwithstanding their precarious position each ate heartily it takes a good deal to spoil the appetite of a growing boy after eating the captain clearing his throat addressed the band my men he said we have refreshed ourselves by eating and now a less pleasant scene awaits us i am your captain and to me you have sworn implicit obedience is it not so yes yes answered the bushrangers it is a necessity of our position we have withdrawn from the world and we lead a free untrammelled life in the bush we scorn the laws that the colonists have made and prefer to govern ourselves is this so there was a hoarse murmur of assent as a consequence the captain proceeded we are hunted like wild beasts our enemies have laid plots to ensnare us but thus far they have not succeeded while we stand together we are safe again there were signs of assent and approval as captain stockton paused but one thing is essential there must be no traitor no malcontents among us a large reward has been offered for my apprehension five thousand pounds it shows how much they are afraid of us and he raised his head with unconscious pride against open enemies we can hold our own but not against the secret foe who sits beside us as a friend and eats and drinks with us when such a one is found what shall be his fate he paused for a reply and it came from the lips of all in one stern word death i am answered said the captain the sentence has been pronounced not by my lips but by your own here he turned to two attendants who were stationed near at hand bring forth the traitor he said the two men disappeared within one of the huts and immediately reappeared leading behind them a third with his hands tied behind him his face was covered by a black cloth which effectually screened his features from the general observation all eyes were turned on the unhappy man harry and jack regarded the scene with painful interest they guessed what was coming complete your task said the captain with a wave of his hand the two guards set the offender with his back to a tree and producing a rope quickly passed it round his waist and tied him securely with his screened face toward the band wretch said the captain in a terrible voice you thought to betray us and expose us to punishment and death but the doom which you were ready to bring upon us has recoiled upon yourself you would have sold your captain and comrades for gold they have pronounced your doom and it is death have you anything to say the victim did not speak but slowly inclined his head in hopeless submission to his fate you have nothing to say for yourself is there anyone to speak for you one of the bushrangers sprang forward impetuously yes captain i will speak for him captain stockton frowned fiercely but uttered one word speak the daring outlaw who had stepped forward a little from the line commenced this man is my brother we were nursed by the same mother we played together by the same fireside we grew into manhood together and together we joined this band of brothers he paused a moment and the captain said briefly well now continued the brother you would condemn him to a shameful death which he does not deserve what exclaimed the captain his face becoming pale with anger what do you dare to say do you question the justice of our sentence would you excuse a traitor he is no traitor said the brother boldly was he not caught attempting to escape answer me instantly yes but he had no intention of betraying any of us what then was his object demanded captain stockton sternly he meant to leave you he had become tired of the life of a bushranger he wished to return to the paths of honesty and live by labor at some respectable trade and why was this why after so many years had he become tired of our noble independence in one of his missions undertaken in the interest of the fraternity he had made the acquaintance of a young girl modest and attractive he wished to marry her but as a bushranger he knew this was impossible therefore he resolved to leave our band and enter upon a new life he would never have uttered a word to imperil the safety of his captain or his comrades and you expect us to believe this said the captain with a sneer i do i swear it is true and what do you expect me to do robert graham to consider his temptations and to show mercy upon him perhaps also you expect me to release him and bid him go his way to the maiden who is waiting for him it would be a generous act but i am not so generous said the captain your plea is ingenious but i put no faith in it it is utterly improbable you and your brother have been with us for seven years you have become accustomed to our ways he was faithful and loyal till the love of gold made him a traitor what he sought was blood money no a thousand times no exclaimed the brother earnestly i say it is so said captain stockton harshly it is plain to every member of the band yet because you have never transgressed i have been willing to listen to you remembering that he is your brother spare his life at least even if you are convinced that he is guilty he has not lived his life half out be merciful i cannot answered the captain in an inflexible tone if i yielded to such a weakness all discipline would be at an end if treachery is to be pardoned who knows which one among you might be the next to imitate the example of this man no justice is stern and punishment must be inflicted the guilty must be punished though the heavens fall men stand aside illustration the death of the bushranger captain this was addressed to the two men who stood one on each side of the condemned bushranger they obeyed the command of their chief and he raising his revolver pointed it at the breast of the unhappy offender there was a moment of intense excitement harry and jack were spellbound their faces were pale and wore an expression of horror they were about to see a human life taken they could hardly forbear uttering a groan the silence was broken by a sharp explosive sound the deadly weapon had done its work but it was not the captive who had received the winged messenger of death it was the captain himself who staggered and with one convulsive movement fell prone to the earth chapter xiv election of a new captain the excitement among the bushrangers was intense simultaneously they started forward and two of them bending over lifted the body of their prostrate leader but he was already dead the bullet had reached his heart and probably he never knew what hurt him robert graham the man who had caused his death stood erect and unflinching he threw his weapon upon the ground folded his arms and said in a tone devoid of fear comrades do with me what you will i could not help doing what i did it was either my brothers life or his sandy was innocent of the crime charged against him he had no thought of treachery though he did mean to leave your ranks is there anyone among you that would stand by and see his brother murdered before his eyes when he had the means of preventing it the bushrangers looked at each other in doubt they had at first accepted the captains statement that sandy graham was a traitor his brothers explanation of his attempted desertion put a new face on the matter then again there was not one among them that had not tired of their despotic leader alive he had impressed them with fear and held them in strict subordination but he was far from popular and had no real friend among them so though they were startled and shocked there was no one to shed a tear over the dead it was a moment of doubt when a leader was wanted well said robert graham after a pause what are you going to do with me i wait your pleasure he ought to be served as he served the captain said fletcher who disliked graham and had always been a toady to captain stockton i say no rejoined rupert ring a man of medium height but of great muscular development it was a terrible deed but had my brother i have a brother in england whom i have not seen for fifteen years been in sandy grahams shoes i would have done the same there was a half murmur which seemed like approval and after all continued ring though sandy graham was in fault he is not the first man that has been beguiled by a fair face no no was heard from several of the bushrangers i dont wish to speak ill of the dead but he drew the reins too tight at times he forgot that we have rights again there was a murmur of assent it was evident that he was carrying his comrades with him i move therefore that we pass over robert grahams deed as one to which he was impelled by brotherly affection and that we restore sandy graham to his place in our ranks on condition that he does not repeat the offence those who agree with me hold up their right hands all hands were raised except that of fletcher release the prisoner said ring turning to the two attendants instantly the rope was cut the dark cloth was removed and sandy graham a tall athletic goodlooking fellow stepped forth his face pale from the terrible strain to which he had been subjected comrades brothers he said in a voice indicating deep emotion i thank you for giving me back my life it shall be devoted to your service the first to press forward and grasp his hand convulsively was his brother robert graham robert said sandy but for your brave act i should have been lying dead instead of him and he pointed with a shudder to the dead captain for your sake sandy said robert solemnly i have shed human blood to save your life i have become a murderer no robert you cannot be called that any more than if you had shed blood in selfdefence their conversation was interrupted by rupert ring comrades he said the captain is dead we can do nothing without a leader we should appoint one at once here fletcher pushed forward i am the oldest in service among you he said i was the trusted friend of captain stockton i submit that i have the best claim to be your leader but among bushrangers as in other communities the man who is the most anxious to secure office is very apt to be left in the lurch now it happened that fletcher was by no means a favorite in the band he was sly and sneaking in his methods currying favor with the captain even at the expense of manliness and selfrespect and there were serious doubts as to his courage if he had been wiser he would not have made a boast of his standing with the late leader for the men were heartily tired of his tyranny and resolved to elect someone in his place who bore no similarity to him rupert ring smiled slightly as he heard fletchers modest claim comrades he said you have heard fletchers appeal it is true that he is the oldest in service among you it is for you to consider whether that entitles him to the post of leader those of you who are in favor of dick fletcher as your leader will signify it by raising your right hands fletchers eye wandered anxiously around the circle to his chagrin not a single hand was raised save his own there was a cheer of derision which brought an angry flush to his cheek then a clear voice was heard it was that of the young man wyman whose conversation with the two boys has already been recorded i nominate rupert ring for our leader he said there was a chorus of approval which emboldened wyman to add as he cant very well put the question on his own nomination i will do so those of you who want ring for your captain please hold up your right hands all hands were raised except that of fletcher that settles it said wyman who was unversed in parliamentary language i call for three cheers for captain ring the woods echoed to the lusty cheers of the bushrangers it was evident from the general expression of satisfaction that the choice was a popular one comrades said the new captain modestly i did not look for this promotion as you may have thought from my taking the lead just now but i saw that it was necessary for somebody to act i dont know whether you have made a wise choice or not but i will do my best to make you think so since i am your captain it is my duty first to see that proper honor is paid to the remains of your late captain whom sudden death has overtaken you two lift the body and carry it into yonder cabin the two attendants did so prepare a coffin and at daybreak we will commit him to the earth whatever else may be said of him he was a brave man and knew not fear that is true said robert graham in a low voice as to his faults those we have no further concern with all of us have faults and no doubt grave ones fletcher till now had sulked in silence he was terribly disappointed that he had been passed over and rupert ring promoted to the place of chief but since it was so he felt that it was politic to stand well with the new administration captain ring he said extending his hand let me be the first to congratulate you on your election as our captain ring smiled slightly he had never liked fletcher i accept your congratulations fletcher he said and condole with you on your own disappointment we cant all be leaders i hope to enjoy your favor as i did that of captain stockton continued fletcher smoothly that will depend on yourself said ring shortly i would like to suggest that the two boys here fletcher turned in the direction where harry and jack had been standing and ejaculated in dismay i dont see them what has become of them they have taken advantage of the excitement and confusion to run away i fancy said the new captain quietly this was quite true just after the fatal shot had been fired and the attention of all had been taken up by the tragedy harry had whispered to jack nows our time to escape jack follow me im with you responded jack promptly and no one noticed the two as they vanished among the trees shall i go after them captain ring asked fletcher in excitement ill take another man and scour the woods for them it is not necessary said ring indifferently let them go they would only be in our way but protested fletcher captain stockton meant to take them into the band they are bright and smart boys and would grow up into useful members heaven forbid said ring earnestly our lives are spoiled already and we have no chance but to continue leave them to grow up innocent this is strange talk for a captain of bushrangers said fletcher disappointed remember that i am your captain retorted ring sharply and dont attempt to interfere with me go i would be alone fletcher slunk away mortified and disappointed it was well for the two boys that he had not been elected captain chapter xv lost in the woods yes the two boys had escaped when the excitement produced by the fatal shot was at its height it had flashed upon harry like an inspiration that then if ever was the time to escape he knew that it would be at the risk of their lives and but for one consideration it is doubtful if he would have been willing to incur the peril of the attempt but he felt that to stay was to run a risk as great that of being compelled to join the ranks of the bushrangers and of that he had a great dread the boys never stopped running till they had set half a mile between them and the camp of the bushrangers jack was the first to show distress hold on harry he said panting i am all out of breath harry instantly slackened his speed look back jack he said anxiously see if you can discover anyone pursuing us i see no one answered jack after a prolonged look they have other things to think of said harry the murder of their captain has put all thoughts of us out of their heads when the excitement has subsided a little i am afraid they will look for us how terrible it was he added with a shudder yes returned jack i saw that man the captives brother lift his weapon and point it at the captain almost before i could speak it was discharged and the captain fell he must have been killed instantly i little thought what lay before me when i left home said harry i wish i knew what lies before us now said jack i am afraid our prospects are rather dark we must take care at any rate not to fall again into the hands of the bushrangers i am most afraid of that man fletcher if he could have his way he would show us no mercy let us go on again said jack i only stopped to catch my breath you are right jack the farther we get away from the bushrangers the better before them was a densely wooded hill the way had become difficult with the scrub bushes that filled up the distance between the trees the latter were no longer the same which they had hitherto encountered the tall and stately eucalyptus but were smaller and wider branched we cant make our way here harry said jack despondently oh yes we can besides dont you see the rougher and more difficult the way the less are we likely to be followed i am willing to go through a good deal to save capture so am i answered jack you are always right push ahead and ill follow for three or four hours the boys kept on their way they surmounted the hill and found a clearer country finally turning to the right they came upon an open tract by this time it was growing dark and the boys were feeling both fatigued and hungry i think we can rest now jack said harry with a sigh of relief jack threw himself on the ground this is worse than any work i did on shipboard he said harry smiled i dont think it is likely to cure you of your love for the sea jack he said though i havent your fondness for sea life i confess i would rather be on the deck of a good stanch ship than here harry said jack anxiously when do you think we shall find something to eat i am terribly hungry so am i jack its the hard walk that has increased our appetite i have often thought i might be afloat in an open boat without anything to eat but i never expected to be caught in such a pickle on land a good many things have happened to us today that we didnt expect said harry do you know jack it seems the longest day i ever spent i can say the same this morning we set out with obed free from care we have been captured by bushrangers taken to their camp seen the murder of their leader escaped and after walking for miles through a rough wilderness here we are tired out and in danger of starvation dont say any more harry said jack faintly i can realize it without your description i wish obed were with us said harry after a pause perhaps he could think of some way out of our trouble he is an experienced man and is used to roughing it as for me i feel helpless do you think there is likely to be any house near at hand it doesnt look like it said harry shaking his head i dont think i should mind much being caught and carried back by the bushrangers if they would give me a good supper said jack ruefully poor jack said harry compassionately i do believe you are suffering for food i told you so harry my appetite no doubt will come later at present i am not very uncomfortable well jack there is only one thing to do we must explore further and see if we can find any trace of a human habitation suppose you go to yonder knoll and climb the tree at the top then use your eyes for all they are worth they are better than mine at any rate for you are accustomed to use them at sea all sailors i have heard are farsighted jack was ready to obey harry feeling much more confidence in his judgment and discretion than in his own he accordingly followed his advice and with a sailors agility mounted the tree then shading his eyes with his hand he looked earnestly first in one direction then in another well jack inquired harry anxiously for he too appreciated the gravity of their situation there was a pause then jack called out joyfully i see a light yes i am sure i see a light whereaway straight ahead or a little to the left take a good look jack so as to be sure of your bearings then we will make our way toward it with the best speed we can muster jack scrambled down from the tree with his face actually cheerful the prospect of a meal had put new life into him follow me he said i dont think it can be more than a mile away chapter xvi the shepherds hut not feeling their fatigue so much now that they were buoyed up by the hope of shelter and food the two boys plodded on the way was at times difficult and there was no glimpse of the light which jack had seen from the treetop do you think you are on the right track jack asked harry anxiously yes i feel sure of it answered the young sailor it would be very unlucky if we had wandered from the right direction yes i should feel like lying down and giving up but i am sure i am right events proved that jack was right they came to an open place from which they could distinctly see the light gleaming from a dwelling only forty rods away there what did i tell you demanded jack triumphantly you are right jack i am glad enough to admit it now the question is will the people who occupy the house let us in they cant be so inhuman as to refuse pass on harry they were not long in reaching the hut it was one of those slab huts which are used by shepherds they are lonely enough the stations being in some instances twenty miles from the nearest dwelling this was a single dwelling the home of one of the out keepers the chief stations are usually an aggregation of dwellings in the yard was a pile of wood for fuel close at hand was a paddock surrounded by a rail fence over which hung a number of sheepskins all these evidences of habitation cheered the hearts of the lonely boys harry went up to the door and knocked his knock appeared to create some commotion inside a voice was heard and then there was audible the barking of a dog but no one came to the door suppose you knock again harry said jack they must have heard my first knock perhaps they dont want to let us in however harry knocked again again the dog inside barked this time with fierce emphasis is there no one inside but the dog thought harry anxiously having no weapon with him he took a piece of a broken rail so that in case of necessity he might have a means of defence he was about to venture on a third knock when a tremulous voice which the boys at once recognized as that of a girl was heard from within who are you what do you want we are two boys who have lost our way and are almost starved answered harry for heavens sake let us in and give us something to eat there was a pause the girl being evidently undecided are there only two of you she asked only two you are sure there is no one with you no one and you are boys yes what brings you here in this lonely place at this hour we are on our way to the goldfields of bendigo but this is off the road i know it the fact is we were captured by the bushrangers and have made our escape we plunged into the woods thinking we were less likely to be caught and carried back there was a change in the girls tone as she said is this really true you are not bushrangers yourselves no i hope not answered harry with a boyish laugh this laugh which sounded natural and genuine evidently inspired the girl with confidence if i let you in will you promise to do no mischief she asked you shall have no cause to regret admitting us we promise that there was still a little pause of indecision and then a bolt was drawn and the door opened the two boys saw in the doorway a pleasantfaced girl of fourteen whose eyes fell upon them not without a shade of anxiety but when she saw that the two visitors were boys not much older than herself there was a look of relief and she said i will trust you come in if you like hush bruno this was addressed to a large shepherd dog that stood beside her eying them suspiciously a weight seemed lifted from the hearts of the two boys as they caught sight of the comfortable interior of the hut on the one side of the room was a large open fireplace on which a good fire was burning the flickering flames helped illumine the apartment and diffused a homelike air which was most grateful to the two tired wanderers you are very kind to admit us said harry you have no idea how great a favor it is i would have let you in before but i thought you might be bushrangers said the girl we dont look much like bushrangers do we said harry with a smile the girl smiled too she was evidently pleased with the appearance of her two visitors no if i had seen you i should have known better than to think you belonged to their band come in and sit down by the fire thank you harry and jack seated themselves on a settle near the fire and the girl continued to eye them curiously i suppose you are boys she said we dont call ourselves men yet answered harry i never saw a boy before was the unexpected remark of their young hostess what ejaculated the two boys in concert i scarcely ever saw anybody explained the girl my father and i live here alone and have lived here for years he has a flock of fifteen hundred sheep to watch and tend sometimes another shepherd calls here and we had a visit from the bushrangers last year it must be very lonely for you said harry in a sympathetic tone yes it is but i am used to it father is away all day but he leaves bruno to keep me company come here bruno said jack in a coaxing tone bruno eyed jack dubiously and finally walked up to him deliberately and allowed himself to be stroked bruno doesnt think we are bushrangers said jack smiling he did at first though the girl replied with an answering smile have you been walking all day yes the greater part of the day then you must be hungry we are almost starved said harry tragically are we not jack i am quite starved said the young sailor then i must get you some supper said the girl in a hospitable tone thank you said harry earnestly will you let me know your name he asked my name is lucy my grandmothers name was lucy said jack then you may look upon me as your grandmother said the girl demurely of course all three laughed heartily at this absurdity then lucy moved about with quick steps and soon a goodly supper of muttonchops was fizzling in the fryingpan sending forth savory odors that made their mouths water presently lucy drew out a table and placed upon it the chops and some cold bread i would boil some potatoes she said but you might not like to wait so long i think we wont wait lucy you havent told me your name said lucy as they drew up to the table my name is harry vane said the possessor of that name and mine is jack pendleton harry and jack repeated lucy nodding yes and where do you come from from america isnt that a long way off yes thousands of miles off seven or eight i think you are very young to walk so far said lucy but perhaps you rode did the bushrangers steal your horses we came over the sea said harry jack is a sailor lucy looked at jack curiously as if a sailor were a strange species of animal at this point bruno raised his head looked toward the door and began to bark i think my father must be close by said lucy bruno is always the first to hear him chapter xvii a welcome in the wilds before lucy could reach the door it was opened and a stalwart man of middle age paused on the threshold in evident surprise whom have you here lucy he asked in a tone of displeasure two boys papa who came here in distress having lost their way did i not caution you against admitting strangers continued her father with a slight frown yes but these are boys not men harry vane thought it was time to start i hope sir he said you wont blame your daughter for her kindness to us we stood greatly in need of friendly help having been robbed of everything by the bushrangers from whom we managed by good luck to escape some hours since the shepherd regarded harry keenly and proceeded to crossexamine him you say you were captured by the bushrangers he said yes sir when was this this morning just after breakfast where did it happen harry told him where were you going to the mines at bendigo how large was your party there were only three of us a countryman of ours and ourselves where is he the bushrangers robbed him and let him go why did they not release you and your friend because as a young member of the band told us the captain meant to spare us to join the band you are young to be travelling to the mines what countrymen are you we are americans humph your story sounds well enough but how do i know that you are not spies of the bushrangers harry vanes eyes flashed indignantly i hope you wont think so badly of us he said the shepherd seemed somewhat impressed by his indignant denial which certainly seemed genuine enough but wanted information on one point how did you manage to escape that doesnt seem very probable at any rate we both took advantage of the excitement occasioned by the murder of captain stockton he began what exclaimed the shepherd in profound astonishment captain stockton murdered when by whom of course harry told the story but that need not be repeated the shepherd listened in evident excitement if this is true he said nothing better could have happened for this part of australia this man stockton is noted everywhere as the most desperate and cruel of the bushrangers i cant begin to tell you how many atrocious crimes he has committed he killed my brother in cold blood three years since here the shepherds face darkened because he defended the property of another and tried to save it from being stolen if he is dead i am deeply profoundly grateful you need have no doubt on that point sir said harry jack and myself saw him shot down there can be no doubt of his death i believe you speak the truth you dont look as if you were deceiving me so you took the opportunity to give the bushrangers legbail eh we didnt stay to bid them goodby said harry smiling we ran till we were out of breath but saw no one on our track probably it was some time before we were thought of and our escape noticed we have been walking ever since and were ready to drop with hunger and fatigue when we espied the light of your cottage and ventured to ask for help you are welcome to all that we can do for you said the shepherd his tone changing i was suspicious at first for the bushrangers are up to all sorts of tricks but the news you have brought insures you a welcome at last my poor brother is avenged and the bloodthirsty villain who killed him has gone to his account you dont know who is elected in his place no sir we came away at once of course of course i should have thought of that i hope it isnt fletcher said jack ha what do you know of dick fletcher more than we want to he it was who passed himself off on us as a returned miner and betrayed us into the hands of his comrades i know of him too he would be as bad as the captain if he dared but he is a coward his turn will come after a while but lucy here he addressed his daughter you are not treating your guests very well where are your potatoes and other vegetables they were so hungry they preferred not to wait for them papa you may put them in the pot now i want them and i think our young friends will be able to eat them later you are very kind sir but i am afraid jack and i will not be able to compensate you the bushrangers took all we had and left us penniless i dont want your money boy you are welcome to all you get in this house we dont have visitors very often when they do come they have no bills to pay unless they are bushrangers father said lucy with a smile if they are bushrangers they will meet with a still warmer reception said the shepherd grimly and now daughter hurry up supper for i have a very fair appetite myself lucy moved about quietly but actively in obedience to her fathers directions an hour later or perhaps less the table was spread once more and all got up to it the boys though the edge of their appetite was taken away managed to eat the vegetables with a relish not having had a chance to eat any for a considerable time except at their hotel in melbourne after supper they sat down beside the fire and talked living so much alone the shepherd and his daughter were anxious to hear all that the boys could tell them of the great world from which they lived aloof later in the evening the shepherd whose name by the way was andrew campbell said now let us have a little music lucy bring me the bagpipe his daughter went into an adjoining room and brought out a highland bagpipe which campbell received and straightway began to play upon it some characteristic scotch tunes it was loud and harsh but the boys enjoyed it for want of better dont you sing miss lucy asked harry when her father laid down the instrument no answered the girl smiling i wish i did father is very fond of singing aye am i lucys mother sang but the gift has not descended to her harry is a professional singer said jack he sings in public please sing something then pleaded lucy if you really wish it answered harry i shall be glad to hear you young sir said the shepherd harry hesitated no longer but sang at once choosing such scotch melodies as he knew in preference the shepherds eyes glistened and he was evidently much moved it calls back my early days when as a lad i trod the heath in scotland he said you are a fine singer i dont mind when i have enjoyed an evening as much i am very glad sir if i have been able in this way to repay your kindness said harry dont speak of it lad said the shepherd lapsing into his scotch mode of speech we shant miss the bit sup we have given you at nine oclock all retired for the night for the shepherd must be up early in the morning to look after his flocks harry and jack slept in a small room back they were very tired and fell asleep as soon as their heads struck the pillow chapter xviii a dangerous acquaintance though the boys were very much fatigued they were up in time for an early breakfast the next morning it consisted of muttonchops potatoes bread and coffee and they were prepared notwithstanding their hearty supper of the night before to do full justice to it the shepherd had got over his first impression and nothing could be more friendly than his manner toward them he gave a still stronger proof of his confidence and friendship so you think of going to the mines my lads he said yes sir i dont know about the wisdom of your plans it isnt all that find the gold they look for are you expecting to come back with fortunes they would not be unwelcome sir said harry but we shall at any rate like the advantage of it and we are young enough to try experiments thats true but about the gold im thinkin youll be disappointed at any rate ill make you an offer the two of you stay here and help me tend sheep ill give you your living and clothes and when you are twentyone i will make you a present of a hundred sheep each to start in business for yourselves the proposal took harry and jack by surprise they could not but observe that lucys face brightened with hope as she awaited their answer it was clear that she hoped it would be favorable it must be acknowledged that this made a considerable impression upon them lucy was a pretty girl and they felt flattered by her desire that they should remain but their resolution was only shaken not changed they had but to look about them at the unbroken solitude to feel that life under such circumstances would be unendurable both of them had led lives of activity and excitement and neither felt prepared to settle down but they felt grateful jack and i thank you for your kindness mr campbell said harry and consider your offer a good one but it would be lonely for us here and though we may change our minds we would like to try the goldfields first its only natural lads said the shepherd you are young and you crave excitement when you are as old as i am you wont mind the quiet go then to bendigo but if you have bad luck come back here and you shall be welcome to stay as long as you like and to accept my offer if you feel like it then i am sorry you wont stay said lucy with a shade of sadness i wish we could be contented to do so said harry you may be sure we wont forget your kindness miss campbell do you mean me asked lucy smiling i never was called miss campbell before i will say lucy if you will allow me i would rather you did then goodby lucy we shall always remember you and you will come back some day if we can then goodby and dont forget your promise there was a suspicious moisture in the girls eyes for she knew that when the young visitors were gone she would feel lonelier than ever thats a nice girl jack said harry after a pause thats so harry i never saw a girl so nice before responded jack emphatically do you know jack said harry turning to him with a smile it is just as well we are going away what do you mean harry if we stayed here till we were both young men we might both fall in love with lucy and quarrel over her i might fall in love with her but i would never quarrel with you harry said jack affectionately no jack i dont think you would nothing shall ever divide us you are very kind to a poor sailor boy said jack you know a great deal more than i and i am not fit to be your friend take care jack i may quarrel with you if you say anything against yourself fit or unfit you are my chosen friend and i should not be willing to exchange you for anyone else i have ever met not even for montgomery clinton said jack archly not even for him with all his stock of trousers reference was made to a young man from brooklyn a fellow passenger on the ship nantucket who had acquired the reputation of a dude and had afforded much amusement to all on board he will be remembered by the readers of the preceding volume facing the world the boys did not set out on their journey emptyhanded lucy by direction of her father had packed a basket with provisions enough to last them two or three days the shepherd wished also to lend them some money but this harry declined we might not be able to pay it back he said i shant miss it lads if you dont urged the shepherd we might be robbed of it as we were of our other money sir we thank you all the same but they gladly accepted the basket of provisions without which indeed they might have fared badly in that uninhabited wilderness how far is it to bendigo harry had asked the shepherd twentyfive miles or thereabouts was the answer if it were a straight road and good travelling we might be there by night but it is neither you will be fortunate if you reach there in three or four days give us the direction and we will try it sir the two young travellers refreshed by their nights sleep and two substantial meals made good progress and by noon found themselves despite the difficulties of the way seven miles distant from the station where they had received such hospitable treatment by this time they were hungry and were glad to sit down at the base of a gigantic gumtree and attack the provisions they had brought with them they were in good spirits and chatted cheerfully many thousands of miles away from home without a penny in their pockets and with only a basket of provisions between them and starvation they did not allow themselves to be depressed by their uncertain prospects but looked forward hopefully jack said harry it seems so lonely here i could easily believe that we two are alone in the world it does seem so said jack i feel a little like robinson crusoe on his island am i to be friday asked jack with a smile jack had read very few books but who is there who has not read robinson crusoe i dont think you are of the right color jack but i would a good deal rather have you than friday they were not so far away from human companionship as they supposed as they soon learned to their dismay suddenly they heard a crunching as of steps upon the brush and turning they saw with alarm a tall muscular man with matted locks unprotected by a hat a long untrimmed beard and a suit hanging in tatters over his gaunt bony figure his eyes were fixed with a famished look upon the open basket of provisions the boys started to their feet in affright give me food said the stranger in a hoarse voice harry took some bread and meat from the basket and handed them to the stranger who devoured them in silence his appetite seemed enormous and the boys saw in dismay that if he kept on there would be very little left it was necessary in selfdefence to limit the mans rapacity more more he cried when he had eaten all that had been given him we have given you all we can spare said harry firmly give me the basket or i will kill you both exclaimed the tramp his eyes suffused with blood and gleaming with fierce anger as he spoke he raised a knotted stick which had served him as a cane and swung it menacingly above his head chapter xix a ruffian foiled harry and jack were brave boys and not easily daunted but the attitude of the stranger was so menacing and his frame so indicative of strength that they were both alarmed had their need of the provisions been less urgent they would have surrendered them without a struggle but they felt that it was a question possibly of continued life or starvation and this inspired them to resistance holding the basket in his hand harry retreated behind a tree and began to parley you are asking too much he said we have given you a meal we need the rest for ourselves no palavering boy said the tramp roughly i need it more than you do give it to me or i will kill you if i only had some weapon thought harry while he was hesitating the tramp with a quick movement sprang to where he stood clutched him by the collar and flinging him on his back put his knee on his breast saying between his closed teeth now i will kill you young jackanapes ill teach you to interfere with me poor harry thought his last moment had come he was powerless against his enemy whose wild rage shown in his distorted features seemed capable of anything his sole helper was jack who flung himself on the giant and sought with his boyish strength to pull him away but in vain ill choke the life out of you you young beast exclaimed the tramp preparing to clutch harry by the throat the moment was a critical one for the poor boy whose career came near ending then and there but assistance came when least expected a man who had approached unseen by either of the three jumped from the underbrush and with one powerful blow sent the tramp sprawling on the ground beside his intended victim illustration obed rescues the boys from the tramp youre rather out of your reckoning you mean skunk he exclaimed if theres any killin to be done round here im goin to do it obed stackpole ejaculated the boys in heartfelt delight and they were rushing forward to greet him but he waved them back yes he said its obed himself ill talk to you in a minute after ive got through with this consarned villain by this time the tramp though startled and dazed was on his feet and preparing to make a desperate assault on the yankee but though quite as strong and possibly stronger than obed stackpole he had now to encounter a foe by no means to be despised moreover he had laid down his knotted stick and obed had secured it it was a formidable weapon and mr stackpole was quite ready to make use of it give me my stick shouted the tramp hoarsely i mean to responded the yankee coolly where will you have it he stepped back warily as the other advanced holding the stick in a strong grasp while he kept his eyes steadily fixed on his opponent he was cool but his enemy was enraged and rage made him incautious he made a desperate clutch at the stick but with a powerful sweep obed struck him on the side of the head and he fell like an ox stunned and insensible that settles you my friend i guess said obed you brought it upon yourself and youve got no one else to blame watch him harry to see that he doesnt come to himself while i tie his hands obed whipped a strong cord from his pockets and secured the wrists of the prostrate enemy tying them securely together will you tie his feet too asked jack no it is not necessary he cant do any harm now i came in the nick of time boys didnt i indeed you did said harry earnestly he was beginning to choke me what was it all about we had given him a meal but he wanted to make off with the basket besides as this would have left us utterly without food i objected the mean skunk im glad i came up in time to settle him wont you have something to eat yourself mr stackpole asked harry bethinking himself that his deliverer might need refreshment i dont mind if i do answered obed the fact is im feeling kinder hollow i feel a gnawin at my vitals that isnt pleasant this is prime fodder where did you raise it while obed was eating with hearty relish it may be added harry related briefly what had befallen jack and himself since they had parted company youre in luck boys was obeds comment you fared better than i for youve had your square meals while ive had only one besides this where was that asked harry at the same place where you passed the night i got there about an hour after you left as well as i can make out the gal was very kind and gave me a tiptop breakfast i ate till i was ashamed and then left off hungry thats why ive got such an appetite now yesterday i didnt have but one meal and ive had to make up for that did lucy tell you we had passed the night at her fathers house lucy seems to me you got mighty familiar said obed in a jocular tone she didnt tell me what her name was i suppose she looked upon me as a driedup old bach shes a nice girl said harry emphatically so she is im with you there but about your question i asked her if she had seen anything of two chaps about your size and she told me enough to show me i was on your track she told me which way you went and i follered she was a little shy at first not knowin but i might be an enemy of yours but when shed made up her mind to the contrary she up and told me everything well i struck your trail and here i am i for one am delighted to see you obed said harry cordially and i for two added jack smiling mr stackpole seemed gratified by the pleasure evinced by the boys well he said were together once more and now we must hold a council of war and decide whats to be done with him asked jack pointing to the tramp with him first of all i take it you dont want me to invite him to join our party his room is better than his company said harry i agree with you according to my idea we may as well leave him where he lies but wont he starve he can get his hands free after awhile said obed but not till after we are at a safe distance you neednt be afraid about him anyhow the world wouldnt lose much if he did take passage for another thats so obed but i wouldnt like to feel that we were responsible for his death at this moment the prostrate man opened his eyes and as his glance lighted on obed they gleamed with the old look of rage he tried to get up and of course discovered that his hands were tied loosen my hands you scoundrel he exclaimed if you mean me by that pet name my esteemed friend said obed i respectfully decline id rather look at you with your hands tied do you want me to kill you demanded the tramp furiously not at present when i do ill let you know come boys we may as well be going this gentleman would rather be left alone unloose me first and i wont harm you said the other trying to struggle to his feet i dont mean you shall goodby my friend i cant say i wish to meet you again i will take the liberty to carry off your stick as you wont need it with your hands tied obed and the boys started off followed by the most fearful execrations from their late acquaintance they had scarcely gone a quarter of a mile when they met two mounted police who halted their horses and inquired have you seen anything of a man tall and spare dark hair and eyes we have traced him to this neighborhood and think he must be near what has he done asked obed curiously murdered a man at the mines in a drunken brawl weve just parted company with him said obed i found him experimentin on my young friend here but come up in time to block his game put us on his track and we will share the reward of a hundred pounds with you ill do it boys stay here and ill go back with these gentlemen ill join you in an hour obed was as good as his word within an hour he was back again with the two policemen followed by the man whom we have called the tramp his hands were more securely fastened now by a pair of handcuffs chapter xx the boys arrive at bendigo you are entitled to half the reward offered for the apprehension of this man said the leader of the police to obed stackpole i congratulate you fifty pounds is a sum not to be despised especially when a man has been robbed of all he possesses by bushrangers said obed if youll excuse me captain why does your government allow them rascals to roam round the country plundering and killing honest men the captain of police shrugged his shoulders we cant help it my good man we do all we can he answered in my country we would soon put a stop to it you mean america yes the land of the stars and the stripes said obed proudly it is more difficult here observed the police captain the nature of the country makes pursuit difficult besides we have had so many convicts sent out here in past years that there is a large proportion of lawless men in the colony some of these men have made themselves very formidable there is captain stockton for instance was you mean captain i dont understand you captain stockton is dead do you mean this how do you know inquired the captain of police eagerly he was killed yesterday by one of his men what evidence have you of this demanded the captain incredulously them two boys saw him shot said obed indicating harry and jack tell me all about it young man said the captain to harry it will be good news at bendigo returning miners are always in fear of this famous bushranger stockton he doesnt care so much to attack parties bound to the mines for they are not supposed to have much with them but those returning to melbourne generally carry more or less gold and are worth capturing harry gave a succinct account of his adventures while in the power of the bushrangers and the scene of which he had been a witness the captain of police listened attentively this is good news he remarked there will be a new captain appointed of course but there is not another man connected with the gang who can take stocktons place or do as much mischief as he has done how far are we from bendigo captain asked obed two days journey or perhaps more a long distance considering we have no money you will have half the reward your share will be fifty pounds that wont do us any good now unless youll be kind enough to advance us a part of that sum i would if i were able but i am not provided with any money beyond what i need you and the boys may come with us however if you wish i should like nothing better captain once at bendigo and well manage to shift for ourselves very well so let it be i pass over the events of the next two days obed and the boys after all their troubles found themselves provided with an official escort and on the morning of the third day arrived at the famous goldfields of bendigo ballarat and mount alexander preceded bendigo in point of time but bendigo has been far more productive as the little party descended a hill made white by the sandy dirt thrown out of the mines they saw below them bendigo creek yellow as the tiber running sluggishly through the valley which on either side had been dug up by prospectors for gold all about on the slopes of the hills and in the valley were rude huts hastily put together the homes of the miners some of them were built of solid trunks of trees laid horizontally after the american backwoods order of architecture the interstices were generally daubed with clay to make them watertight and the roofs were covered with sheets of bark kept down by logs laid upon them there were tents also made of slabs and covered with canvas still others were covered with bullock hides to harry and jack the sight was a novel one and they regarded the extemporized village with interest obeds eyes glistened and he rubbed his hands with delight this seems like home he said its just like shantytown in californy where i worked three months last year i say boys how do you like it i shouldnt like to live here very long said harry i like shipboard better said jack i agree with you boys said obed but itll suit me well enough if i can find enough gold here when ive made my pile australy wont hold me long i shall make tracks for america we have no bushrangers there but you have indians retorted the police captain who did not quite relish the strictures upon the colony of which he was an official i would rather be captured by a bushranger than scalped by an indian i agree with you captain but the indians wont scalp you unless you go where they are i never saw one till i was past twentyone indeed said the captain in evident surprise i thought they were all over the country why one of your countrymen told me they would sometimes surprise families within ten miles of your great city of new york and scalp them all he said he was brought up raised he called it twenty miles away and was obliged to barricade the doors and windows every night and keep a supply of loaded muskets by the side of his bed to resist the indians in case they made a night attack obed laughed till the tears came to his eyes and the two boys also looked amused did you believe all this captain he asked why not asked the captain looking offended my informant was a countryman of yours he was stuffing you captain stuffing me i dont understand said the captain puzzled he saw that you knew very little of america and he practised a little on your credulity isnt that the word how do i know but you are doing the same now probably you want to give me a favorable idea of your country i only want you to judge it correctly captain why there aint no more danger of being scalped in new york than in london i presume not in new york but i am speaking of the neighborhood of new york so am i ill tell you what captain if you can find me a case of a man thats been scalped within five hundred miles of new york within the last fifty years ill give you my share of the reward of course if its in canada it dont count i cant accept any such wager i have no means of proving it even if it is so thats true squire but ill give you an idea harry how many indians have you ever seen in your life about half a dozen answered harry after a pause for reflection and you jack i never saw one that i can remember and yet you were both born in the states you see captain indians are not so abundant in our country as you supposed jack has never seen an indian but he has seen a bushranger eh jack i have seen more than i wanted to answered jack smiling by this time they had descended the hill and were on the borders of the mining settlement they had now attracted the attention of the miners and when the prisoner was recognized there went up an angry shout and a band of swarthy bearded men advanced menacingly to meet them give him to us they cried give up the murderer we will make short work of him chapter xxi buying a claim the face of the prisoner as he met the angry glances of the miners betrayed extreme fear in spite of his terrible crime harry could not help pitying him when he saw the gray pallor that overspread his countenance the captain of the police was a brave and determined man and though his little force was outnumbered five to one he showed no signs of yielding what is it you want men he demanded sternly we want that man the murderer was the unanimous cry what would you do with him string him up to the nearest tree replied a brawny miner there is no occasion for you to punish him he is in the hands of the law replied the captain he may escape we want to make sure of him i will answer for it that he does not escape you know me and you can accept my assurance is that satisfactory there was a sullen murmur among the miners it was evident that they were not wholly satisfied the captain of police watched them keenly and saw that there was danger of an attack he drew a pistol and holding it firmly in his hand said the first man that interferes with me in the discharge of my duty dies i give you fair warning a determined man generally carries his point even against odds had the captain showed the slightest sign of wavering the mob would have been upon him but they saw that he was in earnest and meant what he said how long is he to live asked the brawny miner already referred to after a slight pause i shall take him before the magistrate at once and you know he is not likely to defer punishment the police magistrate who dispensed justice and frequently injustice at bendigo was noted for his severity and this assurance seemed to satisfy the miners they followed the cavalcade however to make sure that the captain kept his word it may be stated here that at this early period in the history of the colony the judicial forms which prevail in other countries were for the most part dispensed with and punishment was swift and certain especially where life or property had been attacked harry and jack followed the crowd to a wooden structure more pretentious than most of the buildings roundabout the magistrate whom i will call judge wood was at hand he was a short stout man of severe aspect and had a harsh voice whom have we here he asked quickly the captain of police answered the question relating also where and under what circumstances the capture was made what have you to say for yourself my man he asked turning to the prisoner i am innocent was the reply in trembling accents of course you all are i never had a man brought before me who was not innocent said the magistrate with a sneer have you any accomplices your honor i am innocent as i have already told you answer my question said the magistrate sternly no your honor ha you alone are guilty then captain are there any witnesses though it is hardly necessary the mans face shows his guilt it will easily be seen how much hope the prisoner had of getting off with such a judge presiding at the trial luckily for the cause of justice the man was undoubtedly guilty and so the judicial proceedings hurried and onesided as they were did not entail any injustice in half an hour the trial was completed a conviction was obtained and the unhappy wretch was sentenced to execution on the following morning meanwhile he was to be confined in a structure set apart as a prison well are you satisfied asked the captain as he passed the ringleader of the miners i dont see the use of waiting till morning grumbled the miner the job might as well have been finished up at once you can rest satisfied the man hasnt long to live this proved to be the case during the night harry and jack who were accommodated with beds in a hut near the prison heard a noise and a sound of mens voices but they were too fatigued and wornout to be thoroughly roused in the morning when they left the hut they needed no explanation from a lofty branch of a gumtree a hundred yards to the west dangled the body of the unfortunate criminal a terrible spectacle contrasting painfully with the bright and cheerful morning they learned afterward that the prison had been guarded by a volunteer company of miners who detected or feigned to detect the prisoner in an attempt to escape probably the latter and forcing an entrance laid violent hands upon him and saved the law officers the trouble of executing him the captain of police didnt learn what had happened till morning as it chanced obed stackpole was with him when he received the information he took it very coolly what are you goin to do about it captain asked obed nothing do you allow such doins here it doesnt matter much the man was to have been executed this morning at any rate he only lost a few hours it has saved us some trouble suppose he was an innocent man but he wasnt you know and now mr stackpole if you will come with me i will see about your getting your share of the reward thank you captain i wont deny that itll be particularly convenient seein im reduced to my last cent the police captain exerted himself in a very friendly manner and owing to the absence of red tape which in an older settlement might have occasioned delay that same day our yankee friend was made happy by receiving the sum of fifty pounds he called the boys to him and dividing the money as well as he could into three equal parts he offered one each to harry and jack now we start alike he said theres nearly seventeen pounds apiece it seems a good deal but it wont last long here we must find something to do before long thats just what i want said harry i came out here to work and make money not to loaf about thats the way with me said jack but his tone was not so hopeful or cheerful as harrys confess now jack said harry you would rather be on board ship than here at the diggings i would said jack wouldnt you not yet there is no money to be made on board ship when youve made your pile my lad said obed you can go back to melbourne and easily get a berth on board some merchant ship bound to liverpool or new york there is a great demand for sailors at that port this made jack more cheerful he was willing to stay a while he said and help harry and mr stackpole but in the end he must return to his old life mr stackpole and the boys took a long walk and reconnoitred the diggings on both sides of bendigo creek toward the middle of the afternoon they came upon a thin melancholy looking young man who was sitting in a despondent attitude with his arms folded are you sick my friend asked obed i am very ill was the answer i dont think i shall ever be any better further questioning elicited the information that he had taken a severe cold from exposure two months before in consequence of which his lungs were seriously affected why do you stay here then asked obed i shall go back to melbourne as soon as i have sold my claim what do you want for it it is worth fifty pounds i will take twentyfive obed after careful inquiry judged that it was a bargain he proposed to the two boys to join him in the purchase of the claim they felt that they could safely follow his judgment and struck a bargain so before twentyfour hours had passed the three friends were joint proprietors of a claim and had about eight pounds apiece to meet expenses till it began to yield a return chapter xxii striking luck now boys said obed we have some hard work before us mining isnt like standing behind a counter or measuring off calico it takes considerable more muscle i am used to hard work said jack but youll have to show me how ill keep up with jack said harry manfully you wont have to charge either of us with laziness i believe you boys there isnt a lazy bone in either of you as i have experience ill boss the job and all youll have to do will be to obey orders all right captain said jack touching his cap with a smile this then was the understanding between the three and it was faithfully adhered to the two boys sensible of their ignorance were very ready to obey obed and he found them willing workers they installed themselves in a cabin which had been occupied by the man they bought out he gave them the use of it having no further occasion for it himself and they began to keep house as one family they lived roughly enough and yet so high were all articles of food on account of the trouble and expense of transportation from melbourne that it cost them as much as would have paid for living at a respectable hotel in the states all three entered upon their labors with high hopes the first day and the second day yielded no results but as obed reminded them a miner needs to be patient but when one week two weeks passed and the amount of gold found amounted to less than ten dollars all three began to look sober this is beginning to look serious boys said obed thoughtfully as they set about their work on the first day of the third week our claim aint pannin out very rich my store of money is panning out very fast said harry with a faint smile ive got less than two pounds left said jack what are we going to do when its all gone i dont know said obed unless we catch another murderer the boys smiled but not hilariously they felt as obed expressed it that matters were indeed becoming serious to run short of money nearly ten thousand miles from home was no light thing we might sell the claim suggested harry obed shook his head i dont think we could he replied everybody would understand our reason for selling that we despaired of finding any gold and instead of getting twentyfive pounds i doubt if you could get twentyfive shillings for it you know about how long twentyfive shillings would last us i suppose there is nothing to do but to keep on said harry obed nodded youve said it he returned let us keep up good heart my boys dont borrow trouble when things come to the worst well decide what to do then by way of setting the example of cheerfulness obed began to whistle yankee doodle and the boys joined in it was not altogether a successful effort but it made them feel a little more cheerful at all events it attracted a listener a tall shabbylooking tramp who had been wandering about for a day or two visiting one claim after another trying to raise a loan i say youre uncommon jolly you chaps he began as he stood in a lounging attitude watching the little party at their work if we are its a credit to us returned obed dryly for there isnt much to be jolly about isnt your claim a good one thats what were trying to find out wheres yours stranger the tramp returned an evasive answer and shambled off do you think hes got a claim obed asked jack no but hes prowling around to see what he can pick up do you think hes a thief i think hes willing to be he heard us whistling and thought wed found something we are safe from robbery for the present said harry yes theres that advantage about being poor it reminds me of old jack pierce in our village what about him asked harry he read in the paper one day that a certain bank had burst so he went home in a hurry to see if he had any bills on that bank he found that he had no bills on that bank or any other and then he felt better harry laughed it was a poor consolation i think he said i remember hearing a sermon from our minister at home in which he said that riches were a great responsibility but i dont think i should mind taking the responsibility thats my idee harry i am afraid there isnt much chance of our having that responsibility but theres one thing we can do if we dont make the claim pay whats that obed we can join the bushrangers will you set us the example asked harry smiling im not quite desperate enough yet well try the claim a little longer but im gettin tuckered out well go and get some dinner and then start diggin again they repaired to their cabin and solaced themselves with food then they threw themselves down in the shadow of the cabin to rest and obed pulled out his pipe this was a solace which the boys didnt enjoy they were sensible enough to know that whatever may be said of men boys only receive injury from the use of tobacco in the resolution to abstain they were upheld and encouraged by obed who veteran smoker as he was did not approve of smoking youre better off without it boys he said it wont do you no good i wish i could leave it off why dont you asked harry easier said than done my boy let me see i was only turned of thirteen when i used to slink off to the barn and smoke for i knew father wouldnt let me if he knew it it made me sick at first but i thought it was makin a man of me and i kept on well the habits on me now and its hard to break it dont hurt a man as much as a boy but it dont do him any good either jack did you ever smoke no obed but one of the sailors gave me a piece of tobacco to chew once i didnt like it and spit it out the best thing you could do i wish all boys were as sensible in their hours of rest the three often chatted of home their conversation was generally of one tenor they liked to fancy themselves returning with plenty of money and planned how they would act under such pleasant circumstances instead of the barren hills among which they were encamped familiar scenes and faces rose before them and the picture was so attractive that it was hard to come back to the cheerless reality well boys said obed at the end of an hour we may as well go to work again the golds waitin for us it was an old joke and scarcely elicited a smile now in fact the boys felt that they had waited a long time for the gold it was not therefore with a very hopeful feeling that they obeyed the summons and returned to the claim though of a sanguine disposition they began to doubt seriously whether their efforts would ever be rewarded they had pretty much lost the stimulus of hope about four oclock when jack was at work with the pick something curious happened instead of sinking into the earth it glanced off as from something hard what is it jack asked obed quickly i must have struck a rock obed here give me the pick said obed eagerly he struck and lo a yellow streak became plainly visible boys said he in an agitated voice i believe our luck has come what do you mean obed i believe weve found a nugget and to the boys intense surprise he immediately began to cover it up with dirt whats that for asked harry hush we mustnt take it out now somebody might be looking well wait till its darker just then the tramp before mentioned strolled up what luck friends he asked same as usual answered obed shrugging his shoulders dont you want to buy the claim not i and the tramp quite deceived by his manner kept on his round chapter xxiii raising the nugget its lucky we covered up the gold said obed in a low voice thats the last man i wanted to discover our good luck shant we keep on working asked harry in excitement i will just probe a little to form some idea of the size of the nugget answered obed then you think it is a nugget asked jack eagerly yes i think our luck has come at last boys i think we will be able to pull up stakes and go back to america but about keeping on now we shall need to be cautious someone might come by and see what we are about then harry made a suggestion let jack go up to the top and if anyone comes he can whistle that will put us on our guard a good idea said obed so jack threw himself on the ground in a listless posture and the other two continued their explorations they dug all about the boulder which proved to be about a foot in diameter it was embedded in clay from which it was separated with some difficulty it was encased in quartz but the interior was bright glittering gold its a regular beauty said obed in a low tone his eyes glittering with excitement it isnt once in a dogs age that so big a nugget is discovered how much do you call it worth obed asked harry in the same low tone thats hard tellin harry but its worth ten thousand dollars easy thank god ejaculated harry fervently that will release us from our imprisonment and enable us to go back to america you are right harry but the hardest job lies before us whats that to get it out without observation and keep it secure from thieves well do our best only you give the orders obed then first and foremost well cover it up again and go up till evening when we will secure it and carry it to our cabin so said so done they joined jack at the limit of the excavation is it all right asked the young sailor eagerly yes answered harry is it really a big one yes we can all go back to america jack and i can once more be a sailor yes if you like it jack was told of their plan of removing the nugget by night and saw at once that it was a wise one shall we go to the cabin now he asked no jack it wont do to leave our treasure unguarded we will lounge here and make sure that no one robs us of our discovery illustration finding the nugget so they sat down and obed lighted his pipe once more a neighbor strolled up and sat down beside them you are leaving off work early he said yes answered obed with a yawn we might as well take it easy its hard work this mining what luck our luck is to come said our yankee friend how is it with you i have got out seventyfive dollars this week answered the other complacently whew thats good what do you say to swapping claims oh no answered the neighbor wagging his head jocosely im not so green the fact is mr stackpole i dont want to discourage you but i dont believe youll ever see the money you put into this hole come now what did you pay five and twenty pounds if you can get five pounds for it my advice is sell i dont know but youre right said stackpole in a rueful tone will you give me five pounds for it ho ho i might give you five shillings though it would be a risk then i dont think well sell eh harry we had better give it away than take that sum said harry carefully veiling his inward exultation they went to their cabin at the usual time and indulged themselves in a better supper than usual feeling that they could afford to do so it is wonderful how success stimulates the appetite i dont know when i have been so hungry obed said harry i feel the same way chimed in jack a light heart increases the appetite boys but sometimes ive felt wolfish when my heart was heavy fifteen months ago i was in californy and down on my luck things had been goin contrary and i hadnt money enough to buy a square meal i didnt like to tell my friends bein a bit proud one day when i was feelin so hungry that i wouldnt have turned up my nose at a chinamans diet rat pie an old acquaintance met me and asked me to dine with him did i accept well i should smile i did smile all over my face as i sat down to the table youd better calculate that i made my knife and fork fly finally my friend remarked looking kind of queer youve got a healthy appetite stackpole i answered it sort of runs in our family to eat whenever we get a chance good joke said he laughing but it was no joke when he came to pay the bill i tell you ill remember that obed said harry smiling and when i invite you to dinner ill first inquire whether youve had anything to eat for a week back i generally eat for a weak stomach returned obed venturing on a little joke at which the boys felt bound to laugh as they sat at the door of their cabin they kept a good lookout in the direction of their claim they could not afford now that success was in their grasp to have it snatched away but they discovered no suspicious movements on the part of anyone in fact no one suspected that they had struck it rich so poor was the general opinion of their claim that they would have found it hard to obtain a purchaser at any price had there been the least suspicion the camp would have been greatly excited as a rule the miners retired early they became fatigued during the day and sleep was welcome there was indeed a gambling saloon at some distance frequented by the more reckless but generally good hours were observed in the camp about half past eleven obed nudged harry and jack who had fallen asleep what is it asked harry in a drowsy tone hush whispered obed dont make any more noise than you can help i think it will be safe to go and secure the nugget now this was enough harry was wide awake in an instant and he in turn roused jack there was no elaborate toilet to make for they had thrown themselves down in their day attire they left the cabin and by the faint light of the moon which was just ready to retire for the night they found their way to the claim without being observed fifteen minutes work and the task was accomplished the nugget was raised and wrapped in a red bandanna handkerchief which obed had brought all the way from his new england home it must weigh seventyfive pounds whispered obed exultantly boys were in tall luck it was worth coming out to australy for well keep it in the cabin over night and tomorrow well put it where it will be safe they gained the cabin without having been seen so far as they knew of the hundreds of men sleeping within a furlongs distance not one dreamed of a discovery which was to draw the attention of the whole colony to bendigo but they had not wholly escaped observation one pair of eyes had detected them in their midnight walk chapter xxiv the nugget in danger the tramp who has already been introduced to the reader had spent the evening at the gambling house having come into possession during the day of a small sum of money given him by a compassionate miner he had risked it and for a time been successful so that at the end of an hour he might have left off with twenty pounds but the fatal fascination of the game drew him on till all his winnings melted away and he left the cabin at midnight without a penny in his pocket so far as he knew there was however a shilling which he had overlooked and did not discover till he was already some distance away he was tempted to return and probably would have done so had not his roving eyes discovered obed and the two boys returning from their claim with the nugget what are they up to he asked himself in amazement that keeps them out of bed till after midnight theres something up i wonder what it is he had reason to be surprised with the exception of those who like himself spent the night in gambling when he was in funds no one in the camp was awake or stirring and of all none kept more regular hours than obed and the two boys casting about for some explanation the tramps attention was drawn to the burden that obed carried what can it be he asked himself wonderingly then with a flash of conviction he said to himself a nugget theyve found a nugget as sure as im a sinner the tramp was intensely excited his covetous soul was stirred to its depths the opportunity he had been waiting for so long had come at length it meant fortune for him qualms of conscience about appropriating the property of another troubled him not at all he meant to have the nugget by fair means or foul the wouldbe thief understood well however that there would be difficulties in the way of accomplishing his design obed and the two boys were broad awake and half an hour perhaps an hour must elapse before he could feel sure that they would be asleep in the meantime it would be best to keep away from the cabin lest someone inside might see him lurking near and suspect his purpose while he is keeping watch from a distance let us enter the cabin obed and the boys are sitting on their rude pallets congratulating themselves on having secured the nugget and removed it from the mine unobserved harry had made a remark to that effect when obed stackpole responded do you know boys i feel sort of uneasy tonight why asked jack im afraid someone might have seen us on our way from the mine i couldnt see anybody harry remarked nor i but there may have been someone nevertheless the fact is i never expected to be uneasy on account of my wealth but thats the way the case stands just at present when we were poor i slept like a top i suppose you wouldnt care to get rid of your care by throwing the nugget away harry said with a smile im not so uneasy as that yet but i should feel a little safer if we and the nugget could be transported to melbourne in five minutes suppose someone did see us queried jack then we may expect a visit some time tonight one of us might remain awake obed that would be rather hard on us for we are all tired i dont believe i could stay awake all night if i tried is there any way of concealing the nugget i dont know if we had a cellar that would be a good place but stop i have an idea cried harry eagerly well harry out with it we can put the nugget in the trunk there was an old trunk covered with hair which had been left by the last occupant of the cabin the lock was broken and it was not of much use or value but the boys occasionally used it as a seat what security would that be said obed it is easy enough to open the trunk i know it but i have another idea wrap up that stone in the handkerchief in place of the nugget the thief if one should come would see it and make off with it without stopping to examine its contents obed smiled grimly thats a good idea he said i believe youre right boy its dark and the thief couldnt tell the difference till he came to examine it stones and fragments of rock are rare in that part of australia and i am not prepared to explain how this particular rock found its way into the mining village the boys had found it however and thinking it might be of some use had carried it to the cabin never however in their wildest imaginings had it entered into their minds to conceive the use to which they were now putting it no sooner said than done the nugget was taken from the enfolding bandanna and dropped into the trunk which obed placed at the head of his pallet i wish there was a lock and key he said i should somehow feel safer its no use wishing said harry weve got to take things as we find them thats true philosophy boy now get the rock and tie it up harry did so where shall i put it he asked anywhere where it can be seen easily we wont trouble the thief to look round much well make everything easy for him when the transfer was effected the boys laughed with glee do you know obed said harry i shall be rather disappointed now if the thief doesnt come i can get along without him said obed dryly but itll be such a good joke obed i dont care so much about jokes as i did when i was your age harry i used to be a great feller for jokes when i was along in my teens did i ever tell you the joke i played on the schoolmaster well i was attendin the district school the winter i was sixteen and i expect i was rather troublesome though there wasnt anything downright bad about me but i remember one day when i stuck a bent pin in the chair the master usually sot in and i shant forget till my dyin day how quick he riz up when he sot down on it obed chuckled at the recollection and so did the boys their sympathies ought to have been with the schoolmaster but i am sorry to say that did not prevent their enjoying the joke were you found out asked jack not exactly but i think the master always suspected me at any rate he was always cuffin me and pullin my hair i didnt mind the fust so much as the last so one day i got my mother to cut my hair close to my head when i went to school the master gave me a queer look he knew what made me have my hair cut the next time i got into mischief he called me up and instead of pullin my hair he pulled my ears till i hollered now go home and get your ears cut off he said but i didnt it seems to me the joke was on you that time obed ive surmised as much myself said obed laughing quietly but im tired boys and i believe i shall have to go off to sleep nugget or no nugget all right goodnight obed goodnight boys chapter xxv the midnight robbery the thief had little difficulty in entering the cabin no one in the mining settlement thought of locking the outer door or closing the windows in many cases the doors were left ajar in some cases there were none it was not necessary therefore to become a housebreaker entrance then was the least difficulty the tramp however was not quite easy in his mind he didnt care for the two boys but he glanced with apprehension at the reclining figure of the tall gaunt yankee who was thin but wiry and possessed of more than ordinary physical strength if he should tackle me thought the midnight visitor with a shudder it would be all up with me he could shake the life out of me but the stake was a valuable one it would in all probability make him comfortable for life if judiciously husbanded and obeds slumber seemed so profound that there appeared to be no risk nevertheless the tramp trembled and his heart was in his mouth as he stealthily got in through the open window and moved toward the nugget or what he supposed to be such he had one eye on obed as he reached for the bundle it was with difficulty that he could lift it so heavy was it but this only encouraged him and made his eyes sparkle covetously the heavier it was the more valuable it must be were it twice as heavy he would be willing to carry it ten miles enduring cheerfully all the fatigue it might entail no thought of the rightful owners or of their disappointment disturbed him that greed of gain which hardens the heart and banishes all scruples held firm dominion over him he lifted the bundle and as noiselessly as he entered he made his egress through the window he thought he was unobserved but he was mistaken harry vane was usually a heavy sleeper he had slept through many a thunderstorm at home and under ordinary circumstances he would have slept through this entire night but the thought of the nugget even in his sleeping hours weighed upon him and entered into his dreams singularly he was dreaming at this very moment that it was being stolen and in the intensity of his excitement all at once he became broad awake just as the thief was disappearing through the window with a startled look he glanced toward the place where the false nugget had been placed it was gone evidently the thief had been taken in and the thought amused him so much that he almost unconsciously laughed aloud the sound fell on the ears of the receding thief and filled his heart with apprehension though he fancied it was a sound emitted in sleep still it might precede awakening once out of the window he did not stand upon the order of his going but fled with a speed remarkable considering the weight of the bundle he carried harry rose from his bed and though he felt sure the thief had been deceived he still in order to make sure opened the trunk and felt for the lump of gold with a thrill of joy he found it still there then he could give way to his sense of amusement and laughed long and loud he did not however arouse jack and obed who like himself were sound sleepers he didnt like however to have all the amusement to himself so he shook the yankee till he awoke whats the matter asked obed in a drowsy tone weve been robbed answered harry what exclaimed mr stackpole in dismay bounding from his pallet now thoroughly awake what is that you say the nugget is gone said harry confusion ejaculated obed when who took it dont be alarmed obed said harry quietly its only the bogus nugget the real one is safe where we hid it tell me all about it harry what skunk has been in here you know the man that was spying about our claim the tramp did you see him not till he was just getting out of the window harry recounted briefly his sudden awakening and the sight that greeted him as he opened his eyes i wish id been awake id have boosted him out of that window said obed grimly i have no doubt you would obed said harry laughing but i think we neednt feel much of a grudge against the poor fellow when he comes to examine his booty by daylight its my impression hell feel sick enough obed laughed too id like to be looking on when he makes the discovery he said hell look green enough i guess how could the fellow have found out that we had found it said harry with a puzzled expression he must have been out late and seen us coming from the mine it is lucky we thought of hiding it and leaving the rock in its place obed thats so the rock came in handy for once do you think there is any danger of another visit tonight no he probably wont discover how he has been tricked till morning and even if he does he may suppose that this rock is what we brought with us possibly still harry i think wed better keep awake and watch tonight it will only be for one night as tomorrow we can make arrangements to send the nugget by express to melbourne i thought we should be carrying it there ourselves no it would not be safe tomorrow everybody will know that we have found a nugget and if we attempted to carry it ourselves we should not get ten miles away without being attacked and perhaps killed then we can send it by express queried harry yes i have inquired into this not that i thought we would be lucky enough to need the information the government escorts charge one per cent and besides the crown exacts a royalty of ten per cent thats pretty steep isnt it obed i will cheerfully bear my part of it said obed i remember there was an old fellow in our place who owned considerable property at any rate he was taxed for fifteen thousand dollars whenever taxes became due he was always groanin and predictin that hed end his days in the poorhouse my father who was only taxed for fifteen hundred said to him one day mr higgins if youll give me half of your property ill agree to pay taxes on the whole so that youll have nothing to pay did he accept asked harry with a smile not much but he stopped growlin it may have given him a new idea of the matter how soon do you think of getting away obed as soon as we have sold the claim answered the yankee when it gets reported round the camp what weve found therell be plenty thatll want to buy it on speculation you may be sure of that i didnt think of that said harry his eyes brightening were luckier than i thought yes answered obed jocularly were men of property now im afraid well have to pay taxes ourselves when we get home chapter xxvi a thiefs embarrassment when the thief left obed stackpoles cabin with his booty his heart was filled with exultation he had been drifting about for years the football of fortune oftener down than up and had more than once known what it was to pass an entire day without food and all this because he had never been willing to settle down to steady work or honest industry he had set out in life with a dislike for each and a decided preference for living by his wits theft was no new thing for him once he had barely escaped with his life in one of the western states of america for stealing a horse he had drifted to australia with no idea of working at the mines or anywhere else but with the intention of robbing some lucky miner and making off with the proceeds of his industry well he had succeeded and his heart was light no more hard work for me he said to himself joyfully no more privation and suffering now i can live like a gentleman it never seemed to occur to him that a thief could by no possibility live like a gentleman to be a gentleman in his opinion meant having a pocketful of money he would like to have examined the nugget but there was no time nor was there light enough to form an opinion of it besides obed and the two boys might at any moment discover their loss and then there would be pursuers on his track he could not hide it for it was too large and anyone seeing what he carried would suspect its nature and character the responsibility of property was upon him now it was an unaccustomed sensation this thief began now to dread an encounter with other thieves there were other men as well as himself who had little respect for the rights of property and this he well knew where shall i go he asked himself in perplexity it would not do to stay in the neighborhood of the mining camp by dawn or as soon as tidings of the robbery should spread there would be an organized pursuit in any mining settlement a thief fares hard in the absence of any established code of laws the relentless laws of judge lynch are executed with merciless severity beads of perspiration began to form on the brow of the thief as he realized the terrible danger he had incurred what good would it do him after all to get away with the nugget if it should cost him his life and that was a contingency as his experience assured him by no means improbable if i were only in melbourne he said to himself i would lose no time in disposing of the nugget and then would take the first ship for england or anywhere else any place would be better than australia for that will soon be too hot to hold me it was one thing to wish and another to realize the wish he was still in the immediate vicinity of the mining camp and there were almost insuperable difficulties in the way of getting far from it with his treasure safe the thief kept on his way however and after a while reached a piece of woods this will be a good place to hide he bethought himself i may be able to conceal the nugget somewhere his first feeling of exultation had given place to one of deep anxiety and perplexity after he was not as happy as he anticipated only yesterday he had been poor almost destitute but at any rate free from anxiety and alarm now he was rich or thought he was and his heart was filled with nervous apprehension he wandered about for two or three hours weary and feeling great need of sleep but afraid to yield to the impulse suppose he should lose consciousness and sleep till morning the first man who found him asleep would rob him of the precious nugget and then he would be back again where he had been the day before and for years back the dream of his life had been fulfilled and he was in no position to enjoy it oftentimes god grants our wishes only to show us how little they add to our happiness it was no light burden this heavy nugget which he was forced to carry with him and drowsy as he was more than once he stumbled with it and came near falling but at last he saw before him a cabin deserted apparently and his heart was filled with joy it would afford him a place to obtain needed repose and there would be some means of hiding his rich treasure he peered timidly into the cabin and found it empty on the floor in the corner was a pallet he put the nugget under the upper part thus raising it and supplying the place of a pillow it was hard enough as the reader will imagine but it was better than nothing and appeared to combine safety with a chance to rest the thief fell asleep and slept soundly when he awoke it was bright and the morning was evidently well advanced in an instant consciousness came and with anxious thought he felt for the nugget it was still there as he realized joyfully he was on the point of examining it when a step was heard he looked up startled and saw a man entering the cabin this man was such another as himself an adventurer and the tramp remembered to have seen him about the camp he was an illfavored man poorly dressed and might have passed for a brother of the first comer so far as his moral qualities and general appearance were concerned halloa the new arrival said gazing with a little surprise at the prostrate man halloa returned the other surveying the new arrival with apprehension is this your crib no im only passing the night here havent i seen you at the mines yes i have been there and now you are leaving are you i dont know exactly i havent made up my mind well i am im out of luck so am i theres nothing to be done at the mines just my idea humph what do you think of doing i dont know i want to get away for one thing so do i suppose we keep company friend two are more social than one eh this proposal gave the first man anxious thought if he had a companion he could not hide for any length of time the fact that he was in possession of the nugget yet he did not know how to refuse without exciting suspicion the new arrival noticed it and it stirred up anger in him perhaps i aint good enough for you he said frowning no no it isnt that said the first eagerly dont you want me to go with you demanded the new arrival bluntly yes or no have you got any money asked the thief because i havent no more have i well be equal partners then im afraid we wont get very far youll get as far as i will but i say what is that under your head pard the question had come at last the thief trembled and answered nervously its its i am using it for a pillow he faltered let us see your pillow said the new arrival suspiciously the thief came to a sudden determination suggested by necessity two would make a stronger guard than one and though this man was not the one he would have selected accident had thrown them together and he would risk it look here my friend he said its a great secret oh a secret is it yes but i am going to make you my confidant i am greatly in need of a friend and partner and ill make it worth your while to stand by me ill give you a quarter of what i have here if youll see me safe to melbourne what is it pard out with it quick its a nugget and the biggest one thats been found at bendigo since they commenced mining a nugget great jehoshaphat let me see it the thief drew the bundle still wrapped in obeds red bandanna from underneath the pallet while his companion in intense excitement bent over to catch a glimpse of the treasure chapter xxvii baffled cupidity an expression of surprise and dismay almost ludicrous appeared on the faces of the two adventurers as the contents of the handkerchief were revealed why its nothing but a rock exclaimed the newcomer with an oath the thief stared at him in helpless consternation and was unable to utter a word what does all this mean asked the newcomer sternly if you are humbugging me ill and he finished the sentence with an oath i dont know what it means answered the thief in a disconsolate tone im just as much surprised as you are where did you get it how came you to make such a fool of yourself demanded the newcomer frowning heavily you know that yankee and the two boys who have a claim next to picketts well last night i was coming from the hut that was the local name of the cabin devoted to gambling purposes when i saw them coming from their claim the yankee had this rock tied up in yonder handkerchief of course i supposed it was a nugget no one would suppose he was taking all that pains with a common rock go on did you follow them yes that is i kept them in sight they entered their cabin and i waited perhaps threequarters of an hour till they had time to fall asleep were you near the cabin all the time no i didnt dare to be too near for fear i should be observed i wanted the nugget but i didnt want to run any risk i have no doubt you were very prudent said the second with an unpleasant sneer doubtless he would have done the same but his disappointment was so great that he could not resist the temptation of indulging in this fling at the man who had unintentionally contributed to it of course i was said the first with some indignation would you have had me enter the cabin while they were all awake and carry it off under their very eyes that would be mighty sensible at any rate then you would have got the genuine nugget what do you mean do you think there was a nugget of course i do its as plain as the nose on your face and thats plain enough in all conscience theyve played a trick on you what trick it appears to me you are mighty stupid my friend they hid away the real nugget and put this in its place that yankee is a good deal sharper than you are and he wasnt going to run no risks do you believe this asked the thief his jaw falling theres no doubt of it theyve had a fine laugh at your expense before this ill be bound just my luck ejaculated the thief dolefully after all the pains ive taken too yes it is hard lines on a poor industrious man like you said the newcomer cynically youre not smart enough to be a successful thief i suppose you are retorted the other resentfully yes i flatter myself i am returned the other composedly when i take anything at any rate i have the sense to take something worth carrying away not a worthless rock like this you must have had a fine time lugging it from the mines it nearly broke my back said the thief gloomily and now you dont know what to do with it take my advice my friend and carry it back to the original owner he may find it handy another time ill be blessed if i do growled the unhappy thief i doubt that said his companion dryly however do as you please it dont interest me i dont think on the whole i will accept your offer of a partnership when i take a partner i want a man with some small supply of brains the first looked at him resentfully he did not like these taunts and would have assaulted him had he dared but the newcomer was powerfully built and evidently an unsafe man to take liberties with he threw himself back on the pallet and groaned well said the second after a pause when youve got through crying over spilt milk will you kindly tell me where i can get something to eat i dont know humph thats short and to the point it is something i would like very much to know for my part i feel decidedly hungry i have no appetite said the luckless thief mournfully you will have after a while then you cant think of any cabin near by where we could get a breakfast theres joes wheres joes about a mile from here on the road to the camp are you acquainted with joe yes is your credit good with him i think he would trust me for a breakfast and me you can introduce me as a friend of yours you havent been talking like a friend of mine said the first resentfully perhaps not however you must make allowances for my natural disappointment you led me into it you know if it comes to that i have done you no harm even if the nugget wasnt real you had no claim to it you excited my hopes and thats enough to rile any man that is when disappointment follows however theres no use crying over spilt milk i have an idea that may lead to something what is it asked the thief with some eagerness i will tell you after breakfast my ideas dont flow freely when i am hungry come my friend get up and lead the way to joes i have an aching void within which needs filling up your appetite may come too after a walk somehow this man cool and cynical as he was impressed his fellow adventurer and he rose obediently and led the way out of the cabin i wish i knew what was your idea he said well i dont mind telling you i believe the yankee did find a nugget well you havent got it but you may get it that is we may get it i dont see how he will be on his guard now of course he will i dont mean that we should repeat the blunder of last night you may be sure he wont keep it in his cabin another night then how are we to get it follow him to melbourne hell carry it there and on the way we can relieve him of it theres something in that we shall be together and he wont take me in as readily as he did you after breakfast if we are lucky enough to get any we must go back to the camp and find out what we can about his plans do you think anyone saw you last night when you were in the cabin no that is well then you wont be suspected but i cant say a word more till i have had breakfast after half an hours walking it was only half a mile but the soil was boggy rendering locomotion difficult they reached a humble wayside cabin which was in some sort a restaurant and by dint of diplomacy and a promise of speedy payment they secured a meal to which despite their disappointment they did ample justice breakfast over they resumed their fatiguing walk and reached the mining camp about ten oclock chapter xxviii the nugget in safety fatigued by their exertions of the previous days and the late hours they had kept obed and the boys rose at a later hour than usual about eight oclock obed opened his eyes and noticed that his two young companions were fast asleep its time to get up boys he said giving them a gentle shake the boys opened their eyes and realized by the bright sunshine entering the cabin that the day was already well advanced what time is it obed asked harry past eight oclock we shall be late at our work he smiled and his smile was reflected on the faces of the boys their success of the day before made it a matter of indifference whether they accomplished a good days work or not what are we going to do about the nugget obed asked harry after breakfast we will carry it to the office of the commissioner and get his receipt for it i shall be glad to get it out of our hands said jack if that is the case jack suppose you give your share to me said harry in joke i didnt mean to get rid of it in that way said the young sailor you would be as ready to give it as i to accept it said harry no jack i want you to have your share i am sure you will have a use for it after breakfast the three emerged from the cabin bearing the precious nugget with them they did not meet anyone on their way to the office of the commissioner for all the miners had gone to their work this suited them for until they had disposed of the nugget they did not care to have their good luck made public the royal commissioner was a stout englishman with a red face and abundant whiskers of the same color he chanced to be at the door of the office as the party appeared well can i do anything for you he asked yes sir you can give us a receipt for this nugget nugget ejaculated the commissioner fixing his eyes for the first time on the burden which mr stackpole carried bless my soul you dont mean to say that you have found a nugget of that size thats just what weve done answered obed when did you find it well we took it from the mine about midnight we found it in the afternoon but calculated wed better take possession when there wasnt so many lookin on i say mr commissioner i dont think it would agree with me to be a rich man i got broken of my rest last night from havin the nugget in the cabin you ran very little risk no one could have found out that you had it in your possession remarked the commissioner thats where you are mistaken commissioner we came near being robbed of it only an hour after we brought it home bless my soul how did that happen a pesky thief sneaked in and carried it off as he thought how could he think he carried it off when he did not upon this obed explained the trick to which he had resorted and the commissioner laughed heartily do you know the man the thief i mean he asked yes it is a man that has been prowlin round the camp for some weeks not doin anything but watchin for a chance to appropriate the property of some lucky miner id like to see the fellows face when he opens the handkerchief this morning and finds the rock it appears you have lost a handkerchief at any rate said the commissioner with a smile hes welcome to it answered obed if it will comfort him any i brought it away from home two years ago and now i can afford to buy another by this time the nugget had been carried into the office and exposed to view it is a splendid specimen said the commissioner admiringly it is certainly the largest that has ever been found in this camp has any been found before asked harry yes six months ago a scotch miner named lindsay found one weighing twentytwo pounds and some ounces is he here now yes and without a shilling didnt his nugget benefit him any then asked harry it became a curse to him he obtained some thousands of dollars for it and all went in three months how did he get rid of it in drinking and gambling two months since he drifted back to the camp in rags he did not have money enough to buy a claim but being a good practical miner he got a chance to work a claim on shares for another man who had just come out from melbourne and who knew very little of mining i hope you will make better use of your money are these boys your partners yes mr commissioner they are equal partners whats ones luck is the luck of all meanwhile the commissioner was weighing the nugget on a pair of scales the three awaited the result with great interest it weighs seventyfour pounds and four ounces he announced my friend it will be famous in the annals of australia if i am not mistaken when it is known it will create a stampede to our mines about how much do you think it will realize asked obed at a rough guess i should say fifteen thousand dollars it may be more and it may be less obed stackpoles rough face was fairly radiant i say boys he remarked turning to harry and jack thats a pretty good days work isnt it i should say so obed the commissioner made out a receipt which obed put away carefully in his pocket thats better than carrying the nugget round he said i suppose you will go to melbourne said the commissioner yes we shall start in a day or two here obed paused for it occurred to him that there were practical difficulties in the way of carrying out his plan that is he added slowly if we can raise the money i suppose we cant borrow on the nugget no but i can suggest a way out of your difficulties you can sell your claim it will realize a good round sum as the one from which the nugget has been taken thats so mr commissioner thank you for the suggestion boys there is still some business before us well realize something extra it seems i dont care how much if its only enough to take us to melbourne just then a miner entered the office and seeing the nugget instantly made it his purpose to report the lucky find throughout the camp the effect was instant and electrical every miner stopped work and there was a rush to the commissioners office to see the nugget all were cheered up if there was one nugget there must be more confidence was restored to many who had been desponding obed and the two boys were the heroes of the hour and the crowd came near lifting them on their shoulders and bearing them off in triumph obed felt that this was a good time to sell the claim boys he said we struck it rich and no mistake how rich i dont know there may be other nuggets where this came from but i and my partners want to go back to america the claims for sale who wants it chapter xxix selling the claim lets adjourn to the mine said tom lewis a short sturdy englishman yes lets see the place where the nugget was found echoed another all right im agreeable said obed followed by a crowd of miners obed stackpole strode to the claim where he had struck it rich in spite of his homely face and ungainly form there was more than one who would have been willing to stand in his shoes homeliness and all the day before little notice was taken of him now he was a man who had won fame at a bound they soon stood around the lucky claim it isnt much to look at gentlemen said obed but looks is deceptive as my old grandmother used to tell me handsome is as handsome does and this ere holes done the handsome thing for me and my partners and i venture to say it hasnt got through doin handsome things its made three of us rich and its ready to make somebody else rich wholl be the lucky man do i hear a bid fifty pounds said tom lewis thatll do to start on but it wont do to take fifty pounds i am offered who says a hundred a german miner offered a hundred and tom lewis raised ten pounds a scotch miner aleck graham offered a hundred and twentyfive from that time the bids rose slowly obed showed himself an excellent auctioneer indeed he had had some experience at home and by his dry and droll remarks stimulated the bidding when it became dull and did not declare the claim sold till it was clear no higher bid could be obtained three hundred pounds and sold to frank scott he concluded mr scott i congratulate you i calculate youve made a pretty good investment and i shouldnt wonder if youd find another nugget within a week birds of a feather flock together as my writingbook says and it never rains but it pours frank scott came forward and made arrangements for the payment of the sum he had offered within five minutes he was offered an advance of twentyfive pounds for his bargain which put him in good humor though he declined it i may as well say here since we are soon to bid farewell to bendigo that the claim yielded him double the amount of his investment and though this was not up to his expectations he had no reason to regret his purchase the little crowd of miners were just separating when two newcomers appeared on the scene they were the wellmatched pair who had met earlier in the morning at the deserted cabin for convenience sake we will call them colson and ropes the former being the man who had stolen the nugget as he supposed whats all this crowd said colson in a tone of curiosity ropes put the question to tom lewis who chanced to be passing havent you heard about the nugget asked lewis what nugget asked colson innocently that slabsided yankee obed stackpole found a nugget last night a regular monster and hes been selling his claim i bid for it but i didnt bid high enough wheres the nugget asked colson eagerly in charge of the commissioner who will send it under escort to melbourne colson expected this intelligence still he looked downcast the chance of getting hold of it under such circumstances seemed very small what did the claim go for questioned ropes three hundred pounds frank scott bought it thats a pretty steep price yes but there may be another nugget and there may not then hell be a loser of course theres a risk is the yankee going to stay around here asked colson no he and the two boys are going to melbourne i believe they are going back to america its a shame that such a prize should go to americans said colson in a discontented tone he would have been very glad to head a movement for robbing obed and the boys of the proceeds of their lucky discovery on this flimsy ground but tom lewis was a fairminded man i dont see what that has to do with it said he they found it and they have a right to it of course id rather it had been me but it wasnt and theres an end of it some people are born lucky grumbled colson as lewis walked away i never had any luck the nugget you found wasnt quite so valuable returned ropes grimly no i tugged away for nothing my arms and shoulders are stiff enough this morning and now the nugget is out of our reach but not the three hundred pounds said ropes significantly the price of the claim yes thats true but it wont do us any good the yankee will carry that with him its worth trying for the suggestion seemed to strike colson favorably the two held a whispered consultation which seemed to yield mutual satisfaction they were indeed congenial spirits and agreed upon one point that it was better to make a living by knavery than by doing honest work for honest wages yet there is no harder or more unsatisfactory way of living than this illgotten gains seldom benefit the possessor and the plans of wicked men often fail altogether gradually the two had drawn near to the claim and at last drew the attention of obed and the boys obeds thin face lighted up with satisfaction as he recognized the man who had attempted to steal the nugget goodmornin squire he said politely you look kind of tired as if you was up late last night colson eyed him sharply does he suspect thought he yes he answered in an indifferent tone i didnt rest very well where did you pass the night round here he answered vaguely you look as if you had been taking a long walk you are very observing said colson not over pleased i always was it pays a man sometimes i hear youve struck it rich said colson not caring to take notice of the others significant tone found a nugget they tell me interpolated ropes how big was it weighs about seventyfive pounds that is luck said colson with a sickly smile he could scarcely help groaning as he thought of his loss well yes it is tolerable hefty i reckon me and the boys will be able to take it easy for a few years but we came near losin it after all hows that colson asked but he did not venture to meet obeds glance some skunk saw us bringin back the nugget and prowled round till he thought we was all asleep then he got into the cabin and carried it off that is he thought he did but we was a little too sharp for him we tied up a big rock in my handkerchief and i guess he had a sweet time carryin it off ha ha a good joke said colson but his laughter was mirthless i thought youd enjoy the joke squire said obed how i pity the poor fellow his arms must ache with luggin the old rock the best of it is we know the fellow that took it you do ejaculated colson his jaw dropping yes harry woke up just in the nick of time and saw him scootin out of the cabin if i should tell the boys round here i reckon theyd lynch him added obed quietly just so assented colson but his face was of a sickly hue and taking ropes by the arm he hurried him away that fellows well scared said obed turning to his two young companions i reckon hell make himself scarce till were out of the way chapter xxx the two conspirators obed and the boys made arrangements to travel with the party sent by the commissioner as an escort to the nugget and other sums intrusted to it by different miners the strong guard gave them a sense of security which they would not have had under other circumstances they were all in high spirits they were no longer penniless adventurers but though not rich were possessed of enough gold to make them feel so now that they were well fixed they were all filled with a strong desire to see their home across the sea i suppose obed youll be getting married soon after you reach home said harry the very first thing i shall do will be to pay off the mortgage on dads farm said mr stackpole i want to see him a free man with a home that cant be taken from him then ill look after the other matter you are right obed i only wish i had a father to help and care for said harry soberly ive got a stepfather said jack but i dont feel much like helping him you have a mother jack yes but i shall have to be careful about giving her money for her husband would get it away from her before long well boys we wont borrow trouble before the time comes for all i know suke stanwood may have got tired of waitin for me and married some other feller in that case obed i suppose you would die of a broken heart not much but i dont mind sayin that i should feel uncommon blue two days elapsed before obed and his party started on their return trip meanwhile colson and ropes had disappeared the boys had expected to see them about the camp but they had vanished i wonder what has become of them said harry just as they were starting i reckon theyre hatchin some new mischief wherever they are returned obed composedly you maybe sure theyre not engaged in any honest work perhaps colson is trying to sell his nugget suggested jack with a smile hes welcome to all he can get for it said obed obed was very near the truth in his conjecture their greed was excited by thoughts of the nugget which our three friends had discovered and their brains were busied with plans for obtaining possession of it the chances didnt seem very encouraging it was under strong escort and it would be sheer madness for the two to attack an armed party it would require a much larger force than they could command to make an attack at all practicable with no special plans but with the hope that something would turn up in their favor the two men started for melbourne in advance of the government party they were indebted for the requisite funds to a successful theft by colson who was an expert in his line it is unnecessary to chronicle their daily progress we will look in upon them on the fourth day they were making toilsome progress over the boggy road when all at once they were confronted by three bushrangers headed by fletcher surrender or you are dead men exclaimed fletcher with a boldness which will be easily understood when it is considered that his force outnumbered the travellers two to one neither colson nor ropes appeared to be frightened indeed they were looking for such an encounter all right gentlemen said ropes quietly we are quite ready to surrender empty your pockets was the next order all right again said ropes i am sorry to say we havent much to surrender is this all you have asked fletcher frowning when a pound and ten shillings were delivered to him as their united contributions to the bushrangers fund we havent a penny more search them said fletcher to his followers a search however failed to bring to light anything more why you poor tramps exclaimed fletcher in disgust you are unworthy the attention of gentlemen perhaps not captain answered colson may i have a word with you in private not without suspicion fletcher granted this unexpected request and stepped aside with colson a few paces taking care however to keep near enough to his party to insure his safety well what have you to say he asked abruptly i have no money to give you replied colson but i have information that will enable you to obtain a great deal what is your object in telling me this demanded fletcher still suspiciously the fact is my friend and i want to join with you in the enterprise and get a fair share of the booty do you wish to join our band then well not permanently but for a little while out with the information then will you agree to our terms what are they we want half of the prize you are very modest said fletcher in a sarcastic tone how much will it amount to not far from a hundred thousand dollars fletcher pricked up his ears this was indeed a prize worth trying for give particulars he said a big nugget is on the way to melbourne or will be in a day or two it was found at bendigo i dont know how much it will net but probably seventyfive thousand dollars then there is a considerable amount of dust besides who is to carry it is it in the hands of a private party no it is under government escort fletchers countenance changed that is a different matter he said there is danger in attacking a government party think of the big sum at stake it would require the cooperation of the whole band suppose it does there will be more to divide it among the captain would not agree for a moment to give away half say a third then i am not authorized to make any bargain that will be for the captain to decide you had better tell me all you know about it and i will lay it before the captain and secure you the best terms i can on conditions well that you give me quarter of your share that is unreasonable said colson disappointed then go ahead and rob the government train yourself colson saw that he was helpless and must submit to any terms proposed he accordingly signified his assent very well then said fletcher you may come with us and i will introduce you to the captain by the way who found the nugget you have not told me that a yankee and two boys what was the yankees name asked fletcher eagerly stackpole obed stackpole fletcher whistled i know the man he said the boys are about sixteen one a sailor yes i know them all and i owe them all a grudge there is nothing i should like better than to take all they have and leave them penniless i dont like them myself said colson thinking this was the way to curry favor with his new acquaintance you know them also yes they have treated me meanly colson probably referred to their substituting a common rock for the rich nugget and so subjecting him to mortification and disappointment fletcher asked him a few more questions and then with the new accessions plunged into the woods and led his party to the headquarters of the bushrangers chapter xxxi taken captive the new recruits on being introduced to the captain of the bushrangers were subjected to a searching examination by the chief a suspicion having arisen in his mind that the two were spies sent out by the government to lure the outlaws into a trap he was convinced after a while that they were acting in good faith and a conference was called to decide what should be done in the matter on this point opinions differed the nugget of course would be a valuable prize but it would be impossible to dispose of it in melbourne as the fact of its discovery would have been published and any person attempting to sell it would be instantly arrested this view was held by captain ring himself that objection is easily met said fletcher in what way one of the band could be sent to america to dispose of it he could carry it in his trunk as ordinary luggage perhaps you would like to undertake the commission said captain ring i should be very willing said fletcher eagerly i dont doubt you would returned the captain in a sarcastic tone who would insure your making over the proceeds to us i hope you dont doubt my integrity said fletcher with an air of virtuous indignation perhaps i had better say nothing on that subject fletcher the band are unwilling to subject you to the temptation thats all many good men go wrong you might send someone with me suggested fletcher unwilling to give up the tempting prospect we havent got the nugget yet answered the captain dryly colson and ropes had listened with interest to the discussion they began to fear that nothing would be done they would have been as much opposed as anyone to trusting fletcher as he had not inspired them with confidence it takes a rogue to detect a rogue and they already suspected his true character their hope of revenge on obed stackpole seemed slipping through their fingers the yankee and the two boys have a good deal of gold about them suggested colson of course it isnt much compared with the nugget but it is better than nothing how much has the yankee demanded king three hundred pounds at least that is something but as he will travel with the government escort we should have to attack the whole party not necessarily i have a plan that i think will work detail it colson did so what it was will appear in due time meanwhile obed and the two boys had started on their way to melbourne with a strong military escort they gave themselves up to joyful anticipations of the bright future that opened before them they no longer entertained apprehensions of being waylaid being secure in the strength of their party they travelled by easy stages and at night camped out a sentry was always posted who stood guard while the rest were asleep for unlikely as an attack might be it was deemed necessary to provide against it often however after supper obed and the two boys would take a walk together in order to talk over their plans without interruption from others on the third evening they unwittingly walked a little further than usual harry was the first to notice it hadnt we better return obed he said we must be a mile from the camp you are right said obed it would be rather unlucky to meet with the bushrangers just as we are gettin on so well thats true we mustnt run any risks they started to return when jack stopping suddenly said i thought i heard a groan so did i said harry they paused and the groan was repeated it appeared to come from a couple of rods to the left in the recesses of the forest if theres any poor critter in pain we ought to help him said obed come along boys it was not difficult to discover the spot from which the groan proceeded a man of middle age lay outstretched beneath a tree with an expression of pain on his face whats the matter my friend asked obed standing over him the bushrangers have robbed and beaten me said the prostrate man feebly you dont say so how long since about an hour then they must be near by said harry no they went away as soon as they got my money meanwhile jack had been attentively examining the face of the alleged victim he quietly beckoned to harry to move off to a little distance well jack what is it asked harry somewhat surprised that man is one of the bushrangers i remember his face very well it is one of the gang that captured us harry was naturally startled are you sure of this he asked yes i know him as well as i do obed then it is a plot we must get away if we can there is danger in staying here you are right there harry i will go up and take obeds place while you call him away harry advanced to the side of the victim and said quietly jack wishes to speak to you a moment obed he thinks we can carry this gentleman with us as he has lost all his money very well said obed and walked to where jack was standing harry scrutinized the mans face and he too recognized him as one of the gang but his face did not betray his suspicions were you robbed of much money he asked in a sympathizing tone i had the value of a hundred pounds with me said the other feebly i suppose you came from bendigo like ourselves yes have you been lucky we had some luck but we are tired of mining and are going back to melbourne would you like to have us take you along also yes if you would be so kind at this moment obeds voice was heard come here harry well make a litter to carry our friend there if he is unable to walk all right obed there might have been something in obeds voice that betrayed him at any rate the victim looking up eyed him keenly and then to the surprise of the boys gave a sharp whistle their suspicions were at once kindled and they started to run but too late from the underbrush there sprang out three bushrangers accompanied by colson and ropes who covered the boys with their weapons halt there exclaimed fletcher in a tone of authority oh its you is it said obed with apparent coolness though his heart sank within him yes its i mr stackpole returned fletcher with a grim smile i hope youre better fixed than when we met last i hear youve found a nugget one of those gentlemen with you can give you information about that said obed indicating colson colson frowned and bit his lip he has told us about it ask him for it then he broke into our tent the night we found it and carried it off is this true demanded fletcher eying colson suspiciously no its a lie the nugget is in charge of a mounted escort on the way to melbourne what have you done with your nugget colson asked obed colson did not reply theres no time to waste here stackpole you and the boys will have to go with us here you two men close behind them we must not let them escape the party started with the captives in the middle it was decidedly a bad outlook for our three friends chapter xxxii obed in a tight place it must be confessed that the reflections of obed and the two boys were far from pleasant the cup of happiness had been dashed from their lips just as they had begun to taste it then again it was very mortifying to watch the exultation of fletcher and colson who had finally triumphed over them after being successfully baffled the worst of it is said obed to harry who was walking alongside of him that them skunks have got the best of it its their time to crow now thats the way i feel said harry soberly i believe i would rather have lost twice as much to anybody else we havent lost all thats a comfort they will take the money we have with us but if ever we escape to melbourne there is the nugget money waiting for us just then colson stepped up with a smile on his face it strikes me ive got about even with you friend stackpole he said dont call me friend colson i dont own any man as friend who acts like you so youre a bushranger are you certainly not answered colson amazed it looks like it remarked obed significantly i am merely in the company of the bushrangers just at present aiding and abetting them in their scheming thats so isnt it no you havent any interest in the plunder then now one of the bushrangers was within hearing and colson didnt venture to say no or it would be virtually giving up his share of the money taken from obed and the boys i dont care to answer any of your questions he said stiffly i dont wonder not a mite colson still id like to ask one what is it i dont promise to answer it though didnt you find that nugget rather heavy asked obed slyly colson didnt answer but frowned for the subject was a sore one how many miles did you carry it if i may be so bold i dont care to discuss the subject i shouldnt if i were you it makes me laugh when i think how you must have looked when you found out it was nothing but common rock how much does it weigh inquired colson in a tone of curiosity somewhere between fifty and five hundred pounds are you thinking of attacking the guard i wouldnt if i were you they are prepared for gentlemen of your kind youd be more likely to carry off lead than gold confound the fellow thought colson he looks as if he had the best of me i must worry him a little do you know that you are in a very ticklish position he asked i cant say its a position i fancy much did you put our friends here on the track yes i did answered colson in a tone of satisfaction i thought so that identifies you with them colson you may find it used against you in a court of justice i am no more a bushranger than you are said colson uneasily i would respect you more if you was colson theyre open and aboveboard anyway you want to profit by the same means but sneak out of it and say youre not a bushranger itll be hard to persuade the courts of that i have nothing to do with courts you may have yet let me give you a piece of advice what is it demanded colson suspiciously join the band permanently youre a man after fletchers own heart you and he will make a good match who is that mentioning my name asked fletcher who happened to be within hearing i took that liberty squire ive been advisin colson here to join your band what is that for i think its a business that will suit him his talents all lie in that direction hell be like a brother to you fletcher what did he say he dont like the idea he seems to feel above you he says he is only keepin company with you for a short time is that true demanded fletcher eying colson with displeasure i never said any such thing said colson eagerly he twists my words i have the greatest respect for the bushrangers whom i regard as gentlemen perhaps that is the reason you dont feel gratified to join them colson fletcher laughed at this palpable hit but colson looked annoyed i dont expect to remain in this section of the country long said colson deprecatingly for he was very much afraid of offending fletcher of course i cant form any permanent ties it might be better for you to leave colson ive an idee that it isnt good for your health to stay around here very long you havent made a shinin success so far now as to that nugget which you stole do you mean to insult me i never took any nugget thats so youre right there colson but you thought you had all the same fortunately its where you cant get at it i have something to say on that point said fletcher i understand the nugget is very valuable im glad to hear it youre a judge i have an idee of that sort myself about how much does it weigh about seventyfive pounds i dont mind gratifying your innocent curiosity fletcher fletchers eyes sparkled it must be very valuable he said i reckon it is at what do you estimate it twenty thousand dollars not as much as that it ought to come pretty near it though obed did not answer its a great prize you were very lucky so i thought at the time i dont feel so certain now said obed dryly i think half of it will be enough for you what do you mean fletcher i mean that we shall want half of it how are you going to get it we mean to hold you prisoner till half the proceeds are brought in from melbourne obeds countenance fell he had not thought of this colsons eyes glistened with pleasure till that lucky suggestion was made he saw no way of securing a share of the great prize thats a nice scheme fletcher said obed regaining his composure so i think you and the boys would still have a good sum of money what do you say shall we make a little friendly arrangement to that effect you could give me an order for half the sum realized and on my securing it you would be released i shall have to talk it over with my partners here returned obed theyre equally interested with me better do so now i wont till evenin when we have more time fletcher rode away under the impression that obed was favorably disposed to his plan when i get the money he said to himself i can decide whether to let the fellow go or not i dont care for the boys but id like to give this yankee a good flogging hes so confoundedly sarcastic plague take it the fellow doesnt know when hes down but talks as if he was on equal terms with me meanwhile though fletcher did not know it the train of bushrangers had steadily advanced to the neighborhood of the place where the government escort were encamped in fact he was ignorant that they were so near but obed knew it and he was watching his opportunity to apprise his friends of his situation harry had noticed the same thing lest he should make a premature revelation obed placed his hand to his lips as a sign of silence harry understood and seemed indifferent but his heart was beating fast with excitement chapter xxxiii the tables are turned it was certainly an oversight in fletcher not to have ascertained the situation of the government encampment he was under the impression that it was in a direction opposite to that in which they were moving and this determined his course he was therefore wholly unconscious of danger and tranquil in mind though his situation was critical obed was puzzled to know in what manner to get the necessary intelligence to his comrades chance gave him a suggestion the man next him wore round his neck a whistle designed doubtless to use in case of emergencies it was of rather peculiar shape thats an odd whistle youve got there my friend he said where did you get it in melbourne answered the fellow unsuspiciously i think ive seen one like it in the states let me look at it a minute the bushranger allowed obed to take it in his hand suddenly mr stackpole put it to his mouth and gave a sharp loud whistle that awakened the echoes in the forest like a flash fletcher turned from his place at the head of the train and eyed the bushranger with a frown obed had dropped the whistle and was walking on with an innocent look what is this foolery hogan demanded fletcher sharply dont you know better than to whistle i didnt lieutenant answered hogan it was this man here the yankee yes how did he get the whistle he asked to look at it what does this mean stackpole asked fletcher angrily dont get riled squire said obed imperturbably i just wanted to try it thats all i had a whistle once a little like it when i was workin for old deacon plummer in new hampshire confound old deacon plummer retorted fletcher impatiently dont you know i might have you shot for what youve done shot for whistling well that beats all i ever heard of i say squire your laws are stricter than any i ever came across i didnt think i was doin any harm i will overlook it this time but if you take any such liberty again ill have you tied to a tree and whipped thats better than bein shot anyway i wont do it again squire i aint particularly anxious to get into trouble these yankees are about as stupid and presuming as any people i ever met fletcher remarked to the comrade who rode beside him that fellow is a nuisance but i mean to teach him a lesson before twentyfour hours are over obed and the two boys awaited with anxiety the result of the summons the camp was but an eighth of a mile away but hidden by the trees will they hear it thought obed it is doubtful whether this would have been the case but luckily for our three friends one of the escort by name warner was taking a walk in the woods and heard the whistle his curiosity was excited and peering through the trees he saw the bushrangers and their captives he was a man of promptness and returning to the camp with all expedition made a report to the officer in command how many are there in the band inquired captain forbush warner reported the captain immediately started under warners guidance with ten men and arranged to intercept the bushrangers the first intimation fletcher had of his danger was the sudden appearance of the government soldiers who broke through the underbrush and took the astonished bushrangers in the flank surrender instantly or you are dead men exclaimed forbush sternly fletcher fell back in dismay and was at first speechless with consternation do you surrender repeated the government officer impatiently fletchers eye ran over the party that confronted him they outnumbered his own forces two to one he felt that resistance would be useless we will release our captives if you let us go he said so you would make conditions you are in no condition to do that we propose to free your captives and to take you to our camp you had better not said fletcher hoping to intimidate the officer our main band is close at hand and they will avenge us ill take the risk said forbush indifferently throw down your arms as this order was given with each of the bushrangers covered by the weapons of his own party the bushrangers found it prudent to comply very well now follow me first however the rifles surrendered by the bushrangers were gathered up and in their defenseless condition they were marched to the government camp it added to fletchers annoyance that the weapons dropped by his party were picked up and carried by their late captives obed and the two boys so youre comin to make us a visit fletcher said obed with an exasperating smile its just as well as if we had gone home with you we shall be together anyway and i know you value our society id like to strangle you muttered fletcher thank you but i dont think i should enjoy it ive seldom met a kinderhearted man fletcher but you have queer ways of showing it probably the most discomfited members of the party were colson and ropes all their schemes had miscarried and they felt that they were in a genuine scrape if they could only convince the officers that they were innocent companions of the bushrangers they might yet escape accordingly when they reached the camp colson advanced to captain forbush and said ahem captain my friend ropes and i wish to express our thanks to you for your timely rescue and would like to travel under your escort to melbourne what does the man mean asked forbush turning to obed suppose you ask him suggested obed with a smile of enjoyment like your friends here we were captured but a little earlier i hope ha ha you dont take us for bushrangers that would be a great joke eh ropes just so answered ropes suppose you ask fletcher again suggested obed are these men followers of yours mr fletcher they say you captured them they did did they returned fletcher eying the two men in a manner by no means friendly it is a lie they came to me and reported that your party were carrying a nugget to melbourne and wanted us to attack you and get possession of it in that case they demanded a share of the proceeds the dogs so they want to get favor at our expense do they do you know anything about them mr stackpole asked captain forbush yes captain and i am convinced that my friend fletcher tells the exact truth that skunk there indicating colson tried to steal the nugget the very night of its discovery and broke into my cabin for the purpose hes a sly underhand thief and not to be compared with a bold bushranger i respect them for their pluck at any rate dont believe him hes prejudiced against us whined colson gentlemen said captain forbush i will comply with your request and allow you to travel with me to melbourne under guard fletcher and the bushrangers looked pleased at this announcement their own prospects were not very bright but they were glad to find that colson and ropes were to share their fate chapter xxxiv farewell to melbourne no further adventures or dangers befell the party on their way to melbourne it was thought possible that captain ring in charge of the main body of the bushrangers might attempt a rescue of his companions no such attack took place it might have been that he feared the issue of the conflict but it is also possible that he experienced no poignant regret at the capture of fletcher who he well knew would have been glad to succeed him in command at first fletcher was buoyed up by the hope of a rescue then when that hope faded out he sought for an opportunity to escape in one case he would have succeeded but for the vigilance of obed stackpole the latter awakening suddenly saw fletcher who in some way had got out of his fetters stealing quietly away he sprang to his feet and intercepted the fugitive what fletcher you dont mean to say you are goin to leave us without sayin goodby we cant spare you really fletcher tried to shake himself free from the yankees detaining grasp let me alone you scarecrow he exclaimed fiercely thank you for the compliment fletcher said obed i aint so hansome as you are thats a fact but i guess im a good deal better as he spoke his grip became stronger and fletcher found his efforts to escape absolutely futile i should like to choke you he said fiercely ive no doubt you would fletcher it would be a nice amusement for you but im not quite ready for the operation just yet when i am ill let you know but for you i would have got away said fletcher in bitter disappointment i guess you would its lucky i opened my eyes in time thered have been mournin in this camp if youd got away fletcher youre wastin yourself in the woods youre fitted to adorn melbourne society and it wont be my fault if you dont arrive there at that moment captain forbush awoke whats happened he asked anxiously one of our friends was takin french leave thats all said obed i woke just in time to persuade him to stay a little longer ha so fletcher was trying to escape was he i am indebted to you mr stackpole for frustrating his plan we cant spare him at all events i would rather lose any two of his companions you see fletcher how much we value your society said obed it was cruel in you to leave us youre a fool exclaimed fletcher darting a look of hate at obed you never did appreciate me fletcher all i want is your good fletcher was secured in such a way that escape was no longer possible in due time he and his comrades reached melbourne as captives and were transferred to the civil authorities it may be well to add here that they were tried and sentenced to a prolonged term of imprisonment colson and ropes fared a little better their term being only half as long they submitted sullenly to their fate but singularly seemed more embittered against obed stackpole than against any of the officers through whose hands they passed obed would have fared badly had he fallen unprotected into their hands it was a joyful day for our young hero as well as his three companions when they saw rising before them the roofs and spires of melbourne during the weeks that had elapsed since their departure they had not only roughed it but they had met with a series of adventures which were pleasanter to remember than to pass through twice they had been captives but each time they had been providentially rescued harry felt that god had watched over him and delivered him from danger and the schemes of wicked men and his confidence and trust in an overruling power were stronger than ever it was some days before they secured the money resulting from the disposal of the nugget when the matter was finally arranged they found themselves in possession of about sixteen thousand dollars this included the sum realized from the sale of the mining claim that gives us about five thousand three hundred dollars apiece said harry after a brief calculation i cant believe it said jack who really seemed bewildered by his good fortune why its wonderful so it is jack i dare say you are the richest young sailor of your age in the world i dont know about that but i feel as rich as a vanderbilt when does the next steamer start obed in four days can you be ready in that time i would get ready to start tomorrow if necessary so would i melbourne is a nice city but id rather be on dads farm eatin supper in the old kitchen than in the best hotel here after all theres no place like home obed thats a fact but perhaps jack doesnt feel so my home isnt what it was once said jack soberly if mother hadnt married again it would have been different but i never can like or respect my stepfather theres one place you ought to visit before you start for home harry suggested obed i mean to see the city pretty thoroughly before i go as i dont imagine i shall ever come this way again thats all right but it isnt what i mean what then do you remember the old gentleman you saved from a ruffian the night before you started for the mines mr woolson yes you ought to call you and jack ill go this morning will you come too jack ill go with you anywhere harry said the young sailor whose affection and admiration for harry were very strong about ten oclock the boys entered the office of mr woolson it was situated in one of the handsomest blocks in little collins street and they learned that he was a wholesale merchant and importer is mr woolson in harry asked of a clerk he is in the inner office have you business with him yes admitted into the inner office the boys saw the old gentleman seated at a large desk with a pile of papers and letters before him they were by no means certain that he would recognize them but he did so instantly i am glad to see you my young friends he said rising and shaking hands with them i have thought of you often and of the great service you did me have you just returned from the mines yes sir i hope you have had good luck wonderful luck jack and i are worth over five thousand dollars apiece bless my soul why it only seems a week since you went away it is nearly three months and seems longer to us for we have passed through a great deal i shall be glad to hear a full account but i have not time in business hours will you do me the favor to dine with me at my house tonight and spend the evening with pleasure sir then i shall expect you the hour is six oclock sharp the boys met the engagement and passed the time most agreeably jack felt a little bashful for mr woolson lived in fine style and jack was not used to an elegant house or table when the cloth was removed mr woolson asked the boys their plans we intend to sail for new york next saturday said harry that is as far as we have got if you were willing to stay in melbourne i would give you a place in my countingroom thank you sir but i prefer to live in america then i will give you a letter to my nephew and business correspondent in new york he will further any business views you may have thank you sir and i will do the same for your friend if he desires thank you sir said jack but i mean to keep on as a sailor i hope some day to be a captain i will give you a place on one of our ships and you shall be promoted as rapidly as you are qualified to rise jack looked gratified for he knew the value of so powerful a friend late in the evening the boys took leave of the hospitable merchant and three days afterward they embarked for new york chapter xxxv some old acquaintances we will now return to america and for the benefit of those readers who are not familiar with harrys early adventures as narrated in the story of facing the world i will give a brief account of his story before setting out on the voyage to australia left an orphan with a scanty patrimony amounting to three hundred dollars harry left it all in the hands of his fathers friend mr benjamin howard of ferguson and set out not in quest of a fortune but of a livelihood he had been recommended by his father to seek a cousin of his john fox of colebrook and place himself under his guardianship he visited mr fox but found him so mean and grasping that he left him after a brief stay preparing to face the world without assistance mr fox who had two children joel and sally was greatly disappointed as he bad hoped to get control of the boys slender property and convert it to his own use he pursued harry but was unable to overtake and capture him months passed and john fox heard nothing of his wandering relative one day however he came home triumphant well maria he said addressing his wife ive heard of harry vane you dont say ejaculated joel his face screwed up into an expression of curiosity what did you hear where is he joel answered his father with an attempt at solemnity the judgments of the lord have fallen upon your unhappy cousin what do you mean mr fox asked his wife showing curiosity in turn i mean that he is lying dead at the bottom of the sea dont be so tantalizing mr fox if you know anything about the boy out with it when mrs fox spoke in this tone her husband knew that she would not stand any nonsense so he answered without delay soon after he left our happy home maria he shipped on board the nantucket as a common sailor i presume and the ship was lost off in the southern ocean with all on board how awful pa said sally who alone of all the family had felt kindly toward harry and he was so goodlooking too he wasnt a bit better looking than joel said her mother sharply oh ma its true i never could see any good looks in him and it doesnt become you miss to go against your own brother how did you find it out mr fox i came across an old copy of the new york herald giving an account of the disaster and mentioning harry vane as one of the passengers of course its a mistake for he must have been one of the common sailors well i reckon theres no call for us to put on mourning said mrs fox i dont know about that it might look better what do we care about harry vane my dear he left property said mr fox significantly theres three hundred dollars in the hands of that man in ferguson besides the money he got for saving the train as much as two hundred dollars as we are his only relatives that money ought to come to us by rights thats so husband on the whole ill put a black ribbon on my bonnet and ill wear a black necktie said joel how much of the money am i to have wait till we get it said his father shortly what steps do you propose to take in this matter mr fox queried his wife im going to ferguson tomorrow to see mr benjamin howard of course he wont want to give up the money but ill show him i mean business and am not to be trifled with thats right pa said joel approvingly five hundred dollars will give us quite a lift said mrs fox thoughtfully so it will so it will my dear of course im sorry to hear of the poor boys death but i shall insist upon my rights all the same mrs fox warmly approved of her husbands determination being quite as mean and moneyloving as he chapter xxxvi a heartbroken relative late in the afternoon john fox knocked at the door of benjamin howard in the town of ferguson it was a hundred miles distant from colebrook his own residence and he grudged the three dollars he had spent for railroad fare still he thought that the stake was worth playing for i am john fox of colebrook he said when mr howard entered the room you may have heard of me i have answered mr howard slightly smiling i am the only living relative of harry vane that is i and my family i have heard harry speak of you said mr howard noncommittally yes poor boy i wish he were alive and mr fox drew out a red bandanna handkerchief and covered his eyes in which there were no tears what do you mean asked mr howard startled then you havent heard heard what that he sailed in the ship nantucket which was lost with all on board in the southern ocean it so happened that mr howard had received a letter from harry after his arrival in australia and so knew that harry was not lost for a moment he thought mr fox might have later information but saw that it was not so he decided to draw mr fox on and ascertain his object in calling i hope that this is not so he said gravely there is not a doubt of it answered fox theres an account of the loss of the vessel in the new york herald i cut it out and have it in my pocketbook would you like to see it if you please mr fox produced the scrap and asked triumphantly doesnt that settle it suppose that it does what then what then it follows that harrys money comes to me and my family as the only surviving relatives youve got money of his the boy told me yes about how much about three hundred dollars so i thought that money ought to be handed over to me i dont see that mr fox you dont see that interrogated fox sharply do you mean to keep it yourself not for my own use i am not that kind of a man mr fox but i have no authority to hand the money over in the unceremonious way you expect why not isnt the boy dead i have no proof of it what better proof do you want than the new york herald the account in the herald may contain errors perhaps you think the boy could swim to shore a few hundred miles suggested john fox with sarcasm no i dont think that likely then what possible chance had he to escape he might have been rescued by a passing vessel look here mr howard said fox indignantly you dont mean what you say you evidently mean to keep that money from the lawful claimants i am not much surprised i expected it but i can tell you here and now that john fox isnt a man to be cheated and imposed upon i mean to have my rights are you aware mr fox that your language is offensive and insulting i dont care i came here for justice that money ought not to be in your hands who are no kith nor kin to harry vane it ought to go to me and i mean to sue you for it mr fox i propose to obey the law but it appears to me that you are taking it for granted that harry vane is dead without sufficient proof what more proof do you want than this paragraph the fact is you dont want to believe it no answered mr howard in a tone of emotion i dont want to believe that poor harry is dead nor i said john fox if the boy hadnt been foolish and left my happy home hed have been alive today but we cant alter facts hes dead and all our grief wont bring him back benjamin howard looked at the man curiously his grief doesnt seem to be very profound he thought i will test him even if i were convinced that poor harry was dead he said i should not deliver up the money till you had established a legal claim to it so you mean to put all possible obstacles in my way said john fox provoked i thought so but mr howard let me tell you that you cant rob the orphan meaning yourself no i mean the dead boy that is the orphans estate without settling with me i am a man of influence id have you know and ill put the matter in the hands of the lawyer right off it might be well first to listen to what i have to say aha hes scared thought john fox im ready to hear what youve got to say he answered but it wont influence me a particle i think it will harry vane is alive what ejaculated john fox his face expressing his dismay its a lie i dont believe it georgie said mr howard to his little son who just then entered the room go to my desk and bring me harry vanes letter this was done at once john fox meanwhile sitting in painful suspense this letter said mr howard taking it in his hand was posted as you see at melbourne australia harry was shipwrecked on an island from which he finally escaped and was carried to melbourne he writes me that he has gone to the mines and is hoping to find some gold there is this true asked fox in a hollow voice i will read you the letter and show you the signature i think its a forgery no chance of that i know harry vanes handwriting well but you dont look well mr fox i thought you would be pleased to hear that harry had escaped from the perils of shipwreck and is alive john fox did not reply but after examining the letter he rose with a rueful countenance and departed unceremoniously a badly disappointed man itll cost me three dollars to get back he groaned and i shall have to stop at a hotel for there is no train till tomorrow most ten dollars gone altogether just thrown away im a very unlucky man the news he carried home brought grief to mrs fox and joel only sally seemed glad that harry was still living for so expressing herself she was severely rebuked by her mother chapter xxxvii home again it was a bright beautiful morning when our three friends landed in new york their voyage had been a favorable one and they had made some pleasant acquaintances but they were overjoyed to tread once more the familiar streets and see the familiar sights of the american metropolis they registered at a quiet hotel on the european system intending to remain in the city a few days they sought out a prominent broker and asked his advice about the investment of their money he received them in a friendly manner and gave them the best advice in his power each reserved three hundred dollars for present use it was a novelty to all of them to be free from anxiety on the score of money and it may well be believed that all enjoyed the feeling the second morning as they were walking down broadway their eyes fell upon a familiar figure directly in front of them they beheld a slender young man dressed in the extreme of fashion swinging a light cane as he walked along it was easy to see that he was on the most comfortable and agreeable terms with himself and firmly persuaded that he was an object of general admiration montgomery clinton exclaimed harry and jack simultaneously you dont mean to say you know that critter said obed eying mr clinton with evident curiosity yes he was one of the nantucket passengers and shipwrecked with us said harry he did not remain in australia but took a return vessel at once that was lucky a critter like that wouldnt be of much account at the mines stop i am going to speak to him harry quickened his step and touched mr clinton on the shoulder clinton turned languidly but when he saw who it was his face expressed undisguised pleasure mr vane he exclaimed im awfully glad to see you dont you know you havent forgotten my friend jack i hope said harry indicating the young sailor i am glad to see him too said mr clinton with modified pleasure offering two fingers for jack to shake for he had not forgotten that jack had been a sailor when did you come from australia asked clinton we only arrived day before yesterday and what luck did you have at the mines we struck it rich we are all capitalists jack and all you dont say so i wish i had gone with you really now i dont think youd have liked it mr clinton we had a hard time we had to wade through mud and mire and sleep on the ground and twice we were captured by bushrangers they wanted jack and myself to join the band you dont say so really they might have made you a bushranger mr clinton if they had caught you i never would consent never said mr clinton with emphasis jack smiled at the idea of the elegant mr clinton being transformed into an outlaw and bushranger i am awfully glad i did not go with you he said shuddering let me make you acquainted with my friend mr obed stackpole mr clinton said harry he was with us in all our trials and dangers montgomery clinton surveyed obed with evident curiosity the long gaunt figure of the yankee was clad in a loose rough suit which was too large for him and clinton shuddered at the barbarous way in which he was attired glad to make your acquaintance mr stackpole he said politely stackpole if its all the same to you friend clinton corrected obed glad to see any friend of harrys and jacks you look as if you had just come out of a bandbox ob thank you said the gratified dude youre awfully kind my friends think i have a little taste in dress my friends never paid me that compliment said obed say how do you like my fit out i i dont think they have very good tailors in australia said clinton hesitatingly have you as many pairs of trousers as ever mr clinton asked harry i have only nineteen mr vane but i shall order some more soon nineteen pairs of breeches ejaculated obed in amazement what in the name of jehoshaphat do you want of so many well i dont want to have people get used to seeing me in the same trousers dont you know so every day i wear a different pair it must cost a mint of money to buy so many clothes oh i have accounts with four or five tailors theyre willing to wait dont you know they appreciate a gentlemans custom how long do they wait asked harry im owing some two years theres lots of fellows make them wait as long that aint my way said obed i pay cash dont they make a fuss oh they send in their bills but i dont take any notice of them said clinton languidly then young man said obed let me advise you to pay your bills and get back your selfrespect id go six months with only a single pair of breeches sooner than cheat a tailor out of a new pair i never wear breeches drawled clinton with a shudder i dont know what they are mr vane those trousers you have on are very unbecoming let me introduce you to my tailor hell fit you out in fashionable style thank you i believe i do need a new pair will he fit me too asked obed he dont make breeches said clinton disdainfully a good hit by jehoshaphat exclaimed obed slapping clinton on the back with such emphasis that he was nearly upset dont hit quite so hard said the dude ruefully you nearly upset me dont you know i know it now the fact is friend clinton you ought to be shut up in a glass case and put on exhibition in a dime museum how awfully horrid protested clinton youre more fit for ornament than use youre awfully sarcastic mr stackpole dont you know said clinton edging off cautiously i must bid you goodmorning mr vane as i have to buy a new neck tie i will go to the tailors any day what was such a critter made for anyway queried obed when clinton was out of hearing he looks for all the world like a tailors dummy chapter xxxviii the boys secure positions before leaving new york harry vane decided to call upon the nephew to whom mr woolson of melbourne had given him a letter of introduction upon inquiry he found that john woolson co the style of the firm were large importers in the lower part of the city accompanied by jack he called one morning mr john woolson a courteous gentleman about forty years of age received him with politeness which changed to cordiality when he had read his uncles letter my uncle writes here that you two young gentlemen recently rendered him an important service we were fortunate enough to save him from being robbed said harry modestly and maltreated also i presume said the nephew when did you arrive in new york last thursday sir did you leave my uncle well he looked in excellent health how long do you remain in the city what are your plans we think of leaving tomorrow we wish to see friends from whom we have long been parted my uncle wishes me to offer you a position in my establishment mr vane if that will meet your views i shall be happy to receive you i should like nothing better sir replied harry his eyes sparkling will fifteen dollars a week satisfy you to begin with but sir i cant hope to earn as much as that well perhaps not just at first said the merchant smiling but if your looks dont belie you it will not be long before your services will be worth that sum at any rate i am ready to pay it thank you sir said harry gratefully when would you wish me to commence when you please you had better take a vacation of a month to visit your friends then come to the city and enter my employment harry renewed his thanks and mr woolson turned to jack yon have been trained as a sailor i believe he said yes sir do you wish to follow the sea yes sir answered jack promptly i love the sea then i will find you a good position on one of my ships commend you specially to the captain as a young friend of mine and promote you as fast as your progress in seamanship will warrant my doing so now it was jacks turn to look jubilant for nothing could have suited him better you too will want a vacation take as long as you like and then come to me by the way i dont know how you are situated as regards money if either of you desires an advance i shall be glad to accommodate you we met with good luck at the mines said harry and are both well supplied with money we thank you however for your kind offer the boys left the office in high spirits i dont see but our prospects are bright jack said harry i didnt think so when we were on the island said jack or when we were captives among the bushrangers no we have certainly seen some hard times let us hope that we have had our share and may look forward now to happier days now that their future was arranged the boys were in a hurry to leave the city and visit their friends obed sympathized with them boys said he im gettin kinder homesick theres an old man and a girl i want to see and tell em of my good luck your father and suke stanwood suke has been waitin for me five years and there aint no need of waitin any longer if all goes well shell be mrs obed stackpole within a month she may not be able to get her wedding things so soon obed she dont need any wedding things any dressll do to be married in you will send us some cards and cake i hope obed bettern that ill send you an invite to the weddin then itll have to come soon obed i shall be gone to the city and jack to sea within a month then well hurry it up itll give me a good excuse but theres one thing im going to do before i get married what is that pay off the mortgage on dads farm its only a thousand dollars but dad couldnt lift it if he lived to a hundred and what are you going to do obed theres a farm alongside i can buy for twentyfive hundred dollars with a comfortable house thrown in i can buy it and have more than enough money left to furnish the house and stock the farm i wish you happiness obed but dont you think youll ever pine to be back in australia i may hanker after a sight of fletcher and his two cronies colson and ropes returned obed with dry humor but we cant have everything in this world and ill try to rub along with the blessings i have let me add here that obed carried out his programme he paid the mortgage bought the farm and in less than three weeks he was a married man harry and jack were at the wedding and received great attention from all obeds friends to the inhabitants of the little village it seemed wonderful that boys so young should have traveled so far and passed through such varied experiences i expect an invite to each of your weddings boys said obed as they were on the point of leaving him one good turn deserves another you will have to exercise a little patience obed said harry smiling dont wait as long as i did said obed i got to be a cranky old bachelor before i hitched horses mrs stackpole will soon cure you of that said harry with a smile chapter xxxix conclusion when harry had completed his business in new york he took the train at once to his native village his arrival made quite a sensation not only mr howard his fathers friend received him with joy but there were many other friends besides who rejoiced in his good fortune you have been very fortunate harry said mr howard you tell me that you have about five thousand dollars yes sir and it makes me feel rich besides the two thousand dollars i have in charge for you two thousand dollars ejaculated harry in amazement you mean three hundred mr howard no i mean what i say replied his friend with a smile but i dont understand dont you remember the fifty shares of mining stock you placed in my hands yes they were given me by my father i thought them worthless a month ago i learned the contrary i took the liberty without consulting you as you were absent to sell them they realized seventeen hundred dollars net thus carrying up the amount in my hands to two thousand dollars is it possible that i am worth seven thousand dollars it seems wonderful but the best of it is that it is true then was there not a sum of money which you received for saving a railroad train yes i have used part of it but one hundred and fifty dollars remain it is in the hands of a mr conway president of the road then it appears to me harry taken in connection with your offer of employment in new york you are in a very enviable position how old are you i shall soon be seventeen then you are beginning the world young continue to deserve good fortune and you are likely to prosper before returning to new york harry felt inclined to visit his wouldbe guardian john fox whose treatment of him has been recorded at length in facing the world he took the train as before to bolton and thence went by stage to colebrook he walked to the fox mansion and going up to the front door knocked the door was opened by mrs fox herself she did not immediately recognize harry in his handsome suit with a gold chain crossing his vest attached it may be added to a handsome gold watch which he had bought in new york what is your business young man she asked dont you remember me mrs fox asked harry lands sake it aint harry vane she exclaimed in wonder yes it is answered harry smiling i hope mr fox and joel are well come in and ill call joel youve been doing well aint you she asked surveying him with eager curiosity i have been very fortunate indeed i thought you was drowned wrecked on a ship or something if i was i have come to life again well well its strange ill call joel joel who was at the barn soon entered he too surveyed harry curiously how dy do he said i never expected to set eyes on you again is that a gold watch you have yes joel let me see it how much did it cost a hundred dollars besides the chain gosh aint that a sight of money did you spend all your money on it no i bought a chain too to my mind you was very foolish to spend all your hard earnins that way theres no fool like a young fool said mrs fox severely but mrs fox i have some money left how much asked joel eagerly seven thousand dollars gosh all jerusalem you aint yarnin be you seven thousand dollars whos talkin of seven thousand dollars asked a familiar voice as mr fox entered the room harry vane says hes worth seven thousand dollars exclaimed joel in a tone made up of amazement jealousy and wonder is that true asked john fox in equal amazement yes mr fox but how on arth then harry gave a full explanation with which i dont propose to trouble the reader as it would be a twicetold tale some folks seem born to luck said mr fox furiously when harry had completed his story joel may work and toil all his life and he wont get no seven thousand dollars it seems hard john fox had been much impressed by harrys luck and his avaricious soul was busying itself with some scheme for turning it to his personal advantage im glad youve been so lucky harry he said with affected cordiality it beats all i must say ive no doubt you are ready now to carry out your dear fathers dyin wish what was that mr fox he wanted me to be your guardeen it stands to reason a boy of sixteen aint to be trusted with so much money now im an experienced man of business and im willin to be your guardeen and i wont charge you a cent for takin care of your property except board money thank you mr fox said harry with an amused smile but i am offered a place in new york at fifteen dollars a week and i have friends who will advise me about the investment of my money fifteen dollars a week repeated mr fox dolefully cant you get a place for joel in the same store if i can find joel a satisfactory place in the city i will do so said harry but i ought to say that my employer only pays me high wages out of favor ill take ten said joel eagerly you know you and me was always friends harry joel always liked you said politic mr fox harry knew better but he was on good terms with the world and he did not dispute this statement ill do what i can he said meanwhile mr fox i should like to make joel and his sister a small present he gave them each a tendollar bill which made joels eyes sparkle with joy mr fox renewed his suggestion that harry select him as a guardeen but harry politely but firmly declined to entertain the proposal nevertheless when he left the house he was warmly urged to come again and often he understood the reason of the cordiality and knew very well that if he had come back poor his reception would have been very different before going back to new york he made a visit of a couple of days to his old friend and employer professor hemmenway the prestidigitateur who was delighted with the success of his young friend he offered harry a new engagement but of course it was declined in new york he met jack and inquired how he had fared i found my stepfather dying answered jack in fact he drank himself to death after wasting all mothers property but i have bought her a small house and insured her an income sufficient to keep her comfortable the last will require some of my principal but i shall be earning good wages and can make it up when i return home when do you sail jack next week on one of mr woolsons ships i am to go to china i hope youll steer clear of the island we were wrecked on jack i never want to see it again harry still it brought us luck i shall be sorry to part with you jack i wish you could be content to stay in new york no harry i cant give up the sea yet it is my great ambition to command a ship myself some time i think you will accomplish it jack for you stand well with the owners five years have passed harry and jack are each twentyone harry occupies a confidential position with the firm and is likely to be a partner before he is much older jack is first mate and will be a captain before he is twentyfive his mother is living and happy in his success and enjoying the comfortable home he has provided for her harry obtained a position for joel in the city but he proved unsatisfactory to his employer and was soon discharged another situation he held as brief a time at last he was obliged to go home and assist his father who treats him almost as penuriously as he would have done harry joel is dissatisfied and unhappy and his mother thinks he was born to bad luck but those who know joel think his want of success springs from a different source harry and jack obtained success because they deserved it if joel were more like them he too might succeed and i am sorry to say he is looking forward impatiently to the time when he shall inherit his fathers property it is very wrong but perhaps mr fox himself is partly to blame whenever jack comes home from a voyage he calls upon harry and together they talk over their adventures in a new world sometimes obed stackpole calls also he has two boys whom he has named respectively harry and jack in honor of his two companions in australia the end the famous castlemon books by harry castlemon illustration specimen cover of the gunboat series no author of the present day has become a
