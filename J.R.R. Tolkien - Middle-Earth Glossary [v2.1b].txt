the house of hador while there is no mention of its use after the downfall it cannot have become completely extinct at this date it seems likely that the scholars of gondor and of arnor would have

holy ones the first beings created by ilъvatar the order of the valar and maiar made before eд the holy ones there was eru the one who in arda is called ilъvatar and he made first the ainur the holy ones that were the offspring of his thought the primordial spirits who existed with ilъvatar and with him created the world through the music of the ainur after the creation of arda many of the ainur descended into it to guide and order its growth of these there were fifteen more powerful than the rest fourteen of these great ainur became the valar or powers of arda the fifteenth melkor turned aside from that path and became the first dark lord the many lesser ainur that accompanied the valar into arda are known as maiar origins of the ainur the ainur were the first and mightiest beings created by ilъvatar in the depths of time before the beginning of the world the ainur were the offspring of thought and each was given understanding only of that part of the mind of ilъvatar from which he or she came the exception to this was melkor the greatest of the ainur who had a part of the gifts of all the others the ainur were kindled with the flame imperishable which can be taken to mean that they were granted free will by their creator ilъvatar instructed them in the arts of music until he brought them together to make the music of the ainur the great song that created the vision of ilъvatar and ultimately the real world the ainur and the world through the music of the ainur ilъvatar created a vision of the world he showed it to the ainur and explained much of its nature and destiny to them so the ainur have much knowledge of the world but are not omniscient then ilъvatar granted the world true being melkor and many of the other mighty ainur desired to descend into it and form it in readiness for the coming of the children of ilъvatar these became the beings known as the valar and the maiar those ainur who entered the world at its beginning remain bound to it until its end though melkor was eventually thrown into the void by the others he is prophesied to return before the end little is known of the ultimate future of the ainur even by themselves but it is said that after the great battle at the end of the world they will make a second even greater music with the children of ilъvatar the line of melian among the many ainur that entered the world long

origin of the sun valinor was in the west of the world and the so the first sunrise was in the west not the east originally arien was to have steered anar ceaselessly from west to east and back again

surrounded by the ocean the andustar was a generally fertile region except along its northern coasts where the landscape became higher and rockier and forested by firs its western shores were broken by three bays with the northernmost of these being the bay of andъniл on the high land around this bay the nъmenуreans built the port and city of andъniл whose lords were to be the ancestors of the

mandos angband iron prison hells of iron the great dungeonfortress of morgoth in the northwest of middleearth the hells of iron angband was a mighty fortified citadel originally constructed by melkor in the earliest days of the world as an outlying fortress to his northern stronghold of utumno utumno was destroyed by the valar and melkor imprisoned in valinor for three ages but on his return to middleearth he took angband as the seat of his power and raised the towers of thangorodrim above its gates angband was beseiged by the noldor during the early part of the first age but the siege of angband was broken at the dagor bragollach it was finally destroyed by the forces of the valar at the end of the first age in the war of the wrath origins and history melkor built angband during the years of the trees originally as an outlying fortress and armoury to his great northern citadel at utumno it was commanded from its first construction by sauron the chief of melkors servants angband was built near the northwestern shores of the great sea in the range of the iron mountains as a first defence against any attack on melkors realm from the valar in aman when the valar captured melkor and took him in chains back to valinor angband was largely destroyed and lay in ruins for many thousands of years although beneath the ruins lay many hidden chambers in which some of melkors servants escaped the valars assault sauron was one of these and the balrogs lay hid with him in angbands deepest vaults angband reentered history when melkor escaped valinor with the stolen silmarils he chose the ruined fortress as his new capital and rebuilt the hells of iron as a base for the dark reign he intended for the lands of middleearth soon after the return of the noldor to beleriand morgoth took maedhros fлanors son by deceit and trickery and hung him by the wrist from the towers of thangorodrim above angband he was rescued by fingon and thorondor but lost his right hand the third of the great battles in the wars of beleriand the dagor aglareb had profound consequences for angband until that time morgoth sent out hosts of orcs in the hope of taking the noldor by surprise the noldor though chased these orcs back to the very gates of angband and slew them to the last creature from then until the dagor bragollach in i a period of almost years angband was surrounded by the noldor this is the time known as the siege of angband appearance and construction angband was primarily an underground fortress at least after its initial destruction by the valar in the years of the trees like its prototype utumno it had many hidden underground chambers and vaults far beneath the earth its main features above ground were the three peaks of the thangorodrim mighty towers of ash and slag raised above angbands gates the peaks of thangorodrim were hollow and from them channels and chimneys ran down to the deepest pits of angband so morgoth could produce poisonous clouds and vapours as indeed he sent against the noldor in mithrim during the first days after their return angbor sturdy lord of lamedon the lord of lamedon at the time of the war of the ring famed for his fearlessness in

himself but it was stolen by his son maeglin this must have happened when maeglin and his mother aredhel fled nan elmoth for gondolin so presumably the sword was taken to turgons hidden city what became of it after that is unknown annael greyelf of mithrim fosterfather of tuor a sindarin elf the fosterfather of tuor during his early years in mithrim annatar lord of gifts name given to himself

kings of arnor beside lake nenuial afterwards restored by king elessar ancient seat of the kings of arnor the city of the kings of arnor on the shores of nenuial the city was founded by elendil himself on the shores of the northern lake nenuial near the sources of the baranduin it was the chief city of the kings of arnor for several centuries and home to one of the three palantнri of the northkingdom the available evidence suggests that the city survived for nearly a thousand years in the early days of arnor it must have been one of the glories of middleearth soon after its founding though the numbers of the dъnedain of the north began to dwindle the population of annъminas seems to have fallen throughout its history until eventually it was deserted and the kings removed to fornost to the east it seems likely that the people of annъminas were dependent on the river baranduin for their contact with the outside world while the hills of evendim surrounded the city to the west and south the citys people could reach the other cities of the dъnedain that lay along the river by boat after the citys desertion it fell into decay but two relics of its greatness survived its palantнr and the sceptre of annъminas the palantнr remained in middleearth for more than a millennium after the loss of its city but was ultimately drowned with arvedui in the cold northern seas the silver sceptre of annъminas was the symbol of kingship in the northkingdom a very ancient thing it was originally the rod of office of the nъmenуrean lords of andъniл though it would have been removed to fornost by the kings and eventually came to be kept by elrond in rivendell it retained the name of its ancient home of annъminas at the time of the coronation of aragorn at the end of the third age annъminas had lain in ruins for more than two thousand years there are hints in the history of middleearth though that aragorn refounded the city and may even have made it his capital no definite statement on this matter appears in the canonical works though so this must be considered speculation anor an elvish name for the sun the name for the sun in the sindarin language it appears in many

of aragorn ii elessar aragorn iaragorn a remote ancestor of aragorn of the fellowship of the ring the heir of aravir who ruled as fifth chieftain of the dъnedain for just eight short years he met an

adventures and travelled to many distant lands before claiming his kingship aragost eighth chieftain of the dъnedain son of arahad i and direct ancestor of aragorn ii elessar arahad iarahad seventh of the chieftains to rule the dъnedain after the loss of arthedain arahad was the son of araglas of the line of isildur early in his reign the watchful peace came to an end as sauron returned to dol guldur and soon afterwards the white council was formed some years later orcs that had been secretly establishing themselves in the misty mountains suddenly revealed themselves and the roads eastward into eriador became all but impassable arahads reign lasted sixtyeight years he was succeeded by his son aragost arahad iiarahad tenth chieftain of the dъnedain son of aravorn and direct ancestor of aragorn ii elessar arahael the second chieftain of the dъnedain arahael was the first of isildurs heirs to be born after the destruction of the northkingdom his father aranarth therefore gave him over to elrond to be fostered in rivendell and this became the custom of the chieftains of the north some decades before arahael assumed the leadership of his people gandalf had gone to dol guldur and driven its master into the east the witchking who had ravaged the realm of arahaels grandfather arvedui two generations before was far to the south in minas morgul so arahael led the dъnedain during the time known as the watchful peace and was untroubled by war arahael served as chieftain of the dъnedain for seventyone years he was succeeded by his son aranuir araman barren wasteland on the coast of aman between the pelуri and the sea extending northward to the helcaraxл the narrow coastlands of aman north of valinor that lay east beyond the mountainfence of the pelуri aranarth first of the chieftains of the dъnedain the elder son of king arvedui of arthedain who would have become king himself in turn if not for the destruction of his fathers kingdom by the witchking of angmar when aranarth was still a young man by the reckoning of his people the witchkings armies swept into arthedain and overran it fornost was taken but the king and his son escaped arvedui fled into the north but aranarth like most of his people escaped westwards across the river lhыn into lindon at aranarths urging cнrdan sent a ship into the north to recover his father but it never returned it was later learned that the ship had rescued arvedui but had been lost with him aboard in the icy northern seas so aranarth inherited the leadership of the scattered and diminished northern dъnedain but he took the title chieftain rather than king since his fathers realm was lost the dъnedain were to have their revenge soon after though with the arrival of the gondorian prince and general eдrnur the son and heir of eдrnil ii he sailed into lindon and then marched eastwards to rout the armies of angmar of aranarths activities during this campaign we know nothing but all available evidence suggests that he was in lindon when eдrnur arrived there and so it seems very likely that he marched with eдrnurs forces and saw the defeat of his ancient enemy with his own eyes aranarth served as chieftain of the dъnedain for years he was succeeded by his eldest son arahael arandor the kingsland of nъmenor the important central region of nъmenor around the islands capital at armenelos it was almost landlocked

the northkingdom son of eldacar grandson of valandil and greatgrandson of isildur himself though his reign spanned nearly a century we have no records of events that took place in that time he was succeeded as king by his son tarcil aranuir the third of the chieftains of the dъnedain the son of arahael and greatgrandson of arvedui lastking he was the direct ancestor of aragorn elessar through thirteen generations aranwлaranwe elf of gondolin father of voronwл the father of voronwл the mariner an elf of the house of fingolfin though not much is known about him for sure he seems to have been a nobleman of gondolin aranwion the surname of voronwл the surname of voronwл in gondolin aranwion is a patronymic meaning simply son of aranwл araphant arthedains penultimate king at the time araphant inherited his kingdom from his father araval arthedain was already in desperate straits the witchking of angmar had been beleaguering the northern lands for nearly five hundred years and arthedains resistance was beginning to fail the one hope that araphant had left was to renew the ancient bond with the southkingdom of gondor which was at that time suffering losses itself at the hands of the wainriders he forged an alliance with king ondoher of gondor and sealed it with the wedding of his son arvedui to ondohers daughter fнriel araphants foresight failed to bring help to his kingdom though since gondor itself was under sustained attack and could send no troops to his aid four years after the alliance was made ondoher fell in battle with the wainriders and the southkingdom was left kingless araphants heir arvedui made a claim to the kingship of gondor which would have reunited the two kingdoms but steward pelendur moved the gondorians to reject it araphant ruled arthedain for seventythree years he was succeeded by his son arvedui who would be the last of the northern kings araphor the ninth king of arthedain the son of arveleg i came early to the throne of arthedain while he was still in his youth the witchking of angmar launched a mighty invasion of his kingdom that came close to destroying it araphors father arveleg fought in the defence of the tower of amon sыl and his early death in that battle brought araphor to the throne records of the events of this time are incomplete but it seems that the witchking laid siege to the royal city of fornost the young araphor went to war with aid from cнrdan and the elves of lindon and succeeded in relieving the siege and driving back the forces of angmar after araphors defeat of angmar there is no record of further warfare during his long reign nonetheless he ruled a diminished and dwindling people the wars of his youth had seen the northern dъnedain come close to destruction rhudaur was now a tributary state to angmar and the dъnedain of cardolan were all but extinct araphor ruled arthedain for one hundred and eighty years and was succeeded by his son named for araphors heroic grandfather argeleb who ruled as argeleb ii arassuil the eleventh chieftain to lead the northern dъnedain the son and heir of arahad ii his time as chieftain saw great troubles grow in the northlands orcs from the misty mountains boldly invaded the western lands and were fought back by arassuils rangers and the household of elrond arassuil was succeeded as chieftain by his son arathorn i aratan the second son of isildur slain with his father and his brothers elendur and ciryon in the disaster of the gladden fields aratar the exalted or high ones of arda the eight valar of greatest power the highest of the powers among nine were of chief power and reverence but one is removed from their number and eight remain the aratar the high ones of arda the eight greatest of the valar manwл varda ulmo yavanna aulл mandos nienna and oromл though manwл was held to be the high king of arda all these eight were held in equal reverence and were said to possess a majesty that surpassed even the other valar it seems clear from the quotation above that the aratar were originally nine and included melkor but he was removed from this order after his rebellion arathorn iarathorn twelfth of the chieftains of the dъnedain the son of chieftain arassuil who led the northern dъnedain in his turn the greatgreatgrandfather of aragorn elessar he ruled in the north for sixtyfour years and died an untimely death he was succeeded by his son argonui arathorn iiarathorn the son of chieftain arador of the dъnedain and a descendant through many generations of isildur himself of arathorns early life little is known he first appears in annals at the age of fiftysix seeking the hand of gilraen as his wife gilraen at that time was just twentytwo years old and though the wedding was opposed by her father dнrhael she became arathorns wife the following year arathorns father arador was slain by trolls and arathorn took on the title of chieftain of the dъnedain gilraen bore him a son who was given the name aragorn aragorn would not know his father for long when he was just two years old arathorn went hunting orcs and was shot through the eye by an arrow after arathorns loss gilraen took their son to rivendell to be fostered by elrond arathorn ii served as chieftain of the dъnedain for just three years he was succeeded by his only son who would become chieftain aragorn ii and in time king elessar of the reunited kingdom of the dъnedain araval the thirteenth king of arthedain the son of arveleg ii was born into a time of war and strife at the time of his birth his fathers realm of arthedain had been under threat from the eastern land of angmar for more than four hundred years araval too played his part in the war with angmar the lord of the rings tells us nothing of his career but the history of middleearth hints that he was a diplomat and a warrior in alliance with the elves of lindon and imladris he won at least one important victory over the witchking of angmar we are also told that he attempted the recolonisation of cardolan though this was prevented by the evil beings the wights sent there by the witchking some two centuries before in the end though aravals bravery counted for little his grandson arvedui who was born in aravals lifetime and just thirteen years after his great victory was to see the final destruction of the kingdom of arthedain araval ruled arthedain for seventyeight years and was succeeded by his son araphant aravir the fourth chieftain of the dъnedain the son of aranuir who led the dъnedain of the north during the closing years of the watchful peace it was aravir it seems who devised the name aragorn he gave it to his son who succeeded him as chieftain aragorn i the aragorn of the the lord of the rings was his distant descendant aragorn ii of the line of isildur aravorn the ninth chieftain to rule the dъnedain since the loss of arthedain he led the rangers for sixtysix years and was succeeded by his son who became chieftain arahad ii aravorn

created through the music of the ainur to be a dwelling place for the children of ilъvatar originally a flat world the continents were surrounded by a mighty ocean ekkaia or the encircling sea and separated by belegaer called the great sea in the first age the regions to the north and west of middleearth were occupied by the country of beleriand but this was destroyed during the tumults of the war of wrath in the second age the isle of nъmenor was raised in the great sea for the edain to dwell on this island existed through most of the second age but was destroyed in the downfall of nъmenor as a result of the pride of the nъmenorean people in defying the ban of the valar and sailing to aman in the west after the downfall the shape of arda was changed and it was made bent aman was taken out of the world and could only be reached by the elves following the straight road that was granted to them as aman was taken away from arda new lands and continents were created from the late second

heart of the mountain of erebor it was like a globe with a thousand faces it shone like silver in the firelight like water in the sun like snow under the stars like rain upon the moon the great jewel discovered beneath the roots of erebor by thrбin i soon after the establishment of the dwarfkingdom there and prized by his descendants as the heart of the mountain the dwarves used all their skill to work the gem into a shimmering multifaceted jewel that not only shone by its own pale light but when light fell upon it the stone changed it into ten thousand sparks of white radiance shot with glints of the rainbow it was a heavy gem small enough for bilbo to hold in one hand yet not so small that he could close his own small hand around it in the centuries after its discovery the arkenstone became an heirloom of the kings of durins folk it was carried away into the grey mountains by thrбins son and in time brought back to the great hall of thrбin under the mountain by his descendant thrуr when smaug sacked erebor the arkenstone was lost to the dwarves of durins folk it lay among smaugs booty in the halls of erebor many years later when thorin led a band of dwarves to recover their ancient city their companion bilbo baggins discovered the arkenstone and kept it for himself later when the lakemen and woodelves came to demand their own shares of smaugs treasure from thorin bilbo delivered the arkenstone to them to bargain with in the ensuing battle of five armies though all enmities were forgotten and bard of dale placed the heart of the mountain on the breast of thorin in his tomb beneath erebor so nearly a thousand years after its discovery by thrбin i the arkenstone was buried once more in the depths beneath the lonely mountain armenelos the royal city of nъmenor

was at annъminas on lake nenuial elendil fell in the siege of baraddыr in ii and his eldest son isildur who would have taken the rulership was lost two years later as he journeyed back from the southlands with his three eldest sons these were also slain by orcs at the disaster of the gladden fields isildurs youngest son valandil however had not gone to the war and was kept safe in rivendell he was accounted the third king of arnor though isildur had never taken the throne the tenth and last king of arnor was eдrendur after his death in iii his three sons each made claims of succession

brother faramir had also ridden to war against the laws and customs of gondor and had himself been lost in the battle leaving gondor without a king a political crisis ensued in which arvedui the northern king of arthedain pressed a strong claim to the crown of gondor arveduis claim was rejected by steward pelendur and the council of gondor who instead gave the kingship to eдrnil the victorious captain who also belonged to the royal house eдrnils line was shortlived however and ended with the presumed loss of his son eдrnur in minas morgul the loss of artamir was a turning point in the history of middleearth had he not perished the line of kings would almost certainly have survived the coming crisis and lasted into the third millennium of the third age a thousand years later

the same age as his great descendant aragorn as is noted in the appendices to the lord of the rings by the standards of his own ancestors though this was an early death of all the northern kings

azanulbizar the valley below the eastgate of moria where in third age was fought the great battle that ended the war of the dwarves and orcs the deepshadowed valley of the dimrill dale the dwarves name for a valley between two arms of the misty mountains called nanduhirion by the elves and the dimrill dale by men azanulbizar was of vital importance in dwarvish history it was here that durin first looked on the waters of kheledzвram and was inspired to found khazaddыm it was here too millennia later that dwarves destroyed the armies of the orcs to bring an end to the war of the dwarves and orcs azog orc of moria slayer of thrуr and slain himself by dбin ironfoot in the battle of azanulbizar chieftain of the northern orcs an orcchieftain of moria who started the war of the dwarves and orcs when he slew thrуr he was himself slain by dбin ironfoot in the battle of azanulbizar and was succeeded by his son bolg of azogs origins we know little he was the chief of the orcs of moria and apparently the most important orc of the northern lands the average lifespan of an orc is unknown but it is conceivable that he was one of those sent to moria by sauron in about iii he had one son that we know of bolg who succeeded him after his death azog entered history in the year iii due to king thrуrs desire to revisit and perhaps refound the lost realm of khazaddыm in whose mighty ruins azog dwelt azog captured and slew thrуr and branded his hewn head with his own name azog when news of this reached thrуrs heir thrбin he was greatly angered and mustered a force of dwarves to seek revenge on azog so began the war of the dwarves and orcs the dwarves hunted azog and many battles were fought beneath the earth after nine years of war the climactic battle of azanulbizar was fought before the gates of moria itself king thrбin and his son thorin were in that battle near the end of the battle azog himself emerged and fought with thrбins cousin nбin and after breaking nбins neck his young son dбin though only years old dбin swept the head from azogs shoulders and helped to win the day the dwarves made no attempt to press their advantage though because dбin had glimpsed durins bane during his battle and warned the dwarves not to attempt to enter moria azogs underground dominions in the north though greatly reduced in the war fell to his son bolg who held them for more than years until he too met his end at the battle of five armies bag endbagend dwelling at hobbiton in the shire of bilbo baggins and later of frodo baggins and samwise gamgee the great smial beneath

later third age they attempted an invasion of gondor but were repulsed by cirion and eorl bald hill the hill of amon rыdh that rose up out of the plainlands south of the forest of brethil it was so named because its peak rose up in bare rock except for the growth of red seregon there the hill was originally a settlement of the pettydwarves and latterly home to tъrin and his outlaw band baldor the prideful son of brego and grandson of eorl the young he tried the paths of the dead though he had been told that the way was shut to him his bones were found long years afterward by aragorn and his company balin a dwarf of durins folk he accompanied gandalf thorin and bilbo on the quest of erebor and later led an illfated attempt to reclaim moria balrogbalrogs demon of might sindarin form of the name of the demons of fire that served morgoth dread servants of melkor the balrogs were spirits of fire seduced by melkor in the beginning of arda and who dwelt in his northern fortress of utumno during the first age the balrogs were the most feared of morgoths forces after the dragons in appearance the balrogs were manlike but fire streamed from them and they were swathed in dark shadows they carried whips of flame and induced great terror in friends and foes alike in the war of wrath morgoth was assailed by the forces of the valar most of the balrogs were destroyed in that war but some few escaped over the blue mountains and lay hid in middleearth durins bane the creature that drove the dwarves from moria was one of these the balrogs before the first age the balrogs were in origin maiar of the same order as sauron or gandalf melkor corrupted them to his service in the distant past of the world in the days of his splendour they were originally gathered by him in his ancient fastness of utumno during the time of the lamps of the valar when this fortress was destroyed by the valar at least some fled and lurked in the pits of angband balrogs in the first age when melkor and ungoliant escaped from valinor three ages later with the silmarils the balrogs were still to be found in the ruins of angband ungoliant entrapped melkor in her webs demanding the silmarils for herself but the balrogs issued from their hidingplace and rescued their lord the balrogs were apparently first encountered by the elves during the dagornuingiliath in the first year of the first age after the great victory of the noldor over morgoths orcs fлanor pressed on towards angband but the balrogs came against him he was mortally wounded by gothmog lord of balrogs though his sons beat off the demons of fire fлanor died of his wounds soon after and his spirit departed for the halls of mandos the appearance and nature of balrogs balrogs were spirits of fire their hearts were of fire we are told and they carried whips of flame they could however shroud themselves in darkness and shadow the balrog that gandalf fought in moria for example at first gave no hint of his fiery nature apart from the flames that issued from his nostrils ban of the valar the ban placed by the valar on the nъmenуreans that they should not sail so far west from their island that they could not see its coasts it was

ages other names the dark tower lugbъrz the first building of baraddыr the first building of baraddыr when sauron was first came to mordor took six hundred years to complete soon after tarminastir of nъmenor sent a fleet to middleearth and saurons forces were driven out of the western lands that they had roamed at will to that time baraddыr could not be approached by the nъmenуreans however and sauron was able to consolidate his power and extend it into the east in ii sauron left his dark tower to travel to nъmenor with the vast forces of arpharazфn he returned after the downfall of nъmenor in ii the last alliance besieged baraddыr in ii and the tower was taken and destroyed by the forces of elendil and gilgalad who both perished in the siege in ii though baraddыr was destroyed its foundations were left in place the second building of baraddыr for much of the third age saurons stronghold was not in mordor which was ruled in his stead by the nazgыl rather the dark lord dwelt in the south of mirkwood at dol guldur in iii the white council sent their forces to drive him from mirkwood and he withdrew to mordor once again there he began the rebuilding of the dark tower given the time taken in its first building this cannot have been fully complete at the time of the war of the ring in iii baraddыr was constructed as much through the personal power of sauron as through stone and mortar when the one ring was destroyed in orodruin this power was lost and the tower destroyed forever the appearance of baraddыr the most complete description we have of baraddыr is that given in the quote above we know then that it was black and constructed mainly of metal adamant usually refers to diamond but it is hard to imagine sauron adding diamond towers to his dark fortress in this context it probably has the more general meaning of hard unbreakable substance from the steel gate of the tower a causeway ran out into the plain of gorgoroth across a mighty bridge we also know that lava from mount doom was channeled back across that plain to baraddыr tolkien probably leaves details of the towers construction vague intentionally as it was hidden by a cloud of shadow and darkness at all times the only characters in the lord of the rings to actually see baraddыr were frodo and sam as they journeyed to mount doom rising black blacker and darker than the vast shades amid which it stood the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of the topmost tower of baraddыr the topmost tower of baraddыr seems to have been the place where sauron dwelt at least the window of the eye from which the

gondor barahirs father was hador a famously longlived man who ruled gondor as its steward for no less than one hundred and seventeen years according to the best sources we have barahir was born in the twelfth year of his fathers rule meaning that he succeeded hador at the age of one hundred and five given barahirs great age it is not surprising that his rule and that of his son dior were brief ones barahir held the office of steward during the waning years of the watchful peace both he and his son dior then enjoyed rules free of troubles barahirs grandson was denethor the son of his daughter rнan who was a young noble of just twenty at the time barahir became steward it was denethor who was destined to rule gondor at the time that war erupted on its borders more than sixty years after

was won came another seven long and bitter years of siege but sauron was finally defeated and the second age came to an end the battle of dagorlad was one of the greatest middleearth had ever seen the original name of the field where it took place if it had one is now forgotten that region was known afterwards simply as dagorlad battle plain battle of dale battle of the war of the ring in which saurons northern army defeated the men of dale and the dwarves of erebor saurons assault on dale and erebor a battle that took place during the war of the ring in dale and erebor brand of dale and

defeat the forces of sauron battle of five armies the great battle before the gates of erebor since the ending of the war of the dwarves and orcs and the dwarves ultimate victory at the battle of nanduhirion the orcs had nursed a hatred of that race in the year iii the year of bilbo baggins journey to the lonely mountain those events lay more than one hundred and forty years in the past travelling through the misty mountains bilbo thorin and their companions were captured by a colony of the orcs that infested those regions with gandalfs help they escaped but not before killing several of their captors including their leader the great goblin the loss of the great goblin at the hands of a band of dwarves inflamed the bitter memories of the orcs war with the dwarves under the command of bolg whose own father azog had been killed at nanduhirion all the armies of the orcs of the misty mountains and their allies the wolves and bats began to gather and plan their revenge oblivious to these events bilbo and the dwarves continued their journey eastward they achieved their quest to recover erebor but in doing so they earned the anger of thranduil and indirectly caused the destruction of laketown thranduils woodelves joined with the lakemen and they marched north to claim a share of smaugs treasure in recompense in response thorin called on his cousin dбin who set out with his own army from the iron hills so the scene was set for a confrontation between the woodelves and lakemen on the one side and the dwarves of thorin and dбin on the other already the first arrows had been shot when a dark cloud was seen coming out of the north the bats that heralded the orcarmies of bolg the elves men and dwarves quickly forgot their differences in the face of this new threat and battle was joined on the slopes of erebor and the valley beneath the battle was ferocious and as it raged it was joined by others eagles out of the misty mountains and even beorn himself in the shape of a monstrous bear by nightfall the orcs were defeated but not without great loss thorin himself was slain making a bold attack against the bodyguard of bolg and with him fell his young nephews fнli and kнli bolg was dead too crushed by beorn and the goblins of the northern mountains were scattered or destroyed battle of fornost the climactic battle amid the ruins of the northkingdom in the year iii the kingdom of arthedain was destroyed and with it the last realm of the northern dъnedain the armies of angmar and its allies overran the northern lands capturing the capital of the dъnedain at fornost and king arvedui fled into the icy north it seemed at that time that the witchkings victory was complete in the following year though the tide turned though too late to save the remnant of the northkingdom the ships of a great fleet sailed into the harbours at mithlond carrying a force of gondorian warriors sent north under the command of the great general eдrnur to that army joined the elves of lindon and the remnant of the dъnedain and they marched east to avenge the loss of arthedain they met the witchkings armies not at fornost itself but on the plains westward towards lake evendim aided by eдrnurs military skill and a force sent out of rivendell led by glorfindel the armies of the dъnedain and elves had utter victory and angmars armies were swept away the witchking himself fled into the dark of the falling night and glorfindel famously prophesied that he would not fall by the hand of man as later proved true in the war of the ring the battle of fornost shaped the future history of middleearth in many important ways its most significant effect could hardly have been guessed at the time it robbed gondor of its kings when the witchking fled south and came at last to mordor he did not forget his defeat at the hands of eдrnur many years later eдrnur became the king of gondor and the witchking challenged him to single combat he refused but seven years later

the battle of the mines of moria that took place below of the eastgate of moria in the winter of iii nine years before the battle the dwarfking thrуr had been murdered by azog the goblin in moria that event triggered a furious backlash from the dwarves who assembled their armies and in their quest for revenge against azog began the systematic destruction of the orcs of the misty mountains eventually the armies of the dwarves came up against the last stronghold of the orcs and hiding place of azog old moria itself the battle was fought in the valley of nanduhirion beneath morias gates the orcs were more numerous and held the higher ground at the head of the valley the dwarves under thrбin ii though were better equipped and were rallied late in the battle by the arrival of reinforcements commanded by thrбins cousin nбin there was great loss on both sides but eventually the dwarves had the victory dбin ironfoot just thirtytwo years old at the time slew azog on the steps

of the wainriders was met by the king of gondor himself ondoher with his two sons artamir and faramir the easterlings swept through gondors defence cutting down the king and his heirs and routing his army their victory complete and gondor defenceless before them the wainriders paused in north ithilien to celebrate their conquest unknown to the victorious wainriders their allies in the south had met with much less success beyond hope the gondorian captain eдrnil had led gondors southern army to victory over the haradrim destroying their army in south ithilien to the north of the poros then eдrnil turned north the feasting wainriders suddenly found their success reversed as eдrnil appeared with his southern army reinforced by fleeing members of ondohers defeated northern troops eдrnils army descended on the unprepared wainriders driving many of them into the swamplands of the dead marshes that eastern people for so long a dreaded enemy of gondor never challenged her again and the

middleearth on its northern coasts lay arvernien and the mouths of sirion where the exiles of gondolin dwelt in the last years of the first age and from where eдrendil set out on his voyage to the undying lands its eastern coastlands were dominated by the great unpeopled forests of taurimduinath far out in the bay lay the isle of balar where cнrdan the shipwright dwelt with his people after the loss of the havens of the falas there was great friendship between cнrdan and the exiles at the mouths of sirion and in the late first age the bay must have seen much traffic between the isle and the

the slopes of which stood the villages of bree itself and staddle breehobbits the hobbits native to bree and the lands around their interaction with men made them more open to the outside world than their parochial cousins in the shire bree itself was a very ancient township of men the first hobbits came there from the east in about the year of the third age making bree the only place in the world where hobbits and men lived together side by side most of the hobbits of the breeland lived in staddle a village on the southeastern slopes of the breehill but some also dwelt in bree itself living on the hill above the houses of men it was three hundred years after hobbits first arrived in bree that two fallohides marcho and blanco led a group of colonists westward to found the shire the breehobbits therefore tended to look down somewhat on their cousins in the shire referring to them as colonists and outsiders the hobbits of bree claimed to have originated most hobbit customs and certainly it was thought that they were the ones who first discovered the properties of pipeweed at the end of the third age the breehobbits still occasionally travelled west to the shire but they rarely ventured further than buckland or the eastfarthing those parts of the shire that were closest to their home in the lord of the rings i at the sign of the prancing pony tolkien gives us a list of the more prominent hobbit families living in the breeland at the time of the war of the ring banks brockhouse longholes mugwort sandheaver tunnelly and underhill there were also hobbits by the name

rivendell and joined the mitheithel to form the river gwathlу or greyflood bucca of the marishbucca first of the shirethains the end of the second millennium of the third age was a time of crisis for the hobbits of the shire the northern lands of middleearth were aflame with war the armies of angmar of arthedain of cardolan rhudaur and latterly gondor marched across the lands that had been the northern realm of arnor most of the shirehobbits went into hiding though some few marched to the service of arthedain within whose borders the shire lay but they never returned at last peace returned the kingdoms of the dъnedain fell one by one and then the victorious witchking of angmar was himself defeated by a revenging army of gondor the hobbits returned to their old lives but the loss of arvedui the last king of arthedain left them leaderless after four years had passed since the end of the great wars the hobbits decided to take a leader for themselves they chose one bucca of the marish who was granted the title thain of the shire and led the shirehobbits to peace and prosperity no more is known of buccas life but his legacy remained until the time of the war of the ring and beyond at that time more than twelve hundred years after his thainship the masters of buckland still proudly claimed descent from bucca the first thain buck hill a hill overlooking the village of bucklebury in buckland deeply burrowed with the smials that made up brandy hall the ancestral home of the brandybuck family buckland the eastmarch of the shire origin and history seven hundred and forty years after the founding of the shire gorhendad oldbuck crossed the river brandywine from the eastfarthing and started the building of brandy hall in buck hill in a land hitherto unpopulated by hobbits as gorhendads family grew the hall also expanded and soon there was a flourishing community in the land between the river and the old forest from that time buckland was ruled by the brandybucks as gorhendad renamed his family who were given the title masters of buckland the village of bucklebury lying close by buck hill was considered bucklands chief village but the expanding population meant that many other villages soon grew up in the region the largest of which were newbury crickhollow and standelf the growing power of the master of buckland gained respect from those close by in the eastfarthing too the lands of the marish between stock and rushey also acknowledged themselves under the sway of buck hall the bucklanders soon found themselves threatened by the strange trees of the forest and so built a vast hedge the high hay stretching twenty miles along the eastern border of their land this was not the only danger to threaten buckland in iii the year of the fell winter the brandywine froze and buckland was invaded by white wolves buckland was also the childhood home of frodo baggins who returned here on his journey to rivendell in iii he bought a house in crickhollow and claimed that he would be living there but instead entered the old forest through the old hay gate and left the eastmarch of the shire culture although similar in many ways to other hobbits the bucklanders did have certain peculiarities due no doubt in part to the fallohidish blood of the brandybucks the hobbits of buckland were somewhat more adventurous than their cousins in the shire they enjoyed boating an activity frowned upon by shirehobbits and some of them could even swim when the breefolk ventured to the shire buckland was their usual destination and so was rather more cosmopolitan then the rest of the land living under constant danger from the old forest the bucklanders were hardier and more suspicious than the usual shirehobbit they were organised to deal with danger and they kept their doors locked at night which was unusual in the shire buckland gate the north gate of the bucklanders leaving the shire across the brandywine bridge a traveller would come to the northern end of the high hay where it ran beside to the road to meet the river brandywine in the hedge at this point was a guarded gate that led to buckland the eastmarch of the shire bucklanders the inhabitants of buckland on the eastern borders of the shire the bucklanders acknowledged the master of buckland as their leader the brandybucks descendants of gorhendad oldbuck who founded buckland were considered the most important family of the bucklanders the brandybucks had a strong fallohidish strain in their blood it is said and this made them more adventurous than many of their more conservative neighbours in the shire they did not share the shirehobbits fear of water for example and the bucklanders boats where often seen on the brandywine river that bordered their land on the eastern border of buckland lay the dangerous old forest and the constant threat of the dark trees made the bucklanders somewhat hardier than typical hobbits bucklebury the chief

large riverisland in the anduin to the east of the land of anуrien it was held in defence against mordor by gondor to prevent crossings of the great river though these defences were breached during the war of the ring the island itself was long and narrow a little over ten miles in length at its northern end sharp rocks split the waters of the anduin in a bubbling foam that gave the island its name cair andros was covered with trees for much of its length strategically the island was of immense importance apart from the bridge at osgiliath it was the only practical means for an army from the east to cross the anduin into gondors heartlands the gondorians took this risk seriously amon dоn the first of the beaconhills was set up originally to warn the citizens of minas tirith if cair andros was ever breached gondor took steps to fortify the island too but the history of these fortifications is difficult to establish we know that it was manned at the time of king ondohers fall in iii but whatever defences were in place at that time were apparently abandoned since denethors greatgrandfather tъrin ii found it necessary to fortify the island again in about the year iii the gondorian defences fell on march iii on the same day that the witchking rode from minas morgul with the armies that would besiege minas tirith sauron released a smaller force from the morannon they overwhelmed the defenders of cair andros and used the island to cross into anуrien it was this northern force that blocked the eastward progress of the rohirrim as they rode to gondors aid though after the battle of the pelennor the rohirrim chased them down and pushed them back out of anуrien they retreated to cair andros and apparently held the island for some days in his march on mordor aragorn released a small group of soldiers from his main army to retake the island if necessary and hold it they must have succeeded since the last we hear of the island of cair andros its moorings

huan the wolfhound slain by dior in menegroth celegorm the fair was the third of the seven sons of fлanor the most ambitious of the seven he followed the oath of his father with the greatest ardour and this led him to his destruction in valinor celegorm became a great hunter and had the friendship of oromл often hunting with the vala or visiting his house from oromл celegorm gained great knowledge of birds and beasts and he learned to understand their tongues and he gained also another gift huan the great hound he also had great friendship with his cousin aredhel the daughter of fingolfin after the darkening of valinor he stood in the court of tirion with his father and his six brothers and swore to the oath of fлanor with that he marched with the noldor from valinor and returned to middleearth as the moon rose for the first time the faithful hound huan accompanied celegorm into exile early years in beleriand i i in the first assault of the noldor on the orcs the dagornuingiliath celegorm found himself in the hills around eithel sirion in the north of the ered wethrin receiving news of an orchost coming north from the falas he ambushed them and drove them into the fen of serech after the battle in which his father fлanor died he journeyed to the land of himlad in the eastern regions of beleriand and there took up his abode with his younger brother curufin celegorm and curufin together claimed the land between the rivers aros and celon and they fortified the pass of aglon in the north against the forces of morgoth during this time the two were close in friendship with their brother caranthir who dwelt across the valley of the river gelion in the land of thargelion and often went hunting with him the land of himlad was held for more than years by celegorm and his brother but in the dagor bragollach morgoths armies broke the defence of the pass of aglon and overran celegorms lands with his brother curufin he was forced to flee and they journeyed south and west until they came to finrods halls in nargothrond time in nargothrond i c i finrod received his cousins warmly and for a time celegorm and curufin dwelt happily in nargothrond hunting the orcs and wolves that dared to cross the guarded plain they were at that time mighty lords and their power and influence in finrods domain grew before many years had passed though beren came out of doriath seeking finrods help in his quest for the silmaril the oath of fлanor bound celegorm to defy any that sought a silmaril but finrod was also bound by an oath to berens father barahir to lend aid in the quest and so he departed from nargothrond leaving it in the keeping of his brother orodreth celegorm and curufin exercised their influence after the departure of finrod however and during this time they were effectively the rulers of nargothrond while out hunting on the guarded plain they discovered lъthien who having escaped from her father in doriath was seeking for beren celegorm saw that to be wedded to the daughter of one of the greatest kings in beleriand would be a great source of power and so he tricked lъthien into returning to nargothrond with him once there he imprisoned her and sent false messages to thingol pursuing his suit from lъthien they learned that beren and finrod had been captured by sauron and imprisoned in his fortress at tolingaurhoth they made no attempt to rescue them believing that the death of finrod would further their own power in nargothrond celegorms hound huan disobeyed his master and help lъthien to escape from the brothers leading here away into the north after beren though he later returned to celegorm their trust was diminished while he was away from nargothrond huan had aided in the defeat of sauron in the north and the destruction of tolingaurhoth many prisoners of sauron who were released when his tower was destroyed returned to nargothrond and reported the fate of finrod so the lies that celegorm and curufin had told in pursuance of power were exposed and the people turned back to their rightful king orodreth celegorm and curufin were exiled from nargothrond but their deeds were repudiated by their people who had come with them from himlad and so they journeyed friendless in beleriand return to the northern lands c i c i after their expulsion from nargothrond the brothers journeyed to the north and east seeking again the lands where they had once ruled and especially himring where their elder brother maedhros was still lord as they travelled beside the eaves of brethil they discovered beren and lъthien returning from the north and attacked them in defence of lъthien huan the hound deserted celegorm and fought against him curufin lost his horse in that fight and the brothers were forced to ride away eastwards together on celegorms steed journeying on through dimbar and nan dungortheb they came at last to the lands of maedhros celegorm was not to abide there long for only a few years after their arrival maedhros united the elves of beleriand and the great battle known as the nirnaeth arnoediad took place celegorm marched into the north with his brothers and was wounded in the battle but uldor the accursed betrayed the elves and turned against them and so the host of maedhros was broken and scattered celegorm fled with his brothers to the lands below mount dolmed in the far east of beleriand there they dwelt a broken and wandering people for some thirty years in that time beren and lъthien dwelt in the far south on the island of tol galen in the river adurant and with them was the silmaril that they had recovered from morgoths crown while their oath bound the brothers to recover the jewel none dared assail that hallowed island and so they waited eventually beren and lъthien passed away and the silmaril was taken to dior thingols heir in doriath now the sons of fлanor sent demands to dior for the return of the jewel but dior disregarded them so the brothers formed an army and assaulted the halls of menegroth and there celegorm was slain by dior though dior also perished as did curufin and caranthir celepharn the fourth king of arthedain the son of mallor and greatgrandson of amlaith of fornost the founder of arthedain he ruled arthedain early in the second millennium of the third age at a time when the southkingdom of gondor was at the height of its power the first hobbits had been seen in eriador in the reign of celepharns grandfather beleg and celepharn might even have encountered them himself as a young man

beneath mindolluin a name given at least at the time of the war of the ring to minas tirith gondors great fortified city that stood at the eastern extent of the white mountains in fact at the time of the countrys founding gondors chief city had been osgiliath some miles east and north of minas tirith but this ancient city did not survive through the third age king tarondor abandoned osgiliath for

frуr were slain at the gates of their halls by a colddrake the attacks of these fearsome creatures persuaded to dwarves to migrate eastwards from the grey mountains and it was soon afterwards that their realms in the iron hills and at erebor were established of the history of the colddrakes after this period we are given no hint four hundred years later at the time of bilbo baggins journey to erebor they seem to have left the grey mountains it is possible that the orcs who colonised the mountains after the departure of the dwarves drove them back into the cold wastes to the north but we can do no more than speculate on their ultimate fate combe a village of the breeland a village that lay in a deep valley on the eastern side of the breehill between archet to the north and staddle to

ring the warcouncil of the wise the council held on october iii at rivendell where the history of the ring was discussed and its fate debated present at the council were representatives of all the free peoples of middleearth the council of elrond aragorn bilbo baggins boromir elrond halfelven erestor and other counsellors of elrond frodo baggins galdor of the havens gandalf gimli glуin glorfindel legolas after much debate four main proposals were put forward erestor elronds chief counsellor suggested taking the ring back westward to tom bombadil in the hope that he could withhold it from sauron glorfindel suggested something similar carrying the ring west to the great sea and casting it in both of these courses were thought too dangerous to attempt and rejected for other reasons besides boromir of gondor had a bolder proposal to take the ring and wield it against its maker the dangers of doing this were all too clear and none of those present who might have taken up the ring would agree to do so the final conclusion of the council was to follow the course devised by elrond himself to carry the ring into mordor and cast it into mount doom by no means all the council agreed with this course erestor in particular saw little hope of succeeding that is the path of despair he said of folly i would say if the long wisdom of elrond did not forbid me nonetheless elronds plan was accepted as the only course possible as gandalf said it is wisdom to recognise necessity when all other courses have been weighed frodo the ringbearer took on the task and a company for him was assembled from five others of those present at the council to which were added the hobbits samwise gamgee meriadoc brandybuck and peregrin took this was the company or fellowship of the ring that set out for rivendell on the journey that erestor had called the path of despair council of gondor advisors to the ruler of the southkingdom in his account of arveduis claim on gondors throne tolkien once mentions a body known as the council of gondor who act as the legal authority of gondor after the loss of ondoher left it kingless except for the fact that it acted under the control of steward pelendur we are told almost nothing of this council or its normal function it was traditional among the men of nъmenor for the king to maintain a council of advisers and it is not unreasonable to presume that their descendants in gondor followed a similar system the nъmenуrean council of the sceptre was composed of nobles from each of the main regions of nъmenor together with the kings heir it is fair to assume then that gondors council was made up from representatives of each of the southkingdoms separate lands probably in addition to the kings heir and apparently the steward as well council of the sceptre advisors to the king of nъmenor the nobles and lords of nъmenor together with the kings heir who gathered to advise the king on weighty matters of state council of the wise also

title of eцl of nan elmoth when melian set her girdle around the land of doriath thingols kinsman eцl left that land and dwelt instead in the forest of nan elmoth living under the dark shadows of that ancient forest and preferring the night to the day he came to be widely known as the dark elf eцls epithet was no doubt influenced by the fact that the sindarin elves to whom he belonged were of the moriquendi the dark elves who had never seen the light of the two trees of valinor dark elvesdark elf in the language of aman all elves that did not cross the great sea were dark elves and the term is sometimes used thus when caranthir called thingol a dark elf it was intended opprobriously and was especially so since thingol had been to aman and was not accounted among the moriquendi but in the period of the exile of the noldor it was often used of the elves of middleearth other than the noldor and the sindar and is then virtually equivalent to avari different again is the title dark elf of the sindarin elf eцl but in the quenta silmarillion turgon no doubt meant that eцl was of the moriquendi the moriquendi those elves who refused the summons of the valar to valinor or fell away on the great journey and never saw the light of the two trees the dark elves are often equated with the avari who refused the summons of the valar and remained in the darkness of middleearth this is not strictly correct dark elves also include those such as the nandor and sindar who started the great journey to valinor but never came there dark land saurons domain of mordor an occasional name used for saurons fortified country of mordor in fact dark land is a possible interpretation of the name mordor though the alternative black land is used much more frequently on at least one early map of arda a great southern continent appears labelled dark land this region is not otherwise mentioned and is unrelated to the dark land mentioned in the lord of the rings dark lands term for middleearth in nъmenor dark lord the term is used of morgoth and of sauron the title given to the two great ainur who ruled the forces of darkness in middleearth morgoth and sauron the first dark lord morgoth morgoth descended into arda at its beginning and battled with the valar for ages uncounted before the awakening of elves and men from his fortress at utumno in the north of the world the valar defeated him and imprisoned him for three ages but on his release he returned to angband north of beleriand during the first age the noldor made hopeless war upon him for the return of the silmarils but at last the valar came to their aid and overthrew morgoth banishing him forever from the world the second dark lord sauron sauron was the ancient lieutenant of morgoth and after the first dark lords defeat he took on his mantle and became a dark lord himself during the early second age taking the land of mordor to dwell in he corrupted the nъmenуreans though he was defeated at the end of the second age and his dark tower of baraddыr was thrown down he rose again during the third age and was finally defeated with the destruction of the one ring in iii dark mountains an old name for the mountains of mirkwood the original name for the range of deeply forested hills that ran through the northern part of greenwood the great whose name is a translation of the elvish emyn duir when the shadow of dol guldur fell on the forest it was renamed mirkwood and this range of high hills came to be called the mountains of mirkwood dark plague the plague that robbed gondor of its king the dreadful plague that swept through middleearth in the middle years of the third age its effects were worst in gondor and the southern lands but it affected even those who lived in the far north dark power a common epithet used especially in gondor to describe sauron dark throne the throne of morgoth in angband beneath which beren hid during the quest of the silmaril dark tower a name for saurons fortress of baraddыr in the black land of mordor dark years the years of the dominion of sauron in the second age a term for the long years of hardship of the men of middleearth during the second age while nъmenor flourished the men of middleearth endured trouble and war and many of them turned to the worship of sauron in this time the dark years ended with the coming of elendil and his sons near the end of the second age darkening of valinor the destruction of the two trees of valinor by morgoth and ungoliant shortly before the beginning of the first age dead marshes wide stagnant marshes southeast of emyn muil in which the slain of the battle of dagorlad were seen the fetid swamplands that lay between the emyn muil and the northern marches of mordor the site at the end of the second

as the laiquendi or greenelves denethor i denethor the steward who saw the end of the watchful peace denethor i was the tenth steward to rule gondor in whose time the realm suffered perhaps the most calamitous upheaval in its history when denethor succeeded his childless uncle dior in iii gondor had known peace for many generations nearly four hundred years earlier during the stewardship of denethors noble ancestor mardil gandalf had gone to dol guldur and forced sauron to withdraw into the east of middleearth though it was known that the nazgыl still infested minas morgul they offered no threat to the southkingdom and denethor had every reason to hope that this time of watchful peace would continue in his time he was wrong iii the twentyfifth of denethors rule would be last year to see gondor fully at peace for nearly six centuries in that year sauron gave up his exile and returned to his fortress of dol guldur in mirkwood just a few years later it was seen that the nazgыl had not been idle in the years of the peace they unleashed a force of hideous soldierorcs on gondor of the kind that was then unknown but would become known as the urukhai they ravaged ithilien and took osgiliath but denethors heir boromir fought them back and recovered gondors holdings east of the river though he was dreadfully wounded these were the first skirmishes in a conflict that would not truly end until the time of the war of the ring denethor i ruled as steward for fortytwo years and was succeeded by his son boromir denethor ii denethor twentysixth and last ruling steward of gondor the second of the name lord of minas tirith at the time of the war of the ring father of boromir and faramir lord of minas tirith born during the stewardship of his grandfather turgon denethor was a gondorian noble who would see some of the most turbulent times in his countrys long history culminating in the war of the ring itself while still a youth of twentyone he saw sauron reemerge as the dark lord of mordor and start building his power on gondors eastern borders just a few short years later mount doom burst into fire once again in gondors time of need a new hero arose and for a time steward ecthelion ii was served by the mysterious captain thorongil nearly twenty years passed and beneath the looming threat of mordor denethor wedded finduilas the daughter of adrahil of dol amroth together they had two sons boromir and faramir soon after denethors father ecthelion died and denethor succeeded to become steward denethor ii just four years after denethor succeeded to the stewardship finduilas died at a young age for one of her line for the next thirty years denethor ruled as a grim and serious steward and it later became known that for at least some of this time he had made use of a palantнr to gain knowledge through which the malice of sauron had begun to sap his will in the end the death of his elder son boromir and the imagined loss of his younger son faramir sent him mad he burned himself to death with his palantнr in his hands denethor ii ruled as steward for thirtyfive years and was succeeded by his younger son faramir dйordeor seventh king of rohan a direct descendant of eorl the young who inherited the kingship of rohan from his father goldwine dйors greatgreatgrandfather aldor the old had hunted out the dunlendings that had harried the eastern borders of rohan and his successors frйa frйawine and goldwine had enjoyed peaceful reigns because of their ancestors enterprises in dйors time this peace came to an end it was later discovered that the dunlendings had secretly been moving back into the northwestern uplands of rohan throughout the reigns of dйors predecessors by dйors own time a powerful dunlendish force had been established and dйor was forced to ride northward from edoras ultimately to defeat his enemies the victory was a bitter one though for he discovered that the dunlendings had also captured the ring of isengard which dйor had no possible means of recapturing so dйors reign saw the beginning of a danger from the north that would reach a crisis nearly fifty years later when the dunlendings were to come close to destroying rohan alogether dйors turbulent reign lasted nineteen years he was succeeded as king by his son gram dйorwinedeorwine a brave knight of rohan an important knight of the rohirrim he had the rank of chief of the kings knights he fell with six of his men at the battle of the pelennor fields before the gates of minas tirith dernhelm йowyn as a rider of the rohirrim the alias taken by йowyn

gondor diors grandfather hador was the last truly longlived of the stewards and ruled gondor for one hundred and seventeen years this meant that his son barahir and his grandson dior both came late to the stewardship and ruled for only a brief time dior was the last steward to enjoy an untroubled rule as his heir denethor would see the breaking of the watchful peace and the beginning of centuries of warfare dior is remarkable as the only recorded ruling steward to leave no direct heir in volume xii of the history of middleearth were told that he had no children of his own and was succeeded therefore by the son of his sister rнan this seems to be borne out by the appendices to the lord of the rings which state that gondors stewardship became hereditary as a kingship from father to son or

of dwarves the eldest of the seven fathers of the dwarves the first of that race to be created by the vala aulл he was set to sleep under the mountains of middleearth until after the awakening of the elves when he woke he journeyed in the wilds until he came upon the mirrormere the lake that the dwarves call kheledzвram looking upon mysterious stars reflected in its surface he took this as a sign and there founded a great city tunnelled in the heart of the misty mountains this was khazaddыm later called moria durin lived to a great age even by the measure of the dwarves but though he was called the deathless he was not immortal he died some time before the end of the first age but he founded the line of the kings of durins folk that extended down through the history of middleearth durin iiidurin king of durins folk in khazaddыm at the time of saurons assault on eregion a king of khazaddыm during the second age the king of durins folk at the height of their friendship with the elves of eregion according to legend he was given a ring of power the ring that would later be known as the ring of thrуr by celebrimbor himself durin vidurin doomed king of khazaddыm a descendant of durin the deathless durin vi was the king of durins folk when the balrog was awoken in khazaddыm the balrogs name durins bane comes from this king who was one of the first to be slain by it durin viidurin the last descendant of durin to bear his name the last of the seven durins appears once in appendix a to the lord of the rings as an undated descendant of thorin iii as such we know almost nothing of him apart from the bare fact of his existence in volume of the history of middleearth though we have access to the proofs of appendix a and a little more of durins life is revealed his birth it seems was prophesied at the battle of five armies and he was born several centuries later he led durins folk back to recolonise khazaddыm during the fourth age where they remained until the world grew old and the dwarves failed and the days of durins race were ended the status of this story is unclear though it never appeared in the lord of the rings and may have been rejected by tolkien after its composition durins banebane of durin the balrog of moria moria moria wonder of the northern world too deep we delved there and woke the nameless fear when the valar came against morgoth at the end of the first age most of his servants were destroyed but some few fled into the world and hid themselves in dark places one such was a balrog probably the last of its kind in middleearth that escaped into the east from the ruin of angband and buried itself in the roots of the misty mountains beneath khazaddыm for more than five millennia the balrog slept in its deep hiding place it remained undisturbed as the second age passed and long into the third at last the mithrilminers of king durin vi stumbled upon it and it awoke from its long sleep durin was slain by the creature and his son nбin i became king it seems that under nбin the dwarves attempted to make a stand against the balrog but it was a power too great for them to control for a year they attempted to hold their mansions against it but at last nбin and many of his subjects were slain and the survivors fled from their ancient halls at this time too many of the silvan elves of lуrien left their land and escaped into the south for some five hundred years moria was deserted but for the balrog in around the year though sauron began to put his plans for war into effect and as part of these he sent orcs and trolls to infest the misty mountains and bar the passes from eriador into rhovanion some of these creatures came to moria we are not told whether sauron was aware of the balrogs existence until then certainly the exiled dwarves had not recognised what kind of creature durins bane was it is clear though that the balrog acknowledged saurons authority if only because it allowed his creatures to remain in moria in addition the messenger of sauron who came to dбin ii ironfoot offered to return moria to the dwarves which would have been impossible if the balrog was not under saurons power despite an illfated attempt to recolonise moria by balin in iii durins bane remained a dark and brooding menace in the ancient kingdom of the dwarves whose nature was hidden to the outside world in january iii the company of the ring travelled through moria on the quest of mount doom in gandalf the balrog finally encountered a being of the same order and power as itself as the two maiar faced each other on the bridge of khazaddыm gandalf broke the bridge and the balrog fell into the depths but gandalf too was drawn into the abyss both survived the fall and gandalf pursued the balrog for eight days through the deepest caverns beneath moria at last they came to the endless stair and climbed the steps that led to the peak of zirakzigil there durins bane fought its last battle for two days and nights the balrog battled with gandalf but at last it was cast from the peak and broke the mountainside as it plunged to its doom durins day a dwarvish festival of the new year the first day of the dwarves year was calculated according to the last new moon of autumn not every dwarves new year was a durins day though thorin says we still call it durins day when the last moon of autumn and the sun are in the sky together only a dwarvish new year where this occurs is technically a durins day durins folk the clan of the longbeards the dwarves descended from durin the deathless eldest of the seven fathers of the dwarves almost all of the dwarves that appear in tolkiens works are of this folk durins tower the tower that stood on the peak of celebdil above khazaddыm where gandalf defeated durins bane durthang a castle of mordor that stood in the northern ephel dъath on the slopes above the isenmouthe dwalin a dwarf descended from the royal line of durins folk the son of fundin and brother to balin whom he accompanied on the quest of erebor dwarfroad dwarfroad translating meninaugrim a name of the old forest road the long eastwest road beneath the trees of mirkwood the old road that followed a straight path through the forest of mirkwood its history is unclear but it seems to have been built by the dwarves as a route between their cities and colonies on either side of the forest dwarfroad dwarfroad road leading down into beleriand from the cities of nogrod and belegost and crossing gelion at the ford of sarn athrad the dwarves road westward from the blue mountains the road built by the dwarves of the blue mountains as a trade route to the elves of beleriand it ran westward along the river ascar for many miles and entered east beleriand where it crossed the gelion at the ford called sarn athrad dwarftongue the secret language of the dwarves the language of the dwarves more commonly referred to as dwarvish or by the dwarves own name for the tongue khuzdul the details of the language remained largely unknown to outsiders because the dwarves held knowledge of their tongue as one of their races deepest secrets the vocabulary and grammar of the language are an almost complete mystery with a very few exceptions found in placenames inscriptions and in the famous dwarvish war cry baruk khazвd khazвd aimкnu dwarrowdelf delving of the dwarves translation of khazaddыm the mannish name for khazaddыm dwarfdelving the name in the common speech for the mansions of khazaddыm dwarrowdelf is an anglicisation the real westron name was phurunargian dwarvesdwarf the children of aulл baruk khazвd khazвd aimкnu unlike elves and men the dwarves are not children of ilъvatar they were created by aulл the smith though ilъvatar granted them life aulл made seven fathers of the dwarves and these slept through many ages until after the awakening of the elves almost all the dwarves that appear in tolkiens works were descended from the eldest of the seven fathers durin the deathless like aulл their maker the dwarves delighted in smithcraft and stoneworking they mined and worked metals throughout the mountains of middleearth the dwarves kept themselves apart from the other races their language khuzdul was a closely guarded secret and they told their true names to none but themselves origins of the dwarves the first dwarves were made long ages ago by aulл the smith he had dimly perceived the coming children of ilъvatar and desired to make children of his own to teach his many skills and arts aulлs work was doomed though because he did not have the power to grant independent life to his creations that power belonged to ilъvatar alone when the dwarves were completed though the voice of ilъvatar spoke to aulл and agreed to grant them true life and include them in his plan for arda ilъvatar would not allow the dwarves to awaken though until after the firstborn and so aulл set them to sleep far apart from one another deep underground until the time came for their awakening the history of the dwarves before the first age ilъvatar promised aulл that he would awaken the fathers of the dwarves when the time comes we must assume that he did so shortly after the awakening of the elves at cuiviйnen it seems that not long passed after their awakening before durin the deathless eldest of the fathers founded khazaddыm in the misty mountains certainly it was well established as their chief citadel by the time the first dwarves crossed the blue mountains into beleriand this event is dated only as during the second age of the captivity of melkor which would place it between and years before the beginning of the first age the dwarves had no settlement in beleriand itself but they built two mighty citadels in the blue mountains gabilgathol to the north and tumunzahar to the south these fortresscities are better known by the elvish versions of their names belegost and nogrod the dwarves also laid the long road that ran westwards out of the blue mountains and along the course of the river ascar crossing into east beleriand at sarn athrad the dwarves in beleriand for the elves dwelling beleriand the first appearance of the dwarves in the blue mountains was a startling revelation until that time the elves had thought themselves the only speaking peoples in the world throughout the long ages the elves and dwarves developed a mutual respect which if not quite friendship was far from enmity after their return to middleearth at the beginning of the first age the noldor became closest in friendship with the dwarves both peoples revered aulл and both had a love of craft and making that made them natural allies of all the elves of beleriand though it was not a noldo but a sindarin elf who became most trusted and respected by the dwarves this was eцl the dark elf of nan elmoth who travelled often to the dwarfcities in the blue mountains and who took also his son maeglin during his youth the nature of the dwarves aulл made the dwarves at a time when the world outside aman still lay under the dominion of melkor and so he made them sturdy and hard to survive the dangers and hardships of that time in nature the typical dwarf is stubborn and secretive though they make loyal and good friends they are also a proud and stern race they do not suffer grievance or insult and their enmity is longlasting they are said though to be quick to learn new skills probably the best known aspect of the dwarvish character though is their strong instinctive skills in the working of metal and stone no doubt derived from aulл their maker the vala whose province these things were in ancient times they were said to have preferred working with copper and iron though in later days they wrought gold and silver and the mithril they found in the mines of khazaddыm of all the materials they worked with they most revered and praised gemstones dwarvish mortality though they live much longer than men dwarves are mortal creatures what happens after their death though is a mystery the elves have said that the dwarves return to the stone from which they were made but the dwarves have a different belief according to dwarvish tradition they are gathered by mahal in a part of the halls of mandos set aside for them after the end of the world and the last battle they say they will aid aulл in the rebuilding of arda dwarves of belegost khazвd of gabilgathol the race of dwarves whose halls were at belegost the northernmost of the two great dwarfcities that stood in the blue mountains during the first age they had generally better relations with the elves than their neighbours in nogrod and as well as being responsible for the building of menegroth they fought bravely beside elves and men during the nirnaeth arnoediad dwarves of erebor the people of the kingdom under the mountain the dwarves who dwelt in the halls of erebor beneath the lonely mountain they were dispossessed of their immense wealth by smaug who sacked their kingdom but they famously reclaimed their inheritance many years later under the leadership of thorin oakenshield dwarves of khazaddыm durins folk in their ancient home the dwarves of durins folk who mined and worked mithril for long ages in the halls of khazaddыm and who had the friendship of the elves of eregion during the second age dwarves of moria

of ilъvatar the first elves awoke by cuiviйnen the water of awakening in the far east of middleearth long ages before the rising of the sun or moon unlike men the elves were not subject to illness or death and at the time of the lord of the rings there were still at least two elves in aman who had awoken by cuiviйnen in the first days ingwл lord of the vanyar and olwл brother of king elu thingol origins and early history in the far eastern land of cuiviйnen on the shores of the inland sea of helcar and beneath the mountains of the orocarni the elves awoke under the starlight of the years of the trees the valar at first knew nothing of their coming but they were soon discovered by the spies of melkor who sent his creatures to watch them and harrass them how long they existed in this perilous and unprotected state is not known but the legends of those times of the hunter and of a dark rider were preserved in valinor by the eldar that came there it is known that many of the ancient elves were captured by melkor and imprisoned in utumno it is generally thought that these hapless beings were the origins of the race of orcs the valar discovered that the elves had awoken when oromл hunting in the lands of middleearth heard their singing voices he named them eldar the people of the stars but the elves own name for their kind was quendi those who speak with voices because of the horrors of melkor many of the elves were at first suspicious of the vala but he remained with them and protected them for a time concerned for the safety of the elves in middleearth which was at that time under the control of melkor the valar left valinor and made war against the dark lord this was the battle of the powers which saw melkor taken as captive back to valinor the great journey after the defeat of melkor the valar debated the fate of the elves whether they should be left to dwell in middleearth or brought to valinor to be kept under the direct protection of the valar it was decided to bring them to the land of the valar and oromл was sent back to cuiviйnen to summon them when he returned though he found that the elves feared the valar and were reluctant to make the journey three ambassadors were chosen ingwл finwл and elwл to travel to aman with oromл and help the elves decide on their course these three were filled with awe by what they saw there and by the light of the two trees and counselled their people to follow the summons the followers of ingwл and most of the peoples of finwл and elwл agreed and set out on the great journey westwards across the wide lands of middleearth these were the peoples later known as the three kindreds the vanyar the noldor and the teleri not all the elves obeyed the summons those who refused are known as avari the unwilling oromл led the peoples of the three kindreds out of the east of middleearth the vanyar were the least numerous and the most eager to reach aman and they came first on the journey followed by the noldor of finwл the teleri led by elwл and his brother olwл were the greatest host and many were uncertain and doubtful not a few of these people left the journey and remained in middleearth the most notable of those who turned from the journey were the nandor who were led away down the vales of anduin by lenwл at last the vanyar and the noldor reached the shores of the great sea in the regions between the bay of balar and the firth of drengist ulmo brought a great island to the shores and on it transported the elves to aman the teleri were the hindcomers though and arrived in beleriand too late to embark on ulmos island they dwelt for a while on the banks of the gelion in eastern beleriand but later spread to the shores in this time two events of historical importance occurred their lord elwл was lost for a time in nan elmoth and they encountered ossл a maia of the sea many of the teleri wished to remain in beleriand some to seek for their lost lord and others because of desires stirred in their hearts by ossл when the time came for ulmo to return to beleriand to take the teleri to valinor then many of them remained behind these people became known in after years as the sindar the greyelves and those who dwelt by the shores under the lordship of cнrdan became known as the falathrim melkor chained three ages of bliss now came three ages of glory and bliss for the elves both east and west of the great sea in valinor the vanyar and the noldor and those of the teleri who completed the journey dwelt with the valar and learned from them they dwelt in the jewelled city of tirion in the pass of light and at the swanhaven of alqualondл and beneath the tower of avallуnл on the lonely isle of tol eressлa while the two trees still gave light to the realm of the valar three ages passed and the elves of valinor became the wisest and noblest of all the children of ilъvatar meanwhile in beleriand the sindar dwelt beneath starlight while most of middleearth still slept awaiting the coming of the sun and moon melian the maia brought life to the forests and plains of beleriand under thingols rule and oromл would still ride at times across the darkling lands the nature of the elves both elves and men are the children of ilъvatar and so have much in common but there are also great differences between the two peoples of these the most significant is that elves are immortal at least while the world lasts they do not suffer ageing or disease and if they are slain or wither with grief they are reincarnated in the halls of mandos in valinor although unlike men the elves must remain in the world until its ending they are not bound to middleearth they may if they wish take the straight road and sail into the uttermost west a road that is barred to mortals elves also have far clearer sight and perception than men they are naturally aware of many things that are hidden from the younger children but these gifts are not without limit religion the elves never had any distinct religion in the sense that men would understand the word indeed the high elves had travelled to valinor and lived with the valar themselves for many ages before men came into the world of all the valar they most revered varda elentбri the spouse of manwл and lady of the stars in middleearth they called her elbereth starqueen and sang to her across the wide ocean

harfoots and stoors the fallohides were the least numerous of the three branches and originally dwelt in the northern parts of middleearth the nature of the fallohides in appearance fallohides were taller and slimmer of build than the other hobbits with some growing to four feet or more in height both their skin and their hair tended to be fair and no fallohide ever grew a beard fallohidish culture was much more open to outside influence than that of the stoors or harfoots they were friendlier with the other races of middleearth than their cousins especially the elves perhaps because of this they were skilled in both song and speech while the other two branches of hobbitkind were pastoral and rustic in nature the fallohides retained a hunting tradition and so were naturally bolder and more inquisitive than their relatives but less gifted in the arts of farming and agriculture the history of the fallohides the fallohides seem to have dwelt originally on the upper reaches of the river anduin in the region where the greylin and the langwell flowed into the great river it is likely that they mixed with the ancestors of the rohirrim at this time for the northmen also dwelt in this region and this is likely the origin of the legend of the holbytlan found in rohan at the end of the first millennium of the third age evil things began to stir in the east of middleearth and many peoples including the ancestral hobbits began to travel westward across the misty mountains the first hobbits to enter eriador were the harfoots the fallohides deserted their northern homes in around iii and crossed the mountains to the north of rivendell at the sources of the river hoarwell the tribes of the fallohidish hobbits travelled slowly down the course of the hoarwell and westward across eriador they eventually settled in the region around bree in ciii where their adventurous and intrepid natures made them natural leaders of the other hobbits they found there it was presumably at about this time that the three strains of hobbits began to mix freely for the first time three hundred years later two fallohide brothers marcho and blanco travelled westward again from bree with their followers and crossed the bridge of stonebows they settled in the empty land that they found there and were granted it by king argeleb ii of arthedain in whose realm it lay this was the land that was to become known as the shire as the centuries passed the three distinct strains of the hobbits gradually began to disappear as they mingled with one another in the shire nonetheless there were families that retained a strong line of fallohidish blood and the impetuosity that went with it at the time of the war of the ring the fallohidish line was still well represented in the families

four ages chronicled by tolkien unlike the second and third ages there is no detailed chronicle of the events of the first age and so dates must be inferred from references in the text hence many

with the war of wrath the destruction of beleriand and the final defeat of morgoth the end of the first age was marked by the return of many of the noldor accompanied also by many sindarin elves into

harad road from harad and south gondor entered the lands of gondor proper as such their strategic importance was considerable as attacking armies from the south had no choice but to cross the poros at this point the fords first enter history in the year iii when the enemies of gondor made an alliance and all attacked simultaneously from the northeast and from the south it was left to the great general eдrnil to deal with the army of harad approaching from the south rather than defend the fords eдrnil positioned his army some forty miles further north in south ithilien and decimated the

flames of mount doom life in the shire iii iii frodos father drogo had left hobbiton and removed to buckland to live with his wifes family and so frodo was raised in brandy hall the ancestral home of the brandybucks he lost both his parents in a boating accident in he was close to his distant cousin bilbo and nine years after the loss of his parents bilbo officially adopted him as his heir at this time frodo moved back from buckland to hobbiton although bilbo often referred to frodo as his favourite nephew he was in fact his first cousin once removed and also his second cousin once removed frodo lived with bilbo at bag end for twelve years and inherited some of his peculiarities it was said that he would meet with elves in the woods for example and bilbo allowed him to read his diary of the journey to erebor in bilbo held the great birthday party on september and afterwards departed from the shire leaving frodo to come into his inheritance including the ring after bilbos departure gandalf visited hobbiton only occasionally frodo often went walking in the shire sometimes with his friends folco boffin fredegar bolger peregrin took and meriadoc brandybuck but more often alone his gardener at bag end was samwise gamgee who was to accompany him on his great journey on april gandalf returned having discovered the truth about the ring and so frodo discovered the history behind the

threefarthing stone and the brandywine bridge immediately to the north of the village the stream known as the water broke into two creating a wide watery region this feature seems to have given frogmorton its name which means frog marsh until the war of the ring the village seems to have been most notable for its inn the floating log during the brief time when saruman took over the shire

near mount dolmed in the blue mountains more commonly known by its elvish name belegost gaffer gamgeegaffer a common nickname for the father of samwise gamgee who was more properly called hamfast he presumably acquired the name gaffer later in his life because it implies a person of advanced years this was certainly true of hamfast who was old enough to remember bilbos return from erebor and was no less than ninetytwo years old when his son sam left the shire with frodo gaffer has another meaning too which is no doubt also relevant in british slang a gaffer is a foreman a person who supervises a job at the time of bilbos birthday party were told that hamfast who was then seventyfive oversaw the gardening at bag end but was helped by his son sam in that sense then gaffer gamgee actually was a gaffer galadhon father of celeborn a noble elf of doriath the son of elmo and thus the nephew of thingol himself little is known of him except for the fact that he was father to

middleearth after the loss of amroth in iii galadriel and celeborn became lady and lord of lothlуrien and there they dwelt until the end of the third age her name means radiant garland galathil brother of celeborn and father of nimloth the mother of elwing a descendant of thingols brother elmo and himself the brother of celeborn the lord of lуrien his daughter nimloth wedded dior thingols

to king thйoden of rohan tolkien only ever mentions him once and then only in passing so almost nothing is known about him his name seems to derive from the old english for lewd or wanton galvorn the metal devised by eцl the black metal of eцl the dark elf the shining black metal devised by eцl said to be as hard as steel but supple and malleable eцls armour was made of his galvorn whose name

corruption of the name of his familys original home the village of gamwich the name was further corrupted when hob acquired the nickname old gammidgy which in turn gave rise to the family name gamgee gammidgy the original form of the name gamgee a hobbit familyname apparently first used in old gammidgy the nickname of hob gammidge of tighfield his son hobson received the name in a slightly corrupted form he became known as roper gamgee and that form of the name that descended to his grandson sam gamwich a village in the shire from which the earliest members of the gamgee family came gamwich familygamwich the ancestors of the gamgees a family of hobbits who took their name from the village where they lived gamwich in the shire over the years as the family spread to other parts of the shire the name became corrupted so at the time of the war of the ring their descendants living in hobbiton were known as the gamgees gandalf one of the istari member of the fellowship of the ring gandalf was his name among northern men see olуrin mithrandir incбnus tharkыn greyhame the grey pilgrim in origin a maia of manwл and varda gandalf came to the northwest of middleearth after a thousand years of the third age had passed with four others of his order at the grey havens cнrdan entrusted him with the red ring narya to aid him in contesting the will of sauron gandalf wandered widely in middleearth and learned much of its races and peoples unlike his fellow wizards saruman and radagast he never settled in a single place he was instrumental in the victory of the war of the ring but during that conflict his body was destroyed by a balrog and his spirit returned into the west the valar sent him back to middleearth to complete his task gandalf finally left middleearth in iii when he departed over the sea with the ringbearers arrival in middleearth c iii the wizards arrived in middleearth after the end of the first millennium of the third age they were sent by the valar to aid elves and men but none knew this but cнrdan the shipwright lord of the grey havens where their ships put in though saruman was at that time the acknowledged leader of the wizards cнrdan saw that gandalf was in fact the greater and secretly gave him the red ring narya to aid him in his quest exploration of middleearth c iii to iii for almost years gandalf wandered the northern and western regions of middleearth learning of its lands and cultures he was closest in friendship with the elves and especially elrond who had learned of his origins from cнrdan the white council iii to iii at almost the same time as gandalf had arrived in middleearth a dark power had appeared in southern mirkwood at the evil place known as dol guldur after a thousand years of his wanderings gandalf went there and drove the darkness into the east for a while soon it returned and in iii the greatest among wizards and elves formed a white council with gandalf as a prominent member to counter the growing threat in he revisited dol guldur to find that the power that held it had grown indeed during the eight hundred years since his last visit he recognised the dark power now as sauron returned and escaped to inform the white council before he escaped though he found thrбin ii broken in the pits of dol guldur and though thrбin died before gandalf could help him he did surrender a map and a key into the wizards keeping the year iii was an important year for gandalf not only did he take part in the white councils expulsion of the necromancer from dol guldur but he also arranged for a party of dwarves accompanied by bilbo baggins to travel to their ancient home of erebor and free it from the dragon smaug gandalf and the hobbits the hobbits first appeared in the records of men and elves shortly after the arrival of the wizards but of all the wise gandalf was the only one to pay them great heed after the foundation of the shire he would visit periodically and was responsible for quiet lads and lasses going off into the blue for mad adventures given this description we are forced to wonder whether he had a hand in the exploits of hildifons and isengar took both of whom are recorded as having become involved in adventures of this kind of all the hobbit families gandalf seems to have been most closely associated with the tooks he was a close friend of gerontius the old took and was said to have given him a gift of magical diamond studs which fastened and unfastened on command after gerontius death in iii he was not seen in the shire for more than twenty years until he returned with thorin and the dwarves to involve bilbo baggins in the quest of erebor gandalfs appearance like all the wizards gandalf had the appearance of an old man who grew old slowly with the passage of the centuries his hair was white and his long white beard grew down below his waist his eyebrows were particularly noticeable they were so long and bushy that they stuck out from beneath the rim of his hat he dressed in a long grey cloak which is perhaps the origin of his title the grey he is also described as wearing a tall shadybrimmed pointed blue hat a silver scarf and long black boots he carried at all times a spiked staff the magic of gandalf tolkien at no point defines what the limits of gandalfs magic were as a maia he had many natural abilities that would seem magical to mortal races but he also had a great store of knowledge of more mechanical magic worked through spells and incantations and especially through the agency of his staff it is clear that he had far greater power especially after his return as gandalf the white than he ever displayed in middleearth his magical powers seem to be particularly associated with fire a fact that is perhaps related to the ring of fire narya that he bore a gandalf miscellany gandalf adopted the habit of pipesmoking from the hobbits he often used his magical arts while smoking he could change the colour of his smokerings or send them in any direction he pleased gandalfs preferred drink was red wine gap of rohan the opening some miles wide between the last end of the misty mountains and the norththrust spur

the golden flowers a minor tributary of the river anduin called sоr ninglor by the elves that rose in the eastern misty mountains and flowed westward to meet the great river at the gladden fields though it was hardly more than a hundred miles long the gladden played a great part in the histories of the third age of the world in the middle years of that age war raged in eriador to the west of the misty mountains in about the year iii a clan of refugee hobbits of the strong and resilient stoor variety fled eastward across the mountains and settled by the banks of the gladden we know little of these people but their society was apparently matriarchal and they shared many of the same ancient habits and superstitions as their more familiar cousins who remained west of the mountains we know that they made a living by fishing among the golden flowers of the gladden river and so founded a successful settlement that would last for at least another thousand years some centuries later another great war occurred but this time far to the south and east beyond the forest of mirkwood the stoors knew nothing of this until refugees from the battles of the south came to settle on the plains to the north of the gladden these were noble fairhaired men descendants of the kings of rhovanion and ancestors of the kings of rohan they called themselves simply horsepeople or йothйod in their own tongue these people did not remain by the gladden for long within two centuries they rode further north to seek new more open lands though the йothйod rode into the distant north many men remained and so did the stoors more than a millennium after their arrival in about the twentyfifth century of the third age two young friends of that people journeyed east on the river together to the mouths of the gladden where it emptied into the marshlands of the fields through a strange accident one of them dйagol by name fell into the water and discovered a golden ring sparkling in the mud on the bottom his friend smйagol wanted the ring for himself he throttled dйagol and stole back to his people with the golden and magical ring eventually his grandmother who ruled his family cast him out and he left the banks of the gladden river to wander into the misty mountains and into history and his name became gollum while gollum skulked away the centuries under the mountains of mist he outlived all his family and his people soon after gollums exile orcs began to mass in the mountains nearby and war of the dwarves and orcs brought the armies of the dwarves to these regions too perhaps the stoors were destroyed by the orcs or overrun in the war perhaps they were lost in the fell winter of iii whatever happened we know that no stoors were left there at the time of the war of the ring the nazgыl went there in search of the ring and found only ruins but gollums wretched life was stretched out by his magic ring beyond that of all his kind until at last that ring was taken from him he hunted for it all down the vales of anduin and was himself hunted by aragorn at gandalfs request aragorn captured him near the borders of mordor at the beginning of the year iii and toiled northward with his prisoner we have an account of his travels in the unfinished tales by tracks as westerly as he could find through the skirts of fangorn and so over limlight then over nimrodel and silverlode through the eaves of lуrien and then on avoiding moria and the dimrill dale over gladden in unfinished tales of nъmenor and middleearth so the last survivor of the gladden stoors saw the longdeserted lands of his home once more before the end gladden fields partial translation of loeg ningloron the great stretches of reeds and iris in and about the anduin where isildur was slain and the one ring lost the

the one ring in the first years of the third age glжmscrafuglвкmscrafuglaemscrafu caves of radiance name in rohan of aglarond glamdring the sword of turgon and gandalf of glamdrings early history we know almost nothing from elronds words in the hobbit we can say that it was forged some time in the second to fifth centuries of the first age and that it was borne by turgon after gondolin was built turgon was in battle twice at the nirnaeth arnoediad and at the fall of gondolin glamdring was greatly feared by the orcs even thousands of years later so turgon must have wielded it ferociously on both these occasions after gondolins fall glamdring passed out of history or rumour for more than years the fact that it survived the war of wrath though tells us that it must have left beleriand before the end of the first age perhaps carried eastward by a band of orcs more than that cannot be said except that somehow by the late third age it had fallen into the hands of the three trolls called in the hobbit tom bert and bill huggins it was discovered in their trollhoard by gandalf bilbo and the dwarves as they travelled eastward on the quest of erebor and claimed by gandalf after it was identified by elrond gandalf wore if for eighty years he had it with him when the white council drove sauron from dol guldur and he bore it through the war of the ring itself famously he used it to battle the balrog at the bridge of khazaddыm and it fell with him there into the abyss glamdring survived that fall gandalf had it with him when he returned and he bore it throughout the last days of the war of the ring and beyond we know that he still had the sword when he rode through bree with the travellers in october iii but tolkien doesnt mention it after that point it seems safe to assume though that gandalf was still wearing glamdring as he had for eighty years when he boarded the white ship at the end of the third age glamhoth sindarin word for orcs a name for the orcs although the sindarin word for orcs is yrch this rare but more descriptive term is also sometimes seen glamhoth does appear however in tuors curse in the unfinished of tuor and his coming to gondolin gurth an glamhoth death to the orcs it is also probably seen in a shortened form in the name of gandalfs sword glamdring glanduin borderriver flowing westwards from the misty mountains forming in the

fully grown at that time the noldor under fingon were able to drive him back in the dagor bragollach and the nirnaeth arnoediad glaurung was in the vanguard of morgoths forces and having grown to his full power he wreaked great destruction on those battlefields in the nirnaeth he was driven back to angband by the heavily armoured dwarves though their lord azaghвl was slain in that battle glaurung led the assault by morgoth on nargothrond and there came across tъrin for the first time he dwelt in the ruined halls of finrod felagund for a while but came forth at last to seek tъrin he was slain

precise origins are uncertain but it is perhaps linked to honeysuckle whose french name chиvrefeuille not only means goat leaf but gives its name to a medieval lay and would therefore presumably have been familiar to tolkien only one member of the goatleaf family appears in tolkiens works harry goatleaf who at one time watched the westgate of bree but threw in his lot with bill ferny and sarumans

halforcs and rather more manlike goblinsgoblin the race of orcs a name for orcs and especially the smaller kinds that infested the misty and the grey mountains in the later third age and had their capital at mount gundabad godsgod a name wrongly given by men to the valar while tolkien states that men have often called the valar gods in fact the term is very rare in his books it is most prominently used at the debate of estolad where the men newly arrived in beleriand dispute whether or not to remain this is natural of course they had not at this point been tutored by the elves in such high matters it is tempting to suppose that men have often called them gods refers to the years after the end of the third age and might even suggest equivalences between the valar and mythological gods of later times such as those of the greeks or vikings this cannot be correct however the valaquenta represents a very ancient text within the context of the silmarillion probably dating from the mid to late first age and therefore can only refer to the men of those times golasgil the lord of the anfalas or langstrand a pastoral fief on the far western shores of gondor he rode

gondolinhidden realm the hidden rock secret city of king turgon surrounded by the encircling mountains destroyed by morgoth turgons hidden refuge the great hidden city of turgon was concealed from friend and foe alike during the first age by the encircling mountains and guarded from trespassers by the eagles of thorondor in the fiftieth year of the first age turgon journeyed from his halls in nevrast with his cousin finrod ulmo guided him to the hidden valley of tumladen and there he founded gondolin the city was completed in c i and turgons people who had dwelt in nevrast travelled there secretly the city was inviolate for almost four hundred years turgon did not break his secret leaguer until the time of the nirnaeth arnoediad in i and even after that disastrous battle he was able to return in secret to the city with the aid of hъrin thalion morgoths servants finally discovered gondolin through the treachery of maeglin and it was sacked in i turgon was lost in the fall of the city but some few escaped the destruction and dwelt as exiles at the mouths of sirion the building of gondolin the round valley of tumladen within the encircling mountains had originally been a lake and in its centre stood a hill that had once been an island amon gwareth it was here that turgon decided to found his hidden city as a memorial to ancient tirion that lay beyond the great sea the first building of the city took fiftytwo years to complete after this time the people of turgon a great number of noldor and sindar travelled from nevrast where they had dwelt and secretly entered the valley of tumladen turgon gave his city the name ondolindл but in sindarin this was rendered gondolin the hidden rock after their arrival in the new city the gondolindrim continued to labour in its building until it was said to rival even tirion itself its walls stood high and white above the plain and its most prominent feature was the great tower of the king where among the fountains turgon himself made glingal and belthil trees of gold and silver made in memory of the two trees of valinor the coming of maeglin there followed two centuries of happy peace morgoth was besieged in the far north of the world and the people of gondolin lived undisturbed by the events outside their fair city at last though a seed of discontent appeared king turgons sister aredhel determined to leave the city much against turgons wishes and journey into middleearth soon after her departure her guards returned and reported that they had lost her in the dark and sorcerous region to the south east of the city known as nan dungortheb more than twenty years then passed and then suddenly aredhel returned with her was one who she claimed to be maeglin her son by eцl the dark elf of nan elmoth this maeglin accepted turgon as lord but his father eцl had followed his wife and son to gondolin and been captured at the entranceway he was brought before turgon eцl refused to submit to turgons authority and instead chose death for himself and his unwilling son he threw a poisoned dart to slay maeglin but instead struck aredhel who fell ill with the poison and died the body of eцl was broken on the caragdыr for this maeglin though had had no part in these evils and turgon accepted him and he grew to be among the great in gondolin wise in council cunning in smithcraft and mighty in battle two great battles for more than a hundred years after the deaths of aredhel and eцl gondolin again had peace the time was coming though when morgoth would break the siege of angband and the unstoppable doom of the elves would fall upon them one winters night the fires of angband destroyed the leaguer of the noldor the dagor bragollach in this disaster the people of gondolin played no immediate part they were drawn into the events of those years though when two young brothers of the race of men hъrin and huor were cut off from their army and became lost amid the feet of the crissaegrim thorondor brought them to turgon at the bidding of ulmo turgon accepted them and they remained in gondolin for almost a year when they returned to their homes in this kindly act were the first seeds of gondolins destruction more than fifty years later turgon now devised a new policy for the salvation of the elves he began secretly to send his people out westward across the great sea to seek the land of the valar and ask their pardon and aid none of his mariners succeeded but this was a wise course though turgon never knew it he was lost long before his grandson eбrendil aided by a silmaril finally succeeded in this task as time passed since the destruction of the dagor bragollach the elves of beleriand began to arm for a counterstroke and turgon secretly began his own preparations fourteen years after the breaking of the siege of angband and some three hundred and fifty since the completion of gondolin turgon rode for the first time to war unknown and unbidden by his kin he rode to their aid with an army of ten thousand this was to be the great battle that was to become known as the nirnaeth arnoediad gondolindrimhidden people the people of gondolin who went with turgon

gondor was at first ruled jointly by elendils sons isildur and anбrion both elendil and anбrion were lost in the siege of baraddыr and his brother isildur soon afterwards in the disaster of the gladden fields and so the kingship of gondor fell on anбrions son meneldil thus the kings of gondor were descendants of anбrion through many generations until the time of eдrnur when eдrnur was lost

the elvensmiths of eregion forged many rings in the midsecond age only these nineteen are concerned great the nature and abilities of each of the great rings differed but each shared two powers the first of these was the prolongation or stretching of life the bearer of a great ring did not age this effect only applied to mortal bearers of the rings the elves and wizards were already immortal by nature and this power did not seem to affect them this explains the peculiar longevity of bilbo baggins and especially gollum the second power conferred by the great rings was that of invisibility at first this was a temporary effect and only occurred when the bearer actually wore the ring after a time though this invisibility would become permanent this invisibility seems to have been due to the wearer being transported to the wraithworld a strange dimension that coexists with the real world tolkiens various references to the great rings seem to make it clear that they all had the power of invisibility however the three rings of the elves seemed to be exempt from this although the rings were normally invisible themselves their bearers did not vanish the seven rings of the dwarves which were among the great rings raise a question we know that one of these rings was held by the kings of durins folk and yet through all the hundreds of years they bore it there is no record of this ring displaying any of its powers though the dwarfkings no doubt kept it secret and used it little there are strong hints here that the dwarves somehow had a greater immunity to the effects of the great rings than other mortal kinds great river the river anduin very common title given to the river anduin the greatest river in middleearth which flowed for many hundred miles from the far north down

west when his people found their path blocked by the misty mountains he resolved to leave the journey and instead led his followers south down the vales of anduin and they became known as the nandor

camouflaging themselves in green from that time they were known as the greenelves or laiquendi in the elvish tongue the hidden people of the greenelves played little part in history after the first battle of the wars of beleriand most significantly they lent their aid to beren and dior after the loss of their ancient ally thingol at the hands of the dwarves they went with beren to avenge him much later after the deaths of beren and lъthien one of their lords took up the silmaril that lъthien had borne and brought it to menegroth where dior now dwelt after the end of the first age their

lesser kings and lords but this is not necessarily the case with the high king of the dъnedain the term seems to date back to the early days of nъmenor where tarmeneldur the fifth king was addressed as high king though he had no other rulers in his service the more common use of the title though came at the end of the second age with the establishment of the realms in exile in middleearth in their earliest years the two kingdoms of arnor and gondor fell under the ultimate rule of one man elendil who dwelt in arnor as the high king the southkingdom of gondor was ruled jointly by his sons but only under his suzerainty with elendils loss in the siege of baraddыr his elder son isildur inherited the high kingship isildur ruled for only two years though before he too was lost in the disaster of the gladden fields after his death historical events conspired to separate the two kingdoms each of which took kings of their own the high kingship should in principle have fallen on isildurs heir valandil but in practice valandil became king of arnor only and had no power over the southkingdom more than three thousand years were to pass before aragorn reunited elendils realms in

high king of the noldor a title of six lords of the deep elves the title of six elflords of the noldor they held titular rulership over all the noldor of middleearth though in practice circumstances

their own policies under the general leadership of maedhros finwл the first lord of the noldor awoke at cuiviйnen and led his people into the west to dwell in valinor he was slain by morgoth at formenos and succeeded by his eldest son fлanor he led the host of the noldor back to middleearth to avenge his fathers death and recover the silmarils from morgoth he was slain in his assault on

beleriand with his sons and ruled the noldor during the siege of angband when morgoth broke the leaguer in the dagor bragollach he rode in anger to the gates of angband and died in single combat with

ended in disaster for the noldor and fingons own death he was succeeded by his brother turgon turgons kingship was titular indeed for even his own kin did not know the location of his hidden city of

of the fellowship of the ring in his older years hob acquired the nickname old gammidgy a play on his own name gammidge which was itself a corruption of the village name gamwich this playful name

preferred style of dwelling holes buried into hillsides downs and banks by the late third age these had largely been replaced by buildings of wood or brick but hobbitholes were still in use by the

at bag end for bilbo baggins and perhaps also for his father bungo in about the year iii he took on his young relation hamfast gamgee as an apprentice hamfast eventually became the gardener at bag end himself and was followed by his son samwise in a curious and unlikely way holman was instrumental in the winning of the war of the ring one morning in the spring of iii bag end was visited by the wizard gandalf bilbo was away from home for the elves new year so gandalf struck up a conversation with holman it was holmans description of his employer that encouraged gandalf to include bilbo in the journey to the lonely mountain which in turn led to the finding of the one ring the means through which sauron was ultimately defeated if not for the part of holman greenhand then the western lands might well have fallen under the yoke of the dark lord holman the greenhanded a distant ancestor of sam gamgee sam gamgees ancestor who seems to have founded the tradition of gardening in hobbiton that was carried on by his greatgrandson hamfast gamgee and hamfasts own son sam himself holman founded a family of gardeners who took their surname from his nickname the greenhands it was

was lost in the siege of baraddыr and his elder son isildur inherited the high kingship two years later isildur himself together with his three elder heirs was lost in the disaster of the gladden fields his only remaining heir valandil was only a boy and so arnor was effectively left without a king thus the house of elendil split into two lines in the south isildurs nephew meneldil had been left to rule gondor in his uncles name meneldil now took up the full kingship of gondor and it was ruled by his descendants for more than two thousand years when valandil came of age he inherited the northern lands of his father arnor valandil and his descendants ruled the northkingdom for many generations until dissent arose among the sons of the tenth king eдrendur this conflict ultimately saw arnor divided into three kingdoms arthedain cardolan and rhudaur eдrendurs eldest son and true heir amlaith took control of arthedain while his brothers took up rule in the other new lands arthedain endured for more than a thousand years but eventually all three kingdoms of the northern dъnedain fell to the armies of angmar the line of elendil was not broken in that defeat the heir of arvedui the

will follow them it shall be laid also the cursed descendants and followers of fлanor the eldest son of finwл and his spouse nerdanel fлanor was one of the greatest and certainly the most skilled of the noldor but his burning anger at the loss of his silmarils led him to commit acts that would greatly diminish the influence of his house among his people as the heir of finwл fлanor and his descendants should have inherited the high kingship of the noldor but because of fлanors rash acts the lordship of the noldor passed to his brothers finarfin in aman and fingolfin in middleearth for this reason the members of the house of fлanor are referred to as the dispossessed the history of the house was a woeful one and most of its members met an early end fлanor and six of his seven sons

hъrin his brother slain in the nirnaeth arnoediad heroic grandfather of eдrendil younger son of galdor lord of dorlуmin and grandson of hador lуrindol tuor was in his turn the father of tuor and grandfather of eдrendil the mariner huor had the fair hair and blue eyes of his grandfathers house and was accounted one of the tallest of the edain second only to his own son tuor following the custom of men in those days huor and his elder brother hъrin were fostered by the uncle haldir the lord of the haladin of brethil and so they were dwelling in that forest at the time of the dagor bragollach in i though they were too young to go to open war they went with the haladin to destroy an orclegion that had come to the forest the orcs were routed and the forest had peace for many years after but huor and his brother were cut off from the main force ulmo sent a mist to aid their escape and they retreated across the brithiach into northern dimbar in the shadows of the crissaegrim the encircling mountains of gondolin seeing that they were lost and weary thorondor sent two of his eagles to rescue them and they were carried over the mountains into turgons hidden kingdom ulmo had warned turgon to look favourably on the men of the house of hador and so he welcomed the brothers and they stayed in gondolin for nearly a year although the law of gondolin forbade any to leave who had entered the city turgon made an exception because the eagles had carried huor and hъrin and so they had no clear idea where it lay the eagles carried them away and they returned to the house of galdor in dorlуmin turgon had bound them under an oath of silence and it was never told where they had been for that year when huor had grown to manhood he wedded rнan the daughter of belegund and they conceived a son who huor named before his birth tuor two months after the wedding the elvenlords assembled a great army to assail morgoth and hъrin and huor went to join that army with the muster of dorlуmin this was the great battle that was to be called nirnaeth arnoediad the unnumbered tears huor stood with the forces of his brother under the walls of the tower of high king fingon at barad eithel and their armies were arrayed in the woods on the eastern slopes of the ered wethrin so that morgoth could not descry their numbers turgon also came out of gondolin with his armies for the first time since the city was built to join that battle after six days of fighting the battle turned to morgoth and the elves were routed turgon retreated south to return to his halls in gondolin and huor and hъrin with the remnant of the forces of dorlуmin stood at his back to guard his withdrawal before they parted huor prophesied to turgon that new hope would spring from the two of them saying from you and from me a new star will arise this later proved to be true for his son tuor wedded turgons daughter idril and their son was eдrendil the blessed then came the last stand of the men of dorlуmin who held the pass of sirion against the hosts of orcs and creatures of the enemy they gave slowly back until they came to the fen of serech and the stream of rivil and there they and their host stood firm as the day grew dark on that last desperate battle huor was slain by a poisoned arrow in his eye huornshuorn the trees that came to the battle of the hornburg and entrapped the orcs

retreated into the east and the nazgыl remained threatening but silent in minas morgul the peace would last long after hъrins time it broke with the return of sauron to dol guldur during the rule of

of gondor ancestor of the ruling stewards of gondor hъrin of emyn arnen is the earliest of gondors stewards to have his name recorded in history he served under king minardil and though we know little of his life it is certain that his actions had a tremendous effect on the future history of middleearth he was a man of noble nъmenуrean descent the founder of the house of hъrin from which minardils heirs came by tradition to select their own stewards by the time of the loss of gondors last king eдrnur some four centuries later the stewardship had become a powerful hereditary institution ready to take over in place of the kings to lay the groundwork for such an achievement hъrin must have provided some great service to the state of gondor but what that service might have been is not hinted at in the lord of the rings however the untimely death of his king minardil followed almost immediately by the ravages of the dark plague leave room for speculation that it was the efforts of hъrin that directed gondor through this dark time in its history a short passage in the history of middleearth seems to confirm this had laboured greatly for the ordering of the realm in the disastrous days of the plague when king telemnar died within two years of the slaying of king minardil by the corsairs hъrin thalionhъrinhurin called thalion the steadfast the strong son of galdor of dorlуmin husband of

isildurs heir the descendants of elendils eldest son isildur was the eldest son of elendil and so by right he and his heirs should have inherited the title of high king and ruled the two kingdoms of

was valandil kept safe in rivendell but only eleven years old at that time and unable to take up his rule so isildurs nephew meneldil took control of the kingdom of gondor and the two kingdoms split

pearls which were found in great abundance in the shallow waters around it these were collected by the people of cнrdan who gave them freely to the other elflords while we are not told of the nature

end though in ii when sauron overran the country of the elves and the doors of khazaddыm were sealed against his forces eventually sauron was driven back and khazaddыm continued to thrive much of its

khazaddыm began to be peopled again but not by dwarves sauron directed his creatures there and it began to fill with orcs and trolls though the orcs numbers were greatly reduced in the battle of nanduhirion fought in the valley beneath morias eastgate in iii the balrog could not be bested and khazaddыm remained a citadel of darkness there were two attempts by the dwarves of durins line to reclaim their ancient home the first of these was by balin who led a force of dwarves there from erebor in iii but though he was successful at first he was eventually defeated and slain the story of the second attempt to recolonise the dwarfmansions is less clear but it seems that after several centuries durin vii became king of durins folk and led a further return to the citadel it seems he was successful so that long after the war of the ring the dwarves of durins line reclaimed their inheritance and the hammers rang again in their great halls beneath the misty mountains

own secret language of which only a few words were ever discovered by outsiders with the exception of a few fragments and placenames tolkien gives us little insight into the dwarvish tongue our main sources are in words such as khazaddыm and khuzdul itself and in the dwarvish warcry baruk khazвd khazвd aimкnu during the third age the dwarves seem to have considered khuzdul in much the same way as the elves of middleearth looked on quenya as an ancient and noble tongue of the past the dwarves would more commonly speak even among themselves in the native tongues of the regions in which they lived to the extent that they took their names from these languages the dwarves also had secret inner names presumably derived from the khuzdul tongue but they were extremely secretive about these to the extent that they were not even given on their owners tombs kнlikili nephew of thorin ii oakenshield who accompanied him on the quest of erebor and was slain at his side in the battle of five

and restored order kindler a translation of tintallл a title given to varda after she kindled the brighter stars with the dews of telperion kine of araw the legendary cattle of rhыn the oxen that lived on the lands around the sea of rhыn were hardier and wilder than any others in middleearth legends claimed that they were descended from the cattle of the huntsman of the valar oromл himself and so they were named the kine of araw the kine were famous as the quarry of vorondil the hunter ancestor of the ruling stewards of gondor it was he who cut a horn from one of these beasts and fashioned a huntinghorn from it which came to be carried by the eldest son of the ruling steward from vorondils time onward the last heir to bear the horn was boromir who saw it broken in two in his battle with orcs beneath amon hen king of arda the most powerful of the valar a title given to manwл sъlimo greatest of the valar and held to be the ruler of the realm of arda king of arnor high title of the heirs of isildur title of ten lords of the dъnedain from elendil to eдrendur eдrendurs eldest son amlaith became the first king of arthedain king of arthedain successors to the kings of arnor title of fifteen lords of the dъnedain from amlaith of fornost to arvedui lastking arveduis eldest son aranarth became the first chieftain of the dъnedain king of dale the title claimed by bard the title of the hereditary rulers of dale after its refounding by bard which was held successively by his descendants bain brand and bard ii it was likely also held by bards ancestors down to girion but there is no definite evidence of this king of doriath the royal title of thingol and his heir the title of two elflords of the sindar who ruled the kingdom of doriath for many centuries from its foundation long before the beginning of the first age to its destruction at the hands of the sons of fлanor elu thingol the founder of doriath with his queen melian he was lord there for millennia and in that time his realm was protected from foes by the girdle of melian thingol was slain by dwarves in approximately i and melian departed from the realm he was succeeded by his grandson the son of his daughter lъthien dior eluchнl after thingols death he came to menegroth and ruled the kingdom of his grandfather after the passing of lъthien the silmaril she had borne was brought to doriath and the sons of fлanor assailed the citadel of menegroth to recover it there dior was slain and the kingdom ended king of durins folk the royal line of the longbeards title given to durin the deathless and his descendants who ruled the dwarves of durins folk famous among these were thorin ii oakenshield who reclaimed erebor from smaug and dбin ii ironfoot who fought in the war of the ring no complete list of the kings is known the table below shows the names of those kings who have been recorded or whose existence can be deduced as the descendants of durin were forced by circumstance to travel widely in middleearth the main seat of their kingship is shown alongside each king durin i one of the seven fathers of the dwarves and the founder of the longbeards durins folk he ruled his people for centuries so long in fact that he became known as the durin the deathless but eventually he passed away from time to time over the millennia one among durins descendants would arise so similar in bearing to his ancient ancestor that he too would be given the name durin durin ii we know nothing of this king except that the appearance of his descendant durin iii in the middle years of the second age shows that he must have ruled in khazaddыm at some time before that durin iii the ruler of khazaddыm at the time of the forging of the rings of power durin iii was a great friend of celebrimbor the lord of eregion to the west he received one of the rings as a gift from his friend durin iv durin v like durin ii we know nothing of the reigns of these two kings except that they must have ruled during the late second age or earlier third age we can safely deduce their existence because we know that durin vi took the throne in the late second millennium of the third age durin vi the first king of durins folk for whom we have specific dates was durin vi who ruled in khazaddыm at the time the balrog was awoken it slew durin for which reason it became known as durins bane durin was succeeded briefly by his son nбin i he ruled for just a year in khazaddыm before he too was slain by the balrog he was succeeded by his son thrбin i he led a great part of his people away from khazaddыm into the north and east of middleearth it was thrбin who founded the great dwarfkingdom of erebor the lonely mountain above the long lake he was succeeded by his son thorin i discerning that the great host of his people were gathering in the northern range of the grey mountains thorin i abandoned erebor and removed there he was succeeded by his son glуin he continued the rule of durins folk in the grey mountains was succeeded by his son уin he was succeeded by his son nбin ii in his time the prosperous dwarves began to suffer attacks by the dragons of the north he was succeeded by his son dбin i his short reign came to a swift end when he was slain by a colddrake before his own doors he was succeeded by the eldest of his three sons thrуr he led his people out of the dragoninfested north back to the lonely mountain while his younger brother grуr led some part of their people further east to settle in the iron hills he had been king under the mountain for more than years when the great dragon smaug descended on his kingdom and sacked it he escaped the destruction with his son and grandson and went wandering in the wild eventually reaching his peoples ancient home of khazaddыm he found it infested with orcs his death at the hands of their leader azog sparked the war of the dwarves and orcs he was succeeded by his son thrбin ii he avenged his fathers death with the defeat of azogs orcs at the battle of azanulbizar in the early part of his reign he dwelt in dunland but he later moved northward to the blue mountains west of eriador before his reign ended he resolved to return to erebor but wandering in the wild he was captured by evil things and died in the dungeons of the necromancer he was succeeded by his eldest son thorin ii he ruled as king in the blue mountains for many years but like his father before him he at last determined to return to his ancient home of erebor accompanied by gandalf and bilbo baggins he led a troop of companions into the far east and against all hope recovered the lonely mountain from smaug after smaugs death the battle of five armies was fought beneath erebor and thorin was slain the only remaining descendants of thrуrs line thorins young nephews fнli and kнli were also lost in the battle so the descent of the kingship passed to the line of thrуrs younger brother grуr and specifically to grуrs grandson dбin ironfoot dбin ii he ruled in prosperity as king under the mountain for many years until the time of the war of the ring he was slain in that war in the battle of dale and succeeded by his son thorin iii he was besieged in erebor for seven days after the loss of his father but when news reached the forces of sauron that their master had been defeated he was able to drive them back with thorin iii detailed records of the reigns of the kings come to an end but we have a record of just one of his descendants durin vii he was said to be the last of the durins to rule over durins folk durins bane had been destroyed in the war of the ring so that khazaddыm lay open for recovery by its ancient owners and there is some evidence that it was durin vii who at last achieved this we know that durin i died before the end of the first age so that between his rule and that of thorin iii the kings of durins line ruled for a period of about years given that the average length of a reign among the longbeards seems to have been roughly a century we can deduce that there are probably about fifty kings names missing from this list king of eagles a title given to thorondor the gigantic and noble eagle of the first age whose talons wounded the face of morgoth himself thorondor dwelt among the peaks of the crissaegrim guarding turgons hidden city of gondolin from the forces of morgoth until that citys fall and he came to the aid of the elves many times during the first age in the hobbit we meet a character who carries the title lord of eagles a title that was also borne by thorondor in the elder days whether the title of king of eagles was also passed down through the ages like this cannot be known in tolkiens writings it is only ever used of thorondor himself king of gondolin a title only ever borne by turgon title of turgon son of fingolfin who founded gondolin in the early first age and ruled it until its fall king of gondor the line of lords descended from elendils son anбrion the title of the lords of the dъnedain elendil and his descendants who ruled thekingdom of gondor the line of the kings came to an end when eдrnur answered the challenge of the lord of the nazgыl and was lost in minas morgul after his loss gondor was ruled by hereditary stewards until the installation of aragorn ii elessar after the war of the ring elendil he founded both arnor and gondor and ruled the two kingdoms as high king his royal seat was in his own capital in the north annъminas and during his reign gondor was under the direct command of his two sons isildur and anбrion he formed the last alliance and marched to the defeat of sauron but he himself was lost in that great victory isildur he succeeded his father as high king but before departing into the north spent time ordering the southkingdom in the second year of the third age he left gondor in the care of his nephew meneldil the son of his brother anбrion and rode away into the north on his journey isildur was ambushed by orcs and slain and so the kingship of gondor passed on to meneldil and his heirs meneldil isildur was lost with his three eldest sons leaving just his fourth son valandil then a mere boy as heir at thistime meneldil took on the full kingship of gondor and its kings through the next thirty generations would be his descendants cemendur eдrendil anardil ostoher ostoher rebuilt and expanded minas anor and took it for his summer residenceduring his reign gondor began to suffer attacks out of the wild eastern lands rуmendacil i he defeated the easterlings and took the name rуmendacil eastvictor in token of this nonetheless he met his death in renewed attacks by the wild men out of the east turambar turambar avenged his fathers death and won wide lands for gondor in the east atanatar i siriondil tarannon falastur the first of the four shipkings tarannon put his energies into the building of gondors navies his queen berъthiel was sent into exile and so he was the first of gondors kings to die childless he was succeeded by his nephew the son ofhis brother tarciryan eдrnil i the second shipking famously captured the southern haven of umbar for gondor expanding its boundaries even farther he was lost in a storm off the very coastshe had conquered ciryandil in ciryandils time the haradrim came against umbar and the king died in its defence hyarmendacil i he avenged his fathers death and pressed on to capture land in the south for gondor extending its borders to their greatest extent in history atanatar ii because of the extent and wealth of his realm he was called alcarin atanatar the glorious though he lacked the adventuring warrior spirit of his predecessors narmacil i narmacil tired of the cares of kingship and appointed a regent to manage the kingdom for him this was his nephew minalcar who would one day rule in his own stead as rуmendacil ii he died without issue and was succeeded instead by his younger brother calmacil throughout his brief reign his son minalcar maintained his role as regent rуmendacil ii after sixtyfour years as regent minalcar took the throne in his own right in memory of a great victory over the easterlings he had won in his regency he became king in the name rуmendacil iihe made diplomatic efforts in the east allying himself with tribes of northmen in rhovanion as a bulwark against further easterling invasions he sent his son valacar as an ambassador to the northmen and while rуmendacil still held the throne valacar wedded vidumavi in the east who bore him a son valacar valacar was a controversial and disputed king especially because his heir carried the bloodof the northmen in the later part of valacars reign true rebellion broke out and the southern provinces of gondor began to break away eldacar after the halfgondorian eldacar took the throne the rebellions of valacars time grew into a full civil war and after five years as king eldacar was deposed by castamir the usurper for ten years he hid in the east gatheringhis forces and then challenged castamir for his rightful kingship slaying theusurper himself after regaining his throne he reigned for another fortythree years before his death castamir the usurper of eldacars throne was descended from the royal line and is considered a king of gondor in his own right he reigned for just ten years as unrest among his subjects grew after which eldacar attacked fromthe east and reclaimed the throne of gondor aldamir aldamir was the younger son of eldacar in histime there was war in gondor with the peoples of the south and aldamir fell in that war hyarmendacil ii aldamirs son avenged his father by overcoming the haradrim and in token of this took the name of hyarmendacil southvictor the second of gondors kings to bear that auspicious name minardil minardils was a brief reign he was at the port of pelargir when it fell under attack by the corsairs of umbar and he was slain in that attack telemnar telemnars reign was even shorter than that of his father he was lost with all his children in the dark plague and his line came to an end tarondor tarondor came early to the kingship and enjoyed the longest rule of any of gondors kings his realm had been devastated by war and plague and he worked to rebuild its power it was tarondor who moved the kings house from osgiliath to minas anor telumehtar umbardacil telumehtar is most remembered by history as the king who reconquered umbar to the south and from this deed he took his name umbardacil victor over umbar narmacil ii in narmacils time gondors wars with the fierce wainriders began they emerged suddenly out of the east and narmacils short reign came to an end in their violent assault calimehtar calimehtar reversed his fathers defeat and secured a famous victory over the wainriders on the plain of dagorlad nonetheless they were not destroyed and their threat remained on gondors eastern borders ondoher like his father and grandfather before him ondoher went to war with the wainriders they had made alliance with the men of khand and of harad so that all of gondors bitterest foes attacked at one time under its great general eдrnil gondor had the victory at the battle of the camp but ondoher was lost in those wars as were his two sons artamir and faramir interregnum after the loss of ondoher and his sons gondor was left without a clear heir to its throne arvedui of arthedainmade a claim based on his descent from isildur gondors second king but this claim was rejected instead the crown was given to the commander who had saved the southkingdom eдrnil who as a greatgreatgrandson of telumehtar was properly a member of the royal house eдrnil ii eдrnil ruled gondor during a time a turmoil across middleearth in the north the last kingdom of the dъnedain was overrun by the witchking and though eдrnils son eдrnur travelled north to the aid of arthedain he came too late though he did achieve the destruction of angmar the lord of the nazgыl returned to mordor from that defeat and later in eдrnils reign the nazgыl launched an assault on minas ithil gondors great citadel on the borders of mordor and captured it after that time minas ithil was known as minasmorgul and minas anor as minas tirith eдrnur eдrnur had reigned for just seven years when he foolishly took up a challenge fromthe lord of the nazgыl and rode willingly to minas morgul he was never heard from again and his loss left gondor without a king once more interregnum for nearly a millennium after eдrnurs loss gondor had no king it was ruled by the stewards the loyal hereditary servants of the kings descended from hъrin of emyn arnen steward to king minardil there were twentysix ruling stewards from mardil voronwл to denethor ii in whose time one came togondor with a true claim to its kingship aragorn elessar aragorn was the longlost heir of isildur out of the north the direct descendant of gondors first and second kings who came into his title at the time of the war of the ring and was crowned in the year of the downfall of baraddыr he reunited the north and south kingdoms his queen was arwen the daughter of elrond and his heir was their son eldarion eldarion little is known of aragorns son eldarion but his name and the fact that he succeeded his father to carry the royal line on into the fourth age king of khazaddыm ruler of durins city in the misty mountains the title taken by the rulers of khazaddыm the greatest and most opulent dwarfcity of all time the kings were descended in line from durin i called the deathless who founded the city in ancient days after the foundation of the line by durin little is said of the most ancient kings what records we have show that they ruled on average for about a century each which would mean that there must have been very roughly sixty generations of kings of khazaddыm before records resume in the eighteenth century of the third age the first king listed there the penultimate king in khazaddыm was durin vi so it follows that there must have been a durin ii iii iv and v among the many unknown kings it was durin vi who had the misfortune to rule khazaddыm at the time its miners discovered and released a sleeping menace deep among their mithril veins this was the balrog that came to be known as durins bane a creature much too powerful for the dwarves to control durin was killed soon after its appearance and succeeded by his son nбin i nбins rule was a short one he too was killed within a year of his fathers death and his subjects fled their ancient home according to legend nбin i was not the last king of khazaddыm some sources suggest that his distant descendant durin vii came back to the kingdom of his ancestor and reclaimed it as its king though this tale cannot be verified beyond doubt king of lуrienking of lorien an ancient title for the rulers of the land of lуrien of which amroth was the last king of nargothrond a title of finrod who founded the citadel and realm of nargothrond in west beleriand after his loss the kingship passed to his brother orodreth king of nъmenorking of numenor ruler of ancient westernesse the title of twentytwo lords of the nъmenуreans from elros tarminyatur down through the long years of the second age to arpharazфn the golden who brought about the downfall king of nъmenуrлking of numenorл the father of the isle of nъmenor the rare highelven form of the title much more usually seen as king of nъmenor in fact it occurs in only one recorded instance in a letter from gilgalad to tarmeneldur the fifth king king of rhovanion a title originally claimed by vidugavia a prince of the northmen who ruled the lands east of greenwood the great king of rohan eorl and his royal descendants title of nineteen recorded lords of the land of rohan from eorl the young who founded that land to elfwine son of йomer йadig who fought in the war of the ring king of the dead lord of the shadow host the king of the oathbreaking men of the white mountains who swore allegiance to isildur in the war of the last alliance for breaking his oath he and his people were cursed to walk the paths of the dead until they could redeem themselves which they achieved by aiding isildurs heir aragorn in the war of the ring king of the mark an equivalent title to king of rohan probably more commonly used in rohan itself king of the noldor title taken by the lords of the deep elves an equivalent title to high king of the noldor but somewhat less common it was originally borne by finwл and passed down through his descendants to gilgalad king of the sea a title of ulmo and of arpharazфn the arising of the king of the sea was terrible as a mounting wave that strides to the land a title primarily given to the vala ulmo whose special province was the oceans seas and waters of the earth ulmo not only ruled the sea he also dwelt in its depths and so lived apart from the other valar the title king of the sea also appears in akallabкth but there it is given not to ulmo but to arpharazфn the last king of nъmenor as he sails on middleearth to defeat sauron king of the west a title given to aragorn a title taken by aragorn elessar on his accession to the throne of gondor signifying his kingship over all the free peoples of the west from the north to the south in both the north and southkingdoms of the dъnedain there had been no king for many centuries at the time of aragorns coronation there had been no king of gondor for years and no king of a united arnor for years the last king to rule both realms jointly had been aragorns distant ancestor isildur though his kingship was cut short at the the disaster of the gladden fields before he could truly take up the rule of his twin realms from that time when the third age was just two years old the west had had no uniting king at the coronation of aragorn two years from the ages end arnor and gondor were at last united once again and aragorns rule of the west is therefore referred to as the reunited kingdom king under the mountainmountain kingdom ruler of the dwarves of erebor title of the dwarflords of erebor the title taken by thrбin i founder of the dwarfkingdom at erebor the lonely mountain and maintained by those kings of durins folk who dwelt there the line was broken twice once by thorin i and once by the

called the shire despite many hardships the shire would survive until the time of the war of the ring and beyond though their land did not survive to our own time tolkiens words in the prologue to the

longwormslongworm scatha and his kind a type of dragon found in the northern parts of middleearth and perhaps elsewhere the most famous longworm was scatha of the ered mithrin who preyed on the dwarves and men of the grey mountains and was slain by fram of the йothйod though tolkien gives almost no clues about longworms in the text of the lord of the rings his illustrations of dragons give us some further hints tolkiens dragons tend to be sinuous serpentine creatures having the appearance almost of a winged snake rather than the more traditional dragonform this would explain the term longworm easily its interesting to note that tolkien gave this form to another northern dragon smaug which strongly suggests that he too was one of the longworms it should be noted that tolkien doesnt conclusively refer to longworms as a type of dragon and it is just possible that longworm is simply another word for dragon this doesnt seem very likely though if all worms are long why call them longworms of course if we assume that longworms are a subspecies of dragon there must be other less long types longbeards a name for durins folk one of the seven clans of the dwarves those that followed the oldest of the seven fathers of the dwarves durin the deathless this people is more commonly known as durins folk longbottom the birthplace of pipeweed in the shire a village or town in the southfarthing of the shire its name means long valley and we know that the village and its surroundings were sheltered from the elements probably by the valleys sides longbottom entered history in about iii when a certain tobold hornblower introduced a new herb there the valleys sheltered aspect and the relatively warm climate of the southfarthing made the region around longbottom ideal for growing this new plant pipeweed which rapidly became the centre of a thriving industry longbottom leaf remained one of the most famous varieties of the weed longbottom leaf one of the finest varieties of pipeweed one of the three varieties of pipeweed recorded as being the most soughtafter the other two being old toby and southern star longbottom in the southfarthing was the first place in the shire where pipeweed was grown and so longbottom leaf must have been one of the oldest and most established types the first leafgrower was tobold hornblower and his family continued the tradition when merry and pippin found barrels of longbottom leaf in the ruins of isengard they bore the brandmarks of the hornblower family longholes a common family name among the breehobbits longo baggins an uncle

nowhere stated for certain how many balrogs gothmog had at his command but the number seems to have been small morgoth had no more than seven of these demons of fire in his service lord of dale the ancestors and descendants of girion the hereditary ruler of the township of dale the first recorded lord was girion who was slain by smaug when he descended on erebor girions descendant bard i avenged his ancestor by slaying smaug and refounding dale lord of dol amroth title of the descendants of galador a title of the princes of dol amroth who ruled the gondorian lands of belfalas from their

dorlomin hъrin tъrin title of the descendants of hador lуrindol a title created by fingolfin when he granted the land of dorlуmin to hador and his descendants as an hereditary fief lord of eagleslord of the eagles greatest of the birds of middleearth the title of the chief eagle of middleearth in the first age this was thorondor while in the third the title seems to have been held by gwaihir lord of emyn arnen a title of steward faramir a title given to faramir by aragorn elessar who granted him the hills of emyn arnen for his residence as prince of ithilien gondors lands east of the great river lord of eregion a title given to celebrimbor grandson of fлanor celebrimbor was the son of curufin who was in turn the son of fлanor himself he became the greatest of the mнrdain the jewelsmiths of eregion and was acknowledged as their leader and lord it is not certain whether celebrimbor was the lord of eregion throughout its history the references to him in the lord of the rings seem to suggest this but other materials in unfinished tales hint that eregion might in fact have been founded by galadriel and celeborn with celebrimbor only becoming its lord later in its history this seems to be a point on which tolkien changed his mind the title lord of eregion only appeared with the revised edition of the lord of the rings lord of forests tauron a title for oromл the literal meaning of the name tauron a title used for oromл the huntsman of the valar lord of gifts annatar the tempter of the mнrdain annatar the name and title taken by sauron when he attempted to seduce the elves of

of the black land of mordor lord of morgul the black captain greatest of the nazgыl one of the many titles given to the dark creature most commonly called the lord of the nazgыl this title comes from

performed great services for the rohirrim and the men of gondor of which the most famous was the making of new gates for minas tirith forged out of mithril and steel lord of the mark a title of the

master of the dark tower of mordor whose power is again stretching out over the world a rare title for sauron the master of the one ring in fact it occurs only once in the lord of the rings in rivendell pippin wrongly granted the title to frodo but was quickly corrected by gandalf with the words shown above lord of the rings most famous of saurons titles a title given to sauron the deviser of the great rings and maker of the ruling ring in orodruin curiously given that this title gives its name to the lord of the rings it is in fact very rare and only appears twice in the entire book because of this we can only speculate on exactly which rings it refers to gandalfs use of the phrase the nine servants of the lord of the rings suggests that he intends specifically the nine rings of the nazgыl the title may not have been meant to include the three rings of the elves in whose making sauron was said to have had no part lord of the west a title given to the valar a title used for

wed a mortal and so set beren what he thought was an unachievable task to recover a silmaril from the iron crown of morgoth himself so beren left doriath in pursuit of his hopeless quest after a time a darkness fell on lъthiens heart and she learned from her mother melian what this meant beren had been captured by sauron and was held in the dungeons of tolingaurhoth though thingol sought to stop her lъthien set out from doriath to rescue beren if she could passing through many adventures she gained the help of huan the hound and together they came to saurons isle through lъthiens magic and huans strength they defeated sauron and rescued beren eventually beren set out for angband once again and lъthien accompanied him through lъthiens powers they passed the gates of angband and the great wolf carcharoth that guarded them coming before the dark throne itself she wove a spell that put morgoth and his court into a deep sleep and beren cut a silmaril from the iron crown returning to the gates they found that carcharoth barred their escape beren held up the hallowed jewel to protect them but the monstrous wolf bit off his hand and with it consumed the silmaril but the silmarils were blessed by varda herself so that any unclean flesh that touched them would be withered and burnt the wolfs innards were consumed with that burning and it ran howling into the south lъthien healed beren and they came at last back to her fathers halls at menegroth there they heard tidings that the maddened wolf had entered thingols realm and beren set out with the king to the hunting of the wolf after nightfall they returned the wolf was slain and the silmaril recovered but beren was wounded mortally so he passed away and soon after lъthien too wasted of grief their spirits were gathered in the halls of mandos in the uttermost west of the world and there lъthien sang a song of such extraordinary power and beauty that it moved even the implacable heart of mandos himself so she was granted a unique fate to become mortal and return to middleearth with beren where they dwelt for a time in happiness on the green island of tol galen in the river adurant mablung mablung elf of doriath chief

fлanor and followed his father back to middleearth though of all fлanors sons except perhaps maglor he regretted this the most after fлanors death morgoth captured maedhros through trickery and hung him by the wrist from the heights of thangorodrim fingon succeeded in rescuing him but he lost his right hand in their escape with his brothers maedhros held the eastern passes into beleriand he himself dwelt in a fortress on the hill of himring he worked to unite the houses of the noldor and formed the union of maedhros but that union perished in the disaster of the nirnaeth arnoediad after

hands of the balrogs with the rest of his brothers he dwelt to the east of beleriand and maglor settled between the little gelion and greater gelion the two rivers that came together to form the long gelion itself that region which came to be known as maglors gap lacked hills or mountains and so was the place on beleriands border that was most open to attack from the north maglor guarded his gap for four and a half centuries but was eventually overcome in the dagor bragollach the dragon glaurung invaded maglors land and ruined it so that he was forced to flee to the fortress of his brother maedhros on the hill of himring to the west sixteen years later he marched out with maedhros to the great battle that should have seen the revenge of the elves on morgoth but was brought to ruin by the treachery of uldor the accursed maglor slew uldor himself but the field was lost that was the battle afterwards called the nirnaeth arnoediad the unnumbered tears all seven of fлanors sons survived the nirnaeth in the years that followed one of the three silmarils was recovered from morgoths crown and came eventually to be held by dior in doriath he would not surrender it to the brothers claims and so they assaulted thingols ancient kingdom celegorm caranthir and curufin all fell in that futile battle now only four of fлanors sons survived maglor the eldest son maedhros and the two youngest brothers amrod and amras after some years had passed these four came to learn that a silmaril was held by elwing at the mouths of sirion and though they restrained themselves for some time their oath compelled them to take back the jewel so they assaulted their fellow elves and elwing escaped with the silmaril across the sea to her husband eдrendil and together they sailed into the west that voyage would in time bring about the downfall of morgoth after the destruction of morgoth the last two silmarils were recovered from his crown by this time only maedhros and maglor remained of fлanors sons and maglor came close to repenting the oath wearily he accompanied his brother in the theft of the silmarils but their evil deeds in recovering them meant that the holy jewels burned their skin maedhros in despair leapt into a fiery fissure and maglor the last of the sons of fлanor to survive cast his silmaril into the sea legend says that he still wanders the shores of the world

bree for it was the ancestral name of the keepers of the prancing pony inn though bree seems to have been founded before the beginning of the third age it lay on the road between the north and southkingdoms of the dъnedain and so was drawn into the history of that age when the northkingdom of arnor was founded bree lay within its borders and the men of bree became subjects of that country

grandson of elendil the first king of gondor to rule in his own name he was succeeded by his son cemendur meneldils early life of meneldils life before the war of the last alliance we know almost nothing but it is possible to deduce some of the most important incidents in that time he was born in the very last years of nъmenor and was at most twenty years old at the time of the downfall he would have seen the drowning of the island with his own eyes from the deck of one of his fathers ships and then was propelled by the rushing water to the shores of middleearth what part he took in the building of the realms in exile is a mystery during this time he would have been considereda relatively minor nobleman as the fourth child of elendils younger son he was at best seventh in line to the succession and the prospect of his becoming king was remote after more than a century sauron rose again in the east triggering the great events of the war of the last alliance it is to be presumed that meneldil played his part in that war a war in which he lost his father anбrion but we have no specific details of his deeds the year of transition iii iii before the war elendil had sat has the high king in the northern realm of arnor while isildur and anбrion had ruled gondor jointly in his name since both elendil and anбrion had been lost in the war these arrangements needed to be changed isildur inherited the high kingship and he placed the rule of gondor in the hands of his brothers eldest eligible son meneldil before departing for the north isildur spent a year ordering matters in the gondor and instructing meneldil in his new duties during this year isildur and meneldil journeyed around the borderlands of the southkingdom defining its bounds it was while returning from their travels that they came upon amon anwar the halifirienwhich at that time stood almost at the central point of the country isildur chose that hill as the resting place of his fathers remains and the tomb of elendil that he placed there was to last long after meneldils line had failed it was the beginning of yavanniл when isildur set out from osgiliath leaving the southkingdom in meneldils hands we are told that meneldil was notdisappointed to see the high king and his sons leave for the north and that he hoped to rule gondor himself for a long time farsighted as he was though even meneldil couldnt haveforeseen the events that were to unfold a month after setting out isildur was set upon by orcs and killed together with his three elder sons the kingship in the north fell on isildurs only surviving son elevenyearold valandil this unexpected turn of events transformed meneldil from a mere caretaker into the true king of gondor the rule of gondor iii iii after the upheavals of iii meneldil was to rule gondor for many yearsbut during this period he effectively disappears from history with sauron utterly defeated his reign was a peaceful andquiet one the only historical events recorded during this time are the wedding of elrond to celebrнan and the birth of their twin sons elladan and elrohir these would have been important events in the north but we cannot be sure if the gondorians were even aware of them meneldil ruled in gondor for one hundred and fiftysix years and was succeeded by his son cemendur menelmacar swordsman of the sky the constellation orion the

the adventures of the hobbit and the lord of the rings are set little is known of the east and south of middleearth or of the far north but the geography and history of its western lands are chronicled in great detail ancient times the foundations of middleearth were laid by aulл in times ancient beyond reckoning and the valar lit the new lands with two great lamps illuin in the north and ormal in the south from fear of tulkas melkor had fled beyond the walls of the world and middleearth was a place of peace and beauty the valar themselves dwelt in its central regions on the green island of almaren this was the time known as the spring of arda unknown to the valar though melkor secretly returned and delved his first great fortress of utumno in the mountains of the far distant north when he judged the time was right he assailed almaren and surprising the valar destroyed their habitation in middleearth fleeing back to utumno he saved himself from the wrath of tulkas this is one of the great disasters of middleearths history the valar departed forever and left middleearth under the sole control of melkor who claimed it as his own though the valar made a new home for themselves in aman and lit their new land of valinor with the light of the two trees middleearth was now left in darkness for many ages the valar did not completely forget their ancient home though and yavanna and oromл especially came there from time to time to try and mend the hurts of melkor if they could it was at this time too that aulл returned and secretly fashioned a hall beneath the mountains of middleearth it was there that he wrought the seven fathers of the dwarves who were given life by ilъvatar and set to sleep until the awakening of the firstborn despite these brief visits from the valar though middleearth was effectively controlled by melkor who was free to act as he would slowly his polluted realm spread southwards over middleearth the coming of the elves the awakening of the elves at cuiviйnen brought about profound changes in middleearth at first they lived in darkness prey to the creatures of melkor but oromл found them and the valar decided to act they went to war against melkor there followed the battle of the powers in the north and west of middleearth that war rent and twisted the lands giving them the shape they were to keep until the war of wrath at the end of the first age dorthonion and the highlands north of beleriand were raised up at that time and many bays including the bay of balar were created melkor was ultimately defeated and taken as a prisoner back to valinor after much debate the valar also offered the elves a home in aman and many accepted led by oromл the vanyar noldor and teleri made the great journey across middleearth from the far east where they awoke to its western shores many of these departed middleearth across the sea but some remained of which the major groups were the sindar of beleriand and the nandor of the anduin valley other groups mainly of telerin origin had also left the journey these were the people who were to become known as the silvan elves also in the far east remained the elves who had refused the summons of the valar the avari all these kinds together are known as the moriquendi the dark elves for they did not go to valinor or see the light of the two trees midgewater

title of the nъmenуreans in that hour he appeared as one of the mighty of the west and fit to be the father of the kings of the kings of men a title used once in the quotation given above to refer to tuor the son of huor its exact meaning is ambiguous it appears in a passage that discusses tuors relationship with his descendants the nъmenуreans and so we have treated it here as an epithet for that division of mankind it might conceivably though refer to the valar though it seems unlikely that such a comparison would be made of a mortal man mоmmim the pettydwarf in whose house on amon rыdh tъrin

mighty king and his reign during the ninth and tenth centuries of the third age saw gondor grow into a huge and powerful kingdom stretching east to the sea of rhыn and south to umbar hyarmendacils immediate descendants were not so vigorous his son atanatar and grandsons narmacil and calmacil were content to live a life of ease in the splendour of gondors royal courts fortunately hyarmendacils greatgrandson minalcar inherited more of his forefathers strength of mind born in the last years of hyarmendacils long reign minalcar became active in matters political and military to the extent that not long after his uncle narmacil became king he handed effective control of the southkingdom to his nephew minalcar took up the challenge and managed to rebuild some of the power that gondor had lost in the reigns of his grandfather atanatar and uncle narmacil in particular gondors eastern borders had become victim to easterling incursions minalcar built a great army and wiped out the invaders from the lands west of the sea of rhыn it was from this event that he took the name rуmendacil victor in the east after narmacils heirless death and a brief reign by his own father calmacil minalcar finally ascended the throne to take up the true kingship of gondor to be known to history by the name rуmendacil ii minardil twentyfifth king of gondor successor to hyarmendacil ii the son of hyarmendacil ii of gondor king minardil had two sons telemnar and minastan he had reigned for just thirteen years when he was attacked at pelargir by the corsairs of umbar and slain he was succeeded

also called truesilver and many other names besides the remarkable metal that the dwarves discovered in the mines of khazaddыm it was supple and easy to work and could be polished to shimmer like silver that never tarnished and it was as strong as steel in middleearth mithril was found nowhere but the dwarfmines of khazaddыm though there are indications that it was also found in nъmenor and in aman the metal held a value almost beyond price in nъmenor king tartelemmaitл became so greedy for mithril that it gave him his name telemmaitл means silverhand in middleearth meanwhile the dwarves discovery of mithril drew the noldor to found the kingdom of eregion in the lands west of their mines as the years passed the seams beneath khazaddыm began to be worked out and the dwarves dug deeper and deeper it was their deep mining for mithril that would awake the balrog durins bane and bring about the downfall of their kingdom of all the mithril artefacts the most famous is surely the coat of mail given to bilbo baggins by thorin oakenshield that was held for a while in the michel delving mathomhouse before being worn by frodo during the quest of mount doom many other of the worlds most important items were made of mithril too the symbol of high kingship worn by elendil and isildur was the elendilmir a diamond bound to the brow by a mithril fillet and nenya one of the three rings of the elves was also made of the metal again bearing a diamond greatest of all according to legend was the ship of eдrendil in which he sailed into the sky making the gleam of truesilver visible to the world as the evening and morning star mithrim mithrim the name of the great lake in the east of hithlum the lake that stood in the north of the land of mithrim separating it from hithlum when the noldor returned to middleearth fлanor set his camp on the northern shore of this lake mithrim mithrim region about the lake of the same name and of the mountains to the west separating mithrim from dorlуmin the name was originally that of the sindarin elves who dwelt there a region to the southeast of hithlum a land walled by the mountains of the ered wethrin to the north of beleriand the site of the great battle of the dagornuingiliath mittalmar the central region of nъmenor translated inlands the central lands of nъmenor a pastoral region of grassland and pasture that lay in the central parts of the island of nъmenor the borders of the mittalmar formed a roughly oval region two hundred and fifty miles west to east and one hundred and seventy north to south near its centre rose a single tall mountain the famous meneltarma the pillar of heaven the two main rivers of nъmenor had their springs in this region the nunduinл that flowed westward and the siril that flowed south the eastern part of the mittalmar was the most important region on the whole island this was arandor the kingsland where the royal city of armenelos stood as well as the bustling eastern port of rуmenna a road ran between these two cities and carried on westward across the mittalmar and into the western parts of the island moonletters the secret runes of the dwarves moonletters are runeletters but you cannot see them said elrond not when you look straight at them a system of writing invented by dwarves moonletters were ordinary runes but written in such a way that they could only be read when the light of the moon shone behind the writing some moonletters could be read by any moonlight but it was possible to make the writing even more secret more sophisticated moonletters could only be read by the same shape of moon or at the same time of year as when they were written moonletters were written with silver pens the substance ithildin made from mithril reflected only starlight and moonlight and it seems likely that ithildin or something very similar was used by the dwarves to write their moonletters moontower a name of minas ithil apparently still retained even after it was captured and renamed minas morgul morannon the main entry to mordor translated the black gate also called the gates of mordor the black gate that sauron built across the entrance of the valley of udыn the only opening in the mountainous defences of his black land of mordor mordorland of shadow the black land also called the land of shadow saurons realm east of the ephel dъath saurons black land after the destruction of the strongholds of evil in the north of middleearth at the end of the first age sauron fled southwards seeking new lands at the end of the first millennium of the second age he chose a land walled by mountains and there built his great fortress of baraddыr after sauron settled there the land became known as mordor no record of an earlier name for this region exists after the defeat of sauron in the war of the last alliance mordor was taken under the control of gondor and the gondorians built fortifications around it to prevent the return of evil things the greatest of these was minas ithil as gondors power faded however mordor once again fell into the hands of the enemy and after two thousand years of relative peace the nazgыl returned and claimed the land once again in the name of sauron sauron himself however dwelt at dol guldur in mirkwood and did not himself return openly to baraddыr until some seventy years before the war of the ring in that war saurons power was finally defeated when the one ring was cast into the cracks of doom and the land of mordor once again came under the control of the southkingdom the geography of mordor mordor was a land of approximately rectangular shape measuring some miles east to west and north to south on all but its eastern borders where it marched with rhыn and khand it was surrounded by the mountains of the ered lithui and the ephel dъath offshoots of its mountain fences divided the land into two distinct regions the barren uplands of gorgoroth in the northwest and the more fertile southern plain of nurn where the inland sea of nъrnen lay in the far northwest of mordor where the mountains of the ered lithui and ephel dъath came together lay a valley named udыn this was the only break in mordors western mountaindefences and sauron built a great gate the morannon at its mouth to protect his realm the history of mordor c ii to ii mordor is not mentioned in the histories of middleearth before the end of the first millennium of the second age when sauron chose it as his dwelling place while its natural defences must have influenced his decision we are told that the main reason for his choice was orodruin the great volcano that lay in the central regions of the plateau of gorgoroth and which sauron used in his sorcery including the forging of the one ring through the rest of the second age mordor became a base for saurons struggle for power in middleearth though he had many successes in this struggle at one time controlling all of eriador he also suffered many setbacks at the hands of the elves and especially the nъmenуreans his worst reverse came in ii when arpharazфn the last king of nъmenor landed in middleearth with an unstoppable army saurons forces fled and he offered himself as hostage to arpharazфn leaving mordor and travelling with the victorious nъmenуreans back to their island home we are told little of mordor after sauron left it his armies having fled it must have been an empty barren place for a time eventually though some part of his followers seem to have returned after the destruction of nъmenor and the founding of gondor by elendil and his sons one of their first works was the building of minas ithil at the feet of the ephel dъath as a threat to mordor which suggests that even with sauron absent the remaining inhabitants of the black land posed a threat of their own ii to ii sauron himself secretly returned to the black land after the downfall of nъmenor and the gondorians were apparently unaware of this for a time soon though orodruin burst into life once more and the men of gondor understood that the dark lord had returned to baraddыr after more than a century in sauron had rebuilt his armies sufficiently to contemplate an assault on the newly founded kingdom of gondor on his western borders he attacked and took minas ithil but isildur escaped and fled north to his father in arnor saurons stroke was mistimed for he was not yet strong enough to capture osgiliath gondors capital and this gave elendil the time to forge a military alliance with his friend gilgalad the last high king of the noldor elendil and gilgalad marched with the host of this last alliance to the gates of mordor where they worsted sauron in a mighty battle on the plain afterwards called the dagorlad there followed the sevenyear siege of baraddыr but the forces of the last alliance eventually captured and destroyed the dark tower and consigned sauron to the shadows iii to c iii through some two thousand years of the third age mordor was a deserted and empty land under the control of the gondorians as time passed though and the power and might of gondor dwindled the watch on the borders of mordor was relaxed in iii the battle of fornost was fought in the north and the forces of angmar were defeated the witchking of angmar fled into the south and entered mordor taking it again in the name of sauron and gathering the others of his order there the gondorian watch on mordor had not been maintained and after the dark plague some three hundred years earlier minas ithil and the other forts and castles on mordors borders stood empty this made the nazgыls return all the easier c iii to iii soon after their return the nazgыl attacked minas ithil and took it once again this was in the year twenty years after their return and minas ithil withstood a twoyear siege before it fell we know the tower was unmanned in so we must assume that the gondorians had quickly garrisoned the city once they learned of the nazgыls return this makes sense when we consider that the king of gondor at that time was eдrnil ii who was a great general before he became king after its capture minas ithil was renamed minas morgul the tower of sorcery and so the ancient dwelling of isildur became a dark place and a threat to the gondorians who had built it two thousand years before for a thousand years mordor was to be ruled in saurons stead by the lord of the nazgыl sauron himself was slowly and secretly growing in power at dol guldur to the north and did not wish to reveal himself until he had sufficient strength to face his enemies by iii sauron had grown sufficiently to face his foes the white council attacked dol guldur but he had prepared for this and abandoned that stronghold returning to his ancient kingdom of mordor in the following year he rebuilt his capital of baraddыr and began the ordering of mordor for war that war the war of the ring was to see his final downfall in its closing days an army of gondor stood before the morannon and challenged him and he sent overwhelming forces to answer their challenge secure in the certainty of his victory he was unaware that two hobbits frodo baggins and samwise gamgee had secretly entered mordor over the ephel dъath with the one ring travelling across gorgoroth they reached orodruin and succeeded in destroying the ring bringing saurons rule to an end and leaving mordor once again a desolate land under the control of gondor morgai black fence inner ridge much lower than the ephel dъath and separated from it by a deep trough the inner

middleearth to make war on morgoth for the recovery of the silmarils the history of that age is the history of the hopeless wars of the noldor against morgoth morgul vale the valley behind minas

the dъnedain ruled by a high king at annъminas this was not to be the loss of elendils son isildur in the disaster of the gladden fields led to a chain of events that separated arnor in the north from gondor in the south and the two kingdoms continued to follow different paths through history arnor the northkingdom of the dъnedain was ruled by the direct descendants of isildur beginning with valandil his youngest son though the bloodline of the northern dъnedain came directly from the old high king theirs was a troubled realm internal strife and war with angmar saw arnor become fractured

miles beneath the canopy of trees before it emerged by the banks of the river running of the origins of the road we know little for certain we can be sure that it existed before the end of the second age because a record exists of the stone bridge being specially strengthened to carry the armies of the last alliance a strong clue to its origins is presented in its sindarin name meninaugrim meaning

later to bring about the dark lords downfall when sauron chose the land of mordor as his dwellingplace in the second age orodruin was the reason for his choice he used the fire that welled there from the heart of the earth in his sorceries and his forging the most famous result of his forging and in fact the only one we know of for sure was the one ring made in about the year ii so powerful was the sorcery used in the making of the ring that it could not be unmade except by casting it back into the same fire that had forged it the first opportunity to destroy the ring came in the last year of the second age at the end of the war of the last alliance sauron was defeated in that war and isildur cut the ring from his hand elrond and cнrdan counselled him to destroy the ring then but isildur refused and claimed the ring for himself so the doom of the third age was made orodruin was far more than a natural volcano sauron seems to have extended his own power into it and was able to control its fires it seems to have lain dormant when sauron was away from mordor and sprung into life when his power grew after the downfall of nъmenor for example the exiles in middleearth first knew

and left no heir as such the line of descent from the old tooks third son isumbras iv came to an end and the descent moved on to the line of his fourth son hildigrim so the thainship fell on

paladin was a farmer who worked the lands around whitwell a village which though it appears on no map is known to have been close to tuckborough in the western green hills when lotho sackvillebaggins attempted his takeover of the shire paladin came into his own as the legitimate thain he refused to accept lothos authority and when lothos ruffians were found in the tookland they were hunted and shot so the tookland remained independent while lotho and later sharkey took over the running of the rest of the shire a hundred of paladins archers marched to the battle of bywater and helped to defeat sharkeys men but paladin himself does not seem to have been at the battle paladin was married to eglantine banks and together they had four children the eldest three were daughters pearl

gondor steward to king ondoher the steward to king ondoher of gondor who was thrust into a position of power when his king together with both his heirs was lost in battle with the wainriders with the council of gondor it fell to pelendur to select an heir there were two candidates arvedui of arthedain and eдrnil the gondorian captain and victor of the battle of the camp who was descended from the royal house of gondor as the direct descendant of isildur himself it could be said that arvedui had the stronger claim but pelendur moved the council to elect eдrnil who took the kingship as eдrnil ii all available evidence suggests that pelendur continued to serve as steward under the new king pelendur was a highly influential steward who accrued considerable power to his office as well as effectively acting as regent during the interregnum it was during his time that the office of steward became hereditary when pelendur died he was succeeded as steward by his son vorondil and his

menegroth the main dwelling of the people of haleth was a fenced compound known as ephel brandir on the hill of amon obel in the middle of the forest according to some tales there were drъedain in the

land of eregion in the year ii the followers of celebrimbor became famous for their works of art and craft they were known as the mнrdain the jewelsmiths and formed a brotherhood known as the gwaithimнrdain the people of the jewelsmiths their skill gained them the friendship of the dwarves of nearby khazaddыm who valued such artistry but their fascination with the making of things was to bring about their downfall nearly five hundred years after eregions foundation a mysterious being appeared among its people calling himself annatar he had knowledge and skill beyond even that of the mнrdain and he offered this knowledge freely to the people of the jewelsmiths they accepted his offer and for some three hundred years more annatar taught them eventually their skills were great enough the begin forging rings of power of which they made many and their greatest works were the three rings narya nenya and vilya through these rings they discovered to their horror that annatar was

youngest of frodos companions he was only twentyeight years old when he set out with frodo and sam from bag end on the first part of their great journey which was considered very young for a hobbit at first he seemed to be rather unsuited to a long journey through the early part of their travels we see him regularly calling for rests or meals as befitted the son of the shires thain though he had a good general knowledge of that land and its people peregrins life after the war of the ring peregrin inherited the title thain of the shire in the year iv during his thainship he remained in close contact with gondor and built a library of great historical importance at great smials the works he collected were mainly concerned with the history of nъmenor and the exiles after its downfall and so were of little interest to the hobbits of the shire but were of great significance to the larger world the tale of years was probably prepared at great smials with help from meriadoc brandybuck

been built in the southern slopes of the green hills and was reached by only a single road apparently leading from the larger settlement of longbottom to the south the origin of pincups name are mysterious perhaps the most likely possibility would be old englsh pнn cuppe pine hollow but this is by no means certain pine hill is another possibility though this doesnt fit easily with the fact that the only known map of pincup shows it below the green hills more exotically its name might even be connected with the colourful bird known as a chaffinch a bird the anglosaxons called a pinca

before the beginning of the first age the telerin lord elwл singollo came upon melian the maia in the woods of nan elmoth so melian became the first and only of the ainur to wed one of the children of ilъvatar and together thingol and melian founded a kingdom among the forests in the heart of beleriand and ruled it as king and queen throughout much of its existence the forestkingdom was known as eglador when morgoth returned to middleearth he sent his orcarmies to ravage beleriand they were beaten back but only at great cost and so melian put out her power to protect her country she surrounded the forests of her home with a bewildering maze of powerful enchantments the socalled girdle of melian from that time the land she ruled with thingol was no longer known as eglador but took a new name doriath the fenced land melian and thingol ruled in doriath for some five centuries more at last thingol was slain in his own treasuries by treacherous dwarves of nogrod melian in despair departed for her ancient home in the west of the world and the girdle that had protected doriath was removed whether melian was the last queen of doriath is open to question thingols grandson dior

mysterious stranger calling himself annatar who offered them even greater knowledge of their arts despite warnings from gilgalad and elrond they accepted annatars offer and he came to eregion to teach them for three hundred years the mнrdain as the jewelsmiths of eregion were known studied at annatars side and learned the making of magical rings in about the year ii the first of the rings of power

ruling ring the one ring that would make him lord of all the rings but sauron had not reckoned on the elves forging their own rings of power as he took up the one ring for the first time they became aware of it and took off their own rings to foil his ambition sauron in his anger swept out of mordor with a great army the land of eregion was overwhelmed and destroyed and celebrimbor was slain the three rings of the elves had already been sent away but the dark lord claimed the remaining rings of power nine of these he used to subvert nine men to his cause this was the origin of the nazgыl or

the war of the last alliance isildur cut the ring from saurons hand but he was lost in the river anduin and the ruling ring was lost with him so the elves could once again use the power of their three rings as they did through the third age at last the one ring was found again and saurons quest to retrieve it resulted in the war of the ring ultimately the ring was destroyed in the place where

victor over the easterlings the heir of ostoher who succeeded his father to become gondors eighth king his name had originally been tarostar but he changed it to rуmendacil to reflect the heroic events surrounding his succession while his father ostoher was still king a horde of easterlings attacked gondor the first time such a thing had been known ostoher was too old to take command of his own armies so his son tarostar took over the kingdoms defence after two years of fighting the old king died and tarostar inherited the crown another eight years of warfare followed but in the end tarostar defeated his enemies and saved gondor he took the name rуmendacil in celebration of his triumph it means eastvictor neither rуmendacils triumph nor gondors peace were to last indefinitely

greatest kings entered the world in inauspicious circumstances he was born with the name minalcar during the reign of hyarmendacil ii and his father was calmacil the younger brother of the kings grandson narmacil as such there seemed little likelihood of his succeeding the throne but fate would decide otherwise his uncle narmacil took gondors throne in the year iii narmacil was not a man suited to the rigours of kingship and chose instead to appoint a regent to rule the kingdom in his stead his choice settled on his nephew minalcar who took up the regency in iii having been given this authority minalcar acted swiftly to secure gondors borders he built a huge army and marched with it into the east were he destroyed the easterling forces between rhovanion and the sea of rhыn after this great event he took a title first used by his ancestor tarostar in the sixth century rуmendacil the eastvictor not satisfied with his great victory in the east rуmendacil set about fortifying the river anduin it was he who built the pillars of the argonath above nen hithoel as a warning and a marker of gondors then northern border he developed less tangible defences too working to cement a bond between gondor and the northmen who lived to the east he went so far to send his son valacar to live among them an act from which the evils of the kinstrife would eventually develop had narmacil had a son minalcar rуmendacils regency would have ended with his uncles death in iii narmacil died without an heir however and his brother minalcars father calmacil succeeded instead calmacil was king in name only for he allowed his illustrious son to continue to rule as regent on the death of his father ten years later the man who had actually been ruling gondor for the previous sixtyfour years

the royal house being granted important military roles for example the great gondorian general eдrnil was a member of the royal house being a descendant of telumehtar greatgrandfather to the reigning

though he counselled a different strategy to orodreth who had by that time succeeded his brother finrod as king in nargothrond orodreth therefore built a bridge from his doors across the narog and went to open war with morgoth this was a foolhardy strategy in centuries of searching morgoth had been unable to find the fortress of nargothrond but now not only was its location revealed but the new bridge removed the defence of the river narog glaurung was sent out from angband with an army of orcs to capture the city the army of nargothrond went out to meet glaurung on the field of tumhalad some miles north of the citadel they were routed and those elves left in the city awaiting their return instead found the dragon and his orcs crossing their bridge and entering the citadel these people including orodreths daughter finduilas were captured by the orcs and driven northward coming late to the sack were tъrin and some few other survivors of the battle of tumhalad at the sight of the dragon tъrins companions fled but tъrin himself was placed under glaurungs dragonspell and forced to watch as the captives were driven away then glaurung released tъrin knowing the evils this

curumo curunнr the white wizard traitor to the white council most often called saruman the white saruman was the first of the five wizards to arrive in middleearth at the end of the first millennium of the third age he was said to be the eldest of the order and gandalf acknowledged him as the chief of the istari for a thousand years and maybe more he journeyed in the east of middleearth and was little heard of in the west he had returned though by iii for he was present at the foundation of the council of the wise and was made their chief it was at about this time that saruman began to study the rings of power their history and the means of their making in iii he was given the keys of orthanc by steward beren of minas tirith and took up his abode there he continued his researches into ringlore and the making of devices and was accustomed to watch the stars from the pinnacle of the tower he visited minas tirith to research the history of the rings and found among the ancient books and scrolls the story of the death of isildur and the loss of the ruling ring in iii the council discovered proof that the necromancer of dol guldur was indeed sauron returned many of the wise wished to attack the fortress and drive sauron out but saruman spoke against this and dissuaded the council from mounting an assault it was only after ninety years had passed that he relented and aided the council in assailing dol guldur driving sauron back into mordor sarumans knowledge was vital in this victory as gandalf said it was by the devices of saruman that we drove him from dol guldur when the council debated the rings of power saruman claimed that his researches showed that the one ring had been lost forever it was later shown that he did not believe this however and was searching for it himself having secretly rebelled against the council he built an army of wolves and orcs of his own within the ring of isengard to challenge both sauron and the wise and took control of the only nearby power the country of rohan through his agent grнma wormtongue in july iii when he was ready to reveal himself saruman set a trap for gandalf using the wizard radagast to lure him to orthanc when gandalf came saruman revealed that he had made a ring of his own and that he was no longer saruman the white but claimed the title saruman of many colours when gandalf refused to join him he was imprisoned on the pinnacle of the tower of orthanc saruman hoped to gain the secret of the one ring from him or at least prevent gandalf from using it himself sauron the abhorred greatest of the servants of melkor in his origin a maia of aulл see annatar artano aulendil the second dark lord originally a maia of aulлs people sauron was early corrupted by melkor and became his most trusted lieutenant in the wars of beleriand sauron was the most feared of morgoths servants but after the war of wrath and the expulsion of the first dark lord sauron rose to become the greatest enemy of elves and men in the second and third ages saurons history before the first age sauron was one of the mightiest of the maiar and in the beginning of days he served aulл the smith from aulл he learnt much of forging and making knowledge that he would make use of many thousands of years later when he built the baraddыr and forged the one ring in the earliest days melkor seduced sauron and took him to his own service and sauron became the greatest and most trusted of his followers while utumno still stood in the dark north of the world sauron was given command of his lesser fortress of angband at length the valar assaulted melkor and took him in chains back to valinor but sauron escaped and remained in middleearth sauron in the first age while melkor was captive in aman angband was made ready for his return and it must be assumed that sauron had a large part in this work after the darkening of valinor melkor returned indeed to middleearth and took up his abode in angband soon after he travelled for a while into the eastern lands to seek the newlyawakened men and once again left sauron in command of his forces though sauron doubtless continued his evil works in the service of his lord we hear nothing of these for many centuries after the return of morgoth until the days after the dagor bragollach for two years after the dagor bragollach itself finrods tower of minas tirith had guarded the pass of sirion against morgoths forces in i sauron himself came against the tower he cast a spell of fear upon the elves who held it and they were slain or fled back to finrod in nargothrond sauron then took minas tirith to dwell in and watched the pass of sirion himself from its topmost tower the isle on which it stood which had been called tol sirion was renamed tolingaurhoth the isle of werewolves after the dagor bragollach the last remnant of the house of bлor became a scattered people barahir its lord took shelter in the uplands of dorthonion at tarn aeluin with his son beren and eleven others and was hidden for a while from morgoth sauron was sent to find and destroy this desperate band of outlaws this he did by capturing gorlim one of barahirs followers and using his sorcery he discovered the outlaws camp and destroyed all of barahirs band but his son beren beren himself fled southwards through the treacherous paths of the ered gorgoroth and saurons army of werewolves failed to capture him fate drove beren into saurons hands eventually though some years later as a he travelled through the with on the quest of the silmaril sauron captured him with finrod and their companions and imprisoned them in tolingaurhoth sauron knew nothing of berens quest sensing some danger to himself or his master he sent wolves out throughout the lands of the elves and meanwhile he flung beren finrod and their companions into a deep pit there they were devoured one after the other by one of his werewolves and eventually all were lost but beren as the werewolf slew finrod though lъthien came upon saurons isle with huan the hound of valinor sauron sent wolf after wolf to investigate lъthiens song and each was slain in turn by huan at last he sent draugluin the mightiest wolf that had then lived and he too was mortally wounded by huan but with his dying breath he returned to sauron and warned him of the danger so sauron went himself to one of his greatest defeats he took the form known as wolfsauron the shape of a mighty werewolf and went out to meet his foes first he attacked lъthien but under her enchantment he stumbled and huan sprang upon him though he shifted shape and struggled he could not escape at last he yielded the tower to lъthien and huan released him he fled eastward then to dorthonion where he dwelt in the dark pine forests of taurnufuin sauron in the second age after the war of wrath and the defeat of his master morgoth sauron fled for a time into the east of the world a period of one thousand years followed in which sauron was not seen in the west of middleearth as the first millennium of the second age turned sauron came back he took the fenced and mountainous land of mordor and there began building his mighty dark tower of baraddыr the beginning of saurons reign as dark lord can be dated from this time he set himself no less a goal than the conquest of middleearth and perhaps even of nъmenor itself for six hundred years he pursued a dual strategy in the guise of annatar the lord of gifts he tutored the elves of eregion teaching them the secret things that only a maia of aulлs people could know from his lore the rings of power were forged but while he worked with the elves he continued the fortification of mordor to make it an unassailable stronghold in the firemountain of orodruin he secretly forged the one ring this was to be the first stroke in his conquest of the west a device by which he could know and control the thoughts of the bearers of the other rings his plan failed though the elves became aware of his malevolent presence and took off their rings angered by this setback sauron loosed the hordes of mordor six hundred years in the building and overran eriador destroying the land of eregion where the rings were made the elves called on nъmenor for aid though and the army of tarminastir put saurons forces to rout after this reverse sauron sought instead to build power in the eastern countries and left the westlands in peace for many centuries when arpharazфn usurped the throne of nъmenor in ii he saw saurons growing eastern kingdom as a threat building and equipping a mighty fleet he sailed for middleearth and landed at umbar to the south of the mouths of anduin arpharazфn demanded that sauron submit to his authority and seeing that the might of the nъmenуreans far outstripped his own sauron agreed the shapes of sauron all of the ainur had the ability to change their form but none held so many different shapes as sauron during the first age his accustomed form seems to have been that of a dark sorceror commanding a host of evil things and especially werewolves and their kind he shifted form many times in his existence though especially during his duel with huan among the shapes he wore were wolfsauron this was the monstrous wolfshape he chose when he went forth from his fortress on tolingaurhoth to battle with huan during the battle he changed his form to that of a serpent in his struggles to escape finally after huan released him he became a great vampire and fled into the east dripping blood from his throat upon the trees saurons isle the island of tolingaurhoth a name for tol sirion during the period of roughly ten years that it was under the command of sauron scatha the wormscatha a mighty longworm of the grey mountains one of the greatest of the dragons to infest the grey mountains of the north of his life little is known except that he was slain by fram son of frumgar in the early days of the йothйod his recovered hoard was the subject of great dispute between the men of the йothйod and the dwarves of that region who claimed the hoard as their own fram rebuked their claim and sent them the teeth of the dragon with the words jewels such as these you will not match in your treasuries for they are hard to come by thereafter there was war between the йothйod and the dwarves and fram was said to have been slain by them however this dispute was resolved it seems that frams people retained at least some of the hoard and brought it south with them when they settled in rohan the horn that йowyn gave to merry brandybuck after the war of the ring was said to come from it sceptre royal symbol of the dъnedain the symbol of kingship to the nъmenуreans and their descendants sceptre of

scroll of isildur isildurs own account of the ring there lies in minas tirith still unread i guess by any save saruman and myself since the kings failed a scroll that isildur made himself a scroll made by isildur himself during his short time in minas tirith after the war of the last alliance that was stored for millennia in the vaults of that city the scroll held isildurs account of the gaining of the ring from sauron his description of the ring and his account of the fiery writing that ran around it was vital in helping gandalf identify frodos magic ring as the one ring of sauron

foundation of rohan second age the age of nъmenor beginning in about the th year since the return of the noldor to middleearth the second age is the longest of the chronicled ages it began after the destruction of beleriand in the war of wrath the founding of lindon and the creation of nъmenor the second age was the age of nъmenor the great island kingdom was created and peopled by the descendants of the edain in the first years of the age and as the years passed their power grew until it surpassed that of any nation of men before or since they sailed east exploring middleearth and founding great cities there eventually their power and pride became so great that they challenged the valar themselves and were destroyed the end of nъmenor was not the end of the second age though a remnant of the nъmenoreans led by elendil escaped its wreck and founded kingdoms in middleearth arnor in the north and gondor in the south they formed a mighty alliance the last alliance of elves and men and marched on sauron who had grown great again assailing the dark tower of baraddыr with the first overthrow of sauron by the alliance the second age came to its end key events of the second age

be identified with or at least connected to the flame imperishable of ilъvatar when gandalf met the balrog on the bridge of khazaddыm he spoke of himself as a servant of the secret fire it has been conjectured that these words referred to his firering narya but it seems unlikely that he would reveal this to a bitter enemy more plausibly gandalfs words identify him as a servant of the power of ilъvatar seeingstonesseeingstoneseeing stonesseeing stone a name for the palantнri the powerful orbs known as the palantнri made in ancient days by the elves in aman and indeed said to have been the work of fлanor himself in appearance they were dark perfectly smooth globes of various capabilities and sizes some were small and portable others so huge that they could not be lifted by a man the elves gave certain of these stones to the nъmenуreans and seven of these nъmenуrean stones were rescued from the downfall of that island by elendil and his sons so these seven were brought to middleearth and the dъnedain set them up at distant points in their lands at amon sыl elostirion and annъminas in the north and at osgiliath orthanc minas anor and minas ithil in the south the chief stone of the north was that of amon sыl lost with arvedui in the cold northern seas the greatest of the southern stones stood beneath the dome of stars in osgiliath and was lost during the kinstrife during the third age three of the stones were known to have been lost the ithilstone was captured by sauron and almost certainly destroyed in the downfall of baraddыr and the palantнr of elostirion in the tower hills was taken back into the west on the ringbearers white ship at the beginning of the fourth age then there were just two seeingstones left in middleearth the anorstone and the orthancstone the seeingstones of middleearth were not the only palantнri to exist many remained with the elves in aman including the socalled masterstone held in the tower of avallуnл on tol eressлa

dwarvesseven ringsthe seven the rings of the dwarflords those of the rings of power that sauron gave to the dwarves to seduce them to his service the dwarves proved too hardy to be lured in this way though and the rings did little more than increase their native lust for gold by the end of the third age sauron had recovered three of the seven rings to himself and the other four had been consumed by dragons seven rivers of ossir the river gelion and its six tributaries seven rivers that flowed through ossiriand the land of the greenelves west of the blue mountains the most important of these was the gelion which flowed from the march of maedhros in the far north and formed the western border of ossiriand the other six rivers were tributaries of this large river each stemming from a separate spring in the blue mountains and flowing westward to empty into the gelion the northernmost of these was the ascar which rose in the mountains near nogrod and flowed beside the dwarfroad to sarn athrad south from the ascar were the thalos the legolin the brilthor and the duilwen finally the southernmost of the six was the river adurant in which the green island of tol galen stood seven

unique to the hobbits of the shire based on the founding of that land in iii the shirehobbits reckoned this as year so years of the third age can be converted to shireyears by subtracting the shirefolk took no account of the change of age in iii while the other peoples of middleearth considered this to be the first year of the fourth age in the shire it was simply shirethain titular leader of the shirehobbits for nearly four hundred years after its foundation the shire had been part of the lands of arthedain and under the rule of that lands king ultimately arthedain fell to the forces of angmar and its last king arvedui was lost leaving the shirehobbits without a ruler they remedied this by choosing a new leader from among themselves bucca of the marish who was given the title thain a word simply meaning chief bucca and his descendants a family known as the oldbucks served as shirethain for twelve generations the twelfth thain one gorhendad oldbuck left the shire and

continued unbroken to the time of the war of the ring and beyond the last recorded thain was faramir took i the thirtyfourth to hold the title of shirethain the fact that both he and his father

rivendell he made use of all the resources there to write four scholarly volumes bound in red leather the first of these the red book of westmarch was continued by bilbos heir frodo it was copied many times and became the original source for our modern the hobbit and the lord of the rings the hobbits of the shire though seem to have had less interest in the other three volumes originally entitled simply translations from the elvish that told the tales of the ancient first age and the time before only one copy was made in gondor in iv and this was kept at great smials by the took family it became known as the thains book it is from this copy that the modern silmarillion comes the silmarillion which in its own words passes from the high and the beautiful to darkness and ruin actually consists of a corpus of five works of which the quenta silmarillion is the central tale these are ainulindalл the tale of the music of the ainur and the creation of arda valaquenta the tale of the valar in which the nature of each of the powers is described quenta silmarillion the longest tale which gives an account of the history of arda from its beginnings until the end of the first age akallabкth the tale of the second age which concentrates on the history of nъmenor until its downfall of the rings of power and the third age which spans the late second age and the third telling of the forging of the rings of power and their history up to the war of the ring silmarilssilmaril the three jewels made by fлanor before the destruction of the two trees of valinor and filled with their

fлanors stronghold at formenos slaying his father finwл and fled with them back to his fortress of angband in the north of middleearth fлanor swore an oath to recover the silmarils and many of the noldor followed him into exile in pursuit of the jewels so began their hopeless war against the forces of morgoth of which the quenta silmarillion tells the story during the first age one silmaril alone was recovered from morgoths iron crown by beren and lъthien and was borne by eдrendil when he sailed into the west to seek the aid of the valar by virtue of the silmaril it is said eдrendil reached aman and was heard by the valar who sent a mighty force into middleearth morgoth was utterly defeated and the silmarils recovered maedhros and maglor the only two of fлanors seven sons to survive until that war of wrath stole the jewels from the camp of the valar their evil deeds in pursuance of the jewels however drove them to madness maedhros cast himself into a fiery chasm with one of the silmarils and maglor threw the other into the depths of the sea so only one silmaril remains visible in the world bound to eдrendils brow as he sails the heavens the morning and evening star silpion a name of telperion silvan elvessilvan elf also called woodland elves nandorin elves who never passed west of the misty mountains but remained in the vale of anduin and in greenwood the great see nandor elves who fell away from the great journey long before the beginning of the first age the elves of the great journey travelled westward through the lands of middleearth coming to the great river anduin and the high peaks of the misty mountains some of the elves of the clanof the teleri fell away from the journey and settled in the woodlands east of the mountains these were the original silvan elves who lived on either side of the river at this time in their history all of this peoplestill lived close together with some dwelling in the land that would later be called lуrien and the others settling around the hill of amon lanc in the far south of greenwood the great it must have been in the time these elves were living closely together that the silvan elvish language appeared as history passed the elves would move away from one another and mingle with other elvish peoples so that the silvan branch of elvish would eventually become extinct nonetheless relics of that ancient tongue survived in some wellknown placenames and personal names such as caras galadhon amroth and even lуrien itself the silvan elves dwelt in their twin woodland realms for many centuries but in the second age the emerging power of sauron began to drive them apart oropher was the ruler of the elves who dwelt in the greenwood and he began to seek safety by moving his people northwards away from amon lanc and away from the silvan elves who lived to the west of thegreat river west of anduin the silvan elves of lуrien unlike their cousins in the east the silvan elves of lуrien remained settled in their land throughout their known history we know little of their existence well into the second age where we find them ruled by a sindarin elf named amdнr after the destruction of eregion in the middle second age many of its exiles had escaped through khazaddыm into the east and had joined the silvan elves of lуrien and ultimately mingled with them amdнr was lost in the wars at the end of the second age in the time of his son amroth durins bane wasunleashed in khazaddыm after this time especially with the power of sauron growing in dol guldur to the east many of lуriens people fled into the south amroth himself was among them and he was drowned in the bay of belfalas far from his kingdom it was at this time a little more than a thousand years before the war of the ring that galadriel and celeborn became the lord and lady of lуrien east of anduin the silvan elves of mirkwood the elves of greenwood the great soon to become known as mirkwood had a much less settled existence than their fellow silvan elves in the west their original dwellings were in the far south of the great wood but as saurons power grew they gradually withdrew farther and farther northward eventually sauron chose to settle within the forest itself and in fact built his fortress of dol guldur on the hill of amon lanc where the silvan elves had originally dwelt though his identity remained secret during this time he brought darkness and shadow to greenwood the great and the elves retreated farther still in the later years of the third age their king thranduil dwelt with his people in the far northeast of mirkwood in underground dwellings protectedby magic their history of fleeing from saurons darkness had made them a suspicious and unwelcoming people as thorin and his companions discovered during the quest of erebor it was from thranduils underground halls that his son legolas journeyed at the end of the third age to play a great part in the war of the ring the war of the ring and beyond in the war of the ring saurons forces attacked both silvan realms by the power of galadriel and her ring lуrien was protected against three waves of assault from dol guldur thranduil had no ring to protect his realm it was invadedand the trees of the northern forest set alight though he was at last able to drive back the enemy with the fall of sauron dol guldur was destroyed and mirkwood renamed again eryn lasgalen the wood of greenleaves now the silvan elves once again dwelt in the south of the wood but these were not thranduils people but elves of lуrien who crossed the great river to live in a new land named east lуrien though the original land of lуrien faded after the passing of galadriel and celeborn the silvan elves of the wood lived peacefully under their trees

east through lуrien to meet the river anduin silvertine the mannish name for zirakzigil one of the three peaks that made up the mountains of moria above the dwarfcity of khazaddыm its dwarvish name was zirakzigil while the elves called it celebdil sindarsinda the greyelves name applied to all the elves of telerin origin whom the returning noldor found in beleriand save for the greenelves of ossiriand the noldor may have devised this name because the first elves of this origin whom they met with were in the north under the grey skies and mists about lake mithrim or perhaps because the greyelves were not of the light nor yet of the dark but were elves of the twilight but it was held to refer to elwлs name thingol since he was acknowledged high king of all the land and its peoples the sindar called themselves edhil plural edhel the greyelves an elvish people of telerin origin coming to the western shores of middleearth with the others of their kin they did not pass across the sea but remained in beleriand some had tarried there searching for their lord elwл while others were persuaded to remain by ossл the maia before the return of the noldor to middleearth the sindar were found in most parts of beleriand all claimed elwл as their high king there were two main countries of the sindar however in doriath under the rule of thingol and melian and in the falas under the lordship of cнrdan the shipwright the name means grey people before the return of the noldor for two ages the sindar dwelt in peace and plenty they roamed throughout beleriand from the shorelands of the falas in the west to the blue mountains in the east and all owned thingol as their lord and king in the third age of the captivity of melkor evil things that had dwelt east of the blue mountains began to trouble the sindar at this time they first considered the need for weapons and armour which they had not needed before they traded with the dwarves of nogrod and belegost and learned smithcraft from them thus armed they drove the invading wolves and orcs and other foul things from their land and had peace again for a time sindarin of or pertaining to the sindar sindarin sindarin the elvish tongue of beleriand derived from the common elvish speech but greatly changed through long ages from quenya of valinor acquired by the noldorin exiles in beleriand called also the greyelven tongue the tongue of the elves of beleriand etc the tongue of the greyelves the language of the greyelves of beleriand and most commonly used of the elftongues in middleearth when the noldor returned to middleearth at the beginning of the first age thingol decreed that their tongue quenya was not to be spoken in his realms so the language of his people sindarin came to dominate quenya though was still used as a language of ceremony and poetry sindarin shared common roots with quenya and the two languages had many similar words sindarin was said to be more changeful than the older tongue however and there were a number of regional dialects of the tongue the sindarin spoken in doriath was said to be the highest and most noble form of the language the word sindarin means of the grey

dragon of erebor called also simply the dragon the dragon of erebor my armour is like tenfold shields my teeth are swords my claws spears the shock of my tail a thunderbolt my wings a hurricane and my breath death smaug was the last of the great firedrakes and said to be the greatest dragon of his time at some time during the twentyeighth century of the third age he came to hear of the immense wealth held by the dwarves of erebor where he came from we do not know for certain but in the year iii he descended in fire on the lonely mountain destroying the dwarfkingdom and the nearby township of dale gathering together the treasures of the dwarves he formed himself an immense bed of gold and jewels and settled within the ruined halls of erebor slowly the years and decades passed until the people of the long lake to the south had almost forgotten the dragon of erebor and smaug imagined himself unassailable then one day in the october of iii one hundred and seventyone years after his arrival in erebor smaug awoke to find his treasure disturbed of all that mountain of wealth he noticed with rage that a single twohandled cup had been taken he could not have imagined that the loss of that cup signalled his own imminent downfall thorin the heir of the king under the mountain that smaug had driven from his halls those many years before had returned to reclaim his kingdom with him came bilbo baggins a hobbit with a magical ring with which he had invisibly removed that single cup from smaugs treasure in his anger the dragon flew from his halls scorching and breaking the mountainside thorin bilbo and their companions were sealed in a hidden tunnel and at last the frustrated smaug gave up his attack on the mountain realizing that they must have had help from laketown to the south he set out to punish the men of the lake instead that was to be smaugs last flight bilbo had managed to discover an open patch in the dragons armour and word of this had been carried to laketown in particular it reached the heir of another of smaugs victims bard the descendant of girion of dale bard shot smaug with an arrow and though laketown was devastated in his attack and fall

might still sail after the downfall of nъmenor and the changing of the world the pathway into the west before the downfall of nъmenor the realm of the gods in valinor was still present in the world and those elves who wished to reach it could do so by sailing on into the west after the downfall valinor was taken away and the world took on the round shape we know today mortals sailing into the west simply circled the globe and eventually returned to their starting place for the elves however a way was left open to return to valinor the straight road an elvenship sailing into the west left the bent world and travelled through the air as it were on a mighty bridge invisible until they came to tol eressлa and the undying lands the straight road was not entirely closed to mortals some by the special grace of the valar could use it as did the ringbearers at the end of the third age other mortal mariners too it was said would sometimes find the road and come to the shores of aman before they died it is not certain whether the straight road could be traversed in both directions there are suggestions in tolkiens unpublished writing that this may have been the case it is suggested for example that glorfindel of rivendell who appears in the lord of the rings may have been the same glorfindel who was slain in the fall of gondolin in the silmarillion returned from the halls of mandos

had begun to turn against the valar and the eldar and take pride in their own strength and wealth tarancalimon continued down this path and the histories of nъmenor record that the division of the nъmenуreans began in earnest during his reign politically the realm became split between two parties the kings men who followed tarancalimons policies and the elendili who favoured continued friendship with the eldar for the next millennium nъmenors history was bound up with the dissent between these two parties and ultimately the kings men were to help bring about its destruction that lay in the far future though during his reign tarancalimon turned away from the traditions of the past he discontinued the dedication to eru which had taken place at the meneltarma in the middle of the island the tradition of the taking of the kings names in elvish he maintained though partly through fear of illfortune this is perhaps because of a dark omen of tarancalimons reign the eagles of

eighteenth ruler of nъmenor he was noted as a great military captain who drove the forces of sauron back into the east of middleearth he was also as the first king whose name is recorded with an adыnaic equivalent arbelzagar a sign of the ascendancy of the party of the socalled kings men there is some confusion over his successor the lord of the rings lists the king following tarcalmacil as aradыnakhфr but this may be due to an accidental omission as evidence exists that tarcalmacil was in fact succeeded by his son tarardamin and that aradыnakhфr was actually his grandson

cuiviйnen the ring saurons one ring to bind all rings the powerful artefact of sauron more properly called the one ring or the ruling ring the ring was born out of a plan sauron devised to enslave the peoples of middleearth he took on the form of a wise adviser under the name annatar and offered great knowledge to the elves many rejected him but celebrimbor and the elves of eregion accepted his offer and he schooled them in the making of rings of power at last annatar and the elves made sixteen jewelled rings that would in time become the seven rings of the dwarves and the nine rings of men now sauron put his scheme into motion returning to his land of mordor to the forges of sammath naur in the heart of mount doom he began the secret making of another ring he filled it with his own power and malice to wield power over all the other rings of power and bind their wearers to his will his plan failed the elves too had made themselves rings so powerful that when sauron took up his ruling ring they perceived that they were betrayed taking off their own rings they escaped the trap that sauron had set for them in anger sauron swept out of mordor with his armies eregion was destroyed celebrimbor was slain and sauron recovered fifteen of the rings of power under the binding power of the ring sauron subverted nine men whose rings of power twisted them slowly into wraiths the nazgыl whose only will was saurons he attempted the same with dwarves but they proved resistant to the rings powers and those of their rings that were not destroyed the dark lord reclaimed the power of saurons ruling ring was such though that it wielded power of the wills of lesser beings whether or not they wore another ring in tolkiens letters were told that he used it to bring about nothing less than the destruction of nъmenor by twisting the will of its king arpharazфn and his followers what sauron could not have foreseen was that the downfall of nъmenor would ultimately bring about his own destruction and the loss of his ring nine ships escaped the downfall and landed in middleearth carrying elendil and his sons isildur and anбrion together they founded great realms in middleearth and allied themselves with gilgalad and the elves against sauron so began the long war of the last alliance in which sauron was at last defeated and his ring taken by isildur but isildur did not hold the ring for long he was set upon by orcs on the banks of the great river and the ring was lost in its depths where it would lie for two and a half millennia it was found at last by dйagol a creature of hobbitkind and then passed through a strange series of events no sooner had dйagol recovered it than he was killed by his companion smйagol who stole the ring for himself driven out by his family who gave him the name gollum he wandered into the depths beneath the misty mountains and there he lurked for more than five centuries his life stretched by the power of the ring by a twist of fate he lost it and it came into the hands of bilbo baggins lost and wandering in the depths where gollum dwelt bilbo carried it through adventure and battle eventually bringing it back to the shire it passed to his heir frodo and at last its identity was discovered by the wizard gandalf over the centuries sauron had recovered much of his strength and he too learned that the ring had been found and discovered that it was held in the shire so began the war of the ring a desperate race to destroy saurons ring in the fires of its birth before its lord could reclaim it and use its

west from frogmorton the fourth farthing the northfarthing did not meet the others at the threefarthing stone instead its borders met those of the westfarthing and eastfarthing about ten miles north

king under the mountain after he had been exiled from his kingdom by the dragon smaug as was traditional among the dwarves it was drawn with east at the top of the map rather than north and showed the lonely mountain of erebor the running river that flowed from it and the lands about it also contained mention of a secret entrance to the mountain and instructions as to how it might be opened in his old age thrуr set out to wander the lands of middleearth but before departing he gave the heirlooms of his house to his son thrбin including his map years later thrбin too set out into middleearth seeking to recover erebor himself and taking with him the map to guide his way he was captured in the wild by the servants of sauron but sauron captured thrбin for the ring of power he bore and so overlooked the map he carried too this proved to be a serious oversight because gandalf secretly entered saurons lair at dol guldur while thrбin was a prisoner there and managed to escape with the map and the key that opened the secret door using thrуrs map his grandson thorin was able to lead a small group of dwarves on his own quest to refound the ancient dwarfrealm through many adventures they

hobbiton to start a new life as a gardener tighfields name probably descends from an old word for a common field or pasture and this fits well with the fact that there seem to have been fairs held there indeed hobs son hobson and in turn his son andwise were said to have often shown off their skills in a ropewalk there the shirehobbits loved punning placenames though and the fact that tighfield was associated with ropes and roping is perhaps more than coincidence tilion a maia steersman of the moon the steersman of the moon originally a hunter of oromлs people famed for his silver bow after

union that would bring great troubles in the future the northmen did not share the long lives of the gondorians and vidumavi died even before valacar had succeeded his father as king nonetheless she bore valacar an heir he was raised with the name vinitharya in the eastern lands but returned to gondor with his father as eldacar these events caused unrest throughout valacars reign it was believed

conflict following the death of thrуr a great war of the later third age between the dwarves and orcs precipitated by the murder of king thrуr by the orcchieftain azog the war lasted six years and the orcs were eventually defeated at the battle of nanduhirion war of the jewels the wars in beleriand fought by the noldor for the recovery of the silmarils war of the last alliance the decisive war at the end of the second age the war at the end of the second age in which the last alliance of elves and men marched against the fortress of sauron baraddыr in mordor against all hope they were victorious but sauron rose again in the long years of the third age war of the ring the decisive conflict at the end of the third age the great conflict at the end of the third age named for the one ring and the importance this had in the final outcome the war was fought between the free and sauron the dark lord with saruman as a third power based in orthanc sauron at all times held the military advantage in the war due to his overwhelming forces not only orcs and trolls but men of harad and the east his main immediate object was the overthrow of gondor his near neighbour and the strongest of his enemies he had such forces at his command though that he was able to fight the war on many fronts also attacking dale erebor and the woodelves in the far north and lуrien from his secondary stronghold at dol guldur there can be no doubt that had the wise not achieved possession of the ring sauron would ultimately have been victorious saruman had claimed alliance with both the wise and the dark lord but was ultimately fighting for his own ends in alliance with the dunlendings and having orcs at his own command his objective was the defeat of rohan until late in the war he held the advantage defeating rohan twice at the battles of the fords of isen he had not considered the ents of fangorn in his plans however and when they were roused to anger at his actions they brought about his downfall the policy of the wise was based around the quest of mount doom a company of nine under the leadership of gandalf travelled from rivendell with the one ring with the hope of reaching orodruin in mordor and there destroying it because the ring held much of saurons native power they realised that in unmaking it they would also defeat its creator against all hope the quest was achieved by frodo baggins and sauron defeated the war did not end with the defeat of sauron for saruman fled northward after the capture of orthanc and established himself in the shire bending the hobbits to his will by threat of violence and the persuasive power of his voice the return of frodo baggins and his companions led to a rebellion by the shirehobbits in which saruman was killed by his servant grнma wormtongue although sauron and saruman were both defeated the wise did not achieve total victory with the destruction of the one ring the three rings that had maintained the realms of the elves in middleearth lost their power and the elves began to leave middleearth for the undying lands war of wrath the end of the elder days after eдrendil came to valinor to beg for the aid of the

the edain and their kin the westron was widely spoken by the men of middleearth when the nъmenуreans began to return to middleearth during the second age westron developed into a lingua franca allowing conversation between them and their distant kin as the second age passed and especially after the establishment of the nъmenуrean kingdoms of arnor and gondor at the end of the age westron became widely spoken by all races in middleearth not just men hence it is often referred to as the common speech as the chief language of the northwest of middleearth westron is naturally represented in tolkiens work by modern english even to the extent that names of the ancient westron form are also translated into equivalent forms based on old english hence we have very few examples of real westron words and names there are in fact only two significant sources the first appears in the isolated notes at the end of appendix f ii of the lord of the rings where banakil and kuduk are given with some other examples the second source is the names of the nъmenуrean kings from aradыnakhфr to arpharazфn these are in adыnaic and hence closely related to westron wetwang the great marshland

nimloth the white tree that grew in armenelos in the early days of nъmenor its people still had the friendship of the elves of tol eressлa among the gifts the eldar gave to the early nъmenуreans one of the greatest was a white seedling of the tree celeborn that stood in the middle of their island planted in the kings court in armenelos the seedling grew into a fine white tree that came to be known as nimloth its blossoms appeared as the sun set and their perfume filled the night in nъmenors royal city the tree of tol eressлa celeborn was itself descended from galathilion the white tree that stood in tirion that was made by yavanna herself its descendant nimloth stood in the courts of armenelos for thousands of years but when sauron gained control of nъmenors government he saw the white tree as a link to his enemies the valar and ordered it destroyed so the white tree of nыmenor was cut down and burned on the altarfire of saurons temple the line of galathilion did not end in saurons flames isildur the son of elendil had stolen a fruit from the tree before it was lost the fruit grew into a seedling that isildur carried to middleearth with him after the downfall of nъmenor

nothing of their ancestry and imagined them to be hardly more than beasts at least until the time of the war of the ring for this reason the rohirrim called them the wild men of the woods wilderland the wilderness of rhovanion a term for the lands of middleearth that lay east of the misty mountains wilderland probably represents the westron equivalent of the elvish name rhovanion wildman of the

companions it was williams pocket that bilbo tried to pick as his first act of burglary an attempt that brought the entire expedition close to disaster luckily gandalf was able to trick william and his two companions into arguing together until sunrise whereupon they all turned to stone the name william huggins seems a very remarkable and unlikely one for a troll it seems to be a translation by tolkien of the trolls real name as with the hobbits dwarves rohirrim and so on and the fact that it is recognisably english suggests that his original name was from a mannish language what williams

of the valar so began a reign of peace in valinor but middleearth was lit by starlight alone and melkor worked in the depths of utumno in the north of the world we are not told how long this time

elves when oromл discovered that the elves had awoken at cuiviйnen great changes came about the valar made war on melkor to protect the elder children of ilъvatar utumno was destroyed and melkor brought in chains to valinor the valar also summoned the elves to dwell in their land and many answered this summons a period of three ages followed melkor was imprisoned in the halls of mandos and the valar and eldar dwelt together in the light of the trees in the darkness of middleearth the dark elves who had not journeyed to valinor still dwelt and the fathers of the dwarves stirred men would
