joes luck or always wide awake by horatio alger jr author of tony the tramp slow and sure the cash boy making his way jacks ward do and dare facing the world strong and steady strive and succeed etc new york the new york book company joes luck chapter i introduces joe come here you joe and be quick about it the boy addressed a stout boy of fifteen with an honest sunbrowned face looked calmly at the speaker whats wanted he asked brush me off and dont be all day about it said oscar norton impatiently joes blue eyes flashed indignantly at the tone of the other you can brush yourself off he answered independently what do you mean by your impudence demanded oscar angrily have you turned lazy all at once no said joe firmly but i dont choose to be ordered round by you whats up i wonder aint you our servant i am not your servant though your father is my employer then you are bound to obey me his son i dont see it then youd better if you know whats best for yourself are you going to brush me off no look out i can get my father to turn you off you may try if you want to oscar much incensed went to his father to report joes insubordination while he is absent a few words of explanation will enlighten the reader as to joes history and present position joe mason was alone in the world a year previous he had lost his father his only remaining parent and when the fathers affairs were settled and funeral expenses paid there was found to be just five dollars left which was expended for clothing for joe in this emergency major norton a farmer and capitalist offered to provide joe with board and clothes and three months schooling in the year in return for his services as nothing else offered joe accepted but would not bind himself for any length of time he was free to go whenever he pleased now there were two disagreeable things in joes new place the first was the parsimony of major norton who was noted for his stingy disposition and the second was the overbearing manners of oscar who lost no opportunity to humiliate joe and tyrannize over him so far as joes independent spirit would allow it happened therefore that joe was compelled to work hard while the promised clothing was of the cheapest and shabbiest description he was compelled to go to school in patched shoes and a ragged suit which hurt his pride as he compared himself with oscar who was carefully and even handsomely dressed parsimonious as his father was he was anxious that his only boy should appear to advantage on the very day on which our story begins oscar had insulted joe in a way which excited our heros bitter indignation this is the way it happened joe who was a general favorite on account of his good looks and gentlemanly manners and in spite of his shabby attire was walking home with annie raymond the daughter of the village physician when oscar came up he was himself secretly an admirer of the young lady but had never received the least encouragement from her it made him angry to see his fathers drudge walking on equal terms with his own favorite and his coarse nature prompted him to insult his enemy miss raymond he said lifting his hat mockingly i congratulate you on the beau you have picked up annie raymond fully appreciated his meanness and answered calmly i accept your congratulations mr norton this answer made oscar angry and led him to go further than he otherwise would you must be hard up for an escort when you accept such a ragamuffin as joe mason joe flushed with anger oscar norton do you mean to insult miss raymond or me he demanded so you are on your high horse said oscar sneeringly will you answer my question yes i will i certainly dont mean to insult miss raymond but i wonder at her taste in choosing my fathers hired boy to walk with i am not responsible to you for my choice oscar norton said annie raymond with dignity if my escort is poorly dressed it is not his fault nor do i think the less of him for it if your father would dress me better i should be very glad of it said joe if i am a ragamuffin it is his fault ill report that to him said oscar maliciously i wish you would it would save me the trouble of asking him for better clothes suppose we go on said annie raymond certainly said joe politely and they walked on leaving oscar discomfited and mortified what a fool annie raymond makes of herself he muttered i should think shed be ashamed to go round with joe mason oscar would have liked to despise annie raymond but it was out of his power she was undoubtedly the belle of the school and he would have been proud to receive as much notice from her as she freely accorded to joe but the young lady had a mind and a will of her own and she had seen too much to dislike in oscar to regard him with favor even if he were the son of a rich man while she had the good sense and discrimination to see that joe despite his ragged garb possessed sterling good qualities when oscar got home he sought his father father said he i heard joe complaining to annie raymond that you didnt dress him decently major norton looked annoyed what does the boy mean he said what does he expect he should be dressed as well as i am said oscar maliciously quite out of the question said the major hastily your clothes cost a mint of money of course you want me to look well father i am your son and he is only your hired boy i dont want folks to talk said the major who was sensitive to public opinion dont you think his clothes are good enough of course they are but ill tell you what father said oscar with a sudden idea you know that suit of mine that i got stained with acid yes oscar said the major gravely i ought to remember it it cost me thirtyfour dollars and you spoiled it by your carelessness suppose you give that to joe suggested oscar hes a good deal larger than you it wouldnt fit him and besides its stained what right has a hired boy to object to a stain no matter if it is too small he has no right to be particular you are right oscar said the major who was glad to be saved the expense of a new suit for joe even he had been unpleasantly conscious that joes appearance had become discreditable to him you may bring it down oscar he said i dare say joe wont like the idea of wearing it but a boy in his position has no right to be proud of course not returned the major his ruling passion gratified by the prospect of saving the price of a suit when joseph comes home at any rate after he is through with his chores you may tell him to come in to me all right sir before oscar remembered this message the scene narrated at the commencement of the chapter occurred on his way to complain to his father he recollected the message and retracing his steps said to joe my father wants to see you right off this was a summons which joe felt it his duty to obey he accordingly bent his steps to the room where major norton usually sat chapter ii the stained suit oscar tells me that you wish to see me sir said joe as he entered the presence of his pompous employer major norton wheeled round in his armchair and looked at joe over his spectacles he looked at joes clothes too and it did strike him forcibly that they were very shabby however there was oscars stained suit which was entirely whole and of excellent cloth as to the stains what right had a boy like joe to be particular ahem said the major clearing his throat oscar tells me that you are not satisfied with the clothes i have i given you he has told you the truth major norton replied joe bluntly if you will look for yourself i think you will see why i am dissatisfied joseph said the major in a tone of disapproval you are too free spoken i understand you have been complaining to doctor raymonds daughter of the way i dress you did oscar tell you the way that happened inquired joe i apprehend he did not when i was walking home with miss annie raymond oscar came up and insulted me calling me a ragamuffin i told him that if i was a ragamuffin it was not my fault major norton looked disturbed oscar was inconsiderate he said it seems to me that your clothes are suitable to your station in life it is not well for a boy in your circumstances to be clothed in purple and fine linen as the scriptures express it however perhaps it is time for you to have another suit joe listened in astonishment was it possible that major norton was going to open his heart and give him what he had long secretly desired our heros delusion was soon dissipated major norton rose from his seat and took from a chair nearby a stained suit which had not yet attracted joes attention here is a suit of oscars he said which is quite whole and almost new oscar only wore it a month it cost me thirtyfour dollars said the major impressively he held it up and joe recognized it at once isnt it the suit oscar got stained he asked abruptly ahem yes it is a little stained but that doesnt injure the texture of the cloth as he held it up the entire suit seemed to have been sprinkled with acid which had changed the color in large patches in different parts the wearer would be pretty sure to excite an unpleasant degree of attention joe did not appear to be overwhelmed with the magnificence of the gift if it is so good why dont oscar wear it he asked major norton regarded joe with displeasure it cannot matter to you how oscar chooses to dress he said i apprehend that you and he are not on a level he is your son and i am your hired boy said joe i admit that but i dont see how you can ask me to wear a suit like that i apprehend that you are unsuitably proud joseph i hope not sir but i dont want to attract everybodys notice as i walk the streets if i had stained the suit myself i should have felt bound to wear it but it was oscars carelessness that destroyed its appearance and i dont think i ought to suffer for that besides it is much too small for me let me show you joe pulled off his coat and put on the stained one the sleeves were from two to three inches too short and it was so far from meeting in front on account of his being much broader than oscar that his shoulders seemed drawn back to meet each other behind it doesnt exactly fit said the major but it can be let out easily i will send it to miss pearce the village tailoress to fix it over for you thank you major norton said joe in a decided tone but i hope you wont go to that expense for i shall not be willing to wear it under any circumstances i cannot believe my ears said major norton with dignified displeasure how old are you joseph fifteen sir it is not fitting that you a boy of fifteen should dictate to your employer i dont wish to major norton but i am not willing to wear that suit you are too proud your pride needs taking down major norton said joe firmly i should like to tell you how i feel you are my employer and i am your hired boy i try to do my duty by you you are a good boy to work joseph i dont complain of that you agreed to give me board and clothing for my services so i have yes sir but you have dressed me in such a way that i attract attention in the street for my shabbiness i dont think i am very proud but i have been mortified more than once when i saw people looking at my patched clothes and shoes out at the toes i think if i work faithfully i ought to be dressed decently joseph said major norton uneasily you look at the thing too onesided you dont expect me to dress you like oscar no sir i dont if you would spend half as much for my clothes as you do for oscars i would be contented it seems to me you are very inconsistent here is a suit of clothes that cost me thirtyfour dollars which i offer you and you decline you know why well enough sir said joe you did not tell me you intended to dress me in oscars castoff clothes too small and stained at that i would rather wear the patched suit i have on till it drops to pieces than wear this suit you can go joseph said major norton in a tone of annoyance i did not expect to find you so unreasonable if you do not choose to take what i offer you you will have to go without very well sir joe left the room his face flushed and his heart full of indignation at the slight which had been attempted on him it is oscars doings i have no doubt he said to himself it is like his meanness he meant to mortify me if there had been any doubt in joes mind it would soon have been cleared up oscar had been lying in wait for his appearance and managed to meet him as he went out into the yard where are your new clothes he asked mockingly i have none answered joe didnt my father give you a suit of mine he offered me the suit which you stained so badly with acid well its pretty good said oscar patronizingly i only wore it about a month why dont you wear it longer because it isnt fit for me to wear returned oscar nor for me said joe you dont mean to say youve declined exclaimed oscar in surprise that is exactly what i have done why you ought to know why it is better than the one you have on it is too small for me besides it would attract general attention seems to me somebody is getting proud sneered oscar perhaps you think annie raymond wouldnt walk with you in that suit i think it would make ho difference to her said joe she was willing to walk with me in this ragged suit i dont admire her taste she didnt walk with my clothes she walked with me a hired boy yes i am a hired boy but i dont get very good pay you feel above your business thats whats the matter with you i hope some time to get higher than my business said joe i mean to rise in the world if i can oscar shrugged his shoulders perhaps you would like to be a wealthy merchant or a member of congress he said i certainly should oscar burst into a sneering laugh and left joe alone joes work was done and being left free to do as he liked he strolled over to the village store chapter iii the returned californian the village store in the evening was a sort of village clubhouse where not only the loungers but a better class who desired to pass the evening socially were wont to congregate about the center of the open space was a large boxstove which in winter was kept full of wood ofttimes getting redhot and around this sat the villagers some on wooden chairs some on a wooden settee with a broken back which was ranged on one side joe frequently came here in the evening to pass a social hour and kill time at the house of major norton he had no company oscar felt above him and did not deign to hold any intercourse with his fathers drudge while the housekeeper major norton being a widower was busy about her own special work and would have wondered at joe if he had sought her company i make this explanation because i do not wish it to be understood that joe was a common village lounger or loafer when joe entered the store he found the usual company present but with one addition this was seth larkin who had just returned from california whither he had gone eighteen months before and was of course an object of great attention and plied with numerous questions by his old acquaintances in regard to the land of promise in the far west of which all had heard so much it was in the fall of the year and so in the early days of california seth was speaking as joe entered is there gold in california repeated seth apparently in answer to a question i should say there was why its chock full of it people havent begun to find out the richness of the country its the place for a poor man to go if he wants to become rich whats the prospects here i ask any one of you a man may go working and plodding from one years end to another and not have ten dollars at the end of it theres some here that know that i speak the truth how much better can a man do in california asked daniel tompkins well dan said seth it depends on the kind of man he is if hes a man like you that spends his money for rum as fast as he gets it i should say its just as well to stay here but if hes willing to work hard and to put by half he makes hes sure to do well and he may get rich why i knew a man that landed in california the same day that i did went up to the mines struck a vein and well how much do you think that man is worth today a thousand dollars suggested dan tompkins why im worth more than that myself and i wasnt lucky and had the rheumatism for four months youll have to go higher two thousand guessed sam stone we dont make much account of two thousand dollars in the mines sam said seth its of some account here said sam ive been workin ten years and i aint saved up a third of it i dont doubt it said seth and it aint your fault either moneys scarce round here and farmin dont pay you know what i was workin at before i went out in a shoe shop i just about made a poor livin and that was all i didnt have money enough to pay my passage out but i managed to borrow it well its paid now and ive got something left you havent told us yet how much the man made that you was talkin about said tom sutter it couldnt be five thousand dollars now could it i should say it could said seth was it any more inquired dan tompkins well boys i spose i may as well tell you and you may blieve it or not just as you like that man is worth twenty thousand dollars today there was a chorus of admiring ejaculations twenty thousand dollars did you ever hear the like mind boys i dont say its common to make so much money in so short a time there isnt one in ten does it but some make even more what i do say is that a feller thats industrious and willin to work an rough it and save what he makes is sure to do well if he keeps well thats all a man has a right to expect or to hope for to be sure it is what made you come home seth if you were gettin on so well inquired one thats a fair question said seth and im willin to answer it it was because of the rheumatics i had em powerful bad at the mines and ive come home to kinder recuperate if thats the right word but im goin back agin you may bet high on that no more work in the shoe shop for me at the old rates i dont mean that id mind bein a manufacturer on a big scale thats a little more stiddy and easy than bein at the mines but that takes more capital than ive got how much does it cost to go out there asked dan tompkins more money than you can scare together dan firstclass nigh on to three hundred dollars i believe this statement rather dampened the ardor of more than one of the listeners three hundred dollars or even two were beyond the convenient reach of most of those present they would have to mortgage their places to get it you can go secondclass for a good deal less and you can go round the horn pretty cheap continued seth how far away is californy inquired sam stone by way of the isthmus it must be as much as six thousand miles and its twice as fur i reckon round the horn i dont exactly know the distance then its farther away than europe said joe who had been listening with eager interest of course it is said seth why thats joe mason isnt it how youve grown since i saw you do you think i have said joe pleased with the assurance to be sure you have why youre a big boy of your age how old are you fifteen nearly sixteen thats about what i thought where are you livin now joe im working for major norton seth burst into a laugh i warrant you havent made your fortune yet joe he said i havent made the first start yet toward it and you wont while you work for the major how much does he pay you board and clothes and them are the clothes said seth surveying joes appearance critically yes i guess the majors tailors bill wont ruin him then are they the best youve got no ive got a better suit for sunday well thats something you deserve to do better joe i wish i could said joe wistfully is there any chance for a boy in california mr larkin call me seth its what im used to i dont often use the handle to my name well theres a chance for a boy if hes smart but hes got to work i should be willing to do that then if you ever get the chance it wont do you any harm to try your luck how much did you say it costs to get there well maybe you could get there for a hundred dollars if you wasnt particular how you went a hundred dollars it might as well have been ten thousand as far as joe was concerned he received no money wages nor was he likely to as long as he remained in the majors employ there was a shoe shop in the village where money wages were paid but there was no vacancy and even if there were joe was quite unacquainted with the business and it would be a good while before he could do any more than pay his expenses joe sighed as he thought how far away was the prospect of his being able to go to california he could not help wishing that he were the possessor of the magic carpet mentioned in the arabian tale upon which the person seated had only to wish himself to be transported anywhere and he was carried there in the twinkling of an eye joe walked home slowly dreaming of the goldfields on the other side of the continent and wishing he were there chapter iv joes legacy the next day was saturday there was no school but this did not lighten joes labors as he was kept at work on the farm all day he was in the barn when deacon goodwin a neighbor drove up oscar was standing in front of the house whittling out a cane from a stick he had cut in the woods is joe mason at home the deacon inquired oscar looked up in surprise why should the deacon want joe mason i suppose he is drawled oscar dont you know probably he is in the barn said oscar indifferently will you call him i want to see him on business oscar was still more surprised he was curious about the business but his pride revolted at the idea of being sent to summon joe youll find him in the barn said he i dont want to leave my horse said the deacon i will take it as a favor if you will call him oscar hesitated finally he decided to go and then return to hear what business joe and the deacon had together he rather hoped that joe had been trespassing on the deacons grounds and was to be reprimanded he opened the barn door and called out deacon goodwin wants you out at the gate joe was as much surprised as oscar he followed oscar to the front of the house and bade the deacon good morning oscar tells me you want to see me he said yes joe do you remember your aunt susan my mothers aunt yes shes dead and buried she was pretty old said joe the old lady had a small pension continued the deacon that just about kept her but she managed to save a little out of it when the funeral expenses were paid it was found that there were fiftysix dollars and seventyfive cents over whats going to be done with it he inquired shes left it to you was the unexpected reply you was the nearest relation she had and it was her wish that whatever was left should go to you im very much obliged to her i didnt expect anything i had almost forgotten i had a greataunt the money has been sent to me joe continued the deacon im ready to pay it over to you when you want it but i hope you wont spend it foolish i dont think i shall deacon goodwin it wouldnt take long to spend it joe said the deacon do you want me to keep it for you i dont know said joe i havent had time to think ill come round tonight and see you very well joseph glang dobbin and the deacon started his old horse who had completed his quarter century along the road oscar had listened not without interest to the conversation though he was the son of a rich man he had not at command so large a sum as his fathers hired boy had fallen heir to on the whole he respected joe rather more than when he was altogether penniless youre in luck joe said he graciously yes said joe its very unexpected you might buy yourself a new suit of clothes i dont intend to do that why not you were wishing for one yesterday because it is your fathers place to keep me in clothes thats the bargain i made with him perhaps you are right said oscar ill tell you what you can do he said after a pause what you might buy a boat i shouldnt have any time to use it you might go out with it in the evening i would look after it in the daytime no doubt this arrangement would be satisfactory to oscar who would reap all the advantage but joe did not see it in a favorable light i dont think i should care to buy a boat he said what do you say to buying a revolver i think it would be better to put it on interest youd better get the good of it now you might die and then what use would the money be on the way to the deacons joe fell in with seth larkin well my boy where are you bound asked seth to collect my fortune said joe seth asked for an explanation and received it im glad for you and i wish it were more so do i said joe what for anything particular yes if it was enough i would go to california and you really want to go yes i suppose fifty dollars wouldnt be enough no it wouldnt said seth but ill tell you what you could do what go to new york and keep yourself till you got a chance to work your passage round the horn so i might said joe brightening up it wouldnt be easy but you wouldnt mind that no i wouldnt mind that well if you decide to go come round and see me tomorrow and ill give you the best advice i can the deacon opposed joes plan but in vain our hero had made up his mind finally the old man counted out the money and joe put it in an old wallet the nest thing was to give major norton warning major norton said joe i should like to have you get another boy in my place what joe exclaimed the major i am going to leave town where are you going asked his employer first to new york and afterwards to california well i declare is it because you aint satisfied with your clothes no sir i dont see much prospect for me if i stay here and i have heard a good deal about california but you havent got any money i have almost sixty dollars oh yes oscar told me youd better stay here no sir i have made up my mind youll come back in a month without a cent if i do ill go to work again for you monday morning came clad in his sunday suit of cheap and rough cloth joe stood on the platform at the depot the cars came up he jumped aboard and his heart beat with exultation as he reflected that he had taken the first step toward the land of gold chapter v at the commercial hotel joe had never been in new york and when he arrived the bustle and confusion at first bewildered him have a hack young man inquired a jehu whatll you charge a dollar and a half and halfadollar for your baggage this is all the baggage i have said joe indicating a bundle tied in a red cotton handkerchief then ill only charge a dollar and a half said the hackman ill walk said joe i cant afford to pay a dollar and a half you cant walk its too far how far is it ten miles more or less answered the hackman then i shall save fifteen cents a mile said joe not much alarmed for he did not believe the statement if you lose your way dont blame me joe made his way out of the crowd and paused at the corner of the next street for reflection finally he stopped at an apple and peanut stand and as a matter of policy purchased an apple i am from the country he said and i want to find a cheap hotel can you recommend one to me yes said the peanut merchant i know of one where they charge a dollar a day is that cheap what do they charge at the st nicholas two dollars a day a day asked joe in amazement it must be remembered that this was over fifty years ago joe would have greater cause to be startled at the prices now asked at our fashionable hotels well you can go to the cheap hotel where is it the requisite directions were given it was the commercial hotel located in a downtown street the commercial hotel now passed away or doing business under a changed name was not a stylish inn it was rather dark and rather dingy but joe did not notice that particularly he had never seen a fine hotel and this structure being four stories in height above the offices seemed to him rather imposing than otherwise he walked up to the desk on which was spread out wide open the hotel register rather a dissipatedlooking clerk stood behind the counter picking his teeth good morning sir said joe politely what do you charge to stay here a dollar a day answered the clerk can you give me a room i guess so my son where is your trunk i havent got any havent you got any baggage here it is the clerk looked rather superciliously at the small bundle then youll have to pay in advance all right said joe ill pay a day in advance a frecklefaced boy was summoned provided with the key of no and joe was directed to follow him shall i take your bundle he asked no thank you i can carry it myself they went upstairs until joe wondered when they were going to stop finally the boy paused at the top floor for the very good reason that he could get no higher and opened the door of there you are said the boy is there anything else you want no thank you im sorry there aint a bureau to keep your clothes said the frecklefaced boy glancing at joes small bundle with a smile it is inconvenient answered joe taking the joke you wouldnt like some hot water for shaving would you asked the boy with a grin you can have some put on to heat and ill order it when my beard is grown said joe goodnaturedly all right ill tell em to be sure and have it ready in two or three years that will be soon enough youd better order some for yourself at the same time oh i get in hot water every day the frecklefaced boy disappeared and joe sat down on the bed to reflect a little on his position and plans so here he was in new york and on the way to california too that is he hoped so how much can happen in a little while three days before he had not dreamed of any change in his position i hope i shant have to go back again to oakville i wont go unless i am obliged to he determined he washed his hands and face and went downstairs he found that dinner was just ready it was not a luxurious meal but compared with the majors rather frugal table there was great variety and luxury joe did justice to it folks live better in the city than they do in the country he thought but then they have to pay for it a dollar a day why that would make three hundred and sixtyfive dollars a year this to joe seemed a very extravagant sum to spend on one persons board and lodging now thought joe after dinner was over the first thing for me to find out is when the california steamer starts and what is the lowest price i can go for in the barroom joe found a file of two of the new york daily papers and began to search for the advertisement of the california steamers at last he found it the steamer was to start in three days apply for passage and any information at the companys offices ill go right down there and find out whether ive got money enough to take me joe decided chapter vi joe buys a ticket the office of the steamer was on the wharf from which it was to start already a considerable amount of freight was lying on the wharf ready to be loaded joe made his way to the office well boy whats your business inquired a stout man with a red face who seemed to be in charge is this the office of the california steamer sir yes what is the lowest price for passage a hundred dollars for the steerage when joe heard this his heart sank within him it seemed to be the deathblow to his hopes he had but fifty dollars or thereabouts and there was no chance whatever of getting the extra fifty couldnt i pay you fifty dollars now and the rest as soon as i can earn it in california he pleaded we dont do business in that way id be sure to pay it sir if i lived said joe perhaps you think i am not honest i dont know whether you are or not said the agent cavalierly we never do business in that way joe left the office not a little disheartened i wish it had been a hundred dollars aunt susan left me he said to himself joes spirits were elastic however he remembered that seth had never given him reason to suppose that the money he had would pay his passage by steamer he had mentioned working his passage in a sailingvessel round the horn joe did not like that idea so well as the voyage would probably last four months instead of twentyfive days and so delay his arrival the afternoon slipped away almost without joes knowledge he walked about here and there gazing with curious eyes at the streets and warehouses and passing vehicles and thinking what a lively place new york was and how different life was in the metropolis from what it had been to him in the quiet country town which had hitherto been his home somehow it seemed to wake joe up and excite his ambition to give him a sense of power which he had never felt before if i could only get a foothold here thought joe i should be willing to work twice as hard as i did on the farm this was what joe thought i dont say that he was correct there are many country boys who make a mistake in coming to the city they forsake quiet comfortable homes where they have all they need to enter some city countingroom or store at starvation wages with at best a very remote prospect of advancement and increased risk of falling a prey to temptation in some of the many forms which it assumes in a populous town a boy needs to be strong and selfreliant and willing to work if he comes to the city to compete for the prizes of life as the story proceeds we shall learn whether joe had these necessary qualifications when supper was over he went into the public room of the commercial hotel and took up a paper to read there was a paragraph about california and some recent discoveries there which he read with avidity though joe was not aware of it he was closely observed by a darkcomplexioned man dressed in rather a flashy manner when our hero laid down the paper this man commenced a conversation i take it you are a stranger in the city my young friend he observed in an affable manner yes sir answered joe rather glad to have some one to speak to i only arrived this morning indeed may i ask from what part of the country you come from oakville new jersey indeed i know the place it is quite a charming town i dont know about that said joe its pretty quiet and dull nothing going on so you have come to the city to try your luck i want to go to california oh i see to the golddiggings have you ever been there sir no but i have had many friends go there when do you expect to start why that is what puzzles me joe replied frankly i may not be able to go at all why not i havent got money enough to buy a ticket you have got some money havent you yes i have fifty dollars but i need that a hundred dollars is the lowest price for a ticket dont be discouraged my young friend said the stranger in the most friendly manner i am aware that the ordinary charge for a steerage ticket is one hundred dollars but exceptions are sometimes made i dont think they will make one in my case said joe i told the agent i would agree to pay the other half as soon as i earned it but he said he didnt do business in that way of course you are a stranger to him dont you see that makes all the difference in the world now i happen to be personally acquainted with him i am sure he would do me a favor just give me the fifty dollars and ill warrant ill get the ticket for you joe was not wholly without caution and the thought of parting with his money to a stranger didnt strike him favorably not that he had any doubts as to his new friends integrity but it didnt seem businesslike cant i go with you to the office he suggested i think i can succeed better in the negotiation if i am alone said the stranger ill tell you what you neednt hand me the money provided you agree to take the ticket off my hands at fifty dollars if i secure it certainly i will and be very thankful to you i always like to help young men along said the stranger benevolently ill see about it tomorrow now where can i meet you in this room how will that do perfectly i am sure i can get the ticket for you be sure to have the money ready ill be sure said joe cheerfully and hark you my young friend continued the stranger dont say a word to any one of what i am going to do for you or i might have other applications which i should be obliged to refuse very well sir i will remember punctually at four the next day the stranger entered the room where joe was already awaiting him have you succeeded asked joe eagerly the stranger nodded let us go up to your room and complete our business for reasons which i have already mentioned i prefer that the transaction should be secret all right sir joe got his key and led the way upstairs i had a little difficulty with the agent said the stranger but finally he yielded out of old friendship he produced a large card which read thus california steamship company the bearer is entitled to one steerage passage from new york to san francisco steamer columbus below this was printed the name of the agent joe paid over the money joyfully i am very much obliged to you he said gratefully dont mention it said the stranger pocketing the fifty dollars good day sorry to leave you but i am to meet a gentleman at five he went downstairs and left joe alone chapter vii joe gets into trouble how lucky i have been thought joe in the best of spirits there wasnt one chance in ten of my succeeding and yet i have succeeded everything has turned out right if i hadnt met this man i couldnt have got a ticket at half price joe found that after paying his hotel expenses he should have a dollar left over this would be rather a small sum to start with in california but joe didnt trouble himself much about that in the course of the day joe found himself in the upper part of the bowery it seemed to him a very lively street and he was much interested in looking in at the shop windows as he passed he was standing before a window when a stone from some quarter struck the pane and shivered it in pieces joe was startled and was gazing at the scene of havoc in bewilderment when a stout german the proprietor rushed out and seized him by the collar aha i have you you young rascal he exclaimed furiously ill make you pay for this by this time joe had recovered his senses let me alone he exclaimed i let you know exclaimed the angry man you break my window you pay me five dollar pretty quick or i send you to prison i didnt break your window its a lie you tell me i lie shouted the angry german first you break my window then you tell me i lie you one bad boy you one loafer i dont know who broke your window said joe but i tell you i didnt i was standing here looking in when all at once i heard a crash you take me for one fool perhaps said his captor puffing with excitement you want to get away hey yes i do and get no money for my window by this time a crowd had collected around the chief actors in this scene they were divided in opinion dont he look wicked the young scamp said a thinvisaged female with a long neck yes said her companion hes one of them street rowdies that go around doin mischief they come around and pull my bell and run away the villians whats the matter my boy asked a tall man with sandy hair addressing himself to joe in a friendly tone this man says i broke his window how was it did you break it no sir i was standing looking in when a stone came from somewhere and broke it look here sir said the sandyhaired man addressing himself to the german what reason have you for charging this boy with breaking your window he stood shoost in front of it said the german if he had broken it he would have run away didnt that occur to you some one broke mine window said the german of course but a boy who threw a stone must do so from a distance and he wouldnt be likely to run up at once to the broken window of course not the mans a fool were the uncomplimentary remarks of the bystanders who a minute before had looked upon joe as undoubtedly guilty youve got no case at all said joes advocate let go the boys collar or i shall advise him to charge you with assault and battery maybe you one friend of his said the german i never saw the boy before in my life said the other but i dont want him falsely accused somebody must pay for my window thats fair but it must be the boy or man that broke it not my young friend here who had no more to do with it than myself i sympathize with you and wish you could catch the scamp that did it at that moment a policeman came up whats the matter he asked my window was broke dats whats de matter who broke it asked the policeman i caught dat boy standing outside pointing to joe aha you young rascal ive caught you have i ive had my eye on you for weeks and joe to his dismay found himself collared anew ive only been in the city two days said joe take him to jail exclaimed the german and the policeman was about to march off poor joe when a voice of authority stayed him officer release that boy said the sandyhaired man sternly ill take you along too if you interfere release that boy repeated the other sternly and arrest the german for assault and battery i charge him with assaulting this boy who are you demanded the officer insolently my name is and i am one of the new police commissioners said the sandyhaired man quietly never was there a quicker change from insolence to fawning oh i beg your pardon sir said the officer instantly releasing joe i didnt know you nor your duty either it appears said the commissioner sternly without one word of inquiry into the circumstances you were about to arrest this boy a pretty minister of justice you are shall i take this man along sir asked the policeman quite subdued at this suggestion the bulky teuton hurried into his shop trembling with alarm with great difficulty he concealed himself under the counter you may let him go this time he has some excuse for his conduct having suffered loss by the breaking of his window as for you officer unless you are more careful in future you will not long remain a member of the force the crowd disappeared only joe and his advocate remaining behind i am grateful to you sir for your kindness said joe but for you i should have been carried to the stationhouse it is fortunate i came along just as i did are you a stranger in the city yes sir you must be careful not to run into danger there are many perils in the city for the in experienced thank you sir i shall remember your advice the next day about two hours before the time of sailing joe went down to the wharf as he was going on board a man stopped him have you got a ticket he asked yes sir said joe a steerage ticket there it is where did you get this asked the man joe told him how much did you pay for it fifty dollars then you have lost your money for it is a bogus ticket you cant travel on it joe stared at the other in blank dismay the earth seemed to be sinking under him he realized that he had been outrageously swindled and that he was farther from going to california than ever chapter viii joes luck changes the intelligence that his ticket was valueless came to joe like a thunderbolt from a clear sky the minute before he was in high spirits his prospects seemed excellent and his path bright what shall i do he ejaculated i cant tell you said the officer one thing is clear you cant go to california on that ticket poor joe for the moment hope was dead within his breast he had but one dollar left and that was only half the amount necessary to carry him back to the village where we found him at the commencement of our story even if he were able to go back he felt he would be ashamed to report the loss of his money the fact that he had allowed himself to be swindled mortified him not a little he would never hear the last of it if he returned to oakville no i wouldnt go back if i could he decided wouldnt i like to get hold of the man that sold me the ticket he had hardly given mental expression to this wish when it was gratified the very man passed him and was about to cross the gangplank into the steamer joes eyes flashed and he sprang forward and seized the man by the arm the swindlers countenance changed when he recognized joe but he quickly decided upon his course what do you want johnny he asked composedly what do i want i want my fifty dollars back i dont know what you are talking about you sold me a bogus ticket for fifty dollars said joe stoutly here it is take it back and give me my money the boy must be crazy said the swindler did you sell him that ticket inquired the officer never saw him before in my life aint you mistaken boy asked the officer no sir this is the very man have you any business here asked the officer yes said the man ive taken a steerage ticket to san francisco here it is all right go in he tore himself from joes grasp and went on board the steamer our hero provoked was about to follow him when the officer said stand back you have no ticket that man bought his ticket with my money that is nothing to me said the officer it may be so or you may be mistaken i am not mistaken said joe you can report it to the police that is if you think you can prove it now stand back poor joe he had been worsted in the encounter with this archswindler he would sail for san francisco on the columbus perhaps he would make his fortune there while joe whom he had so swindled might within three days be reduced to beggary joe felt that his confidence in human nature was badly shaken injustice and fraud seemed to have the best of it in this world so far as his experience went and it really seemed as if dishonesty were the best policy it is a hard awakening for a trusting boy when he first comes in contact with selfishness and corruption joe fell back because he was obliged to he looked around hoping that he might somewhere see a policeman for he wanted to punish the scoundrel to whom he owed his unhappiness and loss but as frequently happens when an officer is wanted none is to be seen joe did not leave the wharf time was not of much value to him and he decided that he might as well remain and see the steamer start on which he had fondly hoped to be a passenger meanwhile the preparations for departure went steadily forward trunks arrived and were conveyed on board passengers accompanied by their friends came and all was hurry and bustle two young men handsomely dressed and apparently possessed of larger means than the great majority of the passengers got out of a hack and paused close to where joe was standing dick said one im really sorry you are not going with me i shall feel awfully lonely without you i am very much disappointed charlie but duty will keep me at home my fathers sudden alarming sickness has broken up all my plans yes dick of course you cant go if my father should recover in a few weeks i will come out and join you charlie i hope you may be able to dick by the way how about your ticket i shall have to lose it unless the company will give me another in place of it they ought to do it yes but they are rather stiff about it i would sell it for a hundred dollars joe heard this and his heart beat high he pressed forward and said eagerly will you sell it to me for that the young man addressed as dick looked in surprise at the poorly dressed boy who had addressed him do you want to go to california he asked yes sir said joe i am very anxious to go do i understand you to offer a hundred dollars for my ticket yes sir but i cant pay you now when do you expect to be able to pay me then not till ive earned the money in california have you thought before of going yes sir until an hour ago i thought that it was all arranged that i should go i came down here and found that the ticket i had bought was a bogus one and that i had been swindled out of my money that was a mean trick said dick scudder indignantly do you know the man that cheated you yes he is on board the steamer how much money have you got left a dollar only a dollar and you are not afraid to land in california with this sum no sir i shall go to work at once charlie said dick turning to his friend i will do as you say are you willing to take this boy into your stateroom in my place yes said charles folsom promptly he looks like a good boy i accept him as my roommate all right said the other my boy what is your name joe mason well joe here is my ticket if you are ever able to pay a hundred dollars for this ticket you may pay it to my friend charles folsom now i advise you both to be getting aboard as it is nearly time for the steamer to sail i wont go on with you charlie as i must go back to my fathers bedside goodby sir god bless you said joe gratefully goodby joe and good luck as they went over the plank the officer recognizing joe said roughly stand back boy didnt i tell you you couldnt go aboard without a ticket here is my ticket said joe a firstclass ticket exclaimed the officer in amazement where did you get it i bought it answered joe i shall go to california after all thought our hero exultingly chapter ix the first day on board we will look up our stateroom first joe said his new friend it ought to be a good one the stateroom proved to be no very well located and spacious for a stateroom but to joe it seemed very small for two persons he was an inexperienced traveler and did not understand that life on board ship is widely different from life on shore his companion had been to europe and was used to steamer life i think joe said he that i shall put you in the top berth the lower berth is considered more desirable but i claim it on the score of age and infirmity you dont look very old or infirm said joe i am twentythree and you fifteen nearly sixteen i have a stateroom trunk which will just slip in under my berth where is your luggage joe looked embarrassed i dont know but you will feel ashamed of me he said but the only extra clothes i have are tied up in this handkerchief charles folsom whistled well said he you are poorly provided what have you got inside a couple of shirts three collars two handkerchiefs and a pair of stockings and you are going a journey of thousands of miles but never mind he said kindly i am not much larger than you and if you need it i can lend you once in california you will have less trouble than if you were loaded down with clothes i must get you to tell me your story when there is time they came on deck just in time to see the steamer swing out of the dock there were some of the passengers with sober faces they had bidden farewell to friends and relatives whom they might not see for years perhaps never again they were going to a new country where hardships undoubtedly awaited them and where they must take their chances of health and success some too feared seasickness a malady justly dreaded by all who have ever felt its prostrating effects but joe only felt joyful exhilaration you look happy joe said young folsom i feel so said joe are you hoping to make your fortune in california i am hoping to make a living said joe didnt you make a living here at home a poor living with no prospects ahead i didnt mind hard work and poor clothes if there had been a prospect of something better by and by tell me your story where were you living charles folsom listened attentively major norton didnt appear disposed to pamper you or bring you up in luxury thats a fact it would have been hard lines if on account of losing your aunts legacy you had been compelled to go back to oakville i wouldnt have gone said joe resolutely what would you have done stayed in new york and got a living somehow even if i had to black boots in the street i guess youll do youve got the right spirit it takes boys and men like you for pioneers joe was gratified at his companions approval now said folsom i may as well tell you my story i am the son of a new york merchant who is moderately rich i entered the countingroom at seventeen and have remained there ever since with the exception of four months spent in europe if you are rich already why do you go out to california asked joe i am not going to the mines i am going to prospect a little for the firm some day san francisco will be a large city i am going to see how soon it will pay for our house to establish a branch there i see said joe i shall probably go out to the mines and take a general survey of the country but as you see i do not go out to obtain employment it must be jolly not to have to work said joe but to have plenty of money to pay your expenses well i suppose it is convenient i believe you havent a large cash surplus i have a dollar youve got some pluck to travel so far away from home with such a slender capital by jove i dont know that its pluck its necessity something of both perhaps dont you feel afraid of what may happen no said joe california is a new country and there must be plenty of work now i am willing to work and i dont believe i shall starve thats the way to feel joe at the worst you have me to fall back upon i wont see you suffer it is very lucky for me i hope i shant give you any trouble if you do ill tell you of it said folsom laughing the fact is i feel rather as if i were your guardian an odd feeling that as hitherto i have been looked after by others now it is my turn to assume authority you will find me obedient said joe smiling seriously i am so inexperienced in the way of the world that i shall consider it a great favor if you will give me any hints you may think useful to me folsom became more and more pleased with his young charge he saw that he was manly amiable and of good principles with only one great fault poverty which he was quite willing to overlook they selected their seats in the saloon and were fortunate enough to be assigned to the captains table old travelers know that those who sit at this table are likely to fare better than those who are farther removed while folsom was walking the deck with an old friend whom he had found among the passengers joe went on an exploring expedition he made his way to that portion of the deck appropriated to the steerage passengers among them his eye fell on the man who swindled him you here exclaimed the fellow in amazement yes said joe i am here i thought you said your ticket wasnt good it wasnt as you very well know i dont know anything about it how did you smuggle yourself aboard i didnt smuggle myself aboard at all i came on like the rest of the passengers why havent i seen you before i am not a steerage passenger i am traveling firstclass you dont mean it ejaculated the fellow thoroughly astonished you told me you hadnt any more money so i did and that shows that you were the man that sold me the bogus ticket nothing of the kind said the other but he seemed taken aback by joes charge well all i can say is that you know how to get round when a man or boy can travel firstclass without a cent of money hell do i wouldnt have come at all if i had had to swindle a poor boy out of his money said joe joe walked off without receiving an answer he took pains to ascertain the name of the man who had defrauded him he was entered on the passengerlist as henry hogan chapter x the detected thief do you expect to be seasick joe i dont know mr folsom this is the first time i have ever been at sea i have crossed the atlantic twice and been sick each time i suppose i have a tendency that way how does it feel asked joe curiously folsom laughed it cannot be described he answered then i would rather remain ignorant said joe you are right this is a case where ignorance is bliss decidedly twentyfour hours out folsoms anticipations were realized he experienced nausea and his head swam returning from a walk on deck joe found his guardian lying down in the stateroom is anything the matter mr folsom nothing but what i expected the demon of the sea has me in his gripe can i do anything for you nothing at present joe what art can minister to a stomach diseased i must wait patiently and it will wear off dont you feel any of the symptoms oh no i feel bully said joe ive got a capital appetite i hope you will be spared it would be dismal for both of us to be groaning with seasickness shall i stay with you no go on deck that is the best way to keep well my sickness wont last more than a day or two the young mans expectations were realized after fortyeight hours he recovered from his temporary indisposition and reappeared on deck he found that his young companion had made a number of acquaintances and had become a general favorite through his frank and pleasant manners i think youll get on joe said he you make friends easily i try to do it said joe modestly you are fast getting over your country greenness of course you couldnt help having a share of it having never lived outside of a small country village i am glad you think so mr folsom i suppose i was very green and i havent got over it yet but in six months i hope to get rid of it wholly it wont take six months at the rate you are advancing day succeeded day and joe was not sick at all he carried a good appetite to every meal and entered into the pleasures of sea life with zest he played shuffleboard on deck guessed daily the ships run was on the alert for distant sails and managed in one way or another to while away the time cheerfully they had got into the gulf of mexico when one day there was an unwonted commotion in the steerage a poor german had lost forty dollars the entire capital he was carrying with him to the new country some tief has rob me he complained in accents of mingled grief and anger he has rob me of all my gold he has not left me one cent when did you miss the money inquired the first officer just now said the poor german when did you see it last last night when i went to mine bed did you take off your clothes no what men sleep near you the german pointed to two the first was a german but he would not rob me he is mine friend he said he is fritz who is the other man the german pointed to henry hogan the same man who had defrauded joe the mans a fool said hogan does he mean to say a gentleman like me would steal his paltry money he hasnt said so said the first officer quietly he only said that you slept near him hed better not accuse me blustered hogan the officer was a judge of human nature and hogans manner and words made him suspect that he was really the guilty party my man said he you are making a fuss before you are accused no charge has been made against you the mans money has been taken and some one must have taken it i dont believe he ever had any said hogan can you prove that you had the money asked the officer addressing the german has any one on board seen it in your possession an irishman named riley came forward that can i do said he it was only yesterday morning that i saw the man counting his money in what denomination was the money pat riley scratched his head sure i didnt know that money belonged to any denomination sir the officer smiled i mean was it in five or ten or twenty dollar pieces there was four tens sir four gould eagles is that right inquired the officer turning to the german yes sir thats what i had then said the officer it seems clearly proved that our german friend here had the money he claims now i suggest that the two men he has said occupied bunks nearest to him shall be searched but first if the man who has taken the money will come forward voluntarily and return the same i will guarantee that he shall receive no punishment he paused for a brief space and looked at hogan hogan seemed uneasy but stolid and obstinate since my offer is not accepted said the officer let the two men be searched fritz the young german came forward readily i am ready he said i am not said hogan i protest against this outrage it is an infringement of my rights as an american citizen if any one dares to lay hands on me i will have him arrested as soon as we reach california his threat produced no effect upon the officer at a signal two sailors seized him and despite his struggles turned his pockets inside out among the contents were found four gold eagles it is my money exclaimed the poor german you lie the money is mine said hogan furiously there was a cross which i scratched with a pin on one piece said the german look see if it is there examination was made and the scratch was found just as he described it the money evidently belongs to the german said the officer give it to him you are robbing me of my money said hogan look here my friend you had better be quiet said the officer significantly or i will have you tied up to keep out of mischief you are getting off very well as it is i have no doubt you have been up to other dishonest tricks before this one that is true sir said joe speaking up for the first time this is the same man who sold me a bogus ticket two days before we sailed for fifty dollars its a lie said hogan ill be even with you some time boy for that lie of yours i dont care for the threats of such a scoundrel as you are said joe undauntedly look out for him joe said folsom he will try to do you a mischief some time he would have been confirmed in his opinion had he observed the glance of hatred with which the detected thief followed his young ward chapter xi joe arrives in san francisco at the isthmus they exchanged steamers crossing the narrow neck of land on the backs of mules today the journey is more rapidly and comfortably made in a railroadcar of the voyage on the pacific nothing need be said the weather was fair and it was uneventful it was a beautiful morning in early september when they came in sight of the golden gate and entering the more placid waters of san francisco bay moored at a short distance from the town what do you think of it joe asked charles folsom i dont know said joe slowly is this really san francisco it is really san francisco it doesnt seem to be much built up yet said joe in fact the appearance of the town would hardly suggest the stately capital of today which looks out like a queen on the bay and the ocean and on either side opens her arms to the eastern and western continents it was a town of tents and onestory cabins irregularly and picturesquely scattered over the hillside with here and there a sawmill where now stand some of the most prominent buildings of the modern city for years later there was a large mound of sand where now the stately palace hotel covers two and a half acres where now stand substantial business blocks a quarter of a century since there appeared only sandy beaches or mudflats with here and there a wooden pier reaching out into the bay only five years before the town contained but seventynine buildings thirtyone frame twentysix adobe and the rest shanties it had grown largely since then but even now was only a straggling village with the air of recent settlement you expected something more joe didnt you yes admitted joe you must remember how new it is ten years nay five will work a great change in this straggling village we shall probably live to see it a city of a hundred thousand inhabitants the passengers were eager to land they were tired of the long voyage and anxious to get on shore they wanted to begin making their fortunes what are your plans joe asked charles folsom i shall accept the first job that offers said joe i cant afford to remain idle long with my small capital joe said the young man seriously let me increase your capital for you you can pay me back you know when it is convenient here take this gold piece our young hero shook his head thank you mr folsom he said you are very kind but i think it will be better for me to shift on what i have then i shall have to go to work at once and shall get started in my new career suppose you cant find work suggested folsom i will find it said joe resolutely perhaps we might take lodgings together joe i cant afford it said joe youre a gentleman of property and im a poor boy who has his fortune to make for the present i must expect to rough it well joe perhaps you are right at any rate i admire your pluck and independent spirit there was a motley crowd collected on the pier and on the beach when joe and his friend landed rough bearded men in mexican sombreros and coarse attire many in shirtsleeves and with their pantaloons tucked in their boots watched the new arrivals with interest you neednt feel ashamed of your clothes joe said folsom with a smile you are better dressed than the majority of those we see joe looked puzzled they dont look as if they had made their fortunes he said dont judge by appearances in a new country people are careless of appearances some of these rough fellows no doubt have their pockets full of gold at this moment a roughlooking fellow stepped forward and said heartily isnt this charles folsom yes answered folsom puzzled you dont remember me said the other laughing not i not remember harry carter your old chum good heaven exclaimed folsom surveying anew the rough figure before him you dont mean to say you are harry carter the same at your service what a transformation why you used to be rather a swell and now now i look like a barbarian well rather said folsom laughing you want me to explain such toggery as i used to wear would be the height of folly at the mines i hope you have had good luck said folsom pretty fair said carter in a tone of satisfaction my pile has reached five thousand dollars and how long have you been at work a year i was a bookkeeper in new york on a salary of fifteen hundred dollars a year i used to spend all my income the more fool i till the last six months when i laid by enough to bring me out here then you have really bettered yourself i should say so i could only save up five hundred dollars a year at the best in new york here i have crowded ten years into one in spite of your large outlay for clothes i see you will have your joke now what brings you out here are you going to the mines presently but not to dig i came to survey the country let me do what i can for you i will first what hotel shall i go to there is the leidesdorff house on california street ill lead you there thank you will you come joe yes i will go to find out where it is the three bent their steps to the hotel referred to it was a shanty compared with the magnificent hotels which now open their portals to strangers but the charge was ten dollars a day and the fare was of the plainest i guess i wont stop here said joe my money wouldnt keep me here more than an hour or two at any rate joe you must dine with me said folsom then you may start out for yourself you must dine with me both of you said carter folsom saw that he was in earnest and accepted the dinner was plain but abundant and all three did justice to it joe did not know till afterward that the dinner cost five dollars apiece after dinner the two friends sat down to talk over old times and mutual friends but joe felt that there was no time for him to lose he had his fortune to make still more important he had his living to make and in a place where dollars were held as cheap as dimes in new york or boston so emerging into the street with his small bundle under his arm he bent his steps as chance directed chapter xii joe finds a job joe knew nothing about the streets or their names chance brought him to clay street between what is now montgomery and kearny streets outside of a low wooden building which appeared to be a restaurant was a load of wood i wonder if i couldnt get the chance to saw and split that wood thought joe it would not do to be bashful so he went in a stout man in an apron was waiting on the guests joe concluded that this must be the proprietor sit down boy said he if you want some dinner ive had my dinner said joe dont you want that wood outside sawed and split yes let me do it go ahead there was a saw and sawhorse outside the work was not new to joe and he went at it vigorously no bargain had been made but joe knew so little of what would be considered a fair price that in this first instance he chose to leave it to his employer as he was at work folsom and his friend passed by have you found a job already said folsom yes sir you have kept your promise joe you said you would take the first job that offered yes mr folsom i meant what i said come round to the leidesdorff house this evening and tell me how you made out thank you sir i will that seems a smart boy said carter yes he is help him along if you have a chance i will i like his pluck he has no false pride he is ready to do anything everybody is here you know jim graves who used to have his shingle up as a lawyer on nassau street yes is he here he has been here three months what do you think he is doing i couldnt guess i dont think you could he has turned drayman charles folsom gazed at his friend in wonder turned drayman he exclaimed is he reduced to that reduced to that my dear fellow you dont understand the use of language graves is earning fifteen dollars a day at his business and i dont believe he made that in new york in a month well it is a strange state of society does he mean to be a drayman all his life of course not a year hence he may be a capitalist or a lawyer again meanwhile he is saving money he is a sensible man after all but you see carter it takes time to adjust my ideas to things here the first surprise was your rough appearance there is one advantage my rough life has brought me said carter it has improved my health i was given to dyspepsia when i lived in new york now i really believe i could digest a tenpenny nail or an eatinghouse mince pie which is more difficult you have steep hills in san francisco yes it is something of a climb to the top of clay street hill when you get to the top you get a fine view though now the hill may be ascended in cars drawn up the steeply graded sides by an endless rope running just below the surface no such arrangement had been thought of then folsom gave out when he had completed half the ascent ill be satisfied with the prospect from here he said meanwhile joe kept steadily at his task it will take me three hours and a half possibly four he said to himself after a survey of the pile i wonder what pay i shall receive while thus employed many persons passed him one among them paused and accosted him so you have found work already he said looking up joe recognized harry hogan the man who had swindled him he didnt feel inclined to be very social with this man yes said he coldly rather strange work for a firstclass passenger he envied joe because he had traveled firstclass while he had thought himself fortunate with the help his dishonesty gave him in being able to come by steerage it is very suitable employment for a boy who has no money said joe how much are you going to be paid for the job asked hogan with sudden interest for ten dollars constituted his only remaining funds if his theft on shipboard had not been detected he would have been better provided i dont know said joe shortly you didnt make any bargain then no what are you going to do next inquired hogan i dont know said joe hogan finally moved off i hate that boy he soliloquized he puts on airs for a country boy so hes getting too proud to talk to me is he well see mr joseph mason joe kept on till his task was completed put on his coat and went into the restaurant it was the supperhour ive finished the job said joe in a businesslike tone the german took a look at joes work you did it up good he said how much you want i dont know what would be a fair price i will give you some supper and five dollars joe could hardly believe his ears five dollars and a supper for four hours work surely he had come to the land of gold in very truth will dat do oh yes said joe i didnt expect so much you shouldnt tell me dat it isnt business joe pocketed the gold piece which he received with a thrill of exultation he had never received so much in value for a weeks work before just then a man paid two dollars for a very plain supper that makes my pay seven dollars said joe to himself if i can get steady work i can get rich very quick he thought there was one thing however that joe did not take into account if his earnings were likely to be large his expenses would be large too so he might receive a good deal of money and not lay up a cent shall you have any more work to do asked joe not shoost now answered the german you can look round in a week maybe i have some then chapter xiii joes hotel before going to the leidesdorff house to call upon his friend folsom joe thought he would try to make arrangements for the night he came to the st francis hotel on the corner of dupont and clay streets there was an outside stair that led to the balcony that ran all round the second story the doors of the rooms opened upon this balcony a man came out from the office can i get lodging here asked joe yes how much do you charge three dollars he must take me for a millionaire thought joe i cant afford it he said as joe descended the stairs he did not feel quite so rich six dollars wont go far when lodging costs three dollars and supper two continuing his wanderings joe came to a tent which seemed to be a hotel in its way for it had lodgings inscribed on the canvas in front what do you charge for lodgings joe inquired a dollar was the reply looking in joe saw that the accommodations were of the plainest thin pallets were spread about without pillows joe was not used to luxury but to sleep here would be roughing it even for him but he was prepared to rough it and concluded that he might as well pass the night here all right said he ill be round by and by do you want to pay in advance to secure your bed i guess not ill take the risk joe went on to the leidesdorff hotel and was cordially received by mr folsom how much have you earned today joe five dollars and my supper thats good is the job finished yes sir and you have nothing in view for tomorrow no sir but i guess i shall run across a job where are you going to spend the night in a tent a little way down the street how much will they charge you one dollar i wish my bed was large enough to hold two you should be welcome to a share of it but they dont provide very wide bedsteads in this country mr folsoms bed was about eighteen inches wide thank you sir said joe i shall do very well in the tent i am sure i am thinking of making a trip to the mines with my friend carter continued folsom very likely we shall start tomorrow do you want to go with us i expect to go to the mines said joe but i think i had better remain awhile in san francisco and lay by a little money you know i am in debt in debt yes for my passage i should like to pay that off there is no hurry about it joe id like to get it off my mind mr folsom about nine oclock joe left the hotel and sought the tent where he proposed to pass the night he was required to pay in advance and willingly did so chapter xiv joes second day joe woke up at seven oclock the next morning though his bed was hard he slept well for he was fatigued he stretched himself and sat up on his pallet it is needless to say that he had not undressed three or four men were lying near him all fast asleep except one and that one he recognized as henry hogan halloo said hogan you here yes said joe not overpleased at the meeting we seem to keep together said hogan with a grin so it seems said joe coldly hogan however seemed disposed to be friendly pretty rough accommodations for the money it doesnt make so much difference where money is earned easily how much money did you make yesterday joes first thought was to tell him it was none of his business but he thought better of it i made seven dollars said he rather proudly pretty good but i beat you said hogan how much did you make ill show you hogan showed five halfeagles i made it in ten minutes he said joe was decidedly mystified you are fooling me he said no i am not i made it at the gamingtable oh said joe a little startled for he had been brought up to think gambling wicked better come and try your luck with me said hogan it is easier and quicker than sawing wood perhaps it is said joe but id rather saw wood i suspect you are a young puritan perhaps i am said joe at any rate i dont mean to gamble just as you like i cant afford to be so particular you dont seem to be very particular said joe what do you mean inquired hogan suspiciously you know well enough said joe you know the way you had of getting money in new york you know the way you tried to get it on board the steamer look here young fellow said hogan menacingly ive heard enough of this you wont find it safe to run against me im a tough customer youll find i dont doubt it said joe then just be careful will you i aint going to have you slander me and prejudice people against me and i mean to protect myself do you understand me i think i do mr hogan but i dont feel particularly alarmed joe got up and went out in search of breakfast be thought of the place where he took supper but was deterred from going there by the high prices i suppose i shall have to pay a dollar for my breakfast he thought but i cant afford to pay two my capital is reduced to five dollars and i may not be able to get anything to do today joe finally succeeded in finding a humble place where for a dollar he obtained a cup of coffee a plate of cold meat and as much bread as he could eat i shall have to make it do with two meals a day thought our hero then it will cost me three dollars a day to live including lodging and i shall have to be pretty lucky to make that after breakfast joe walked about the streets hoping that something would turn up but his luck did not seem to be so good as the day before hour after hour passed and no chance offered itself as he was walking along feeling somewhat anxious he met hogan lend me a dollar said hogan quickly im dead broke where has all your money gone asked joe lost it at faro lend me a dollar and ill win it all back i have no money to spare said joe decidedly curse you for a young skinflint said hogan scowling ill get even with you yet chapter xv the foiled assassin about four oclock joe went into a restaurant and got some dinner in spite of his wish to be economical his dinner bill amounted to a dollar and a half and now his cash in hand was reduced to two dollars and a half joe began to feel uneasy this wont do he said to himself at this rate i shall soon be penniless i must get something to do in the evening he strolled down montgomery street to telegraph hill it was not a very choice locality the only buildings being shabby little dens frequented by a class of social outlaws who kept concealed during the day but came out at night a class to which the outrages frequent at this time were rightly attributed joe was stumbling along the uneven path when all at once he found himself confronted by a tall fellow wearing a slouched hat the man paused in front of him but did not say a word finding that he was not disposed to move aside joe stepped aside himself he did not as yet suspect the fellows purpose he understood it however when a heavy hand was laid on his shoulder quick boy your money said the ruffian having but two dollars and a half joe naturally felt reluctant to part with it and this gave him the courage to object ive got none to spare he said and tried to tear himself away his resistance led the fellow to suspect that he had a considerable sum with him joe felt himself seized and carried into a den close by which was frequented by thieves and desperate characters there was a counter on which was set a dim oillamp there were a few bottles in sight and a villainouslooking fellow appeared to preside over the establishment the latter looked up as joe was brought in who have you there asked the barkeeper a young cove as dont want to part with his money youd better hand over what youve got young un joe looked from one to the other and thought he had never seen such villainous faces before what are you lookin at demanded his captor suspiciously you want to know us again do you maybe youd like to get us hauled up would you i dont want ever to set eyes on you again thats the way to talk as soon as our business is over there aint no occasion for our meetin again dont you go to point us out or he didnt finish the sentence but whipped out a long knife which made any further remarks unnecessary under the circumstances resistance would be madness and joe drew out his money is that all youve got demanded the thief every cent said joe it wont leave me anything to pay for my nights lodging then you can sleep out ive done it many a time but ill take the liberty of searching you and seeing if you tell the truth or not just as you like said joe joe was searched but no more money was found the boys told the truth said his captor two dollars and a half is a pretty small haul i am sorry gentlemen that i havent anything more it isnt my fault for ive tried hard to get something to do today and couldnt youre a cool customer said the barkeeper i expect to be tonight for i shall have to sleep out you can go said his captor as he opened the door of the den and dont come round here again unless youve got more money with you i dont think i shall said joe when joe found himself penniless he really felt less anxious than when he had at least money enough to pay for lodging and breakfast having lost everything any turn of fortune must be for the better something has got to turn up pretty quick thought joe its just as well i didnt get a job today i should only have had more money to lose he had not walked a hundred feet when his attention was called to the figure of a gentleman walking some rods in front of him he saw it but indistinctly and would not have given it a second thought had he not seen that the person whoever he might be was stealthily followed by a man who in general appearance resembled the rascal who had robbed him of his money the pursuer carried in his hand a canvas bag filled with sand this though joe did not know it was a dangerous weapon in the hands of a lawless human brought down heavily upon the head of an unlucky traveler it often produced instant death without leaving any outward marks that would indicate death from violence though joe didnt comprehend the use of the sandbag his own recent experience and the stealthy movement of the man behind convinced him that mischief was intended he would have been excusable if being but a boy and no match for an ablebodied ruffian he had got out of the way but joe had more courage than falls to the share of most boys of sixteen he felt a chivalrous desire to rescue the unsuspecting stranger from the peril that menaced him joe too imitating the stealthy motion of the pursuer swiftly gained upon him overtaking him just as he had the sandbag poised aloft ready to be brought down upon the head of the traveler with a cry joe rushed upon the wouldbe assassin causing him to stumble and fall while the gentleman in front turned round in amazement joe sprang to his side have you a pistol he said quickly scarcely knowing what he did the gentleman drew out a pistol and put it in joes hand joe cocked it and stood facing the ruffian the desperado was on his feet fury in his looks and a curse upon his lips he swung the sandbag aloft curse you he said ill make you pay for this one step forward said joe in a clear distinct voice which betrayed not a particle of fear and i will put a bullet through your brain the assassin stepped back he was a coward who attacked from behind he looked in the boys resolute face and he saw he was in earnest put down that weapon you whippersnapper not much answered joe ive a great mind to kill you ive no doubt of it said our hero but youd better not attack me i am armed and i will fire if you make it necessary now turn round and leave us will you promise not to shoot yes if you go off quietly the order was obeyed but not very willingly when the highwayman had moved off joe said now sir wed better be moving and pretty quickly or the fellow may return with some of his friends and overpower us where are you stopping at the waverly house that is nearby we will go there at once they soon reached the hotel a large wooden building on the north side of pacific street joe was about to bid his acquaintance good night but the latter detained him come in my boy he said you have done me a great service i must know more of you chapter xvi joes new friend come up to my room said the stranger he obtained a candle at the office gas not being used in san francisco at that time and led the way to a small chamber on the second floor now sit down my boy and tell me your name joseph mason how long have you been here less than a week i only arrived yesterday but for your help my residence might have been a brief one i am glad i have been able to be of service to you you were a friend in need and a friend in need is a friend indeed it is only fair that i should be a friend to you its a poor rule that doesnt work both ways joe was favorably impressed with the speakers appearance he was a man of middle height rather stout with a florid complexion and an open friendly face thank you sir he said i need a friend and shall be glad of your friendship then heres my hand take it and let us ratify our friendship joe took the proffered hand and shook it cordially my name is george morgan said the stranger i came from philadelphia now we know each other where are you staying joes face flushed and he looked embarrassed just before i came up with you he answered thinking frankness best i was robbed of two dollars and a half all the money i had in this world i shall have to stop in the streets tonight not if i know it said morgan emphatically this bed isnt very large but you are welcome to a share of it tomorrow we will form our plans shant i inconvenience you sir asked joe not a bit answered morgan heartily then i will stay sir and thank you after the adventure i have had tonight i shouldnt enjoy being out in the streets tell me how you came to be robbed was it by the same man who made the attack upon me no sir i wish it had been as then i should feel even with him it was a man that looked very much like him though joe gave an account of the robbery to which his new friend listened with attention evidently he said the street we were in is not a very safe one have you had any supper oh yes sir luckily i got that and paid for it before i had my money taken good now as i am tired i will go to bed and you can follow when you feel inclined i will go now sir i have been walking the streets all day in search of work and though i found none i am tired all the same they woke up at seven oclock how did you rest joe asked george morgan very well sir do you feel ready for breakfast as soon as i can earn money enough to pay for it dont trouble yourself about that you are going to breakfast with me you are very kind mr morgan but i wish you had some work for me to do so that i could pay you that may come after awhile it might not be safe to delay your breakfast till you could pay for it remember you have done me a great service which fifty breakfasts couldnt pay for dont think of that mr morgan said joe modestly anybody would do what i did i am not sure whether everybody would have the courage but you must leave me to show my appreciation of your services in my own way they took breakfast in the hotel and walked out though it was early the town was already astir people got up early in those days building was going on here and there draymen were piloting heavy loads through the streets rough enough in general appearance but drawn from very unlikely social grades by jove said morgan in surprise his glance resting on a young man of twentyfive who was in command of a dray do you hear that drayman is he a foreigner asked joe i dont understand what he is saying he is talking to his horse in greek quoting from homer look here my friend he said hailing the drayman what is it sir said the young man courteously didnt i hear you quoting greek just now yes sir how happens it that a classical scholar like you finds himself in such a position the young man smiled how much do you think i am earning i cant guess i am a stranger in this city twenty dollars a day capital i dont feel as much surprised as i did are you a college graduate yes sir i was graduated at yale then i studied law and three months since i came out here it takes time to get into practise at home and i had no resources to fall back upon i raised money enough to bring me to california and came near starving the first week i was here i couldnt wait to get professional work but i had an offer to drive a dray i am a farmers son and was accustomed to hard work as a boy i accepted the offer and here i am i can lay up half my earnings and am quite satisfied but you wont be a drayman all your life oh no sir but i may as well keep at it till i can get into something more to my taste and the young lawyer drove off its a queer country said morgan its hard to gauge a man by his occupation here i see i wish i could get a dray to drive said joe you are not old enough or strong enough yet i am looking for some business myself joe but i cant at all tell what i shall drift into at home i was a drygoods merchant my partner and i disagreed and i sold out to him i drew ten thousand dollars out of the concern invested fourfifths of it and have come out here with the remainder to see what i can do ten thousand dollars what a rich man you must be said joe in your eyes my boy as you get older you will find that it will not seem so large to you at any rate i hope to increase it considerably they were walking on kearny street near california street when joes attention was drawn to a sign this restaurant for sale it was a onestory building of small dimensions not fashionable nor elegant in its appointments but there wasnt much style in san francisco at that time would you like to buy out the restaurant asked morgan i dont feel like buying anything out with empty pockets said joe let us go in the proprietor was a man of middle age why do you wish to sell out asked morgan i want to go to the mines i need an outofdoor life and want a change does this business pay sometimes i have made seventyfive dollars profit in a day how much do you ask for the business ill take five hundred dollars cash have you a reliable cook yes he knows his business will he stay for the present if you want a profitable business you will do well to buy i dont want it for myself i want it for this young man for this boy asked the restaurantkeeper surprised joe looked equally surprised chapter xvii joe starts in business do you think you can keep a hotel joe asked morgan i can try said joe promptly come in gentlemen said the restaurantkeeper we can talk best inside the room was small holding but six tables in the rear was the kitchen let me see your scale of prices said morgan it was shown him i could breakfast cheaper at delmonicos he said and better said the proprietor of the restaurant but i find people here willing to pay big prices and as long as thats the case i should be a fool to reduce them yes theres a splendid profit to be made in the business i ought to charge a thousand dollars instead of five hundred why dont you asked morgan bluntly because i couldnt get it most men when they come out here are not content to settle down in the town they wont be satisfied till they get to the mines that seems to be the case with you too it isnt that altogether my lungs are weak and confinement isnt good for me besides the doctors say the climate in the interior is better for pulmonary affections what rent do you have to pay a small groundrent i put up this building myself how soon can you give possession right off will you stay here three days to initiate my young friend into the mysteries of the business oh yes ill do that willingly then i will buy you out in five minutes the business was settled joe said morgan let me congratulate you you are now one of the business men of san francisco it seems like a dream to me mr morgan said joe this morning when i waked up i wasnt worth a cent and now you own five hundred dollars said mr morgan laughing that wasnt exactly the way i thought of it sir but are you not afraid to trust me to that amount no i am not joe said morgan seriously i think you are a boy of energy and integrity i dont see why you shouldnt succeed suppose i shouldnt i shall not trouble myself about the loss in all probability you saved my life last evening that is worth to me many times what i have invested for you i want to give you my note for the money said joe if i live i will pay you with interest i agree with you we may as well put it on a business basis papers were drawn up and joe found himself proprietor of the restaurant he lost no opportunity of mastering the details of the business he learned where his predecessor obtained his supplies what prices he paid about how much he required for a days consumption and what was his scale of prices do you live here mr brock asked joe yes i have a bed which i lay in a corner of the restaurant thus i avoid the expense of a room outside and am on hand early for business ill do the same said joe promptly in that way you will have no personal expenses except clothing and washing said brock i shall be glad to have no bills to pay for board said joe thats rather a steep item here so it is i dont see but i can save up pretty much all i make said joe certainly you can in two days joe who was naturally quick and whose natural shrewdness was sharpened by his personal interest mastered the details of the business and felt that he could manage alone mr brock said he you promised to stay with me three days but i wont insist upon the third day i think i can get along well without you if you can i shall be glad to leave you at once the fact is a friend of mine starts for the mines tomorrow and i would like to accompany him i asked him to put it off a day but he thinks he cant go with him by all means i can get along so on the morning of the third day joe found himself alone at the end of the first week he made a careful estimate of his expenses and receipts and found to his astonishment that he had cleared two hundred dollars it seemed to him almost incredible and he went over the calculations again and again but he could figure out no other result two hundred dollars in one week he said to himself what would oscar say to that it seems like a fairy tale joe did not forget that he was five hundred dollars in debt he went to george morgan who had bought out for himself a gentlemens furnishing store and said mr morgan i want to pay up a part of that debt so soon joe how much do you want to pay a hundred and fifty dollars you dont mean to say that you have cleared that amount said morgan in amazement yes sir and fifty dollars more very well i will receive the money you do well to wipe out your debts as soon as possible joe paid over the money with no little satisfaction without going too much into detail it may be stated that at the end of a month joe was out of debt and had three hundred dollars over he called on the owner of the land to pay the monthly groundrent why dont you buy the land and get rid of the rent asked the owner do you want to sell asked joe yes i am about to return to the east what do you ask i own two adjoining lots you may have them all for a thousand dollars will you give me time i cant i want to return at once and i must have the cash a thought struck joe i will take three hours to consider said joe he went to george morgan and broached his business mr morgan he said will you lend me seven hundred dollars are you getting into pecuniary difficulties joe asked morgan concerned no sir but i want to buy some real estate explain yourself joe did so it is the best thing you can do said morgan i will lend you the money i hope to repay it inside of two months said joe i think you will judging from what you have done already in two hours joe had paid over the entire amount for it will be remembered that he had three hundred dollars of his own and was owner of three city lots now thought he i must attend to business and clear off the debt i have incurred i shant feel as if the land is mine till i have paid for it wholly joe found it a great advantage that he obtained his own board and lodging free though wages were high the necessary expenses of living were so large that a man earning five dollars a day was worse off oftentimes than one who was earning two dollars at the east how shall i make my restaurant more attractive thought joe he decided first that he would buy good articles and insist upon as much neatness as possible about the tables at many of the restaurants very little attention was paid to this and visitors who had been accustomed to neatness at home were repelled soon joes diningroom acquired a reputation and the patronage increased at the end of the third month he had not only paid up the original loan of seven hundred dollars but was the owner of the three lots and had four hundred dollars over he began to feel that his prosperity was founded on a solid basis one day about this time as he was at the desk where he received money from his patrons as they went out his attention was drawn to a rough fellow having the appearance of a tramp entering at the door the mans face seemed familiar to him and it flashed upon him that it was henry hogan who had defrauded him in new york the recognition was mutual you here he exclaimed in surprise so it seems said joe is it a good place i like it whos your boss myself you dont mean to say this is your own place yes i do well ill be blowed ejaculated hogan staring stupidly at joe chapter xviii mr hogans proposal joe enjoyed hogans amazement he felt rather proud of his rapid progress it was not four months since a poor country boy he had come up to new york and fallen a prey to a designing sharper now on the other side of the continent he was master of a business and owner of real estate the day has passed for such rapid progress california is no longer a new country and the conditions of living closely approximate those in the east i am careful to say this because i dont wish to mislead my young readers success is always attainable by pluck and persistency but the degree is dependent on circumstances how have you made out asked joe of his visitor ive had hard luck grumbled hogan i went to the mines but i wasnt lucky was that the case with other miners asked joe who had a shrewd suspicion that hogans ill luck was largely the result of his laziness and want of application no said hogan other men around me were lucky but i wasnt perhaps your claim was a poor one it was as long as i had anything to do with it said hogan i sold it out for a trifle and the next day the other man found a nugget wasnt that cursed hard he grumbled you ought to have kept on then you would have found the nugget no i shouldnt i am too unlucky if i had held on it wouldnt have been there youve got on well youre lucky yes i have no reason to complain but i wasnt lucky all the time i was robbed of every cent of money when i met a good friend who bought this business for me does it pay asked the other eagerly yes it pays said joe cautiously how much do you make say in a week asked hogan leaning his elbows on the counter and looking up in joes face really mr hogan said joe i dont feel called upon to tell my business to others i thought maybe youd tell an old friend said hogan joe could not help laughing at the mans matchless impudence i dont think you have treated me exactly like a friend mr hogan he said you certainly did all you could to prevent my coming to california theres some mistake about that said hogan youre under a misapprehension but i wont go into that matter now will you trust me for my supper yes said joe promptly sit down at that table the man had treated him badly but things had turned out favorably for joe and he would not let hogan suffer from hunger if he could relieve him hogan needed no second invitation he took a seat at a table nearby and ate enough for two men but joe could not repeat the invitation he had given he felt that he could not afford it it was rather late when hogan sat down when he finished he was the only one left in the restaurant except joe he sauntered up to the desk youve got a good cook said hogan picking his teeth with a knife yes answered joe i think so you say the business pays well yes it satisfies me are you alone have you no partner you could do better with one suppose you take me into business with you joe was considerably surprised at this proposition from a man who had swindled him how much capital can you furnish he asked i havent got any money im dead broke said hogan but i can give my services i can wait on the table ill do that and you can give me my board and onethird of the profits come now thats a good offer what do you say joe thought it best to be candid i dont want any partner mr hogan he said and i may as well tell you i dont think i should care to be associated with you if i did do you mean to insult me asked hogan scowling no but i may as well be candid whats the matter with me asked hogan roughly i dont like the way you do business said joe look here young one you put on too many airs just because youre keepin a onehorse restaurant said hogan angrily if its a onehorse restaurant why do you want to become my partner retorted joe coolly because im hard up i havent got a cent im sorry for you but a man neednt be in that condition long here where do you sleep asked hogan suddenly here i put a bed on the floor in one corner and so am on hand in the morning i say hogan continued insinuatingly wont you let me stay here tonight sleep here yes id rather not mr hogan i havent a cent to pay for a lodging if you dont take me in i shall have to stay in the street all night youve slept out at the mines havent you yes then you can do it here youre hard on a poor man whined hogan it wouldnt cost you anything to let me sleep here no it wouldnt said joe but i prefer to choose my own company at night i may catch my death of cold said hogan i hope not but i dont keep lodgings said joe firmly you havent any feeling for an unlucky man i have given you your supper and not stinted you in any way what you ate would cost two dollars at my regular prices i wasnt called to do it for you never did me any service and you are owing me today fifty dollars which you cheated me out of when i was a poor boy i wont let you lodge here but i will give you a breakfast in the morning if you choose to come round then you will be strengthened for a days work and can see what you can find to do hogan saw that joe was in earnest and walked out of the restaurant without a word when joe was about to close his doors for the night his attention was drawn to a man who was sitting down on the ground a few feet distant with his head buried between his two hands in an attitude expressive of despondency joe was warmhearted and sympathetic and after a moments hesitation addressed the stranger is anything the matter with you sir he asked dont you feel well the man addressed raised his head he was a stout strongly built man roughly dressed but had a look which inspired confidence i may as well tell you boy he answered though you cant help me ive been a cursed fool thats whats the matter if you dont mind telling me said joe gently perhaps i can be of service to you the man shook his head i dont think you can he said but ill tell you for all that yesterday i came up from the mines with two thousand dollars i was about a year getting it together and to me it was a fortune im a shoemaker by occupation and lived in a town in massachusetts where i have a wife and two young children i left them a year ago to go to the mines i did well and the money i told you about would have made us all comfortable if i could only have got it home were you robbed of it asked joe remembering his own experience yes i was robbed of it but not in the way you are thinking of a wily scoundrel induced me to enter a gamblingden the bella union they call it i wouldnt play at first but soon the fascination seized me i saw a man win a hundred dollars and i thought i could do the same so i began and won a little then i lost and played on to get my money back in just an hour i was cleaned out of all i had now i am penniless and my poor family will suffer for my folly he buried his face in his hands once more and strong man as he was he wept aloud have you had any supper sir said joe compassionately no but i have no appetite have you any place to sleep no then i can offer you a supper and a nights lodging dont be discouraged in the morning we can talk the matter over and see what can be done the stranger rose and laid his hand on joes arm i dont know how it is he said but your words give me courage i believe you have saved my life i have a revolver left and i had a mind to blow my brains out would that have helped you or your family no boy i was a fool to think of it ill accept your offer and tomorrow ill see what i can do youre the best friend ive met since i left home chapter xix the unlucky miner joe brought out some cold meat and bread and butter and set it before his guest the fires gone out he said or i would give you some tea here is a glass of milk if you like it thank you boy said his visitor milk is good enough for anybody one thing i can say ive steered clear of liquor a brother of mine was intemperate and that was a warning to me i took credit to myself for being a steadygoing man compared with many of my acquaintances out at the mines but it dont do to boast ive done worse perhaps ive gambled away the provision i had made for my poor family dont take it too hard said joe in a tone of sympathy you know how it is out here down today and up tomorrow itll take me a long time to get up to where i was said the other but its my fault and i must make the best of it joe observed with satisfaction that his visitor was doing ample justice to the supper spread before him with a full stomach he would be likely to take more cheerful views of life and the future in this thought joe proved to be correct i didnt think i could eat anything said the miner laying down his knife and fork twenty minutes later but i have made a hearty supper thanks to your kindness things look a little brighter to me now ive had a hard pullback but all is not lost ive got to stay here a year or two longer instead of going back by the next steamer but i must make up my mind to that what is your name boy joe mason youve been kind to me and i wont forget it it doesnt seem likely i can return the favor but ill do it if ever i can good night to you where are you going asked joe surprised as the miner walked to the door out into the street but where do you mean to pass the night where a man without money must in the street but you mustnt do that i shant mind it ive slept out at the mines many a night but wont you find it more comfortable here yes but i dont want to intrude youve given me a good supper and that is all i can expect he doesnt seem much like hogan thought joe you are welcome to lodge here with me he said it will cost you nothing and will be more comfortable for you you dont know me joe said the miner how do you know but i may get up in the night and rob you you could but i dont think you will said joe i am not at all afraid of it you look like an honest man the miner looked gratified you shant repent your confidence joe he said id rather starve than rob a good friend like you but you mustnt trust everybody i dont said joe i refused a man tonight a man named hogan hogan yes what does he look like joe described him its the very man said the miner do you know him then yes he was out at our diggings nobody liked him or trusted him he was too lazy to work but just loafed around complaining of his luck one night i caught him in my tent just going to rob me i warned him to leave the camp next day or id report him and the boys would have strung him up thats the way they treat thieves out there it doesnt surprise me to hear it said joe he robbed me of fifty dollars in new york he did how was that joe told the story the mean skunk ejaculated watson for this joe found to be the miners name its mean enough to rob a man but to cheat a poor boy out of all he has is a good deal meaner and yet you gave him supper yes the man was hungry i pitied him youre a better christian than i am id have let him go hungry both joe and the miner were weary and they soon retired but not to uninterrupted slumber about midnight they were disturbed as the next chapter will show chapter xx hogan meets a congenial spirit when hogan left joes presence he was far from feeling as grateful as he ought for the kindness with which our hero had treated him instead of feeling thankful for the bountiful supper he was angry because joe had not permitted him to remain through the night had he obtained this favor he would have resented the refusal to take him into partnership there are some men who are always soliciting favors and demanding them as a right and hogan was one of them out in the street he paused a minute undecided where to go he had no money as he had truly said or he would have been tempted to go to a gamblinghouse and risk it on a chance of making more curse that boy he muttered as he sauntered along in the direction of telegraph hill whod have thought a green country clodhopper would have gone up as he has while an experienced man of the world like me is out at the elbows and without a cent the more hogan thought of this the more indignant he became he thrust both hands into his pantaloons pockets and strode moodily on i say its a cursed shame he muttered i never did have any luck thats a fact just see how luck comes to some with only a dollar or two in his pocket this joe got trusted for a firstclass passage out here while i had to come in the steerage then again he meets some fool who sets him up in business nobody ever offered to set me up in business continued hogan feeling aggrieved at fortune for her partiality nobody even offered to give me a start in life i have to work hard and thats all the good it does the fact was that hogan had not done a whole days work for years but such men are very apt to deceive themselves and possibly he imagined himself a hardworking man its disgusting to see the airs that boy puts on he continued to soliloquize its nothing but luck he cant help getting on with everybody to help him why didnt he let me sleep in his place tonight it wouldnt have cost him a cent then hogan drifted off into calculations of how much money joe was making by his business he knew the prices charged for meals and that they afforded a large margin of profit the more he thought of it the more impressed he was with the extent of joes luck the boy must be making his fortune he said to himself why he cant help clearing from one to two hundred dollars a week perhaps more its a moneymaking business theres no doubt of it why couldnt he take me in as partner that would set me on my legs again and in time id be rich id make him sell out and get the whole thing after awhile so hogan persuaded himself into the conviction that joe ought to have accepted him as partner though why this should be since his only claim rested on his successful attempt to defraud him in new york it would be difficult to conjecture sauntering slowly along hogan had reached the corner of pacific street then a dark and suspicious locality in the immediate neighborhood of a number of low public houses of bad reputation the night was dark for there was no moon suddenly he felt himself seized in a tight grip while a low stern voice in his ear demanded your money and be quick about it hogan was not a brave man but this demand in his impecunious condition instead of terrifying him struck his sense of humor as an exceedingly good joke youve got the wrong man he chuckled stop your fooling and hand over your money quickly was the stern rejoinder my dear friend said hogan if you can find any money about me its more than i can do myself are you on the square demanded the other suspiciously look at me and see the highwayman took him at his word lighting a match he surveyed his captive you dont look wealthy thats a fact he admitted where are you going i dont know i havent got any money nor any place to sleep then youd better be leaving this place or another mistake may be made stop said hogan with a sudden thought though i havent any money i can tell you where we can both find some do you mean it yes come in here then and come to business he led hogan into a low shanty on pacific street and bidding him be seated on a broken settee waited for particulars chapter xxi ready for mischief though hogan was a scamp in the superlative degree the burly ruffian who seated himself by his side looked the character much better he was not a man to beat about the bush as he expressed it he wanted to come to business at once whats your game pard he demanded out with it hogans plan as the reader has already surmised was to break into joes restaurant and seize whatever money he might be found to have on the premises he recommended it earnestly for two reasons first a share of the money would be welcome and secondly he would be gratified to revenge himself upon the boy whom he disliked because he had injured him jack rafferty listened in silence i dont know about it he said theres a risk i dont see any risk we two ought to be a match for a boy of course we are if we wasnt id go hang myself up for a milksop are you sure theres no one else with him not a soul thats well so far but we might be seen from the outside we can keep watch do you think the boys got much money about him yes hes making money hand over fist hes one of those mean chaps that never spend a cent but lay it all by bah so hogan expressed his contempt for joes frugality all the better for us how much might there be now do you think five hundred dollars likely thats worth risking something for said jack thoughtfully well share alike inquired hogan anxiously depends on how much you help about gettin the money said jack carelessly hogan who was not very courageous did not dare push the matter though he would have liked a more definite assurance however he had another motive besides the love of money and was glad to have the cooperation of rafferty though secretly afraid of his ruffianly accomplice it was agreed to wait till midnight till then both men threw themselves down and slept as the clock indicated midnight rafferty shook hogan roughly the latter sat up and gazed in terrified bewilderment at jack who was leaning over him forgetting for the moment the compact into which he had entered what do you want he ejaculated its time we were about our business growled jack its struck twelve all right responded hogan who began to feel nervous now that the crisis was at hand dont sit rubbing your eyes man but get up havent you got a drop of something to brace me up asked hogan nervously what are you scared of pard asked rafferty contemptuously nothing answered hogan but i feel dry all right a drop of something will warm us both up jack went behind the counter and selecting a bottle of rotgut whisky poured out a stiff glassful apiece drink it pard he said hogan did so nothing loath thats the right sort he said smacking his lips its warming to the stomach so it was and a frequent indulgence in the vile liquid would probably have burned his stomach and unfitted it for service but the momentary effect was stimulating and inspired hogan with a kind of dutch courage which raised him in the opinion of his burly confederate push ahead pard said he im on hand thats the way to talk said rafferty approvingly if were lucky well be richer before morning through the dark streets unlighted and murky the two confederates made their stealthy way and in five minutes stood in front of joes restaurant chapter xxii checkmated everything looked favorable for their plans of course the restaurant was perfectly dark and the street was quite deserted how shall we get in asked hogan of his more experienced accomplice no trouble through the winder rafferty had served an apprenticeship at the burglars trade and was not long in opening the front window he had no light and could not see that joe had a companion if he had discovered this he would have been more cautious go in and get the money said he to hogan he thought it possible that hogan might object but the latter had a reason for consenting he thought he might obtain for himself the lions share of the plunder while as to risk there would be no one but joe to cope with and hogan knew that in physical strength he must be more than a match for a boy of sixteen all right said hogan you stay at the window and give the alarm if we are seen rafferty was prompted by a suspicion of hogans good faith in the proposal he made to him his ready compliance lulled this suspicion and led him to reflect that perhaps he could do the work better himself no said he ill go in and you keep watch at the winder im willing to go in said hogan fearing that he would not get his fair share of the plunder you stay where you are pard said rafferty in a tone of command ill manage this thing myself just as you say said hogan slightly disappointed rafferty clambered into the room making as little noise as possible he stood still a moment to accustom his eyes to the darkness his plan was to discover where joe lay wake him up and force him by threats of instant death as the penalty for noncompliance to deliver up all the money he had in the restaurant now it happened that joe and his guest slept in opposite corners of the room rafferty discovered joe but was entirely ignorant of the presence of another person in the apartment joe waked on being rudely shaken who is it he muttered drowsily never mind who it is growled jack in his ear its a man thatll kill you if you dont give up all the money youve got about you joe was fully awake now and realized the situation he felt thankful that he was not alone and it instantly flashed upon him that watson had a revolver but watson was asleep to obtain time to form a plan he parleyed a little you want my money he asked appearing to be confused yes and at once refuse and i will kill you i wont pretend to deny that joes heart beat a little quicker than its wont he was thinking busily how could he attract watsons attention its pretty hard but i suppose i must he answered thats the way to talk let me get up and ill get it joe spoke so naturally that rafferty suspected nothing he permitted our hero to rise supposing that he was going for the money he demanded joe knew exactly where watson lay and went over to him he knelt down and drew out the revolver from beneath his head at the same time pushing him in the hope of arousing him the push was effectual watson was a man whose experience at the mines had taught him to rouse at once he just heard joe say hush what are you so long about demanded rafferty suspiciously ive got a revolver said joe unexpectedly and if you dont leave the room ill fire with an oath rafferty who was no coward sprang upon joe and it would have gone hard with him but for watson the latter was now broad awake he seized rafferty by the collar and dashing him backward upon the floor threw himself upon him two can play at that game said he light the candle joe help pard called rafferty but hogan on whom he called suspecting how matters stood was in full flight the candle was lighted and in the struggling ruffian joe recognized the man who three months before had robbed him of his little all chapter xxiii not wholly black i know this man mr watson said joe who is he he is the same man who robbed me of my money one night about three months ago the one i told you of for the first time rafferty recognized joe there wasnt enough to make a fuss about he said there was only two dollars and a half it was all i had let me up said rafferty renewing his struggles joe have you got a rope asked watson yes bring it here then i cant hold this man all night what are you going to do with me demanded rafferty uneasily tie you hand and foot till tomorrow morning and then deliver you over to the authorities no you wont he made a renewed struggle but watson was a man with muscles of iron and the attempt was unsuccessful it was not without considerable difficulty however that the midnight intruder was secured when at length he was bound hand and foot watson withdrew to a little distance joe and he looked at rafferty and each felt that he had seldom seen a more brutal face well growled rafferty i hope you are satisfied not yet returned watson when you are delivered into the hands of the authorities we shall be satisfied oh for an hours freedom muttered jack rafferty expressing his thoughts aloud what use would you make of it asked watson in a tone of curiosity id kill the man that led me into this trap watson and joe were surprised was there such a man didnt you come here alone no there was a man got me to come curse him he told me i would only find the boy here what has become of him he ran away i reckon instead of standing by me where was he at the winder could it have been hogan thought joe i think i know the man said our hero ill describe the man i mean and you can tell me if it was he he described hogan as well as he could thats the man said rafferty i wouldnt peach if he hadnt served me such a mean trick whats his name his name is hogan he came over on the same steamer with me after robbing me of fifty dollars in new york he has been at the mines but didnt make out well this very afternoon i gave him supper all he could eat and charged him nothing for it he repays me by planning a robbery hes a mean skunk said watson bluntly youre right stranger said rafferty im a scamp myself but ill be blowed if id turn on a man that fed me when i was hungry the tones were gruff but the man was evidently sincere youre better than you look said watson surprised to hear such a sentiment from a man of such ruffianly appearance jack rafferty laughed shortly i aint used to compliments he said and i expect im bad enough but i aint all bad i wont turn on my pal unless he does it first and i aint mean enough to rob a man thats done me a good turn no you aint all bad said watson its a pity you wont make up your mind to earn an honest living too late for that i reckon what do you think theyll do with me in those days punishments were summary and severe watson knew it and joe had seen something of it our hero began to feel compassion for the foiled burglar he whispered in watsons ear watson hesitated but finally yielded stranger said he the boy wants me to let you go does he inquired rafferty in surprise yes he is afraid it will go hard with you if we give you up likely it will muttered rafferty watching watsons face eagerly to see whether he favored joes proposal suppose we let you go will you promise not to make another attempt upon this place what do you take me for im not such a mean cuss as that one thing more you wont kill this man that brought you here if i knowed it wasnt a trap he led me into he told me there was only the boy he thought so i dont belong here the boy let me sleep here out of kindness hogan knew nothing of this i didnt come till after he had left thats different said rafferty but he shouldnt have gone back on me he is a coward probably i guess youre right said rafferty contemptuously you promise then not to kill him yes then well let you go watson unloosed the bonds that confined the prisoner rafferty raised himself to his full height and stretched his limbs there i feel better he said you tied the rope pretty tight i found it necessary said watson laughing now joe if you will open the door this gentleman will pass out rafferty turned to joe as he was about to leave the restaurant boy said he i wont forget this i aint much of a friend to boast of but im your friend youve saved me from prison and worse its likely and if you need help any time send for me if i had that money i took from you id pay it back i dont need it said joe ive been lucky and am doing well i hope youll make up your mind to turn over a new leaf if you do and are ever hard up for a meal come to me and you shall have it without money and without price thank you boy said rafferty ill remember it he strode out of the restaurant and disappeared in the darkness human natures a curious thing joe said watson who would have expected to find any redeeming quality in such a man as that i would sooner trust him than hogan so would i hogan is a mean scoundrel who is not so much of a ruffian as this man only because he is too much of a coward to be i am glad we let him go said joe i am not sure whether it was best but i knew we should have to be awake all night if we didnt he could have loosened the knots after awhile he wont trouble you any more i wish i felt as sure about hogan said joe hogan is a coward i advise you to keep ft revolver constantly on hand he wont dare to break in by himself the next morning after breakfast watson prepared to go out in search of work i must begin at the bottom of the ladder once more he said to joe its my own fault and i wont complain but what a fool i have been i might have gone home by the next steamer if i hadnt gambled away all my hard earnings what sort of work shall you try to get anything i have no right to be particular anything that will pay my expenses and give me a chance to lay by something for my family at home mr watson said joe suddenly ive been thinking of something that may suit you since i came to san francisco i have never gone outside i would like to go to the mines you wouldnt make as much as you do here perhaps not but i have laid by some money and i would like to see something of the country will you carry on the restaurant for me for three months if i give you your board and half of the profits will i i should think myself very lucky to get the chance then you shall have the chance how do you know that i can be trusted asked watson i havent known you long said joe but i feel confidence in your honesty i dont think youll repent your confidence when do you want to go ill stay here a few days till you get used to the business then i will start i was lucky to fall in with you said watson i didnt want to go back to the mines and tell the boys what a fool i have been i begin to think theres a chance for me yet chapter xxiv mr bickford of pumpkin hollow it may be thought that joe was rash in deciding to leave his business in the hands of a man whose acquaintance he had made but twelve hours previous but in the early history of california friendships ripened fast there was more confidence between man and man and i am assured that even now though the state is more settled and as far advanced in civilization and refinement as any of her sister states on the atlantic coast the people are bound together by more friendly ties and exhibit less of cold caution than at the east at all events joe never dreamed of distrusting his new acquaintance a common peril successfully overcome had doubtless something to do in strengthening the bond between them joe went round to his friend mr morgan and announced his intention i dont think you will make money by your new plan joe said morgan i dont expect to said joe but i want to see the mines if i dont succeed i can come back to my business here that is true i should like very well to go too why wont you mr morgan i cannot leave my business as readily as you can do you feel confidence in this man whom you are leaving in charge yes sir he has been unlucky but i am sure he is honest he will have considerable money belonging to you by the time you return that is if you stay any length of time i want to speak to you about that mr morgan i have directed him to make a statement to you once a month and put in your hands what money comes to me if it wont trouble you too much not at all joe i shall be glad to be of service to you if you meet with any good investment for the money while i am away i should like to have you act for me as you would for yourself all right joe joe learned from watson that the latter had been mining on the yuba river not far from the town of marysville he decided to go there although he might have found mines nearer the city the next question was how should he get there and should he go alone about this time a long lank yankee walked into the restaurant one day and seating himself at a table began to inspect the bill of fare which joe used to write up every morning he looked disappointed dont you find what you want inquired joe no said the visitor i say this is a queer country ive been hankerin arter a good dish of baked beans for a week and aint found any we sometimes have them said joe come here at one oclock and you shall be accommodated the stranger brightened up thats the talk said he ill come have you just come out here asked joe curiously a week ago are you a southerner asked joe demurely no i guess not said the yankee with emphasis i was raised in pumpkin hollow state of maine i was twentyone last first of april but i aint no april fool i tell you dad and me carried on the farm till i began to hear tell of californy id got about three hundred dollars saved up and i took it to come out here i suppose youve come out to make your fortune yes siree thats just what i come for how have you succeeded so far ive succeeded in spendin all my money except fifty dollars i say it costs a sight to eat and drink out here i cant afford to take but one meal a day and then i eat like all possessed i should think you would mr joshua bickford thats my name when im to hum well mr bickford what are your plans i want to go out to the mines and dig gold i guess i can dig as well as anybody ive had experience in diggin ever since i was ten year old not digging gold i suppose diggin potatoes and sich im going to the mines myself mr bickford what do you say to going along with me im on hand you know the way dont you we can find it i have no doubt i have never been there but my friend mr watson is an experienced miner how much gold did you dig asked joshua bluntly two thousand dollars answered watson not thinking it necessary to add that he had parted with the money since at the gamingtable two thousand dollars exclaimed joshua duly impressed thats a heap of money yes its a pretty good pile id like to get that much i know what id do what would you do mr bickford id go home and marry sukey smith by gosh then i hope youll get the money for miss smiths sake theres a feller hangin round her said joshua kinder slicklookin with his hair parted in the middle he tends in the drygoods store but if i come home with two thousand dollars shell have me i guess why with two thousand dollars i can buy the farm next to dads with a house with five rooms into it and a goodsized barn i guess sukey wouldnt say no to me then but would change her name to bickford mighty sudden i hope you will succeed in your plans mr bickford seems to me youre kinder young to be out here said bickford turning his attention to joe yes i am not quite old enough to think of marrying have you got money enough to get out to the mines asked joshua cautiously i think i can raise enough said joe smiling my young friend is the owner of this restaurant said watson you dont say i thought you hired him no on the contrary i am in his employ i have agreed to run the restaurant for him while he is at the mines you dont say exclaimed bickford surveying our hero with curiosity have you made much money in this eatinghouse ive done pretty well said joe modestly i own the building and the two adjoining lots you dont say how old be you sixteen you must be allfired smart i dont know about that mr bickford ive been lucky and fallen in with good friends well i guess californys the place to make money i aint made any yet but i mean to there wasnt no chance to get ahead in pumpkin hollow i was workin for eight dollars a month and board it would be a great while before you could save up money to buy a farm out of that mr bickford thats so my experience was something like yours before i came out here i was working on a farm sho and i didnt begin to get as much money as you i was bound out to a farmer for my board and clothes the board was fair but the clothes were few and poor you dont say i hope you will be as lucky as i have been how much are you worth now asked joshua curiously from one to two thousand dollars i expect sho i never did how long have you been out here three months jerusalem thats better than stayin to hum i think so by this time mr bickford had completed his breakfast and in an anxious tone he inquired whats the damage oh i wont charge you anything as you are going to be my traveling companion said joe youre a gentleman by gosh exclaimed mr bickford in unrestrained delight come in at one oclock and you shall have some of your favorite beans and nothing to pay can you start for the mines tomorrow yes ive got nothin to prepare take your meals here till we go well im in luck said bickford victuals cost awful out here and i havent had as much as i wanted to eat since i got here consider yourself my guest said joe and eat all you want to it may be remarked that mr bickford availed himself of our young heros invitation and during the next twentyfour hours stowed away enough provisions to last an ordinary man for half a week chapter xxv the man from pike county four days later joe and his yankee friend mounted on mustangs were riding through a canon a hundred miles from san francisco it was late in the afternoon and the tall trees shaded the path on which they were traveling the air was unusually chilly and after the heat of midday they felt it i dont feel like campin out tonight said bickford its too cool i dont think we shall find any hotels about here said joe dont look like it id like to be back in pumpkin hollow just for tonight how fur is it to the mines do you calclate we are probably about halfway we ought to reach the yuba river inside of a week here mr bickfords mustang deliberately stopped and began to survey the scenery calmly what do you mean you pesky critter demanded joshua the mustang turned his head and glanced composedly at the burden he was carrying glang said joshua and he brought down his whip on the flanks of the animal it is not in mustang nature to submit to such an outrage without expressing proper resentment the animal threw up its hind legs lowering its head at the same time and joshua bickford describing a sudden somersault found himself sitting down on the ground a few feet in front of his horse not seriously injured but considerably bewildered by gosh he ejaculated why didnt you tell me you were going to dismount mr bickford asked joe his eyes twinkling with merriment because i didnt know it myself said joshua rising and rubbing his jarred frame the mustang did not offer to run away but stood calmly surveying him as if it had had nothing to do with his riders sudden dismounting darn the critter he looks just as if nothing had happened said joshua he served me a mean trick it was a gentle hint that he was tired said joe darn the beast i dont like his hints said mr bickford he prepared to mount the animal but the latter rose on its hind legs and very clearly intimated that the proposal was not agreeable whats got into the critter said joshua he wants to rest suppose we rest here for halfanhour while we loosen checkrein and let the horses graze just as you say joshuas steed appeared pleased with the success of his little hint and lost no time in availing himself of the freedom accorded him i wish i was safe at the mines said joshua what would dad say if he knowed where i was right out here in the wilderness it looks as we might be the only human critters in the world there aint no house in sight nor any signs of mans ever bein here so we can fancy how adam felt when he was set down in paradise said joe i guess he felt kinder lonely probably he did till eve came he had eve and i have you for company i guess eve wasnt much like me said joshua with a grin he was lying at full length on the greensward looking awkward and ungainly enough but his countenance homely as it was looked honest and trustworthy and joe preferred his company to that of many possessed of more outward polish he could not help smiling at mr bickfords remark probably eve was not as robust as you are he replied i doubt if she were as tall either but as to loneliness it is better to be lonely than to have some company there aint no suspicious characters round are there inquired joshua anxiously we are liable to meet them men who have been unsuccessful at the mines and who have become desperate in consequence and others who came out here to prey upon others thats what i hear do you think we shall meet any of the critters asked joshua i hope not they wouldnt find it very profitable to attack us we havent much money i havent said joshua i couldnt have got to the mines if you hadnt lent me a few dollars you have your animal you can sell him for something if he agrees to carry me so far said mr bickford gazing doubtfully at the mustang who was evidently enjoying his evening repast oh a hearty meal will make him goodnatured that is the way it acts with boys and men and animals are not so very different i guess youre right said joshua when i wanted to get a favor out of dad i always used to wait till the old man had got his belly full that made him kinder goodnatured i see you understand human nature mr bickford said joe i guess i do said joshua complacently great jehoshaphat whos that joe raised his head and saw riding toward them a man who might have sat for the photograph of a bandit without any alteration in his countenance or apparel he wore a red flannel shirt pants of rough cloth a mexican sombrero had a bowieknife stuck in his girdle and displayed a revolver rather ostentatiously his hair which he wore long was coarse and black and he had a fierce mustache is he a robber asked joshua uneasily even if he is said joe we are two to one i dare say hes all right but keep your weapon ready though joe was but a boy and bickford a fullgrown man from the outset he had assumed the command of the party and issued directions which his older companion followed implicitly the explanation is that joe had a mind of his own and decided promptly what was best to be done while his longlimbed associate was duller witted and undecided joe and joshua maintained their sitting position till the stranger was within a rod or two when he hailed them how are ye strangers he said pretty comfortable said joshua reassured by his words how fare you youre a yank aint you said the newcomer disregarding joshuas question i reckon so where might you hail from im from pike county missouri was the answer youve heard of pike haint you i dont know as i have said mr bickford the stranger frowned you must have been born in the woods not to have heard of pike county he said the smartest fighters come from pike i kin whip my weight in wildcats am a match for a dozen indians to onst and can tackle a lion without flinchin sho said joshua considerably impressed wont you stop and rest with us said joe politely i reckon i will said the pike man getting off his beast you dont happen to have a bottle of whisky with you strangers no said joe the newcomer looked disappointed i wish you had said he i feel as dry as a tinderbox where might you be travelin we are bound for the mines on the yuba river thats a long way off yes its four or five days ride ive been there and i dont like it its too hard work for a gentleman this was uttered in such a magnificent tone of disdain that joe was rather amused at the fellow in his red shirt and coarse breeches and brown not overclean skin he certainly didnt look much like a gentleman in the conventional sense of that term its all well enough to be a gentleman if youve got money to fall back on remarked joshua sensibly is that personal demanded the pike county man frowning and half rising its personal to me said joshua quietly i accept the apology said the newcomer sinking back upon the turf i haint apologized as im aware said joshua who was no craven youd better not rile me stranger said the pike man fiercely you dont know me you dont im a riptail roarer i am i always kill a man who insults me so do we said joe quietly the pike county man looked at joe in some surprise he had expected to frighten the boy with his bluster but it didnt seem to produce the effect intended chapter xxvi a desperado mr bickford also seemed a little surprised at joes coolness though not a coward in the face of danger he had been somewhat impressed by the fierce aspect of the man from pike county and really looked upon him as a reckless daredevil who was afraid of nothing joe judged him more truly he decided that a man who boasted so loudly was a sham if he had talked less he would have feared him more after his last bloodthirsty declaration the man from pike county temporarily subsided he drew out from his pocket a greasy pack of cards and after skilfully shuffling them inquired what do you say strangers to a little game to pass away the time i never played keards in my life said joshua bickford where was you raised demanded the pike man contemptuously pumpkin hollow state o maine said joshua dads an orthodox deacon he never let any of us play keards i dont know one from tother ill learn you said the pike man condescendingly suppose we have a game of poker aint that a gambling game inquired joshua we always play for something said the pike man its dern foolishness playin for nothing shall we have a game he looked at joe as he spoke i dont care to play said our hero i dont know much about cards and i dont want to play for money thats dern foolishness said the stranger whose object it was to clean out his new friends being an expert gambler perhaps it is said joe but i only speak for myself mr bickford may feel differently will you take a hand bickford asked the pike man thinking it possible that joshua might have some money of which he could relieve him you kin show me how to play if you want to said joshua but i wont gamble any the pike man put up his pack of cards in disgust derned if i ever met sich fellers he said youre methodists aint you we generally decline doing what we dont want to do said joe look here boy blustered the pike man i reckon you dont know me im from pike county missouri i am im a riptail roarer i am i kin whip my weight in wildcats you told us that afore said joshua placidly derned if i dont mean it too exclaimed the pike county man with a fierce frown do you know how i served a man last week no tell us wont you said joshua we was ridin together over in alameda county wed met permiscuous like weve met today i was tellin him how four bars attacked me once and i fit em all singlehanded when he laughed and said he reckoned id been drinkin and saw double if hed knowed me better he wouldnt have done it what did you do asked joshua interested joe who was satisfied that the fellow was romancing did not exhibit any interest what did i do echoed the pike county man fiercely i told him he didnt know the man he insulted i told him i was from pike county missouri and that i was a riptail roarer and could whip your weight in wildcats suggested joe the pike man appeared irritated dont interrupt me boy he said it aint healthy after youd made them remarks what did you do inquired joshua i told him hed insulted me and must fight i always do that did he fight he had to how did it come out i shot him through the heart said the man from pike county fiercely his bones are bleaching in the valley where he fell sho said joshua the pike county man looked from one to the other to see what effect had been produced by his bloodcurdling narration joshua looked rather perplexed as if he didnt quite know what to think but joe seemed tranquil i think you said it happened last week said joe if i said so it is so said the pike man who in truth did not remember what time he had mentioned i dont question that i was only wondering how his bones could begin to bleach so soon after he was killed just so said joshua to whom this difficulty had not presented itself before do you doubt my word stranger exclaimed the pike man putting his hand to his side and fingering his knife not at all said joe but i wanted to understand how it was i dont give no explanations said the pike man haughtily and i allow no man to doubt my word look here my friend said joshua aint you rather cantankerous whats that demanded the other suspiciously no offense said joshua but you take a feller up so we dont know exactly how to talk to you i take no insults said the pike man insults must be washed out in blood soapsuds is better than blood for washin purposes said joshua practically seems to me youre spoilin for a fight all the time i allow i am said the pike man who regarded this as a compliment i was brought up on fightin when i was a boy i could whip any boy in school thats why they called you a riptail roarer i guess said joshua youre right stranger said the pike man complacently what did you do when the teacher give you a lickin asked mr bickford what did i do yelled the pike county man with a demoniac frown exactly so i shot him said the pike man briefly sho how many teachers did you shoot when you was a boy only one the rest heard of it and never dared touch me so you could play hookey and cut up all you wanted to youre right stranger they didnt manage that way at pumpkin hollow said mr bickford boys aint quite so handy with shootinirons when the master flogged us we had to stand it were you afraid of him asked the pike man disdainfully well i was joshua admitted he was a big man with arms just like flails and the way he used to pound us was a caution id have shot him in his tracks said the pike man fiercely youd have got a wallopin fust i reckon said joshua do you mean to insult me demanded the pike man oh lay down and dont be so cantankerous said joshua youre allus thinkin of bein insulted we may as well be going said joe who was thoroughly disgusted with their new companion just as you say joe said joshua here you pesky critter come and let me mount you the mustang realized joes prediction after his hearty supper he seemed to be quite tractable and permitted mr bickford to mount him without opposition joe also mounted his horse ill ride along with you if youve no objections said the pike man we kin camp together tonight so saying he too mounted the sorrylooking steed which he had recently dismounted joe was not hypocrite enough to say that he was welcome he thought it best to be candid if you are quite convinced that neither of us wishes to insult you he said quietly you can join us if you are bent on quarreling you had better ride on by yourself the pike man frowned fiercely boy he said i have shot a man for less than that i carry a revolver said joe quietly but i shant use it unless it is necessary if you are so easily offended youd better ride on alone this the pike man did not care to do youre a strange boy he said but i reckon youre on the square ill go along with you i would rather youd leave us thought joe but he merely said very well chapter xxvii two tragic stories they rode on for about an hour and a half joshuas steed placated by his good supper behaved very well their ride was still through the canon presently it became too dark for them to proceed aint we gone about fur enough for tonight asked joshua perhaps we have answered joe heres a good place to camp suggested the man from pike county pointing to a small grove of trees to the right very well let us dismount said joe i think we can pass the night comfortably they dismounted and tied their beasts together under one of the trees they then threw themselves down on a patch of greensward nearby im gettin hungry said joshua aint you joe yes mr bickford we may as well take supper mr bickford produced a supper of cold meat and bread and placed it between joe and himself wont you share our supper said joe to their companion thank ye stranger i dont mind if i do answered the pike man with considerable alacrity my fodder give out this mornin and i haint found any place to stock up he displayed such an appetite that mr bickford regarded him with anxiety they had no more than sufficient for themselves and the prospect of such a boarder was truly alarming you have a healthy appetite my friend he said i generally have said the pike man youd orter have some whisky strangers to wash it down with id rather have a good cup of coffee sweetened with lasses sech as marm makes to hum remarked mr bickford coffee is for children whisky for strong men said the roarer i prefer the coffee said joe are you temperance fellers inquired the pike man contemptuously i am said joe and i too said joshua bah said the other disdainfully id as soon drink skimmilk good whisky or brandy for me i wish we was to your restaurant joe said joshua i kinder hanker after some good baked beans baked beans and brown bread are scrumptious ever eat em stranger no said the pike man none of your yankee truck for me i guess you dont know whats good said mr bickford whats your favorite vittles bacon and hominy hoecakes and whisky well said joshua it depends on the way a feller is brung up i go for baked beans and brown bread and punkin pie thats goloptious ever eat punkin pie stranger yes like it i dont lay much on it supper was over and other subjects succeeded the pike county man became social strangers said he did you ever hear of the affair i had with jack scott no said joshua spin it off will you jack and me used to be a heap together we went huntin together camped out for weeks together and was like two brothers one day we was ridin out when a deer started up fifty rods ahead we both raised our guns and shot at him there was only one bullet into him and i knowed that was mine how did you know it inquired joshua dont you get curious stranger i knowed it and that was enough but jack said it was his its my deer he said for you missed your shot look here jack said i youre mistaken you missed it dont you think i know my own bullet no i dont said he jack said i calmly dont talk that way its dangerous do you think im afraid of you he said turning on me jack said i dont provoke me i can whip my weight in wildcats you cant whip me said he that was too much for me to stand im the riptail roarer from pike county missouri and no man can insult me and live jack said i weve been friends but youve insulted me and it must be washed out in blood then i up with my wepon and shot him through the head sho said joshua i was sorry to do it for he was my friend said the pike county man but he disputed my word and the man that does that may as well make his will if hes got any property to leave here the speaker looked to see what effect was produced upon his listeners joe seemed indifferent he saw through the fellow and did not credit a word he said joshua had been more credulous at first but he too began to understand the man from pike county the idea occurred to him to pay him back in his own coin didnt the relatives make any fuss about it he inquired didnt they arrest you for murder they didnt dare to said the pike man proudly they knew me they knew i could whip my weight in wildcats and wouldnt let no man insult me did you leave the corpse lyin out under the trees asked joshua i rode over to jacks brother and told him what i had done and where hed find the body he went and buried it what about the deer what deer the deer you killed and your friend claimed oh said the pike man with sudden recollection i told jacks brother he might have it now that was kinder handsome considerin youd killed your friend on account of it there aint nothin mean about me said the man from pike county i see there aint said mr bickford dryly it reminds me of a little incident in my own life ill tell you about it if you haint any objection go ahead its your deal you see the summer i was eighteen my cousin worked for dad hayin time he was a little oldern me and he had a powerful appetite bill had if it wasnt for that hed a been a nice feller enough but at the table he always wanted more than his share of wittles now that aint fair no ways think it is stranger no go ahead with your story one day we sat down to dinner marm had made some appledumplin that day and twas good you bet well i see bill aeyin the dumplin as he shoveled in the meat and pertaters and i knowed he meant to get moren his share now im fond of dumplin as well as bill and i didnt like it well we was both helped and went to eatin when i was half through i got up to pour out some water when i cum back to the table bill had put away his plate which he had cleaned off and was eatin my dumplin what did you say inquired the gentleman from pike interested i said bill youre my cousin but youve gone too fur he laffed and we went into the field together to mow he was just startin on his swath when i cum behind him and cut his head clean off with my scythe joe had difficulty in suppressing his laughter but mr bickford looked perfectly serious why that was butchery exclaimed the pike man startled cut off his head with a scythe i hated to bein as he was my cousin said joshua but i couldnt have him cum any of them tricks on me i dont see as its any wuss than shootin a man what did you do with his body asked joe commanding his voice bein as twas warm weather i thought id better bury him at once were you arrested yes and tried for murder but my lawyer proved that i was crazy when i did it and so i got off do such things often happen at the north asked the pike county man not so often as out here and down south i guess said joshua its harder to get off sometimes a man gets hanged up north for handlin his gun too careless did you ever kill anybody else asked the pike man eying joshua rather uneasily no said mr bickford i shot one man in the leg and another in the arm but that warnt anything serious it was hard to disbelieve joshua he spoke with such apparent frankness and sincerity the man from pike county was evidently puzzled and told no more stories of his own prowess conversation died away and presently all three were asleep chapter xxviii the events of a night the pike county man was the first to fall asleep joe and mr bickford lay about a rod distant from him when their new comrades regular breathing assured joe that he was asleep he said mr bickford what do you think of this man who has joined us i think hes the biggest liar i ever set eyes on said joshua bluntly then you dont believe his stories no do you i believe them as much as that yarn of yours about your cousin bill returned joe laughing i wanted to give him as good as he sent i didnt want him to do all the lyin and you a deacons son exclaimed joe in comic expostulation i dont know what the old man would have said if hed heard me or cousin bill either then one part is true you have a cousin bill that isnt the only part thats true he did help me and dad hayin but his head is still safe on his shoulders i hope so i dont think we can find as much truth in the story of our friend over yonder nor i if there was a prize offered for tall lyin i guess hed stand a good chance to get it do you know joshua fireeater as he is i suspect that he is a coward you do yes and i have a mind to put him to the test how will you do it one day an old hunter came into my restaurant and kept coming for a week he was once taken prisoner by the indians and remained in their hands for three months he taught me the indian warwhoop and out of curiosity i practised it till i can do it pretty well whats your plan to have you fire off your gun so as to wake him up then i will give a loud warwhoop and see how it affects the gentleman from pike county he may shoot us before he finds out the deception it will be well first to remove his revolver to make all safe i wish you could give the warwhoop too it would make a louder noise how do you do it joe explained i guess i can do it you start it and ill jin in just as i used to do in singin at meetin i never could steer through a tune straight by myself but when the choir got to goin i helped em all i could i guess you can do it now let us make ready the pike county mans revolver was removed while he was unconsciously sleeping then joshua and our hero ensconced themselves behind trees and the yankee fired his gun the pike man started up still half asleep and wholly bewildered when within a rod of him he heard the dreadful warwhoop then another more discordant voice took up the fearful cry joshua did very well considering that it was his first attempt then the man from pike county sprang to his feet if it had been daylight his face would have been seen to wear a pale and scared expression it did not appear to occur to him to make a stand against the savage foes who he felt convinced were near at hand he stood not on the order of going but went at once he quickly unloosed his beast sprang upon his back and galloped away without apparently giving a thought to the companions with whom he had camped out when he was out of hearing joe and bickford shouted with laughter you see i was right said joe the mans a coward he seemed in a hurry to get away said joshua dryly hes the biggest humbug out i thought so as soon as he began to brag so much i believed his yarns at first admitted joshua i thought he was rather a dangerous fellow to travel with he looked like a desperado certainly said joe but appearances are deceitful its all swagger and no real courage well what shall we do now joe lie down again and go to sleep the mans gone off without his revolver hell be back for it within a day or two we shall be sure to fall in with him again i shant lose my sleep worrying about him the two threw themselves once more on the ground and were soon fast asleep joe proved to be correct in his prediction concerning the reappearance of their terrified companion the next morning when they were sitting at breakfast that is sitting under a tree with their repast spread out on a paper between them the man from pike county rode up he looked haggard as well he might not having ventured to sleep for fear of the indians and his horse seemed weary and dragged out where have you been asked mr bickford innocently chasin the indians said the riptail roarer swinging himself from his saddle sho be there any indians about here didnt you hear them last night inquired the man from pike no nor you turning to joe i heard nothing of any indians replied joe truthfully then all i can say is strangers that you sleep uncommon sound nothing wakes me up said bickford what about them indians did you railly see any i rather think i did said the man from pike it couldnt have been much after midnight when i was aroused by their warwhoop starting up i saw twenty of the red devils riding through the canon were you afraid afraid exclaimed the man from pike contemptuously the riptail roarer knows not fear i can whip my weight in wildcats yes i know you can interrupted joshua you told us so yesterday the man from pike seemed rather annoyed at the interruption but as mr bickford appeared to credit his statement he had no excuse for quarreling he proceeded instantly i sprung to the back of my steed and gave them chase did they see you they did why didnt they turn upon you you said there were twenty of them why repeated the pike man boastfully they were afraid they recognized me as the riptail roarer they knew that i had sent more than fifty indians to the happy huntinggrounds and alone as i was they fled sho did you kill any of them asked joe when i was some distance on my way i found i had left my revolver behind did you find it stranger there it is said joshua who had replaced it on the ground close to where the pike man had slept he took it with satisfaction and replaced it in his girdle then you didnt kill any no but i drove them away they wont trouble you any more thats a comfort said joshua now strangers if youve got any breakfast to spare i think i could eat some set up old man said mr bickford with his mouth full the man from pike did full justice to the meal then he asked his two companions as a favor not to start for two hours during which he lay down and rested the three kept together that day but did not accomplish as much distance as usual chiefly because of the condition of their companions horse at night they camped out again in the morning an unpleasant surprise awaited them their companion had disappeared taking with him joshuas horse and leaving instead his own sorry nag that was not all he had carried off their bag of provisions and morning found them destitute of food with a hearty appetite and many miles away as they judged from any settlement the mean skunk said joshua hes cleaned us out what shall we do i dont know said joe seriously chapter xxix john chinaman the two friends felt themselves to be in a serious strait the exchange of horses was annoying but it would only lengthen their journey a little the loss of their whole stock of provisions could not so readily be made up i feel holler said joshua i never could do much before breakfast i wish id eat more supper i would have done it only i was afraid by the way that skunk pitched into em we wouldnt have enough to last you only saved them for him it seems said joe he has certainly made a poor return for our kindness if i could only wring his neck i wouldnt feel quite so hungry said joshua or cut his head off with a scythe suggested joe smiling faintly danged if i wouldnt do it said mr bickford hunger making him bloodthirsty we may overtake him mr bickford you may joe but i cant hes left me his horse which is clean tuckered out and never was any great shakes to begin with i dont believe i can get ten miles out of him from now till sunset we must keep together no matter how slow we go it wont do for us to be parted we shall starve together likely enough said joshua mournfully ive heard that the french eat horseflesh if it comes to the worst we can kill your horse and try a horsesteak its all hes fit for and he aint fit for that well move on for a couple of hours and see if somethin wont turn up i tell you joe id give all the money ive got for some of marms johnnycakes it makes me feel hungrier whenever i think of em i sympathize with you joshua said joe we may as well be movin on as you suggest we may come to some cabin or party of travelers so they mounted their beasts and started joe went ahead for his animal was much better than the sorry nag which mr bickford bestrode the latter walked along with an air of dejection as if life were a burden to him if i had this critter at home joe ill tell you what id do with him said mr bickford after a pause well what would you do with him id sell him to a sexton hed be a firstclass animal to go to funerals no danger of his runnin away with the hearse you are not so hungry but you can joke joshua its no joke returned mr bickford if we dont raise a supply of provisions soon i shall have to attend my own funeral my mind keeps running on them johnnycakes they rode on rather soberly for the exercise and the fresh morning air increased their appetites which were keen when they started mr bickford no longer felt like joking and joe at every step looked anxiously around him in the hope of espying relief on a sudden mr bickford rose in his stirrups and exclaimed in a tone of excitement i see a cabin where yonder said the yankee pointing to a onestory shanty perhaps a quarter of a mile away is it inhabited i wonder i dont know let us go and see the two spurred their horses and at length reached the rude building which had inspired them with hope the door was open but no one was visible joshua was off his horse in a twinkling and peered in hooray he shouted in rejoicing accents breakfasts ready what do you mean i mean that ive found something to eat on a rude table was an earthen platter full of boiled rice and a stale loaf beside it pitch in joe said joshua im as hungry as a wolf this food belongs to somebody i suppose we have no right to it right be hanged a starving man has a right to eat whatever he can find suppose it belongs to a fireeater or a man from pike county well eat first and fight afterward joe did not feel like arguing the matter there was an advocate within him which forcibly emphasized joshuas arguments and he joined in the banquet this bread is dry as a chip said mr bickford but no matter i never thought dry bread would taste so good i always thought rice was mean vittles but it goes to the right place just now i wonder if any one will have to go hungry on our account said joe i hope not but i cant help it returned mr bickford necessitys the fust law of nature joe i feel twice as strong as i did twenty minutes ago theres nothing like a full stomach joshua i wonder to whom we are indebted for this repast joe was not long in having his query answered an exclamation as of one startled called the attention of the two friends to the doorway where with a terrified face stood a chinaman his broad face indicating alarm its a heathen chinee by gosh exclaimed joshua even at that time chinese immigrants had begun to arrive in san francisco and the sight was not wholly new either to joshua or joe good morning john said our young hero pleasantly good morning heathen said mr bickford we thought wed come round and make you a mornin call is your family well the chinaman was reassured by the friendly tone of his visitors and ventured to step in he at once saw that the food which he had prepared for himself had disappeared melican man eat johns dinner he remarked in a tone of disappointment so we have john said mr bickford the fact is we were hungry hadnt had any breakfast suppose melican man eat he pay said the chinaman thats all right said joe we are willing to pay how much do you want the chinaman named his price which was not unreasonable and it was cheerfully paid have you got some more bread and rice john asked mr bickford wed like to buy some and take it along they succeeded in purchasing a small supply enough with economy to last a day or two this was felt as a decided relief in two days they might fall in with another party of miners or come across a settlement they ascertained on inquiry that the chinaman and another of his nationality had come out like themselves to search for gold they had a claim at a short distance from which they had obtained a small supply of gold the cabin they had found in its present condition it had been erected and deserted the previous year by a party of white miners who were not so easily satisfied as the two chinamen well said joshua after they had started on their way thats the first time i ever dined at a chinee hotel we were lucky in coming across it said joe the poor fellow looked frightened when he saw us gobblin up his provisions said mr bickford laughing at the recollection but we left him pretty well satisfied we didnt treat him as the gentleman from pike treated us no i wouldnt be so mean as that darned skunk it makes me mad whenever i look at this consumptive boss hes left behind you didnt make much out of that horse trade mr bickford i didnt but ill get even with him some time if we ever meet again do you know where he was bound no he didnt say i dare say itll all come right in the end at any rate we shant starve for the next fortyeight hours so in better spirits the two companions kept on their way chapter xxx on the yuba river on the following day joe and his comrade fell in with a party of men who like themselves were on their way to the yuba river they were permitted to join them and made an arrangement for a share of the provisions this removed all anxiety and insured their reaching their destination without further adventure the banks of the yuba presented a busy and picturesque appearance on the banks was a line of men roughly clad earnestly engaged in scooping out gravel and pouring it into a rough cradle called a rocker this was rocked from side to side until the particles of gold if there were any settled at the bottom and were picked out and gathered into bags at the present time there are improved methods of separating gold from the earth but the rocker is still employed by chinese miners in the background were tents and rude cabins and there was the unfailing accessory of a large mining camp the gambling tent where the banker like a wily spider lay in wait to appropriate the hardearned dust of the successful miner joe and his friend took their station a few rods from the river and gazed at the scene before them well mr bickford said joe the time has come when we are to try our luck yes said joshua looks curious doesnt it if i didnt know id think them chaps fools stoopin over there and siftin mud it minds me of when i was a boy and used to make dirt pies suppose we take a day and look round a little then we can find out about how things are done and work to better advantage just as you say joe i must go to work soon for i haint nary red ill stand by you mr bickford youre a fustrate feller joe you seem to know just what to do it isnt so long since i was a greenhorn and allowed myself to be taken in by hogan youve cut your eyeteeth since then i have had some experience of the world but i may get taken in again joe and his friend found the miners social and very ready to give them information how much do i make a day said one in answer to a question from joshua well it varies sometimes i make ten dollars and from that all the way up to twentyfive once i found a piece worth fifty dollars i was in luck then i should say you were said mr bickford the idea of findin fifty dollars in the river it looks kind of strange dont it joe are any larger pieces ever found here asked joe sometimes i have seen larger nuggets on exhibition in san francisco worth several hundred dollars are any such to be found here generally they come from the dry diggings we dont often find such specimens in the river washings but these are more reliable can a man save money here if hell be careful of what he gets but much of our dust goes there he pointed as he spoke to a small cabin used as a store and gambling den at one and the same time there in the evening the miners collected and by faro poker or monte managed to lose all that they had washed out during the day thats the curse of our mining settlement said their informant but for the temptations which the gaminghouse offers many whom you see working here would now be on their way home with a comfortable provision for their families i never go there but then i am in the minority what did you used to do when you was to hum inquired joshua who was by nature curious and had no scruples about gratifying his curiosity i used to keep school winters in the spring and summer i assisted my father on his farm down in maine you dont say youre from maine why im from maine myself remarked joshua indeed whereabouts in maine did you live pumpkin hollow i kept school in pumpkin hollow one winter you dont say so what is your name inquired joshua earnestly john kellogg i thought so exclaimed mr bickford excited why i used to go to school to you mr kellogg it is nine years ago and you must have changed so much that i cannot call you to mind dont you remember a tall slabsided youngster of thirteen that used to stick pins into your chair for you to set on kellogg smiled surely you are not joshua bickford he said yes i am i am that same identical chap i am glad to see you mr bickford said his old schoolteacher grasping joshuas hand cordially it seems kinder queer for you to call me mr bickford i wasnt so ceremonious in the old times said kellogg no i guess not youd say come here joshua and youd jerk me out of my seat by the collar did you stick that pin in my chair thats the way you used to talk and then youd give me an allfired lickin overcome by the mirthful recollections joshua burst into an explosive fit of laughter in which presently he was joined by joe and his old teacher i hope youve forgiven me for those whippings mr bickford they were jest what i needed mr kellogg i was a lazy young rascal as full of mischief as a nut is of meat you tanned my hide well you dont seem to be any the worse for it now i guess not im pretty tough i say mr kellogg continued joshua with a grin youd find it a harder job to give me a lickin now than you did then i wouldnt undertake it now i am afraid you could handle me it seems curus dont it joe said joshua when mr kellogg used to haul me round the schoolroom it didnt seem as if i could ever be a match for him we change with the passing years said kellogg in a moralizing tone which recalled his former vocation now you are a man and we meet here on the other side of the continent on the banks of the yuba river i hope we are destined to be successful i hope so too said joshua for im reglarly cleaned out if i can help you any in the sway of information i shall be glad to do so joe and bickford took him at his word and made many inquiries eliciting important information the next day they took their places farther down the river and commenced work their inexperience at first put them at a disadvantage they were awkward and unskilful as might have been expected still at the end of the first day each had made about five dollars thats something said joe if i could have made five dollars in one day in pumpkin hollow said mr bickford i would have felt like a rich man here it costs a feller so much to live that he dont think much of it we shall improve as we go along wait till tomorrow night the second day brought each about twelve dollars and joshua felt elated im gettin the hang of it said he as soon as ive paid up what i owe you ill begin to lay by somethin i dont want you to pay me till you are worth five hundred dollars mr bickford the sum is small and i dont need it thank you joe youre a good friend ill stick by you if you ever want help in the evening the camp presented a lively appearance when it was chilly logs would be brought from the woods and a bright fire would be lighted around which the miners would sit and talk of home and their personal adventures and experiences one evening mr bickford and joe were returning from a walk when as they approached the campfire they heard a voice that sounded familiar and caught these words im from pike county missouri gentlemen they call me the riptail roarer i can whip my weight in wildcats by gosh exclaimed joshua if it aint that skunk from pike i mean to tackle him chapter xxxi judge lynch pronounces sentence the gentleman from pike was sitting on a log surrounded by miners to whom he was relating his marvelous exploits the number of indians grizzly bears and enemies generally which according to his account he had overcome and made way with was simply enormous hercules was nothing to him it can hardly be said that his listeners credited his stories they had seen enough of life to be pretty good judges of human nature and regarded them as romances which served to while away the time it seems to me my friend said kellogg who it will be remembered had been a schoolmaster that you are a modern hercules whos he demanded the pike man suspiciously for he had never heard of the gentleman referred to he was a great hero of antiquity exclaimed kellogg who did many wonderful feats thats all right then said the pike man if youre friendly then im friendly but if any man insults me hell find hes tackled the wrong man i can whip my weight in wildcats here he was subjected to an interruption mr bickford could no longer suppress his indignation when at a little distance he saw his mustang which this treacherous braggart had robbed him of quietly feeding look here old riptail or whatever you call yourself ive got an account to settle with you the pike man started as he heard mr bickfords voice which being of a peculiar nasal character he instantly recognized he felt that the meeting was an awkward one and he would willingly have avoided it he decided to bluff joshua off if possible and as the best way of doing it to continue his game of brag who dares to speak to me thus he demanded with a heavy frown looking in the opposite direction who insults the riptail roarer look this way if you want to see him said joshua put on your specs if your eyes aint good the man from pike could no longer evade looking at his late comrade he pretended not to know him stranger said he with one hand on the handle of his knife are you tired of life i am neither tired of life nor afraid of you said joshua manfully you dont know me or yes i do youre the man that says he can whip his weight in wildcats i dont believe you dare to face your weight in tame cats sdeath roared the bully do you want to die on the spot not particularly old riptail dont talk sech nonsense ill trouble you to tell me why you stole my horse on the way out here let me get at him said the pike man in a terrible voice but not offering to get up from the log nobody henders your gettin at me said mr bickford composedly but that aint answerin my question if i didnt respect them two gentlemen too much id shoot you where you stand said the pike man ive got a shootiniron myself old riptail and im goin to use it if necessary what have you to say in answer to this mans charge asked one of the miners a large man who was looked upon as the leader of the company he charges you with taking his horse he lies said the man from pike be keerful old riptail said mr bickford in a warning tone i dont take sass any more than you do i didnt steal your horse no you didnt exactly steal it but you took it without leave and left your own bag of bones in his place but that wasnt so bad as stealin all our provisions and leavin us without a bite out in the wilderness thats what i call tarnation mean what have you to say to these charges asked the mining leader gravely say i say that man is mistaken i never saw him before in my life well thats cheeky said joshua aghast at the mans impudence why i know you as well as if wed been to school together you are the riptail roarer you are from pike county missouri you are you can whip your weight in wildcats thats he gentlemen i leave it to you in giving the description joshua imitated the boastful accents of his old comrade with such success that the assembled miners laughed and applauded thats he youve got him they cried just hear that old riptail said mr bickford you see these gentlemen here believe me and they dont believe you theres a man in this here country that looks like me said the pike man with a lame excuse youve met him likely that wont go down old riptail there aint but one man can whip his weight in wildcats and tell the allfiredest yarns out thats you and there aint no gettin round it this is a plot gentlemen said the man from pike glancing uneasily at the faces around him in which he read disbelief of his statements my word is as good as his maybe it is said mr bickford ill call another witness joe jest tell our friends here what you know about the gentleman from pike if im lyin say so and ill subside and never say another word about it all that my friend bickford says is perfectly true said joe modestly this man partook of our hospitality and then repaid us by going off early one morning when we were still asleep carrying off all our provisions and exchanging his own wornout horse for my friends mustang which was a much better animal the man from pike had not at first seen joe his countenance fell when he saw how mr bickfords case was strengthened and for the moment he could not think of a word to say you are sure this is the man joe asked the leader of the miners yes i will swear to it he is not a man whom it is easy to mistake i believe you gentlemen turning to the miners who were sitting or standing about him do you believe this stranger or our two friends the reply was emphatic and the man from pike saw that he was condemned gentlemen he said rising you are mistaken and i am the victim of a plot it isnt pleasant to stay where i am suspected and ill bid you good evening not so fast said the leader putting his hand heavily on his shoulder you deserve to be punished and you shall be friends what shall we do with him kill him string him up shouted some the riptail roarers swarthy face grew pale as he heard these ominous words he knew something of the wild stern justice of those days he knew that more than one for an offense like his had expiated his crime with his life it seems to me said the leader that the man he injured should fix the penalty say you so aye aye shouted the miners will you two turning to joe and bickford decide what shall be done with this man shall we string him up the pike mans nerve gave way he flung himself on his knees before joshua and cried mercy mercy dont let them hang me joshua was not hardhearted he consulted with joe and then said i dont want the critters life if there was any wildcats round id like to see him tackle his weight in em as he says he can as there isnt let him be tied on the old nag he put off on me with his head to the horses tail supplied with one days provisions and then turned loose this sentence was received with loud applause and laughter the horse was still in camp and was at once brought out the man from pike was securely tied on as directed and then the poor beast was belabored with whips till he started off at the top of his speed which his old owner on account of his reversed position was unable to regulate he was followed by shouts and jeers from the miners who enjoyed this act of retributive justice mr bickford you are avenged said joe so i am joe im glad ive got my hoss back but i cant help pityin poor old riptail after all i dont believe he ever killed a wildcat in his life chapter xxxii taking account of stock three months passed they were not eventful the days were spent in steady and monotonous work the nights were passed around the campfire telling and hearing stories and talking of home most of their companions gambled and drank but mr bickford and joe kept clear of these pitfalls come man drink with me more than once one of his comrades said to joshua no thank you said joshua why not aint i good enough asked the other half offended you mean im puttin on airs cause i wont drink with you no sirree there isnt a man id drink with sooner than with you come up then old fellow whatll you take ill take a sandwich if you insist on it thats vittles whatll you drink nothing but water thats strong enough for me danged if i dont believe youre a minister in disguise i guess id make a curus preacher said joshua with a comical twist of his features you wouldnt want to hear me preach moren once in this way our friend mr bickford managed to evade the hospitable invitations of his comrades and still retain their goodwill not always an easy thing to achieve in those times joe was equally positive in declining to drink but it was easier for him to escape even the most confirmed drinkers felt it to be wrong to coax a boy to drink against his will there was still another kellogg who steadfastly adhered to cold water or tea and coffee as a beverage these three were dubbed by their companions the coldwater brigade and accepted the designation goodnaturedly joshua said joe some three months after their arrival have you taken account of stock lately no said joshua but ill do it now after a brief time he announced the result ive got about five hundred dollars or thereabouts he said you have done a little better than i have how much have you about four hundred and fifty i owe you twentyfive dollars joe thatll make us even joshua was about to transfer twentyfive dollars to joe when the latter stayed his hand dont be in a hurry mr bickford he said wait till we get to the city do you know joe said joshua in a tone of satisfaction i am richer than i was when i sot out from home i am glad to hear it mr bickford you have worked hard and deserve your luck i had only three hundred dollars then now ive got four hundred and seventyfive takin out what i owe you you neednt take it out at all youve done enough for me joe i dont want you to give me that debt remember joshua i have got a business in the city paying me money all the time i expect my share of the profits will be more than i have earned out here thats good i wish id got a business like you youd be all right even if you only get enough to pay expenses here thats so i am getting rather tired of this place mr bickford said joe after a little pause you dont think of going back to the city asked joshua apprehensively not directly but i think i should like to see a little more of california these are not the only diggings where do you want to go i havent considered yet the main thing is will you go with me we wont part company joe good then ill inquire and see what i can find out about other places this pays fairly but there is little chance of getting nuggets of any size hereabouts id just like to find one worth two thousand dollars id start for home mighty quick and give sukey smith a chance to become mrs bickford success to you said joe laughing chapter xxxiii a startling tableau joe finally decided on some mines a hundred miles distant in a southwesterly direction they were reported to be rich and promising at any rate said he even if they are no better than here we shall get a little variety and change of scene thatll be good for our appetite i dont think mr bickford that either of us need be concerned about his appetite mine is remarkably healthy nothing was ever the matter with mine said joshua as long as the provisions held out they made some few preparations of a necessary character their clothing was in rags and they got a new outfit at the mining store each also provided himself with a rifle the expense of these made some inroads upon their stock of money but by the time they were ready to start they had eight hundred dollars between them besides their outfit and this they considered satisfactory kellogg at first proposed to go with them but finally he changed his mind i am in a hurry to get home he said and these mines are a sure thing if i were as young as you i would take the risk as it is i had better not ive got a wife and child at home and i want to go back to them as soon as i can you are right said joe ive got a girl at home said joshua but i guess shell wait for me suppose she dont suggested joe i shant break my heart said mr bickford theres more than one girl in the world i see you are a philosopher mr bickford said his old schoolmaster i dont know about that but i dont intend to make a fool of myself for any gal i shall say sukey here i am ive got a little money and im yourn till death if you say so if you dont want me i wont commit susancide thats a capital joke joshua said joe her name is susan isnt it have i made a joke waal i didnt go to do it it is unconscious wit mr bickford said kellogg pooty good joke aint it said joshua complacently susancide and her name is susan ho ho i never thought ont and joshua roared in appreciation of the joke which he had unwittingly perpetrated for it must be explained that he thought susancide the proper form of the word expressing a voluntary severing of the vital cord years afterward when joshua found himself the center of a social throng he was wont to say ever heard that joke i made about susan and then he would cite it amid the plaudits of his friends mr bickford and joe had not disposed of their horses they had suffered them to forage in the neighborhood of the river thinking it possible that the time would come when they would require them one fine morning they set out from the camp near the banks of the yuba and set their faces in a southwesterly direction they had made themselves popular among their comrades and the miners gave them a hearty cheer as they started good luck joe good luck old man they exclaimed heartily the same to you boy so with mutual good feeling they parted company we aint leavin like our friend from pike county said mr bickford i often think of the poor critter trottin off with face to the rear i hope we shant meet him or any of his kind said joe so do i hed better go and live among the wildcats he is some like them he lives upon others it would only be wearisome to give a detailed account of the journey of the two friends one incident will suffice on the fourth day joe suddenly exclaimed in excitement look joshua by gosh the exclamation was a natural one at the distance of forty rods a man was visible his hat off his face wild with fear and in dangerous proximity a grizzly bear of the largest size doggedly pursuing him its hogan exclaimed joe in surprise we must save him chapter xxxiv a grizzly on the warpath it may surprise some of my young friends to learn that the grizzly bear is to be found in california though as the state has increased in population mostly all have been killed off even now among the mountains they may be found and occasionally visit the lower slopes and attack men and beasts hogan had had the illluck to encounter one of these animals when he first saw the grizzly there was a considerable space between them if he had concealed himself he might have escaped the notice of the beast but when he commenced running the grizzly became aware of his presence and started in pursuit hogan was rather dilapidated in appearance trusting to luck instead of labor he had had a hard time as he might have expected his flannel shirt was ragged and his nether garments showed the ravages of time in the race his hat had dropped off and his rough unkempt hair was erect with fright he was running rapidly but was already showing signs of exhaustion the bear was getting over the ground with clumsy speed appearing to take it easily but overhauling his intended victim slowly but surely joe and bickford were standing on one side and had not yet attracted the attention of either party in this unequal race poor chap said joshua he looks most tuckered out shall i shoot wait till the bear gets a little nearer we cant afford to miss he will turn on us im in a hurry to roll the beast over said joshua its a cruel sight to see a grizzly hunting a man at this moment hogan turned his head with the terrorstricken look of a man who felt that he was lost the bear was little more than a hundred feet behind him and was gaining steadily he was already terribly fatigued his breathing was reduced to a hoarse pant he was overcome by the terror of the situation and his remaining strength gave way with a shrill cry he sank down upon the ground and shutting his eyes awaited the attack the bear increased his speed now let him have it said joe in a sharp quick whisper mr bickford fired striking the grizzly in the face bruin stood still and roared angrily he wagged his large head from one side to the other seeking by whom this attack was made he espied the two friends and abandoning his pursuit of hogan rolled angrily toward them give it to him quick joe exclaimed bickford hes making for us joe held his rifle with steady hand and took deliberate aim it was well he did for had he failed both he and bickford would have been in great peril his faithful rifle did good service the bear tumbled to the earth with sudden awkwardness the bullet had reached a vital part and the grizzly was destined to do no more mischief is he dead or only feigning asked joe prudently hes a gone coon said joshua let us go up and look at him they went up and stood over the huge beast he was not quite dead he opened his glazing eyes made a convulsive movement with his paws as if he would like to attack his foes and then his head fell back and he moved no more hes gone sure enough said bickford goodby old grizzly you meant well but circumstances interfered with your good intentions now let us look up hogan said joe the man had sunk to the ground utterly exhausted and in his weakness and terror had fainted joe got some water and threw it in his face he opened his eyes and drew a deep breath a sudden recollection blanched his face anew and he cried dont let him get at me youre safe mr hogan said joe the bear is dead dead is he really dead if you dont believe it get up and look at him said bickford i cant get up im so weak let me help you then there do you see the critter hogan shuddered as he caught sight of the huge beast only twentyfive feet distant from him was he as near as that he gasped he almost had you said bickford if it hadnt been for joe and me hed have been munchin you at this identical minute things have changed a little and in place of the bear eatin you you shall help eat the bear by this time hogan realizing that he was safe began to recover his strength as he did so he became angry with the beast that had driven him such a hard race for life he ran up to the grizzly and kicked him take that he exclaimed with an oath i wish you wasnt dead so that i could stick my knife into you if he wasnt dead youd keep your distance said joshua dryly it dont require much courage to tackle him now hogan felt this to be a reflection upon his courage i guess youd have run too if hed been after you he said i guess i should bears are all very well in their place but id rather not mingle with em socially theyre very affectionate and fond of hugging but if im going to be hugged i wouldnt choose a bear you seem to think i was a coward for runnin from the bear no i dont how do i know you was runnin from the bear maybe you was only takin a little exercise to get up an appetite for dinner i am faint and weak said hogan i havent had anything to eat for twelve hours you shall have some food said joe joshua where are the provisions we may as well sit down and lunch jest as you say joe i most generally have an appetite there was a mountain spring within a stones throw joshua took a tin pail and brought some of the sparkling beverage which he offered first to hogan hogan drank greedily his throat was parched and dry and he needed it he drew a deep breath of relief i feel better said he i was in search of a spring when that cursed beast spied me and gave me chase they sat down under the shade of a large tree and lunched what sort of luck have you had since you tried to break into my restaurant mr hogan asked joe hogan changed color the question was an awkward one who told you i tried to enter your restaurant he asked the man you brought there that wasnt creditable of you hogan said joshua with his mouth full after my friend joe had given you a supper and promised you breakfast it was unkind to try to rob him dont you think so yourself i couldnt help it said hogan who had rapidly decided on his defense couldnt help it said joe in a tone of inquiry thats rather a strange statement its true said hogan the man forced me to do it how was that he saw me comin out of the restaurant a little while before and when he met me after trying to rob me and finding that it didnt pay he asked me if i was a friend of yours i told him i was then he began to ask if you slept there at night and if anybody was with you i didnt want to answer but he held a pistol at my head and forced me to then he made me go with him i offered to get in thinking i could whisper in your ear and warn you but he wouldnt let me he stationed me at the window and got in himself you know what followed as soon as i saw you were too strong for him i ran away fearing that he might try to implicate me in the attempt at robbery hogan recited this story very glibly and in a very plausible manner mr hogan said joe if i didnt know you so thoroughly i might be disposed to put confidence in your statements as it is i regret to say i dont believe you hogan said joshua i think youre one of the fust romancers of the age if i ever start a storypaper ill engage you to write for me i am sorry you do me so much injustice gentlemen said hogan with an air of suffering innocence im the victim of circumstances i expect youre a second george washington you never told a lie did you some time you will know me better said hogan i hope not said joe i know you better now than i want to chapter xxxv the new diggings when lunchwas over joe said good day mr hogan look out for the grizzlies and may you have better luck in future yes hogan good by said joshua we make over to you all our interest in the bear he meant to eat you you can revenge yourself by eatin him are you going to leave me gentlemen asked hogan in alarm you dont expect us to stay and take care of you do you let me go with you pleaded hogan i am afraid to be left alone in this country i may meet another grizzly and lose my life that would be a great loss to the world said mr bickford with unconcealed sarcasm it would be a great loss to me said hogan maybe thats the best way to put it observed bickford it would have been money in my friend joes pocket if you had never been born may i go with you pleaded hogan this time addressing himself to joe mr hogan said joe you know very well why your company is not acceptable to us you shall have no occasion to complain said hogan earnestly do you want us to adopt you hogan asked joshua let me stay with you till we reach the nearest diggings then i wont trouble you any more joe turned to bickford if you dont object he said i think ill let him come let the critter come said bickford hed be sure to choke any grizzly that tackled him for the sake of the bear let him come mr hogan was too glad to join the party on any conditions to resent the tone which mr bickford employed in addressing him he obtained his suit and the party of three kept on their way as they advanced the country became rougher and more hilly here and there they saw evidences of prospecting by former visitors they came upon deserted claims and the sites of former camps but in these places the indications of gold had not been sufficiently favorable to warrant continued work and the miners had gone elsewhere at last however they came to a dozen men who were busily at work in a gulch two rude huts nearby evidently served as their temporary homes well boys how do you find it inquired bickford riding up pretty fair said one of the party have you got room for three more yes come along you can select claims alongside and go to work if you want to what do you say joe i am in favor of it we are going to put up here hogan said mr bickford you can do as youve a mind to much as we value your interestin society we hope you wont put yourself out to stay on our account ill stay said hogan joe and joshua surveyed the ground and staked out their claims writing out the usual notice and posting it on a neighboring tree they had not all the requisite tools but these they were able to purchase at one of the cabins what shall i do asked hogan im dead broke i cant work without tools and i cant buy any do you want to work for me asked joshua whatll you give thatll depend on how you work if you work stiddy ill give you a quarter of what we both make ill supply you with tools but theyll belong to me suppose we dont make anything suggested hogan you shall have a quarter of that you see i want to make it for your interest to succeed then i shall starve the bargain was modified so that hogan was assured of enough to eat and was promised besides a small sum of money daily but was not to participate in the gains if we find a nugget it wont do you any good do you understand hogan yes i understand he shrugged his shoulders having very little faith in any prospective nuggets then we understand each other thats all i want on the second day joe and mr bickford consolidated their claims and became partners agreeing to divide whatever they found hogan was to work for them jointly they did not find their hired man altogether satisfactory he was lazy and shiftless by nature and work was irksome to him if you dont work stiddy hogan said joshua you cant expect to eat stiddy and your appetite is pretty reglar i notice under this stimulus hogan managed to work better than he had done since he came out to california or indeed for years preceding his departure bickford and joe had both been accustomed to farm work and easily lapsed into their old habits they found they had made a change for the better in leaving the banks of the yuba the claims they were now working paid them better twentyfive dollars today said joshua a week after their arrival that pays better than hoeing pertaters joe you are right mr bickford you are ten dollars ahead of me i am afraid you will lose on our partnership ill risk it joe hogan was the only member of the party who was not satisfied cant you take me into partnership he asked we can but i dont think we will hogan said mr bickford it wouldnt pay if you dont like workin for us you can take a claim of your own i have no tools why dont you save your money and buy some instead of gamblin it away as you are doin a man must have amusement grumbled hogan besides i may have luck and win better keep clear of gamblin hogan mr hogan if you want to start a claim of your own ill give you what tools you need said joe upon reflection hogan decided to accept this offer but of course you will have to find your own vittles now said joshua ill do it said hogan the same day he ceased to work for the firm of bickford mason for joe insisted on giving mr bickford the precedence as the senior party and started on his own account the result was that he worked considerably less than before being his own master he decided not to overwork himself and in fact worked only enough to make his board he was continually grumbling over his bad luck although joshua told him plainly that it wasnt luck but industry he lacked if youd work like we do said bickford you wouldnt need to complain your claim is just as good as ours as far as we can tell then let us go in as partners said hogan not much you aint the kind of partner i want i was always unfortunate said hogan you were always lazy i reckon you were born tired werent you my health aint good said hogan i cant work like you two youve got a healthy appetite said mr bickford there aint no trouble there that i can see mr hogan had an easier time than before but he hadnt money to gamble with unless he deprived himself of his customary supply of food and this he was reluctant to do lend me halfanounce of golddust wont you he asked of joe one evening what do you want it for to gamble with yes said hogan i dreamed last night that i broke the bank all i want is money enough to start me i dont approve of gambling and cant help you hogan next tried mr bickford but with like result i aint quite such a fool hogan said the plainspoken joshua about this time a stroke of good luck fell to joe bout three oclock one afternoon he unearthed a nugget which at a rough estimate might be worth five hundred dollars instantly all was excitement in the miningcamp not alone for what he had obtained but for the promise of richer deposits experienced miners decided that he had struck upon what is popularly called a pocket and some of these are immensely remunerative shake hands joe said bickford youre in luck so are you mr bickford we are partners you know in less than an hour the two partners received an offer of eight thousand dollars for their united claim and the offer was accepted joe was the hero of the camp all were rejoiced at his good fortune except one that one was hogan who from a little distance jealous and gloomy surveyed the excited crowd chapter xxxvi hogans discontent why dont luck come to me muttered hogan to himself that green country boy has made a fortune while i an experienced man of the world have to live from hand to mouth its an outrage the parties to whom joe and his partner sold their claim were responsible men who had been fortunate in mining and had a bankaccount in san francisco well give you an order on our banker they proposed that will suit me better than money down said joe i shall start for san francisco tomorrow having other business there that i need to look after ill go too joe said joshua with my share of the purchasemoney and the nugget im worth nigh on to five thousand dollars what will dad say and what will susan smith say queried joe joshua grinned i guess shell say shes ready to change her name to bickford said he you must send me some of the cake mr bickford just wait joe the thing aint got to that yet i tell you joe i shall be somebody when i get home to pumpkin hollow with that pile of money the boysll begin to look up to me then i cant hardly believe its all true maybe im dreamin it jest pinch my arm will you joe complied with his request thatll do joe youve got some strength in your fingers i guess its true after all joe observed with some surprise that hogan did not come near them the rest without exception had congratulated them on their extraordinary good luck seems to me hogan looks rather down in the mouth said joe to bickford hes mad cause he didnt find the nugget thats whats the matter with him i say hogan you look as if your dinner didnt agree with you my luck dont agree with me you dont seem to look at things right wasnt you lucky the other day to get away from the bear i was unlucky enough to fall in with him wasnt you lucky in meetin my friend joe in new york and raisin money enough out of him to pay your passage out to californy i should be better off in new york i am dead broke youd be dead broke in new york such fellers as you always is dead broke do you mean to insult me mr bickford demanded hogan irritably oh dont rare up hogan it wont do no good youd ought to have more respect for me considerin i was your boss once id give something for that boys luck joes luck well things have gone pretty well with turn but that dont explain all his success hes willin to work so am i then go to work on your claim theres no knowin but theres a bigger nugget inside of it if you stand round with your hands in your pockets youll never find it its the poorest claim in the gulch said hogan discontentedly it pays the poorest because you dont work half the time hogan apparently didnt like mr bickfords plainness of speech he walked away moodily with his hands in his pockets he could not help contrasting his penniless position with the enviable position of the two friends and the devil who is always in wait for such moments thrust an evil suggestion into his mind it was this he asked himself why could he not steal the nugget which joe had found he can spare it for he has sold the claim for a fortune hogan reasoned it isnt fair that he should have everything and i should have nothing he ought to have made me his partner anyway he would if he hadnt been so selfish i have just as much right to a share in it as this infernal yankee id like to choke him this argument was a very weak one but a man easily persuades himself of what he wants to do ill try for it hogan decided this very night chapter xxxvii the nugget is stolen at this time joe and joshua were occupying a tent which they had purchased on favorable terms of a fellow miner they retired in good season for they wished to start early on their journey on the following morning i dont know as i can go to sleep said joshua i cant help thinkin of how rich i am and what dad and all the folks will say do you mean to go home at once mr bickford jest as soon as i can get ready ill tell you what i am goin to do joe im goin to buy a tiptop suit when i get to boston and a gold watch and chain and a breastpin about as big as a saucer when i sail into pumpkin holler in that rig folksll look at me you bet theres old squire pennyroyal hell be disappointed for one why will he be disappointed because he told dad i was a fool to come out here he said id be back in rags before a year was out now the old man thinks a good deal of his opinion and he wont like it to find how badly hes mistaken then he would prefer to see you come home in rags you bet he would how about susan aint you afraid she has married the store clerk joshua looked grave for a moment i wont say but she has said he but if she has gone and forgotten about me jest because my back is turned she aint the gal i take her for and i wont fret my gizzard about her she will feel worse than you when she finds you have come back with money thats so and you will easily find some one else suggested joe theres sophrony thompson thinks a sight of me said mr bickford shes awful jealous of susan if susan goes back on me ill call round and see sophrony joe laughed i wont feel anxious about you joshua he said since i find you have two girls to choose between not much danger of breakin my heart its pretty tough there was a brief silence then joshua said what are your plans joe shall you remain in san francisco ive been thinking mr bickford that i would like to go home on a visit if i find that i have left my business in good hands in the city i shall feel strongly tempted to go home on the same steamer with you that would be hunky said bickford really delighted wed have a jolly time i think we would but mr bickford i have no girls to welcome me home as you have you aint old enough yet joe youre a goodlookin feller and when the time comes i guess you can find somebody i dont begin to trouble myself about such things yet said joe laughing i am only sixteen youve been through considerable joe for a boy of sixteen i wish youd come up to pumpkin holler and make me a visit when youre to home perhaps i can arrange to be present at your wedding mr bickford that is if susan doesnt make you wait too long while this conversation was going on the dark figure of a man was prowling near the tent why dont the fools stop talking and go to sleep muttered hogan i dont want to wait here all night his wish was gratified the two friends ceased talking and lay quite still soon joes deep regular breathing and bickfords snoring convinced the listener that the time had come to carry out his plans with stealthy step he approached the tent and stooping over gently removed the nugget from under joshuas head there was a bag of golddust which escaped his notice the nugget was all he thought of with beating heart and hasty step the thief melted into the darkness and the two friends slept on unconscious of their loss chapter xxxviii hogans fate the sun was up an hour before joe and bickford awoke when joe opened his eyes he saw that it was later than the hour he intended to rise he shook his companion is it mornin asked bickford drowsily i should say it was everybody is up and eating breakfast we must prepare to set out on our journey then it is time we are rich said joshua with sudden remembrance do you know joe i haint got used to the thought yet i had actually forgotten it the sight of the nugget will bring it to mind thats so bickford felt for the nugget without a suspicion that the search would be in vain of course he did not find it joe you are trying to play a trick on me he said youve taken the nugget what exclaimed joe starting is it missing yes and you know all about it where have you put it joe on my honor joshua i havent touched it said joe seriously where did you place it under my head the last thing before i lay down are you positive of it certain sure then said joe a little pale it must have been taken during the night who would take it let us find hogan said joe with instinctive suspicion who has seen hogan hogans claim was in sight but he was not at work neither was he taking breakfast ill bet the skunk has grabbed the nugget and cleared out exclaimed bickford in a tone of conviction did you hear or see anything of him during the night no i slept too sound is anything else taken asked joe the bag of dust is safe its only the nugget thats gone the loss was quickly noised about the camp such an incident was of common interest miners lived so much in common their property was necessarily left so unguarded that theft was something more than misdemeanor or light offense stern was the justice which overtook the thief in those days it was necessary perhaps for it was a primitive state of society and the code which in established communities was a safeguard did not extend its protection here suspicion fell upon hogan at once no one of the miners remembered to have seen him since rising did any one see him last night asked joe kellogg answered i saw him near your tent he said i did not think anything of it perhaps if i had been less sleepy i should have been more likely to suspect that his design was not a good one about what hour was this it must have been between ten and eleven oclock we did not go to sleep at once mr bickford and i were talking over our plans i wish id been awake when the skunk come round said bickford id have grabbed him so hed thought an old grizzlyd got hold of him did you notice anything in his manner that led you to think he intended robbery asked kellogg he was complainin of his luck he thought joe and i got more than our share and im willin to allow we have but if wed been as lazy and shifless as hogan we wouldnt have got down to the nugget at all an informal council was held and it was decided to pursue hogan as it was uncertain in which direction he had fled it was resolved to send out four parties of two men each to hunt him joe and kellogg went together joshua and another miner departed in a different direction and two other pairs started out i guess well fix him said mr bickford if he can dodge us all hes smarter than i think he is meanwhile hogan with the precious nugget in his possession hurried forward with feverish haste the night was dark and the country was broken from time to time he stumbled over some obstacle the root of a tree or something similar and this made his journey more arduous i wish it was light he muttered then he revoked his wish in the darkness and obscurity lay his hopes of escape id give half this nugget if i was safe in san francisco he said to himself he stumbled on occasionally forced by his fatigue to sit down and rest i hope im going in the right direction but i dont know he said to himself he had been traveling with occasional rests for four hours when fatigue overcame him he lay down to take a slight nap but when he awoke the sun was up good heaven he exclaimed in alarm i must have slept for some hours i will eat something to give me strength and then i must hurry on he had taken the precaution to take some provisions with him and he began to eat them as he hurried along they have just discovered their loss thought hogan will they follow me i wonder i must be a good twelve miles away and this is a fair start they will turn back before they have come as far as this besides they wont know in what direction i have come hogan was mistaken in supposing himself to be twelve miles away in reality he was not eight during the night he had traveled at disadvantage and taken a roundabout way without being aware of it he was mistaken also in supposing that the pursuit would be easily abandoned mining communities could not afford to condone theft nor were they disposed to facilitate the escape of the thief more than once the murderer had escaped while the thief was pursued relentlessly all this made hogans position a perilous one if he had been long enough in the country to understand the feeling of the people he would not have ventured to steal the nugget about eleven oclock hogan sat down to rest he reclined on the greensward near the edge of a precipitous descent he did not dream that danger was so close till he heard his name called and two men came running toward him hogan starting to his feet in dismay recognized crane and peabody two of his late comrades what do you want he faltered as they came within hearing the nugget said crane sternly hogan would have denied its possession if he could but there it was at his side there it is he said what induced you to steal it demanded crane i was dead broke luck was against me i couldnt help it it was a bad days work for you said peabody didnt you know the penalty attached to theft in the miningcamps no faltered hogan alarmed at the stem looks of his captors what is it death by hanging was the terrible reply hogans face blanched and he sank on his knees before them dont let me be hung he entreated youve got the nugget back ive done no harm no one has lost anything by me eight of us have lost our time in pursuing you you gave up the nugget because you were forced to you intended to carry it away mercy mercy im a very unlucky man ill go away and never trouble you again we dont mean that you shall said crane sternly peabody tie his hands we must take him back with us i wont go said hogan lying down i am not going back to be hung it would obviously be impossible to carry a struggling man back fifteen miles or more we must hang you on the spot then said crane producing a cord say your prayers your fate is sealed but this is murder faltered hogan with pallid lips we take the responsibility he advanced toward hogan who now felt the full horrors of his situation he sprang to his feet rushed in frantic fear to the edge of the precipice threw up his arms and plunged headlong it was done so quickly that neither of his captors was able to prevent him they hurried to the precipice and looked over a hundred feet below on a rough rock they saw a shapeless and motionless figure crushed out of human semblance perhaps it is as well said crane gravely he has saved us an unwelcome task the nugget was restored to its owners to whom hogans tragical fate was told poor fellow said joe soberly i would rather have lost the nugget so would i said bickford he was a poor shifless critter but im sorry for him chapter xxxix how joes business prospered joe and his friend bickford arrived in san francisco eight days later without having met with any other misadventure or drawback he had been absent less than three months yet he found changes a considerable number of buildings had gone up in different parts of the town during his absence it is a wonderful place said joe to his companion it is going to be a great city some day its ahead of pumpkin holler already said mr bickford though the holler has been goin for over a hundred years joe smiled at the comparison he thought he could foresee the rapid progress of the new city but he was far from comprehending the magnificent future that lay before it a short time since the writer of this story ascended to the roof of the palace hotel and from this lofty elevation a hundred and forty feet above the sidewalk scanned with delighted eyes a handsome and substantial city apparently the growth of a century and including within its broad limits a population of three hundred thousand souls it will not be many years before it reaches halfamillion and may fairly be ranked among the great cities of the world of course joes first visit was to his old place of business he received a hearty greeting from watson his deputy i am glad to see you joe said he grasping our heros hand cordially when did you arrive ten minutes ago i have made you the first call perhaps you thought i might have vamosed the ranch said watson smiling and left you and the business in the lurch i had no fears on that score said joe has business been good excellent i have paid weekly your share of the profits to mr morgan am i a millionaire yet asked joe not quite i have paid mr morgan on your account here watson consulted a small accountbook nine hundred and twentyfive dollars is it possible said joe gratified that is splendid then you are satisfied more than satisfied i am glad of it i have made the same for myself and so have nearly half made up the sum which i so foolishly squandered at the gamingtable i am glad for you mr watson how have you prospered at the mines i have had excellent luck i dont believe you bring home as much money as i have made for you here dont bet on that mr watson for you would lose you dont mean to say that you have made a thousand dollars exclaimed watson surprised i have made five thousand dollars within a hundred or two is it possible ejaculated watson you beat everything for luck joe so he does said bickford who felt that it was time for him to speak its lucky for me that i fell in with him it brought me luck too for we went into partnership together have you brought home five thousand dollars too asked watson ive got about the same as joe and now im going home to marry susan smith if shell have me shell marry a rich miner mr bickford you neednt be concerned about that i feel pretty easy in mind said joshua how soon do you sail when does the next steamer go in six days i guess itll carry me watson turned to joe i suppose you will now take charge of your own business said lie i am ready to hand over my trust at any minute would you object to retaining charge for say for four months to come asked joe object i should be delighted to do it i couldnt expect to make as much money any other way you see mr watson i am thinking of going home myself on a visit i feel that i can afford it and i should like to see my old friends and acquaintances under my new and improved circumstances watson was evidently elated at the prospect of continued employment of so remunerative a character you may depend upon it that your interests are safe in my hands said he i will carry on the business as if it were my own indeed it will be for my interest to do so i dont doubt it mr watson i have perfect confidence in your management joes next call was on his friend morgan by whom also he was cordially welcomed have you called on watson he asked yes then he has probably given you an idea of how your business has gone on during your absence he is a thoroughly reliable man in my opinion you were fortunate to secure his services so i think have you done well at the mines asked mr morgan doubtfully you hope so but you dont feel confident said joe smiling you can read my thoughts exactly i dont consider mining as reliable as a regular business nor i in general but there is one thing you dont take into account what is that mr bickford answered the question joes luck then you have been lucky how much do you think i have brought home a thousand dollars five times that sum are you in earnest asked mr morgan incredulous wholly so then let me congratulate you on that and something else what is that the lots you purchased including the one on which your restaurant is situated have more than doubled in value bully for you joe exclaimed mr bickford enthusiastically it never rains but it pours said joe quoting an old proverb i begin to think i shall be rich some time mr morgan it seems very much like it what would you advise me to do mr morgan sell out the lots at the present advance hold on to them joe not only do that but buy more this is destined some day to be a great city it has a favorable location is the great mining center and the state i feel convinced has an immense territory fit for agricultural purposes lots here may fluctuate but they will go up a good deal higher than present figures if you think so mr morgan i will leave in your hands three thousand dollars for investment in other lots this will leave me including my profits from the business during my absence nearly three thousand dollars more which i shall take east and invest there i will follow your instructions joe and predict that your real estate investments will make you rich sooner than you think joe said bickford ive a great mind to leave half of my money with mr morgan to be invested in the same way do it mr bickford that will leave you enough to use at home yes i can buy a farm for two thousand dollars and stock it for five hundred more besides i neednt pay more than half down if i dont want to a good plan said joe mr morgan will you take my money and invest it for me just like joes of course i want you to take a commission for doing it with pleasure mr bickford more especially as i have decided to open a real estate office in addition to my regular business you and joe will be my first customers i shouldnt wonder if the two or three thousand dollars you leave with me should amount in ten years to ten thousand ten thousand ejaculated joshua elated wont i swell round pumpkin holler when im worth ten thousand dollars six days later among the passengers by the steamer for panama were joseph mason and joshua bickford chapter xl joes welcome home on arriving in new york both joe and mr bickford bought new suits of clothes mr bickford purchased a blue dress suit resplendent with brass buttons and a gold watch and chain which made a good deal of show for the money his tastes were still barbaric and a quiet suit of black would not have come up to his idea of what was befitting a successful california miner he surveyed himself before the tailors glass with abundant satisfaction i guess thatll strike em at home eh joe he said you look splendid mr bickford kinder scrumptious dont i decidedly so i say joe youd better have a suit made just like this joe shuddered at the thought in refinement of taste he was decidedly ahead of his friend and partner im going to buy a secondhand suit he said what ejaculated joshua joe smiled i knew youd be surprised but ill explain i want people to think at first that i have been unlucky oh i see said joshua nodding kinder take em in just so mr bickford well there is something in that then i shall find out who my true friends are just so it is not my purpose to describe mr bickfords arrival in pumpkin hollow resplendent in his new suit joshua wouldnt have changed places with the president of the united states on that day his old friends gathered about him and listened openmouthed to his stories of mining life in california and his own wonderful exploits which lost nothing in the telling he found his faithful susan unmarried and lost no time in renewing his suit he came he saw he conquered in four weeks susan became mrs bickford her husband became the owner of the farm he coveted and he at once took his place among the prominent men of pumpkin hollow in a few years he was appointed justice of the peace and became known as squire bickford it may be as well to state here before taking leave of him that his real estate investments in san francisco proved fortunate and in ten years he found himself worth ten thousand dollars this to joshua was a fortune and he is looked upon as a solid man in the town where he resides we now turn to joe since his departure nothing definite had been heard of him another boy had taken his place on major nortons farm but he was less reliable than joe i am out of patience with that boy i wish i had joe back again have you heard anything of joe since he went away inquired oscar not a word i dont believe he went to california at all in that case we should have heard from him no joes proud poor and proud said oscar i guess hes wished himself back many a time but hes too proud to own it joe was good to work said the major he was too conceited he didnt know his place he thought himself as good as me said oscar arrogantly most people seemed to like joe said the major candidly i didnt said oscar tossing his head if hed kept in his place and realized that he was a hired boy i could have got along well enough with him i wish he would come back said the major i would take him back i dare say hes had a hard time and would be humbler now said oscar at this moment a knock was heard at the door and just afterward joe entered he wore a mixed suit considerably the worse for wear and patched in two or three places there was a rip under the arm and his hat a soft felt one had become shapeless from long and apparently hard usage he stood in the doorway waiting for recognition how do you do joe said major norton cordially i am glad to see you joes face lighted up thank you sir he said shake hands joe major norton was mean in money matters but he had something of the gentleman about him oscar held aloof how do you do oscar im well said oscar have you been to california yes you dont seem to have made your fortune said oscar superciliously eying joes shabby clothing i havent starved said joe where did you get that suit of clothes asked oscar i hope youll excuse my appearance said joe well joe do you want to come back to your old place asked major norton ive got a boy but he doesnt suit me how much would you be willing to pay me major norton the major coughed well said he i gave you your board and clothes before thats pretty good pay for a boy im older now ill do the same by you joe and give you fifty cents a week besides thank you for the offer major norton ill take till tomorrow to think of it youd better accept it now said oscar beggars shouldnt be choosers i am not a beggar oscar said joe mildly you look like one anyway said oscar bluntly oscar said major norton if joe has been unlucky you shouldnt throw it in his teeth he went off expecting to make his fortune said oscar in an exulting tone he looks as if he had made it where are you going i am going to look about the village a little i will call again after joe went out oscar said it does me good to see joe come in rags serves him right for putting on airs on the main street joe met annie raymond why joe she exclaimed delighted is it really you bad pennies always come back said joe have you i am afraid you have not been fortunate said the young lady hesitating as she noticed joes shabby clothes do you think less of me for that no said annie raymond warmly it is you i like not your clothes you may have been unfortunate but i am sure you deserved success you are a true friend miss annie so i dont mind telling you that i was successful annie raymond looked astonished and these clothes she began i put on for oscar nortons benefit i wanted to see how he would receive me he evidently rejoiced at my bad fortune oscar is a mean boy joe you must come to our house to supper thank you i will but i will go round to the hotel and change my clothes never mind but i do mind i dont fancy a shabby suit as long as i can afford to wear a good one joe went to the hotel took off his ragged clothes put on a new and stylish suit which he recently had made for him donned a gold watch and chain and hat in the latest style and thus dressed his natural good looks were becomingly set off how do i look now he asked when he met miss annie raymond at her own door splendidly joe i thought you were a young swell from the city after supper annie said her eyes sparkling with mischief suppose we walk over to major nortons and see oscar just what i wanted to propose oscar was out in the front yard when he caught sight of joe and annie raymond approaching he did not at first recognize joe but thought like the young lady that it was some swell from the city you see ive come again oscar said joe smiling oscar could not utter a word he was speechless with astonishment i thought you were poor he uttered at last i have had better luck than you thought i suppose you spent all your money for those clothes you are mistaken oscar i am not so foolish i left between two and three thousand dollars in a new york bank and i have more than twice that in san francisco it isnt possible exclaimed oscar surprised and disappointed here is my bankbook you can look at it and joe pointed to a deposit of twentyfive hundred dollars i dont think oscar it will pay me to accept your fathers offer and take my old place i dont understand it how did you do it asked the bewildered oscar i suppose it was my luck said joe not wholly that said annie raymond it was luck and labor i accept the amendment miss annie oscars manner changed at once joe the successful californian was very different from joe the hired boy he became very attentive to our hero and before he left town condescended to borrow twenty dollars of him which he never remembered to repay he wanted to go back to california with joe but his father would not consent when joe returned to san francisco by advice of mr morgan he sold out his restaurant to watson and took charge of mr morgans real estate business he rose with the rising city became a very rich man and now lives in a handsome residence on one of the hills that overlook the bay he has an excellent wife our old friend annie raymond and a fine family of children his domestic happiness is by no means the smallest part of joes luck the end
