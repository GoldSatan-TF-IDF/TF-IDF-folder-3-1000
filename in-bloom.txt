in bloom edgar million in bloom published by edgar million at smashwords copyright edgar million dedicated to all those i have lost who live on in my heart it is now my duty to completely drain you nirvana the little boy looked upon his big brother with the sort of awe often found in younger siblings johnny substantially older than kim was the epitome of cool with kurt cobain grunge hair a guitar pinned to the wall and a black nirvana tshirt under a scruffy leather jacket and a variety of ripped jeans and tatty dms most weekends the band would practice in the garage and kim would lounge about in front pressed hard against the garage door to listen to blazing axe sounds which to his tender ears sounded full and accomplished although their the neighbours were less keen johnny cutbush was the lead singer and guitarist and might have chased him off if he had known he was there but kim kept quiet and listened to the rough guitar sounds and coarse words used by the fifteen year old johnny and his friends kim practised the sound of the some of the words quietly when he was on his own words he could tell were forbidden by the weight and vigour with which johnny and his friends hefted them but the nine yearold enjoyed the taste of them on his tongue although he understood little of their origin or their meaning and wouldnt have dared use them in front of his parents on the whole the elder sibling treated the younger with the sort of kindness often missing from brotherly relationships because the sizeable gap in their years meant that they werent really competing for attention or space certainly he was treated with greater respect by johnny than he himself bestowed upon his younger sibling alice a mere two years kims junior and frankly stupid and pointless in so many ways he wondered how she could get out of bed in the morning he wasnt allowed to sit in the garage and be with the group as they rehearsed that would have been taking things too far but his brother always had a friendly word for him or a tousle of his hair and had given him his own nirvana tshirt an old one of kims shrunk slightly in the wash the white garment with the crooked smiley face was kims most precious possession and every day he dashed to throw off his bottle green school tshirt to be replace with the oversized shirt with its askew smiling face adorning the front the songs sounded fantastic to kim mostly nirvana covers and sometimes a ballady thing that hed been told was by someone called neil young which shook the corrugated metal door as he leant against it his body thrilled with the vibrations occasionally another sound seeped in the noise of mrs hitchcock penetrating the waves of noise with a swoosh swoosh swoosh as she swept her drive patio and pathways headscarf wrapped tight around her head and chin with massive sunglasses obscuring much of her face as she swept and swept and swept the same stretch of path repeatedly she did this every day almost every hour to the extent that kim sometimes wondered if she was trying to dig or erode her way through she hovered permanently watching for stray leaves landing on the grass or the pathway kim had no idea why it bothered her so much and he wasnt about to ask her or talked her she scared him but he watched her swoosh swoosh swoosh along the path spying through a crack in the fence listening now to her as she made her other favourite sound tutting kim knew from experience that the tutting was probably a reaction to blasting guitar and drumming and figured it would only be a matter of time before she would be heading up the path to hammer on the door and berate johnny for his terrible behaviour or possibly his mum or dad for their lack of guidance in ensuring that the boy was suitably considerate and respectful and quiet all children appeared to be too noisy for mrs hitchcock he would edge closer to the fence behind the hydrangea plant if he heard her approach because whilst his older brother had regularly proved his lack of fear of her retrieving kims overhit footballs and numerous other spherical objects from her garden he had seen something of her to know she was not to be crossed hed known from the first she was to be feared when old man rab disappeared old man rab had been the elderly gentleman who had lived at number before she moved in kim had often chatted to rab who would call over the fence to him to discuss the various games and imagined adventures kim was having in the garden sometimes rab would tell him stories about his life about his longgone wife sandra and rabs own very real adventures when hed been in the war back in the olden days when hed dropped bombs out of darkened skies before falling out of one himself in flames minus most of his leg always with a lollipop or some other confectionery in hand old man rab had been everpresent in kims life until one day around a year ago he was no more gone the presence of old man rab dispenser of candy and war stories replaced by mrs hitchcock although he didnt know her name yet sweeping the path as though she was furious with the leaves for landing on it mum he called coming in from the garden with holding a dirty green toy stegosaurus that he had just found wedged into a flower bed and pointing it towards the unknown woman mum whos that lady i dont know dear maybe shes just moved in his mum peered out at the woman in the garden about time too the house was falling to rack and ruin empty kim stared at her rabs house had always been lovely his pride and joy his mum knew that she always went on about how lovely it was but what about rab who dear old man rab next door what about him his mother was now peering down at him curiously are you okay darling you look a little peaky your allergies arent playing up kim was allergic to tons of stuff tomatoes cheese dust and a whole range of household goods and foods he was okay with sweets thank god and meats and potatoes and rice but most other edible things would bring him out in an itchy rash he was fine with dirt with mud and was regularly caked with the stuff from his adventures in the garden his dad always said that he thought that playing in all the muck and bacteria might help build his resistance to the other nasties but it never had and he regularly spent days having antihistamines poured down his neck to reduce various swelling and rashes im fine mum i just want to know where old man next door has been empty for years darling in an absent moving onto other things tone of voice she had cut him off interrupting him in a way that he knew he would never have been allowed to do to her but knew not to comment on this no it hasnt he told her old man rab lives there kim now found that he had his mums attention intensely and later he would overhear her asking dad whether he thought the boy was okay ive no idea who youre talking about placing a hand on his forehead to check his temperature are you sure youre okay dear hes always been there kim told her stubbornly i see him every day dad just made a joke of it when his mum spoke to him later and started going wooooooooh ghosts woooooooh whilst his mum rolled her eyes and complained he never took things seriously enough so the moment passed but kim knew for certain that hed been eating rabs orange flavoured lollipops for well ever so had alice ghosts dont give you sweets do they even johnny still had the occasional werthers being too old for lollipops apparently now noone else in the house remembered him his much idolised older brother shrugged heavily when questioned despite the obvious rapport hed with the man since kim could remember certainly there was no hint of recognition from his idiot sister who had accepted lollies with relish as often as he himself everyone now said that the house had been empty for an age as long as they could recall and lets just hope the new lady is nice noone but kim remembered old man rab but he bet mrs hitchcock did rabs son an intermittent visitor visited no more time had swallowed him up or mrs hitchcock watching her crouched on her path snipping at the edge of the path with a pair of scissors snipping away at the edge of the grass in an effort to make it perfectly straight he wondered again how shed done it how shed ripped old man rab from the world and stole his house kim stared at her and decided that his parents contention that monsters were only pretend and in your head or actors wearing makeup on the telly and that there was nothing to be scared of was being severely put to the test she had not only done something with rab to him but had somehow contrived to make everyone else forget him rab told him his sandy would only truly be dead once there was noone left who remembered them only kim remembered rab now rab had been the first to go but was not the last in the weeks and months that followed her arrival there was a spate of disappearances from the village and kims little primary school with by kims reckoning at least four of the local children gone but instead of the outcry you would expect for a missing child there was nothing a year or so back an eleven year old disappeared for a couple of days and the nearby fields had been filled with black suited policemen and locals trudging through autumn soaked fields until it turned out the boy had run away and living on apples in a rundown barn just a couple of miles away near hunsdon now four children and one teacher had gone from his little village school and no mention had been made the earth covered them and the people who would normally be frantically searching for their lovedones professed no knowledge of them who they would say looking bemused sorry son i think youre confusing us with someone else we couldnt have kids then they walked sadly passed a mournful glaze covering their eyes their loved ones existences were being buried in time but for some strange reason kim remembered them all like the young couple who lived across the road who laughed when he asked after their baby who had so often lain on the lush grass in front of their rustic home on a blue and yellow blanket with ducks and bunnies embroidered into the soft fabric they told him no theyd never had a baby but and they looked hopeful and excited now and glanced at each other before telling the boy they were trying now for their first cant believe we waited this long they said looking lovingly at each other eventually he stopped telling his family about the disappearances as they began threatening to take him to something his brother called a headshrinker he didnt like the sound of that although he wasnt certain what it was they went on for months like this kim keeping his distance and pleading with his sceptical family to do the same she is a bit of a nutter his dad acknowledged over a cup of tea and crumpets toasted and smothered in cheese spread all that bloody sweeping and the stuff with leaves and the grass but that doesnt make her a monster just a daft old lady these were the last words kim his father ever spoke to him kim cutbush was not an early riser his little sister awoke at around am every day spending her the time before anyone else rose creating worlds and universes in the space beneath the pine kitchen table populated by sylvanian badgers and rabbits several my little ponies and an assortment of realistic looking jungle animals his dad was normally next up reading the next paper on his ipad with a coffee brewed in a small beige topped cafetiere as his sister played at his feet today as he passed he heard something new an argument appeared to have broken out between his dad and mrs hitchcock something about fallen leaves on mrs hitchcocks path she was saying they came from the trees in their garden and kim heard him telling her to chuck the damn things back over if they bother you laying in his bed kim heard a noise like something being water being emptied or a vacuum being filled and shot out of his bed a horrible thought occurring to him as he clattered down the stairs and into the kitchen to find his sister alone under the table conducting a conversation between a mountain lion and a squirrel his dads ipad laying alone on the table but no trace of him no empty coffee cup wheres dad he asked alice frantically but she just pulled a face at her big brother being weird again and he ran into the garden to find mrs hitchcock staring over the fence triumphantly ignoring her as he felt a sob growing in the pit of his stomach and tears seeping uncontrollably from his eyes boy she called to him but he ignored her would go nowhere near her you need to learn some manners boy within an hour all trace of dad had disappeared his study redecorated family photos airbrushed or absent as his existence was stitched out of time leaving the boy distraught please dear dont talk like that about your father said his mother a wistful look on her face as the boy begged her to recall his father you know i dont like to think about it he was just a man i knew briefly before you were born i dont really remember him but mum i knew him hes my daddy i want my daddy kim shouted tears in his eyes even though he knew it was futile and hes gone and i miss him i want him for a week he took to his bed weeping inconsolable whilst his mother went from initial irritation and befuddlement to growing concern and panic and in no time at all hed been booked in to see a counsellor a head shrinker who didnt actually do anything to his head and just showed him lots of funny drawings and asked him all these questions about what he thought he knew read out all these words to him and asked what they meant later he heard his mum telling johnny the counsellor had told her he was a deeply troubled boy and how she was really worried even though shed done her best with him he was deeply troubled just not by what mum thought the lady next door had knocked off half the village and noone seemed to have noticed again he recalled how rab told him a person was only truly dead when there was noone left who remembered them only he remembered dad now only he remembered all of them he crouched down behind the hydrangea and stared at her through the crack in the fence and cursed his mums reasoning it wasnt that hed never known dad hed been stolen from him from all of them and he stewed about it the only person who half believed him was his little sister alice but she more or less believed everything that anyone told her so this didnt help him at all except in that it kept her relatively safe mums rule about the band in bloom was that they didnt play beyond pm and they did their best to keep it down but this hadnt stopped mrs hitchcocks growing frustration at the noise boy she called over the fence that noise not noise mrs hitchcock interrupted johnny his fender copy in a tight grip music i know music and i know noise the pale woman spoke sternly in an accent which sounded odd to kims young ears foreign and which his mother described as russiansounding eastern european and this is closer to noise than music very loud noise please could you keep it quiet ill try my best responded johnny with an attempt at his most charming smile before turning around as he turned away from her kim saw mrs hitchcocks upper lip pull up into a snarl and caught a momentary glimpse of a single sharp middle tooth a fang which quickly retracted as she heard the smaller boy cry out in startlement she hadnt seen him there before but now he had her attention you boy she called to him come over here boy kim took a step back towards the house away from her and the tightly wound woman smiled the sharp needle tooth no longer visible are you okay she asked him in a softer voice than he remembered hearing from her before kim remained silent as they stared at one another and he wondering if she knew hed found out her secret before his brothers voice shook them both from their reverie as he was summoned for dinner later whilst his mum did the washing up he sat with his brother on the pale blue sofa and told him he had something to explain johnny sighed deeply seriously kim i love you dearly bruv but you need to stop this shes not a monster and she certainly hasnt done something to your dad our dad kim interrupted i didnt even know my dad kim johnny sounded exasperated and amused i wish i had but i just didnt kim had an idea mum always says weve got the same dad right yeah so why cant you remember him hed have been there when i was little right up to before alice was born why dont you remember him then how old were you when alice was born johnny looked confused well or i suppose but kim interrupted him again and even if you dont remember your dad why dont you remember my dad johnny considered this for a long time but could not find a decent response so this dad you say that you remember johnny asked and kim nodded he was like my dad too right in your memory and just saying he had or did exist what was he like there was a look of longing in the older boys green eyes a desire for something lost or never known and kim felt terrified by the absence in his face still the same older brother not knowing how that longing had got there he was just dad you know we used to watch tottenham with him and hed keep telling us how we couldnt support anyone else if we wanted to go with him to the lane to watch them like that would be so bad kim recalled numerous depressed walks away from the ground towards northumberland park train station and he read us stories and shouted at us sometimes especially you to turn your music down he read you all the harry potters and hes read me the first two ive never been to the lane johnny told his younger brother id love to youve been there loads johnny any time he could get spare tickets hed take us you were there when we beat arsenal i was so jealous i wish he was real he was real john kims face drenched with tears now cant you see its all wrong now and as johnny stared at kim he thought that maybe he was right maybe it was all wrong the more he thought about it the more everything all seemed off slightly look say youre right and people are disappearing he said still looking sceptical but accepting of the possibility he was onto something why do you think next door has anything to do with it kim explained about old man rab the nice man with the sweeties and how shed immediately taken his place and how people especially those who had annoyed mrs hitchcock had gone too including dad as well as others who couldnt possibly have done her harm like the baby opposite then he described the tooth like a single vampire fang concealed behind her scowl johnny spoke what difference does it make though even if it were true what can we do kim still smarting from the loss of his dad looked deadly serious well first off you could stop annoying her with the band ive warned alice to keep well away from her as well his brother nodded in forced agreement his younger brother sometimes possessed a persuasiveness which belied his tender years i could turn the music down i suppose but im not convinced still theres no harm in being careful this better not be some weird joke though kim and his brother maintained an edgy surveillance of the path sweeping neighbour kept her constantly in the periphery of their vision whilst the younger gave the elder information on those who continued to vanish the man from the murco garage which closed for three weeks until the company worked out that it was unattended mrs fairweather the mum of the baby who disappeared from across the road was gone as now as well leaving a behind a bemused husband wondering whatever had possessed him a merry bachelor to buy a three bedroom home in a village in the middle of nowhere then there was no post for a week after samthepostie dropped some small cerise coloured elastic bands on mrs hitchcocks doorstep and declined to clear them away only kim could see these things these absences and lately as he watched the old lady out of the corner of his eye he sensed piercing stares from her amid the constant sweeping like she had picked up the scent of his or their fear the sense that he alone was aware of her talent and her hunger kim wondered if she moved through the country like this emptying village after village of its inhabitants before moving onto the next unsuspecting town to feast he would keep his family safe from her he would protect them and then and then hed always been needled by her his idiot little sister but then he saw her from his bedroom window pursuing the pink hellokitty football towards the fence then after looking furtively to make sure mrs hitchcock wasnt around over after it ignoring kims previous warnings he suddenly felt her worth and knew how much hed miss her cheerfulness her cacophonous laughter and he screamed at her her cries soundless from behind double glazed glass installed by his diy mad dad nooooooo alice dont she couldnt hear him she dropped over the fence as he struggled futilely to open the childlocked window watching as mrs hitchcock stepped out from behind old man rabs potting shed her broom in hand and a look of utter hatred in her eyes for a moment mrs hitchcock lifted from the ground and floated above the scene as alice shrank from the fanged cloaked thing which transformed and fell upon her in a rage beams of darkness exploding from the scene pouring her from reality then she too was gone leaving only mrs hitchcock now watching kim weeping framed in the upstairs window johnny looked with blank terror at the boy when he found him he had found his brother prone on the green carpeting sobbing alices name who kim explained the latest abduction and the scene hed witnessed i cant have a little sister id remember her kim was weeping again now he hadnt known it but hed grown up in a community a family and it had nurtured and raised him but it was being torn away from him by this monster slice by slice how long before she got him or worse got johnny or his mum what can we do though kim despite the precariousness of their circumstance kim bristled with pride at being asked for his brothers advice but he had not answered hugging his nirvana tshirt closer to his skin in his comics shed have had some fatal weakness that they could exploit and defeat her with but sweeping aside he had no idea even how she did it does she bite them with that fang thing dunno i suppose the people just go like this he gestured with his hands miming a black supernova and then noone even remembers them not even dad he resisted the urge to call him daddy a moniker hed ceased to use as soon as he realised his big brother didnt use it he wanted his daddy badly he missed him so much of a night hed lay sobbing into red bear unable to talk to mum without her looking terrified and too proud to cry again in front of johnny john jr named for his daddy his face reminded him of dads sometimes what do we do the words hung in the air there was only one solution they both knew it but one of them had to voice if they were to survive we could kim looked around his room as if searching for spies we could kill her johnny sat stunned he was increasingly convinced by his little brother and the absence from his missing father had become tangible since revealed to him a space which had been full was now an empty room he was starting to understand shed taken him his heart and a life that he didnt remember but he longed for that life and he now knew they going to have to kill her they plotted to draw her to them in blooms band practice had become more muted recently and johnnys friends had been voicing the opinion that their lead man johnny had lost his edge and maybe they needed to find a new lead singer with a garage they could properly let rip in tonight was a return to form for johnny it seemed hed been holding in the sound for so long but the emotional loss he was experiencing vicariously broke the sound barrier roaring into drain you five times one after another then after a moments silence ten minutes of territorial pissings frantic guitars and drums cacophonous looping expanding to fill the universe kim had been allowed into the sanctum today which drew comment from the rest of the band but who forgot this youthful infraction when they heard the passionate solo of their band leader returning to form he couldnt hear it but he knew that behind the sound would be the angry swoosh swoosh swoosh of next door sweeping but for now all he could hear was the glorious three piece and his brother shrieking and sweat drenched on the garage floor and kim felt certain he would never hear a more wonderful sound later when the noise tailed off once topend mercedes and bmws had entered and left the drive to collect their wannabe rock star children they were left alone in the dark dusty gloom last rays of the summer sun fading out cutting impossible slices of brilliance through cracks in the roof awaiting the monster next door johnny continued to play in the gloom his guitar scream increasingly deafening and his brother kim sitting on the gaffertaped drum stool doing his best to keep some rhythm with drumsticks which the elder had sharpened into vicious spikes mrs hitchcock kicked the garage door open with a bang silhouetted against the glorious setting sun head scarf pulled tight she screamed at them enough enough of this noise i have lived too long to have to put up with this now and kim had a vision of mrs hitchcock ten thousand years ago feeding upon humans as they emerged chalk in hand from caves decorated with bison and smoke and fire johnny was screaming too and before he knew it a drumstick had been snatched from his hand and plunged into her throat kim following with the other slamming it into her chest piercing the heart mrs hitchcocks eyes wider than the universe as kim watched and waited and hoped for the harm she had done to be put right would everyone now return he wondered hoped my they at least remember or would they all just live on in him so many lost voices nothing was ever put right wherever dad and alice and the others had gone it appeared there was no coming back the police arrived around an hour later called by the bachelor across the road who was concerned by the teenaged boy sitting twitching on his drive covered in blood and holding two bloodied spikes in his hand he went with the police without complaint as a young boy watched silently from an upstairs as another presence was removed from his life although not permanently this time hed been shocked by the blood partly because he had thought the monster might explode in dust and blackness as the good people were returned to their lives she didnt and they werent she just lay motionless and twitching bled onto the concrete mouth in an o of horror which revealed no fang but which he figured that was retracted just out of sight he was just glad no one else would lose their life through her hunger lose their existence johnny had done a brave thing and taken all the blame saved them his mum said his brother might only do eight years before his release and although that seemed a lifetime to the young boy hed seen enough to know there were greater losses eight years to save everyone who left not fair johnny was a hero but hed saved them then it happened around three months later another boy from his class brendan disappeared and was forgotten by everyone except kim and he knew it had started again he sat behind the hydrangea on the drive and stared intensely at the people passing in the street and wondered if maybe mrs hitchcock had had the chance to turn one of them before her demise thanks
