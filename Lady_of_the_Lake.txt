lady of the lake i life of scott i walter scott was born in edinburgh august of an ancient scotch clan numbering in its time many a hard rider and good fighter and more than one of these petty chieftains halfshepherd and halfrobber who made good the winter inroads into their stock of beeves by spring forays and cattle drives across the english border scotts greatgrandfather was the famous beardie of harden so called because after the exile of the stuart sovereigns he swore never to cut his beard until they were reinstated and several degrees farther back he could point to a still more famous figure auld wat of harden who with his fair dame the flower of yarrow is mentioned in the lay of the last minstrel the first member of the clan to abandon country life and take up a sedentary profession was scotts father who settled in edinburgh as writer to the signet a position corresponding in scotland to that of attorney or solicitor in england the character of this father stern scrupulous calvinistic with a high sense of ceremonial dignity and a punctilious regard for the honorable conventions of life united with the wilder ancestral strain to make scott what he was from auld wat and beardie came his high spirit his rugged manliness his chivalric ideals from the writer to the signet came that power of methodical labor which made him a giant among the literary workers of his day and that delicate sense of responsibility which gave his private life its remarkable sweetness and beauty at the age of eighteen months scott was seized with a teething fever which settled in his right leg and retarded its growth to such an extent that he was slightly lame for the rest of his life possibly this affliction was a blessing in disguise since it is not improbable that scotts love of active adventure would have led him into the army or the navy if he had not been deterred by a bodily impediment in which case english history might have been a gainer but english literature would certainly have been immeasurably a loser in spite of his lameness the child grew strong enough to be sent on a long visit to his grandfathers farm at sandyknowe and here lying among the sheep on the windy downs playing about the romantic ruins of smailholm tower scampering through the heather on a tiny shetland pony or listening to stories of the thrilling past told by the old women of the farm he drank in sensations which strengthened both the hardiness and the romanticism of his nature a story is told of his being found in the fields during a thunder storm clapping his hands at each flash of lightning and shouting bonny bonny a bit of infantile intrepidity which makes more acceptable a story of another sort illustrative of his mental precocity a lady entering his mothers room found him reading aloud a description of a shipwreck accompanying the words with excited comments and gestures theres the mast gone he cried crash it goes they will all perish the lady entered into his agitation with tact and on her departure he told his mother that he liked their visitor because she was a virtuoso like himself to her amused inquiry as to what a virtuoso might be he replied dont ye know why tis one who wishes to and will know everything footnote see scotts ballad the eve of st john as a boy at school in edinburgh and in kelso and afterwards as a student at the university and apprentice in his fathers law office scott took his own way to become a virtuoso a rather queer way it must sometimes have seemed to his good preceptors he refused pointblank to learn greek and cared little for latin his scholarship was so erratic that he glanced meteorlike from the head to the foot of his classes and back again according as luck gave or withheld the question to which his highly selective memory had retained the answer but outside of school hours he was intensely at work to know everything so far as everything came within the bounds of his special tastes before he was ten years old he had begun to collect chapbooks and ballads as he grew older he read omnivorously in romance and history at school he learned french for the sole purpose of knowing at first hand the fascinating cycles of old french romance a little later he mastered italian in order to read dante and ariosto and to his schoolmasters indignation stoutly championed the claim of the latter poet to superiority over homer a little later he acquired spanish and read don quixote in the original with such efforts however considerable as they were for a boy who passionately loved a bicker in the streets and who was famed among his comrades for bravery in climbing the perilous kittle nine stanes on castle rock he was not content nothing more conclusively shows the genuineness of scotts romantic feeling than his willingness to undergo severe mental drudgery in pursuit of knowledge concerning the old storied days which had enthralled his imagination it was no moonshine sentimentality which kept him hour after hour and day after day in the advocates library poring over musty manuscripts deciphering heraldic devices tracing genealogies and unraveling obscure points of scottish history by the time he was twentyone he had made himself almost unconsciously an expert paleographer and antiquarian whose assistance was sought by professional workers in those branches of knowledge carlyle has charged against scott that he poured out his vast floods of poetry and romance without preparation or forethought that his production was always impromptu and rooted in no sufficient past of acquisition the charge cannot stand from his earliest boyhood until his thirtieth year when he began his brilliant career as poet and novelist his life was one long preparation very individual and erratic preparation perhaps but none the less earnest and fruitful in scott then twentyone years old was admitted a member of the faculty of advocates of edinburgh during the five years which elapsed between this date and his marriage his life was full to overflowing of fun and adventure rich with genial companionship and with experience of human nature in all its wild and tame varieties ostensibly he was a student of law and he did indeed devote some serious attention to the mastery of his profession but the dry formalities of legal life his keen humor would not allow him to take quite seriously on the day when he was called to the bar while waiting his turn among the other young advocates he turned to his friend william clark who had been called with him and whispered mimicking the highland lasses who used to stand at the cross of edinburgh to be hired for the harvest weve stood here an hour by the tron hinny and deil a ane has speered our price though scott never made a legal reputation either as pleader at the bar or as an authority upon legal history and principles it cannot be doubted that his experience in the edinburgh courts was of immense benefit to him in the first place his study of the scotch statutes statutes which had taken form very gradually under the pressure of changing national conditions gave him an insight into the politics and society of the past not otherwise to have been obtained of still more value perhaps was the association with his young companions in the profession and daily contact with the racy personalities which traditionally haunt all courts of law and particularly scotch courts of law the first association kept him from the affectation and sentimentality which is the bane of the youthful romanticist and the second enriched his memory with many an odd figure afterward to take its place clothed in the colors of a great dramatic imagination upon the stage of his stories footnote asked added to these experiences there were others equally calculated to enlarge his conception of human nature not the least among these he found in the brilliant literary and artistic society of edinburgh to which his mothers social position gave him entrance here when only a lad he met robert burns then the pet and idol of the fashionable coteries of the capital here he heard henry mackenzie deliver a lecture on german literature which turned his attention to the romantic poetry of germany and led directly to his first attempts at balladwriting but much more vital than any or all of these influences were those endless walkingtours which alone or in company with a boon companion he took over the neighboring countryside carefree roystering expeditions which he afterwards immortalized as dandie dinmonts liddesdale raids in guy mannering thirty miles across country as the crow flies with no objective point and no errand a village inn or a shepherds hut at night with a crone to sing them an old ballad over the fire or a group of hardy dalesmen to welcome them with stories and carousal these were blithe adventurous days such as could not fail to ripen scotts already ardent nature and store his memory with genial knowledge the account of dandie dinmont given by mr shortreed may be taken as a picture only too true in some of its touches of scott in these youthful escapades eh me sic an endless fund of humor and drollery as he had then wi him never ten yards but we were either laughing or roaring and singing wherever we stopped how brawlie he suited himsel to everybody he aye did as the lave did never made himsel the great man or took ony airs in the company ive seen him in a moods in these jaunts grave and gay daft and serious sober and drunk this however even in our wildest rambles was but rare but drunk or sober he was aye the gentleman he looked excessively heavy and stupid when he was fou but he was never out o gude humor after this we are not surprised to hear that scotts father told him disgustedly that he was better fitted to be a fiddling peddler a gangrel scrapegut than a respectable attorney as a matter of fact however behind the mad pranks and the occasional excesses there was a very serious purpose in all this scouring of the countryside scott was picking up here and there from the old men and women with whom he hobnobbed antiquarian material of an invaluable kind bits of local history immemorial traditions and superstitions and above all precious ballads which had been handed down for generations among the peasantry these ballads thus precariously transmitted it was scotts ambition to gather together and preserve and he spared no pains or fatigue to come at any scrap of ballad literature of whose existence he had an inkling meanwhile he was enriching heart and imagination for the work that was before him so that here also though in the hairbrained and heady way of youth he was engaged in his task of preparation scott has told us that it was his reading of don quixote which determined him to be an author but he was first actually excited to composition in another way this was by hearing recited a ballad of the german poet brger entitled lenore in which a skeleton lover carries off his bride to a wedding in the land of death mr hutton remarks upon the curiousness of the fact that a piece of raw supernaturalism like this should have appealed so strongly to a mind as healthy and sane as scotts so it was however he could not rid himself of the fascination of the piece until he had translated it and published it together with another translation from the same author one stanza at least of this first effort of scott sounds a note characteristic of his poetry tramp tramp along the land they rode splash splash along the sea the scourge is red the spur drops blood the flashing pebbles flee here we catch the trumpetlike clang and staccato tramp of verse which he was soon to use in a way to thrill his generation this tiny pamphlet of verse scotts earliest publication appeared in soon after he met monk lewis then famous as a purveyor to english palates of the crude horrors which german romanticism had just ceased to revel in lewis was engaged in compiling a book of supernatural stories and poems under the title of tales of wonder and asked scott to contribute scott wrote for this book three long ballads glenfinlas cadyow castle and the gray brother though tainted with the conventional diction of eighteenth century verse these ballads are not unimpressive pieces of work the second named especially shows a kind and degree of romantic imagination such as his later poetry rather substantiated than newly revealed ii in the following year scott married a miss charpentier daughter of a french refugee she was not his first love that place having been usurped by a miss stuart belches for whom scott had felt perhaps the only deep passion of his life and memory of whom was to come to the surface touchingly in his old age miss charpentier or carpenter as she was called with her vivacity and quaint foreign speech caught his heart on the rebound there can be no doubt that in spite of a certain shallowness of character she made him a good wife and that his affection for her deepened steadily to the end the young couple went to live at lasswade a village near edinburgh on the esk scott in whom the proprietary instinct was always very strong took great pride in the pretty little cottage he made a diningtable for it with his own hands planted saplings in the yard and drew together two willowtrees at the gate into a kind of arch surmounted by a cross made of two sticks after i had constructed this he says mamma mrs scott and i both of us thought it so fine that we turned out to see it by moonlight and walked backwards from it to the cottage door in admiration of our magnificence and its picturesque effect it would have been well indeed for them both if their pleasures of proprietorship could always have remained so touchingly simple now that he was married scott was forced to look a little more sharply to his fortunes he applied himself with more determination to the law in he became deputysheriff of selkirkshire with a salary of three hundred pounds which placed him at least beyond the reach of want he began to look more and more to literature as a means of supplementing his income his ballads in the tales of wonder had gained him some reputation this he increased in by the publication under the title border minstrelsy of the ballads which he had for several years been collecting collating and richly annotating meanwhile he was looking about for a congenial subject upon which to try his hand in a larger way than he had as yet adventured such a subject came to him at last in a manner calculated to enlist all his enthusiasm in its treatment for it was given him by the countess of dalkeith wife of the heirapparent to the dukedom of buccleugh the ducal house of buccleugh stood at the head of the clan scott and toward its representative the poet always held himself in an attitude of feudal reverence the duke of buccleugh was his chief entitled to demand from him both passive loyalty and active service so at least scott loved to interpret their relationship making effective in his own case a feudal sentiment which had elsewhere somewhat lapsed he especially loved to think of himself as the bard of his clan a modern representative of those rude poets whom the scottish chiefs once kept as a part of their household to chant the exploits of the clan nothing could have pleased his fancy more therefore than a request on the part of the lady of his chief to treat a subject of her assigning namely the dark mischiefmaking of a dwarf or goblin who had strayed from his unearthly master and attached himself as page to a human household the subject fell in with the poets reigning taste for strong supernaturalism gilpin horner the goblin page though he proved in the sequel a difficult character to put to poetic use was a figure grotesque and eerie enough to appeal even to monk lewis at first scott thought of treating the subject in balladform but the scope of treatment was gradually enlarged by several circumstances to begin with he chanced upon a copy of goethes gtz von berlichingen and the history of that robber baron suggested to him the feasibility of throwing the same vivid light upon the old border life of his ancestors as goethe had thrown upon that of the rhine barons this led him to subordinate the part played by the goblin page in the proposed story which was now widened to include elaborate pictures of medieval life and manners and to lay the scene in the castle of branksome formerly the stronghold of scotts and the duke of buccleughs ancestors the verse form into which the story was thrown was due to a still more accidental circumstance ie scotts overhearing sir john stoddard recite a fragment of coleridges unpublished poem christabel the placing of the story in the mouth of an old harper fallen upon evil days was a happy afterthought besides making a beautiful framework for the main poem it enabled the author to escape criticism for any violent innovations of style since these could always be attributed to the rude and wild school of poetry to which the harper was supposed to belong in these ways the lay of the last minstrel gradually developed in its present form upon its publication in it achieved an immediate success the vividness of its descriptive passages the buoyant rush of its meter the deep romantic glow suffusing all its pages took by storm a public familiar to weariness with the decorous abstractions of the eighteenth century poets the first edition a sumptuous quarto was exhausted in a few weeks an octavo edition of fifteen hundred was sold out within the year and before fortyfour thousand copies were needed to supply the popular demand scott received in all something under eight hundred pounds for the lay a small amount when contrasted with his gains from subsequent poems but a sum so unusual nevertheless that he determined forthwith to devote as much time to literature as he could spare from his legal duties those he still placed foremost for until near the close of his life he clung to his adage that literature was a good staff but a poor crutch a year before the publication of the lay scott had removed to the small country seat of ashestiel in selkirkshire seven miles from the nearest town selkirk and several miles from any neighbor in the introductions to the various cantos of marmion he has given us a delightful picture of ashestiel and its surroundings the swift glenkinnon dashing through the estate in a deep ravine on its way to join the tweed behind the house the rising hills beyond which lay the lovely scenery of the yarrow the eight years at ashestiel were the serenest and probably the happiest of scotts life here he wrote his two greatest poems marmion and the lady of the lake his mornings he spent at his desk always with a faithful hound at his feet watching the tireless hand as it threw off sheet after sheet of manuscript to make up the days stint by one oclock he was as he said his own man free to spend the remaining hours of light with his children his horses and his dogs or to indulge himself in his lifelong passion for treeplanting his robust and healthy nature made him excessively fond of all outofdoor sports especially riding in which he was daring to foolhardiness it is a curious fact noted by lockhart that many of scotts senses were blunt he could scarcely for instance tell one wine from another by the taste and once sat quite unconscious at his table while his guests were manifesting extreme uneasiness over the approach of a toolongkept haunch of venison but his sight was unusually keen as his hunting exploits proved his little son once explained his fathers popularity by saying that it was him that commonly saw the hare sitting what with hunting fishing salmonspearing by torchlight gallops over the hills into the yarrow country planting and transplanting of his beloved trees scotts life at ashestiel during the hours when he was his own man was a very full and happy one unfortunately he had already embarked in an enterprise which was destined to overthrow his fortunes just when they seemed fairest while at school in kelso he had become intimate with a school fellow named james ballantyne and later when ballantyne set up a small printing house in kelso he had given him his earliest poems to print after the issue of the border minstrelsy the typographical excellence of which attracted attention even in london he set ballantyne up in business in edinburgh secretly entering the firm himself as silent partner the good sale of the lay had given the firm an excellent start but more matter was presently needed to feed the press to supply it scott undertook and completed at ashestiel four enormous tasks of editing the complete works of dryden and of swift the somers tracts and the sadler state papers the success of these editions and the subsequent enormous sale of scotts poems and novels would have kept the concern solvent in spite of ballantynes complete incapacity for business but in scott plunged recklessly into another and more serious venture a dispute with constable the veteran publisher and bookseller aggravated by the harsh criticism delivered upon marmion by francis jeffrey editor of the edinburgh review constables magazine determined scott to set up in connection with the ballantyne press a rival bookselling concern and a rival magazine to be called the quarterly review the project was a daring one in view of constables great ability and resources to make it foolhardy to madness scott selected to manage the new business a brother of james ballantyne a dissipated little buffoon with about as much business ability and general caliber of character as is connoted by the name which scott coined for him rigdumfunnidos the selection of such a man for such a place betrays in scotts eminently sane and balanced mind a curious strain of impracticality to say the least indeed we are almost constrained to feel with his harsher critics that it betrays something worse than defective judgment defective character his greatest failing if failing it can be called was pride he could not endure even the mild dictations of a competent publisher as is shown by his answer to a letter written by one of them proposing some salaried work he replied curtly that he was a black hussar of literature and not to be put to such tame service probably this haughty dislike of dictation this imperious desire to patronize rather than be patronized led him to choose inferior men with whom to enter into business relations if so he paid for the fault so dearly that it is hard for a biographer to press the issue against him for the present however the wind of fortune was blowing fair and all the storm clouds were below the horizon in marmion appeared and was greeted with an enthusiasm which made the unprecedented reception of the lay seem lukewarm in comparison marmion contains nothing which was not plainly foreshadowed in the lay but the hand of the poet has grown more sure his descriptive effects are less crude and amateurish the narrative proceeds with a steadier march the music has gained in volume and in martial vigor an anecdote is told by mr hutton which will serve as a type of a hundred others illustrative of the extraordinary hold which this poetry took upon the minds of ordinary men i have heard he says of two old men complete strangers passing each other on a dark london night when one of them happened to be repeating to himself just as campbell did to the hackney coachman of the north bridge of edinburgh the last lines of the account of flodden field in marmion charge chester charge when suddenly a reply came out of the darkness on stanley on whereupon they finished the death of marmion between them took off their hats to each other and parted laughing the lady of the lake which followed in little more than a year was received with the same popular delight and with even greater respect on the part of the critics even the formidable jeffrey who was supposed to dine off slaughtered authors as the giant in jack and the beanstalk dined off young englishmen keyed his voice to unwonted praise the influx of tourists into the trossachs where the scene of the poem was laid was so great as seriously to embarrass the mail coaches until at last the posting charges had to be raised in order to diminish the traffic far away in spain at a trying moment of the peninsular campaign sir adam ferguson posted on a point of ground exposed to the enemys fire read to his men as they lay prostrate on the ground the passage from the lady of the lake describing the combat between roderick dhus highlanders and the forces of the earl of mar and the listening soldiers only interrupted him by a joyous huzza when the french shot struck the bank close above them such tributes and they were legion to the power of his poetry to move adventurous and hardy men must have been intoxicating to scott there is small wonder that the success of his poems gave him as he says such a heeze as almost lifted him off his feet iii scotts modesty was not in danger but so far as his prudence was concerned his success did really lift him off his feet in still more encouraged thereto by entering upon the emoluments of the office of clerk of sessions the duties of which he had performed for six years without pay he purchased abbotsford an estate on the tweed adjoining that of the duke of buccleugh his kinsman and near the beautiful ruins of melrose abbey here he began to carry out the dream of his life to found a territorial family which should augment the power and fame of his clan beginning with a modest farm house and a farm of a hundred acres he gradually bought planted and built until the farm became a manorial domain and the farm house a castle he had not gone far in this work before he began to realize that the returns from his poetry would never suffice to meet such demands as would thus be made upon his purse byrons star was in the ascendant and before its baleful magnificence scotts milder and more genial light visibly paled he was himself the first to declare with characteristic generosity that the younger poet had bet him at his own craft as carlyle says he had held the sovereignty for some halfscore of years a comparatively long lease of it and now the time seemed come for dethronement for abdication an unpleasant business which however he held himself ready as a brave man will to transact with composure and in silence footnote bested got the better of but as it proved there was no need for resignation the reign of metrical romance brilliant but brief was past or nearly so but what of prose romance which long ago in picking out don quixote from the puzzling spanish he had promised himself he would one day attempt with some such questioning of the fates scott drew from his desk the sheets of a story begun seven years before and abandoned because of the success of the lay of the last minstrel this story he now completed and published as waverley in the spring of an event memorable in the annals of british literature in the annals of british bookselling thrice and four times memorable the popularity of the metrical romances dwindled to insignificance before the enthusiasm with which this prose romance was received a moment before quietly resolved to give up his place in the worlds eye and to live the life of an obscure country gentleman scott found himself launched once more on the tide of brave fortunes the ballantyne publishing and printing houses ceased to totter and settled themselves on what seemed the firmest of foundations at abbotsford buying planting and building began on a greater scale than had ever been planned in its owners most sanguine moments the history of the next eleven years in scotts life is the history on the one hand of the rapidlyappearing novels of a fame gradually spreading outward from great britain until it covered the civilized world a fame increased rather than diminished by the incognito which the author of waverley took great pains to preserve even after the secret had become an open one on the other hand of the largehearted hospitable life at abbotsford where in spite of the importunities of curious and illbred tourists bent on getting a glimpse of the wizard of the north and in spite of the enormous mass of work literary and official which scott took upon himself to perform the atmosphere of country leisure and merriment was somehow miraculously preserved this life of the hearty prosperous country laird was the one toward the realization of which all scotts efforts were directed it is worth while therefore to see as vividly as may be what kind of life that was that we may the better understand what kind of man he was who cared for it the following extract from lockharts life of scott gives us at least one very characteristic aspect of the abbotsford world it was a clear bright september morning with a sharpness in the air that doubled the animating influence of the sunshine and all was in readiness for a grand coursingmatch on newark hill the only guest who had chalked out other sport for himself was the staunchest of anglers mr rose but he too was there on his shelty armed with his salmonrod and landingnet this little group of waltonians bound for lord somervilles preserve remained lounging about to witness the start of the main cavalcade sir walter mounted on sibyl was marshalling the order of procession with a huge huntingwhip and among a dozen frolicsome youths and maidens who seemed disposed to laugh at all discipline appeared each on horseback each as eager as the youngest sportsman in the troop sir humphrey davy dr wollaston and the patriarch of scottish belleslettres henry mackenzie laidlow the steward of abbotsford on a strongtailed wiry highlander yclept hoddin grey which carried him nimbly and stoutly although his feet almost touched the ground was the adjutant but the most picturesque figure was the illustrious inventor of the safetylamp sir humphrey davy a brown hat with flexible brim surrounded with line upon line of catgut and innumerable flyhooks jackboots worthy of a dutch smuggler and a fustian surtout dabbled with the blood of salmon made a fine contrast with the smart jacket whitecord breeches and wellpolished jockeyboots of the less distinguished cavaliers about him dr wollaston was in black and with his noble serene dignity of countenance might have passed for a sporting archbishop mr mackenzie at this time in the seventysixth year of his age with a hat turned up with green green spectacles green jacket and long brown leathern gaiters buttoned upon his nether anatomy wore a dogwhistle round his neck tom purdie one of scotts servants and his subalterns had preceded us by a few hours with all the greyhounds that could be collected at abbotsford darnick and melrose but the giant maida had remained as his masters orderly and now gamboled about sibyl grey barking for mere joy like a spaniel puppy the order of march had all been settled when scotts daughter anne broke from the line screaming with laughter and exclaimed papa papa i knew you could never think of going without your pet scott looked round and i rather think there was a blush as well as a smile upon his face when he perceived a little black pig frisking about his pony evidently a selfelected addition to the party of the day he tried to look stern and cracked his whip at the creature but was in a moment obliged to join in the general cheers poor piggy soon found a strap round its neck and was dragged into the background scott watching the retreat repeated with mock pathos the first verse of an old pastoral song what will i do gin my hoggie die my joy my pride my hoggie my only beast i had na mae and wow but i was vogie the cheers were redoubled and the squadron moved on let us supplement this with one more picture from the same hand showing scott in a little more intimate light the passage was written in after lockhart had married scotts eldest daughter and gone to spend the summer at chiefswood a cottage on the abbotsford estate we were near enough abbotsford to partake as often as we liked of its brilliant and constantly varying society yet could do so without being exposed to the worry and exhaustion of spirit which the daily reception of newcomers entailed upon all the family except scott himself but in truth even he was not always proof against the annoyances connected with such a style of open housekeeping when sore beset at home in this way he would every now and then discover that he had some very particular business to attend to on an outlying part of his estate and craving the indulgence of his guests overnight appear at the cabin in the glen before its inhabitants were astir in the morning the clatter of sibyl greys hoofs the yelping of mustard and spice and his own joyous shout of rveille under our windows were the signal that he had burst his toils and meant for that day to take his ease in his inn on descending he was found to be seated with all his dogs and ours about him under a spreading ash that overshadowed half the bank between the cottage and the brook pointing the edge of his woodmans axe and listening to tom purdies lecture touching the plantation that most needed thinning after breakfast he would take possession of a dressingroom upstairs and write a chapter of the pirate and then having made up and despatched his packet for mr ballantyne away to join purdie wherever the foresters were at work until it was time to rejoin his own party at abbotsford or the quiet circle of the cottage when his guests were few and friendly he often made them come over and meet him at chiefswood in a body towards evening he was ready with all sorts of devices to supply the wants of a narrow establishment he used to delight particularly in sinking the wine in a well under the brae ere he went out and hauling up the basket just before dinner was announced this primitive device being he said what he had always practised when a young housekeeper and in his opinion far superior in its results to any application of ice and in the same spirit whenever the weather was sufficiently genial he voted for dining out of doors altogether few events of importance except the successive appearances of our buiks as tom purdie called his masters novels and an occasional visit to london or the continent intervened to break the busy monotony of this abbotsford life on one of these visits to london scott was invited to dine with the prince regent and when the prince became king george iv in almost the first act of his reign was to create scott a baronet scott accepted the honor gratefully as coming he said from the original source of all honor there can well be two opinions as to whether this least admirable of english kings constituted a very prime fountain of honor judged by democratic standards but to scotts mind such an imputation would have been next to sacrilege the feudal bias of his mind strong to start with had been strengthened by his long sojourn among the visions of a feudal past the ideals of feudalism were living realities to him and he accepted knighthood from his kings hand in exactly the same spirit which determined his attitude of humility towards his chief the duke of buccleugh and which impelled him to exhaust his genius in the effort to build up a great family estate there were already signs that the enormous burden of work under which he seemed to move so lightly was telling on him the bride of lammermoor the legend of montrose and ivanhoe had all of them been dictated between screams of pain wrung from his lips by a chronic cramp of the stomach by the time he reached redgauntlet and st ronans well there began to be heard faint murmurings of discontent from his public hints that he was writing too fast and that the noble wine he had poured them for so long was growing at last a trifle watery to add to these causes of uneasiness the commercial ventures in which he was interested drifted again into a precarious state he had himself fallen into the bad habit of forestalling the gains from his novels by heavy drafts on his publishers and the example thus set was followed faithfully by john ballantyne scotts good humor and his partners bad judgment saddled the concern with a lot of unsalable books in the affairs of the bookselling business had to be closed up constable taking over the unsalable stock and assuming the outstanding liabilities in return for copyright privileges covering some of scotts novels this so burdened the veteran publisher that when in a large london firm failed it carried him down also and with him james ballantyne with whom he had entered into close relations scotts secret connection with ballantyne had continued accordingly he woke up one fine day to find himself worse than beggared being personally liable for one hundred and thirty thousand pounds iv the years intervening between this calamity and scotts death form one of the saddest and at the same time most heroic chapters in the history of literature the fragile health of lady scott succumbed almost immediately to the crushing blow and she died in a few months scott surrendered abbotsford to his creditors and took up humble lodgings in edinburgh here with a pride and stoical courage as quiet as it was splendid he settled down to fill with the earnings of his pen the vast gulf of debt for which he was morally scarcely responsible at all in three years he wrote woodstock three chronicles of the canongate the fair maid of perth anne of geierstein the first series of the tales of a grandfather and a life of napoleon equal to thirteen volumes of novel size besides editing and annotating a complete edition of his own works all these together netted his creditors touched by the efforts he was making to settle their claims they now presented him with abbotsford and thither he returned to spend the few years remaining to him in he suffered a first stroke of paralysis refusing to give up however he made one more desperate rally to recapture his old power of storytelling count robert of paris and castle dangerous were the pathetic result they are not to be taken into account in any estimate of his powers for they are manifestly the work of a paralytic patient the gloomy picture is darkened by an incident which illustrates strikingly one phase of scotts character the great reform bill was being discussed throughout scotland menacing what were really abuses but what scott with his intense conservatism believed to be sacred and inviolable institutions the dying man roused himself to make a stand against the abominable bill in a speech which he made at jedburgh he was hissed and hooted by the crowd and he left the town with the dastardly cry of burk sir walter ringing in his ears nature now intervened to ease the intolerable strain scotts anxiety concerning his debt gradually gave way to an hallucination that it had all been paid his friends took advantage of the quietude which followed to induce him to make the journey to italy in the fear that the severe winter of scotland would prove fatal a ship of his majestys fleet was put at his disposal and he set sail for malta the youthful adventurousness of the man flared up again oddly for a moment when he insisted on being set ashore upon a volcanic island in the mediterranean which had appeared but a few days before and which sank beneath the surface shortly after the climate of malta at first appeared to benefit him but when he heard one day of the death of goethe at weimar he seemed seized with a sudden apprehension of his own end and insisted upon hurrying back through europe in order that he might look once more on abbotsford on the ride from edinburgh he remained for the first two stages entirely unconscious but as the carriage entered the valley of the gala he opened his eyes and murmured the name of objects as they passed gala water surely buckholm torwoodlee when the towers of abbotsford came in view he was so filled with delight that he could scarcely be restrained from leaping out at the gates he greeted faithful laidlaw in a voice strong and hearty as of old why man how often i have thought of you and smiled and wept over the dogs who came rushing as in bygone times to lick his hand he died a few days later on the afternoon of a glorious autumn day with all the windows open so that he might catch to the last the whisper of the tweed over its pebbles and so says carlyle the curtain falls and the strong walter scott is with us no more a possession from him does remain widely scattered yet attainable not inconsiderable it can be said of him when he departed he took a mans life along with him no sounder piece of british manhood was put together in that eighteenth century of time alas his fine scotch face with its shaggy honesty sagacity and goodness when we saw it latterly on the edinburgh streets was all worn with care the joy all fled from it plowed deep with labor and sorrow we shall never forget it we shall never see it again adieu sir walter pride of all scotchmen take our proud and sad farewell ii scotts place in the romantic movement in order rightly to appreciate the poetry of scott it is necessary to understand something of that remarkable romantic movement which took place toward the end of the eighteenth century and within a space of twentyfive years completely changed the face of english literature both the causes and the effects of this movement were much more than merely literary the romantic revival penetrated every crevice and ramification of life in those parts of europe which it affected its social political and religious results were all deeply significant but we must here confine ourselves to such aspects of the revival as showed themselves in english poetry eighteenth century poetry had been distinguished by its polish its formal correctness or to use a term in much favor with critics of that day its elegance the various and wayward metrical effects of the elizabethan and jacobean poets had been discarded for a few wellrecognized verse forms which themselves in turn had become still further limited by the application to them of precise rules of structure hand in hand with this restricting process in meter had gone a similar tendency in diction the simple concrete phrases of daily speech had given way to stately periphrases the rich and riotous vocabulary of earlier poetry had been replaced by one more decorous measured and highsounding a corresponding process of selection and exclusion was applied to the subject matter of poetry passion lyric exaltation delight in the concrete life of man and nature passed out of fashion in their stead came social satire criticism generalized observation while the classical influence as it is usually called was at its height with such men as dryden and pope to exemplify it it did a great work but toward the end of the eighth decade of the eighteenth century it had visibly run to seed the feeble hayley the silly della crusca the arid erasmus darwin were its only exemplars england was ripe for a literary revolution a return to nature and to passion and such a revolution was not slow in coming it announced itself first in george crabbe who turned to paint the life of the poor with patient realism in burns who poured out in his songs the passion of love the passion of sorrow the passion of conviviality in blake who tried to reach across the horizon of visible fact to mystical heavens of more enduring reality following close upon these men came the four poets destined to accomplish the revolution which the early comers had begun they were born within four years of each other wordsworth in scott in coleridge in southey in as we look at these four men now and estimate their worth as poets we see that southey drops almost out of the account and that wordsworth and coleridge stand so far as the highest qualities of poetry go far above scott as indeed blake and burns do also but the contemporary judgment upon them was directly the reverse and scotts poetry exercised an influence over his age immeasurably greater than that of any of the other three let us attempt to discover what qualities this poetry possessed which gave it its astonishing hold upon the age when it was written in so doing we may discover indirectly some of the reasons why it still retains a large portion of its popularity and perhaps arrive at some grounds of judgment by which we may test its right thereto one reason why scotts poetry was immediately welcomed while that of wordsworth and of coleridge lay neglected is to be found in the fact that in the matter of diction scott was much less revolutionary than they by nature and education he was conservative he put the lay of the last minstrel into the mouth of a rude harper of the north in order to shield himself from the charge of attempting to set up a new school in poetry and he never throughout his life violated the conventions literary or social if he could possibly avoid doing so this bias toward conservatism and conventionality shows itself particularly in the language of his poems he was compelled of course to use much more concrete and vivid terms than the eighteenth century poets had used because he was dealing with much more concrete and vivid matter but his language nevertheless has a prevailing stateliness and at times an artificiality which recommended it to readers tired of the inanities of hayley and mason but unwilling to accept the startling simplicity and concreteness of diction exemplified by the lake poets at their best another peculiarity of scotts poetry which made powerfully for its popularity was its spirited meter people were weary of the heroic couplet and turned eagerly to these hurried verses that went on their way with the sharp tramp of mosstroopers and heated the blood like a drum the meters of coleridge subtle delicate and poignant had been passed by with indifference had not been heard perhaps for lack of ears trained to hear but scotts metrical effects were such as a child could appreciate and a soldier could carry in his head analogous to this treatment of meter though belonging to a less formal side of his art was scotts treatment of nature the landscape setting of his stories perhaps the most obvious feature of the romantic revival was a reawakening of interest in outdoor nature it was as if for a hundred years past people had been stricken blind as soon as they passed from the city streets into the country a trim garden an artfully placed country house a wellkept preserve they might see but for the great shaggy world of mountain and sea it had been shut out of mans elegant vision before scott began to write there had been no lack of prophets of the new natureworship but none of them of a sort to catch the general ear wordsworths pantheism was too mystical too delicate and intuitive to recommend itself to any but chosen spirits crabbes descriptions were too minute coleridges too intense to please scott was the first to paint nature with a broad free touch without raptures or philosophizing but with a healthy pleasure in its obvious beauties such as appeal to average men his scenery seldom exists for its own sake but serves as it should for background and setting of his story as his readers followed the fortunes of william of deloraine or roderick dhu they traversed by sunlight and by moonlight landscapes of wild romantic charm and felt their beauty quite naturally as a part of the excitement of that wild life they felt it the more readily because of a touch of artificial stateliness in the handling a slight theatrical heightening of effect from an absolute point of view a defect but highly congenial to the taste of the time it was the scenic side of nature which scott gave and gave inimitably while burns was piercing to the inner heart of her tenderness in his lines to a mountain daisy and to a mouse while wordsworth was mystically communing with her soul in his tintern abbey it was the scenic side of nature for which the perceptions of men were ripe so they left profounder poets to their musings and followed after the poet who could give them a brilliant story set in a brilliant scene again the emotional key to scotts poetry was on a comprehensible plane the situations with which he deals the passions ambitions satisfactions which he portrays belong in one form or another to all men or at least are easily grasped by the imaginations of all men it has often been said that scott is the most homeric of english poets so far as the claim rests on considerations of style it is hardly to be granted for nothing could be farther than the hurrying torrent of scotts verse from the long and refluent music of homer but in this other respect that he deals in the rudimentary stuff of human character in a straightforward way without a hint of modern complexities and supersubtleties he is really akin to the master poet of antiquity this added to the crude wild life which he pictures the vigorous sweep of his action the sincere glow of romance which bathes his story all so tonic in their effect upon minds long used to the stuffy decorum of didactic poetry completed the triumph of the lay of the last minstrel marmion and the lady of the lake over their age as has been already suggested scott cannot be put in the first rank of poets no compromise can be made on this point because upon it the whole theory of poetry depends neither on the formal nor on the essential sides of his art is he among the small company of the supreme and no one understood this better than himself he touched the keynote of his own power though with too great modesty when he said i am sensible that if there is anything good about my poetry it is a hurried frankness of composition which pleases soldiers sailors and young people of bold and active dispositions the poet campbell who was so fascinated by scotts ballad of cadyow castle that he used to repeat it aloud on the north bridge of edinburgh until the whole fraternity of coachmen knew him by tongue as he passed characterizes the predominant charm of scotts poetry as lying in a strong pithy eloquence which is perhaps only another name for hurried frankness of composition if this is not the highest quality to which poetry can attain it is a very admirable one and it will be a sad day for the englishspeaking race when there shall not be found persons of every age and walk of life to take the same delights in these stirring poems as their author loved to think was taken by soldiers sailors and young people of bold and active dispositions iii the lady of the lake historical setting the lady of the lake deals with a distinct epoch in the life of king james v of scotland and has lying back of it a considerable amount of historical fact an understanding of which will help in the appreciation of the poem during his minority the king was under the tutelage of archibald douglas sixth earl of angus who had married the kings mother the young monarch chafed for a long time under this authority but the douglases were so powerful that he was unable to shake it off in spite of several desperate attempts on the part of his sympathizers to rescue him in the king then sixteen years of age escaped from his own castle of falkland to stirling castle the governor of stirling an enemy of the douglas family received him joyfully there soon gathered about his standard a sufficient number of powerful peers to enable him to depose the earl of angus from the regency and to banish him and all his family to england the douglas who figures in the poem is an imaginary uncle of the banished regent and himself under the ban compelled to hide away in the shelter provided for him by roderick dhu on the lonely island in loch katrine he is represented as having been loved and trusted by king james during the boyhood of the latter before the enmity sprang up between the house of angus and the throne this enmity to quote from the history of the house of douglas published at edinburgh in was so inveterate that numerous as their allies were their nearest friends even in the most remote parts of scotland durst not entertain them unless under the strictest and closest disguise the outlawed border chieftain roderick dhu who gives shelter to the persecuted douglas is a fictitious character but one entirely typical of the time and place the expedition undertaken by the young king against the border clans under the guise of a hunting party is in part at least historic pitscotties history says in james v made a convention at edinburgh for the purpose of considering the best mode of quelling the border robbers who during the license of his minority and the troubles which followed had committed many exorbitances accordingly he assembled a flying army of ten thousand men consisting of his principal nobility and their followers who were directed to bring their hawks and dogs with them that the monarch might refresh himself with sport during the intervals of military execution with this array he swept through ettrick forest where he hanged over the gate of his own castle piers cockburn of henderland who had prepared according to tradition a feast for his reception general criticism and analysis the lady of the lake appeared in two years before marmion had vastly increased the popular enthusiasm aroused by the lay of the last minstrel and the success of his second long poem had so exhilarated scott that as he says he felt equal to anything and everything to one of his kinswomen who urged him not to jeopardize his fame by another effort in the same kind he gaily quoted the words of montrose he either fears his fate too much or his deserts are small who dares not put it to the touch to win or lose it all the result justified his confidence for not only was the lady of the lake as successful as its predecessors but it remains the most sterling of scotts poems the somewhat cheap supernaturalism of the lay appears in it only for a moment both the story and the characters are of a less theatrical type than in marmion and it has a glow animation and onset which was denied to the later poems rokeby and the lord of the isles the following outline abridged from the excellent one given by francis jeffrey in the edinburgh review for august will be useful as a basis for criticism of the matter and style of the poem the first canto begins with a description of a staghunt in the highlands of perthshire as the chase lengthens the sportsmen drop off till at last the foremost horseman is left alone and his horse overcome with fatigue stumbles and dies the adventurer climbing up a craggy eminence discovers loch katrine spread out in evening glory before him the huntsman winds his horn and sees to his infinite surprise a little skiff guided by a lovely woman glide from beneath the trees that overhang the water and approach the shore at his feet upon the strangers approach she pushes the shallop from the shore in alarm after a short parley however she carries him to a woody island where she leads him into a sort of silvan mansion rudely constructed and hung round with trophies of war and the chase an elderly lady is introduced at supper and the stranger after disclosing himself to be james fitzjames the knight of snowdoun tries in vain to discover the name and history of the ladies the second canto opens with a picture of the aged harper allanbane sitting on the island beach with the damsel watching the skiff which carries the stranger back to land a conversation ensues from which the reader gathers that the lady is a daughter of the douglas who being exiled by royal displeasure from court had accepted this asylum from sir roderick dhu a highland chieftain long outlawed for deeds of blood that this dark chief is in love with his fair protge but that her affections are engaged to malcolm graeme a younger and more amiable mountaineer the sound of distant music is heard on the lake and the barges of sir roderick are discovered proceeding in triumph to the island ellen hearing her fathers horn at that instant on the opposite shore flies to meet him and malcolm graeme who is received with cold and stately civility by the lord of the isle sir roderick informs the douglas that his retreat has been discovered and that the king james v under pretence of hunting has assembled a large force in the neighborhood he then proposes impetuously that they should unite their fortunes by his marriage with ellen and rouse the whole western highlands the douglas intimating that his daughter has repugnances which she cannot overcome declares that he will retire to a cave in the neighboring mountains until the issue of the kings threat is seen the heart of roderick is wrung with agony at this rejection and when malcolm advances to ellen he pushes him violently back and a scuffle ensues which is with difficulty appeased by the giant arm of douglas malcolm then withdraws in proud resentment plunges into the water and swims over by moonlight to the mainland the third canto opens with an account of the ceremonies employed in summoning the clan this is accomplished by the consecration of a small wooden cross which with its points scorched and dipped in blood is carried with incredible celerity through the whole territory of the chieftain the eager fidelity with which this fatal signal is carried on is represented with great spirit a youth starts from the side of his fathers coffin to bear it forward and having run his stage delivers it to a young bridegroom returning from church who instantly binds his plaid around him and rushes onward in the meantime douglas and his daughter have taken refuge in the mountain cave and sir roderick passing near their retreat on his way to the muster hears ellens voice singing her evening hymn to the virgin he does not obtrude on her devotions but hurries to the place of rendezvous the fourth canto begins with some ceremonies by a wild hermit of the clan to ascertain the issue of the impending war and this oracle is obtained that the party shall prevail which first sheds the blood of its adversary the scene then shifts to the retreat of the douglas where the minstrel is trying to soothe ellen in her alarm at the disappearance of her father by singing a fairy ballad to her as the song ends the knight of snowdoun suddenly appears before her declares his love and urges her to put herself under his protection ellen throws herself on his generosity confesses her attachment to graeme and prevails on him to seek his own safety by a speedy retreat from the territory of roderick dhu before he goes the stranger presents her with a ring which he says he has received from king james with a promise to grant any boon asked by the person producing it as he retreats his suspicions are excited by the conduct of his guide and confirmed by the warnings of a mad woman whom they encounter his false guide discharges an arrow at him which kills the maniac the knight slays the murderer and learning from the expiring victim that her brain had been turned by the cruelty of sir roderick dhu he vows vengeance when chilled with the midnight cold and exhausted with fatigue he suddenly comes upon a chief reposing by a lonely watchfire and being challenged in the name of roderick dhu boldly avows himself his enemy the clansman however disdains to take advantage of a wornout wanderer and pledges him safe escort out of sir rodericks territory when he must answer his defiance with his sword the stranger accepts these chivalrous terms and the warriors sup and sleep together this ends the fourth canto at dawn the knight and the mountaineer proceed toward the lowland frontier a dispute arises concerning the character of roderick dhu and the knight expresses his desire to meet in person and do vengeance upon the predatory chief have then thy wish answers his guide and gives a loud whistle a whole legion of armed men start up from their mountain ambush in the heath while the chief turns proudly and says i am roderick dhu sir roderick then by a signal dismisses his men to their concealment arrived at his frontier the chief forces the knight to stand upon his defense roderick after a hard combat is laid wounded on the ground fitzjames sounding his bugle brings four squires to his side and after giving the wounded chief into their charge gallops rapidly on towards stirling as he ascends the hill to the castle he descries approaching the same place the giant form of douglas who has come to deliver himself up to the king in order to save malcolm graeme and sir roderick from the impending danger before entering the castle douglas is seized with the whim to engage in the holiday sports which are going forward outside he wins prize after prize and receives his reward from the hand of the prince who however does not condescend to recognize his former favorite roused at last by an insult from one of the royal grooms douglas proclaims himself and is ordered into custody by the king at this instant a messenger arrives with tidings of an approaching battle between the clan of roderick and the kings lieutenant the earl of mar and is ordered back to prevent the conflict by announcing that both sir roderick and lord douglas are in the hands of their sovereign the last canto opens in the guard room of the royal castle at stirling at dawn while the mercenaries are quarreling and singing at the close of a night of debauch the sentinels introduce ellen and the minstrel allanbane who are come in search of douglas ellen awes the ruffian soldiery by her grace and liberality and is at length conducted to a more seemly waiting place until she may obtain audience with the king while allanbane in the cell of sir roderick sings to the dying chieftain of the glorious battle which has just been waged by his clansmen against the forces of the earl of mar ellen in another part of the palace hears the voice of malcolm graeme lamenting his captivity from an adjoining turret before she recovers from her agitation she is startled by the appearance of fitzjames who comes to inform her that the court is assembled and the king at leisure to receive her suit he conducts her to the hall of presence round which ellen casts a timid and eager glance for the monarch but all the glittering figures are uncovered and james fitzjames alone wears his cap and plume the knight of snowdoun is the king of scotland struck with awe and terror ellen falls speechless at his feet pointing to the ring which he has put upon her finger the prince raises her with eager kindness declares that her father is forgiven and bids her ask for a boon for some other person the name of graeme trembles on her lips but she cannot trust herself to utter it the king in playful vengeance condemns malcolm graeme to fetters takes a chain of gold from his own neck and throwing it over that of the young chief puts the clasp in the hand of ellen from this outline it will be evident that scott had gained greatly in narrative power since the production of the lay of the last minstrel not only are the elements of the fable to use the word in its oldfashioned sense harmonious and probable but the various incidents grow out of each other in a natural and necessary way the lay was at best a skillful bit of carpentering whereof the several parts were nicely juxtaposed the lady of the lake is an organism and its several members partake of a common life a few weaknesses may it is true be pointed out in it the warning of fitzjames by the mad womans song makes too large a draft upon our romantic credulity her appearance is at once so accidental and so opportune that it resembles those supernatural interventions employed by ancient tragedy to cut the knot of a difficult situation which have given rise to the phrase deus ex machina the improbability of the episode is further increased by the fact that she puts her warning in the form of a song scotts love of romantic episode manifestly led him astray here further the story as a whole shares with all stories which turn upon the revelation of a concealed identity the disadvantage of being able to affect the reader powerfully but once since on a second reading the element of suspense and surprise is lacking in so far as the lady of the lake is a mere story or as it has been called a versified novelette this is not a weakness but in so far as it is a poem with the claim which poetry legitimately makes to be read and reread for its intrinsic beauty it constitutes a real defect not only does this poem with the slight exceptions just mentioned show a gain over the earlier poems in narrative power but it also marks an advance in character delineation the characters of the lay are with one or two exceptions mere layfigures lord cranstoun and margaret are the most conventional of lovers william of deloraine is little more than an animated suit of armor and the lady of branksome except at one point when from her walls she defies the english invaders is nearly or quite featureless with the characters of the lady of the lake the case is very different the three rivals for ellens hand are real men with individualities which enhance and deepen the picturesqueness of each other by contrast the easy grace and courtly chivalry of the disguised king the quick kindling of his fancy at sight of the mysterious maid of loch katrine his quick generosity in relinquishing his suit when he finds that she loves another make him one of the most lifelike figures of romance roderick dhu nursing darkly his clannish hatreds his hopeless love and his bitter jealousy with a delicate chivalry sending its bright thread through the tissue of his savage nature is drawn with an equally convincing hand against his gloomy figure the boyish magnanimity of malcolm graeme ellens brave faithfulness made human by a surface play of coquetry and the quiet nobility of the exiled douglas stand out in varied relief judged in connection with the more conventional character types of marmion and with the draped automatons of the lay the characters of the lady of the lake show the gradual growth in scott of that dramatic imagination which was later to fill the vast scene of his prose romances with unforgettable figures but the most significant advance which this poem shows over earlier work is in the greater genuineness of the poetic effect in the description for example of the approach of roderick dhus boats to the island there is a singular depth of race feeling there is borne in upon us as we read the realization of a wild and peculiar civilization we get a breath of poetry keen and strange like the shrilling of the bagpipes across the water again in the speeding of the fiery cross there is a primitive depth of poetry which carries with it a sense of old unhappy faroff things it appeals to latent memories in us which have been handed down from an ancestral past there is nothing in either the lay of the last minstrel or marmion to compare for natural dramatic force with the situation in the lady of the lake when roderick dhu whistles for his clansmen to appear and the astonished fitzjames sees the lonely mountain side suddenly bristle with tartans and spears and the fight which follows at the ford is a real fight in a sense not at all to be applied to the tournaments and other conventional encounters of the earlier poems even where scott still clung to supernatural devices to help along his story he handles them with much greater subtlety than he had done in his earlier efforts the dropping of douglass sword from its scabbard when his disguised enemy enters the room arouses the imagination without burdening it it has the same imaginative advantage over such an episode as that in the lay where the ghost of the wizard comes to bear off the goblin page as suggestion always has over explicit statement this gain in subtlety of treatment will be made still more apparent by comparing with any supernatural episode of the lay the account in the lady of the lake of the unearthly parentage of brian the hermit the gain in style is less perceptible scott was never a great stylist he struck out at the very first a nervous hurrying meter and a strong though rather commonplace diction upon which he never substantially improved abundant action rapid transitions stirring descriptions common sentiments and ordinary language heightened by a dash of pomp and novelty above all a pervading animation spirit intrepidity these are the constant elements of scotts success present here in their accustomed measure in the broader sense of style however where the word is understood to include all the processes leading to a given poetical effect the lady of the lake has some advantage even over marmion it contains nothing to be sure so fine or so typical of scotts peculiar power as the account of the battle of flodden in marmion the minstrels recital of the battle of beal an duine does not abide the comparison the quieter parts of the lady of the lake moreover are sometimes disfigured by a sentimentality and prettiness happily unfrequent with scott but the description of the approach of roderick dhus warboats already mentioned the superb landscape delineation in the fifth canto and the beautiful twilight ending of canto third can well stand as prime types of scotts stylistic power the lady of the lake canto first the chase harp of the north that moldering long hast hung on the witchelm that shades saint fillans spring and down the fitful breeze thy numbers flung till envious ivy did around thee cling muffling with verdant ringlet every string o minstrel harp still must thine accents sleep mid rustling leaves and fountains murmuring still must thy sweeter sounds their silence keep nor bid a warrior smile nor teach a maid to weep not thus in ancient days of caledon was thy voice mute amid the festal crowd when lay of hopeless love or glory won aroused the fearful or subdued the proud at each according pause was heard aloud thine ardent symphony sublime and high fair dames and crested chiefs attention bowed for still the burden of thy minstrelsy was knighthoods dauntless deed and beautys matchless eye o wake once more how rude soeer the hand that ventures oer thy magic maze to stray o wake once more though scarce my skill command some feeble echoing of thine earlier lay though harsh and faint and soon to die

drunk his fill where danced the moon on monans rill and deep his midnight lair had made in lone glenartneys hazel shade but when the sun his beacon red had kindled on benvoirlichs head the deepmouthed bloodhounds heavy bay resounded up the rocky way and faint from farther distance borne were heard the clanging hoof and horn ii as chief who hears his warder call to arms the foemen storm the wall the antlered monarch of the waste sprung from his heathery couch in haste but ere his fleet career he took the dewdrops from his flanks he shook like crested leader proud and high tossed his beamed

bound the copse he cleared and stretching forward free and far sought the wild heaths of uamvar iii yelled on the view the opening pack rock glen and cavern paid them back to many a mingled sound at once the awakened mountain gave response a hundred dogs bayed deep and strong clattered a hundred steeds along their peal the merry horns rung out a hundred voices joined the shout with hark and whoop and wild halloo no rest benvoirlichs echoes knew far from the tumult fled the roe close in her covert cowered the doe the falcon from her cairn on high cast on the rout a wondering eye till far beyond her piercing ken the hurricane had swept the glen faint and more faint its failing din returned from cavern cliff and linn and silence settled wide and still on the lone wood and mighty hill iv less loud the sounds of silvan war disturbed the heights of uamvar and roused the cavern where tis told a giant made his den of old for ere that steep ascent was won high in his pathway hung the sun and many a gallant stayed perforce was fain to breathe his faltering horse and of the trackers of the deer scarce half the lessening pack was near so shrewdly on the mountain side had the bold burst their mettle tried v the noble stag was pausing now upon the mountains southern brow where broad extended far beneath the varied realms of fair menteith with anxious eye he wandered oer mountain and meadow moss and moor and pondered refuge from his toil by far lochard or aberfoyle but nearer was the copsewood grey that waved and wept on lochachray and mingled with the pinetrees blue on the bold cliffs

but with unbated zeal that horseman plied the scourge and steel for jaded now and spent with toil embossed with foam and dark with soil while every gasp with sobs he drew the laboring stag strained

shunned the shock and turned him from the opposing rock then dashing down a darksome glen soon lost to hound and hunters ken in the deep trossachs wildest nook his solitary refuge took there while close couched the thicket shed cold dews and wildflowers on his head he heard the baffled dogs in vain rave through the hollow pass amain chiding the rocks that yelled again ix close on the hounds the hunter came to cheer them on the vanished game but stumbling in the rugged dell the gallant horse exhausted fell the impatient rider strove in vain to rouse him with the spur and rein for the good

vain pursuit to call the hounds back limped with slow and crippled pace the sulky leaders of the chase close to their masters side they pressed with drooping tail and humbled crest but still the dingles hollow throat prolonged the swelling buglenote the owlets started from their dream the eagles answered with their scream round and around the sounds were cast till echo seemed an answering blast and on the hunter hied his way to join some comrades of the day yet often paused so strange the road so wondrous were the scenes it showed xi the western waves of ebbing day rolled oer the glen their level way each purple peak each flinty spire was bathed in floods of living fire but not a setting beam could glow within the dark ravines below where twined the path in shadow hid round many a rocky pyramid shooting abruptly from the dell its thundersplintered pinnacle round many an insulated mass the native bulwarks of the pass huge as the tower which builders vain presumptuous piled on shinars plain the rocky summits split and rent formed turret dome or battlement or seemed fantastically set with cupola or minaret wild crests as pagod ever decked or mosque of eastern architect nor

waved and danced the wanderers eye could barely view the summer heavens delicious blue so wondrous wild the whole might seem the scenery of a fairy dream xiii onward amid the copse gan peep a narrow inlet still and deep affording scarce such breadth of brim as served the wild ducks brood to swim lost for a space through thickets veering but broader when again appearing tall rocks and tufted knolls their face could on the darkblue mirror trace and farther as the hunter strayed still broader sweep its channels made the shaggy mounds no longer stood emerging from entangled wood but waveencircled seemed to float like castle girdled with its moat yet broader floods extending still divide them from their parent hill till each retiring claims to be an islet in an inland sea xiv and now to issue from the glen no pathway meets the wanderers ken unless he climb with footing nice a far projecting precipice the brooms tough roots his ladder made the hazel saplings lent their aid and thus an airy point he won where gleaming with the setting sun one burnished sheet of living gold loch katrine lay beneath him rolled in all her length far winding lay with promontory creek and bay and island that empurpled bright floated amid the livelier light and mountains that like giants stand to sentinel enchanted land high on the south huge benvenue down on the lake in masses threw crags knolls and mounds confusedly hurled the fragments of an earlier world a wildering forest feathered oer his ruined sides and summit hoar while on the north through middle air benan heaved high his forehead bare xv from the steep promontory gazed the stranger raptured and amazed and what a scene were here he cried for princely pomp or churchmans pride on this bold brow a lordly tower in that soft vale a ladys bower on yonder meadow far away the turrets of a cloister gray how blithely might the buglehorn chide on the lake the lingering morn how sweet at eve the lovers lute chime when the groves were still and mute and when the midnight moon should lave her forehead in the silver wave how solemn on the ear would come the holy matins distant hum while the deep peals commanding tone should wake in yonder islet lone a sainted hermit from his cell to drop a bead with every knell and bugle lute and bell and all should each bewildered stranger call to friendly feast and lighted hall xvi blithe were it then to wander here but now beshrew yon nimble deer like that same hermits thin and spare the copse must give my evening fare some mossy bank my couch must be some rustling oak my canopy yet pass we that the war and chase give little choice of restingplace a summer night in greenwood spent were but tomorrows merriment but hosts may in these wilds abound such as are better missed than found to meet with highland plunderers here were worse than loss of steed or deer i am alone my buglestrain may call some straggler of the train or fall the worst that may betide ere now this falchion has been tried xvii but scarce again his horn he wound when lo forth starting at the sound from underneath an aged oak that slanted from the islet rock a damsel guider of its way a little skiff shot to the bay that round the promontory steep led its deep line in graceful sweep eddying in almost viewless wave the weeping willowtwig to lave and kiss with whispering sound and slow the beach of pebbles bright as snow the boat had touched the silver strand just as the hunter left his stand and stood concealed amid the brake to view this lady of the lake the maiden paused as if again she thought to catch the distant strain with head upraised and look intent and eye and ear attentive bent and locks flung back and lips apart like monument of grecian art in listening mood she seemed to stand the guardian naiad of the strand xviii and neer did grecian chisel trace a nymph a naiad or a grace of finer form or lovelier face what though the sun with ardent frown had slightly tinged her cheek with brown the sportive toil which short and light had dyed her glowing hue so bright served too in hastier swell to show short glimpses of a breast of snow what though no rule of courtly grace to measured mood had trained her pace a foot more light a step more true neer from the heathflower dashed the dew een the slight harebell raised its head elastic from her airy tread what though upon her speech there hung the accents of the mountain tongue those silver sounds so soft so dear the listener held his breath to hear xix a chieftains daughter seemed the maid her satin snood her silken plaid her golden brooch such birth betrayed and seldom was a snood amid such wild luxuriant ringlets hid whose glossy black to shame might bring the plumage of the ravens wing and seldom oer a breast so fair mantled a plaid with modest care and never brooch the folds combined above a heart more good and kind her kindness and her worth to spy you need but gaze on ellens eye not katrine in her mirror blue gives back the shaggy banks more true than every freeborn glance confessed the guileless movements of her breast whether joy danced in her dark eye or woe or pity claimed a sigh or filial love was glowing there or meek devotion poured a prayer or tale of injury called forth the indignant spirit of the north one only passion unrevealed with maiden pride the maid concealed yet not less purely felt the flame oh need i tell that passions name xx impatient of the silent horn now on the gale her voice was borne father she cried the rocks around loved to prolong the gentle sound a while she paused no answer came malcolm was thine the blast the name less resolutely uttered fell the echoes could not catch the swell a stranger i the huntsman said advancing from the hazel shade the maid alarmed with hasty oar pushed her light shallop from the shore and when a space was gained between closer she drew her bosoms screen so forth the startled swan would swing so turn to prune his ruffled wing then safe though fluttered and amazed she paused and on the stranger gazed not his the form nor his the eye that youthful maidens wont to fly xxi on his bold visage middle age had slightly pressed its signet sage yet had not quenched the open truth and fiery vehemence of youth forward and frolic glee was there the will to do the soul to dare the sparkling glance soon blown to fire of hasty love or headlong ire his limbs were cast in manly mold for hardy sports or contest bold and though in peaceful garb arrayed and weaponless except his blade his stately mien as well implied a highborn heart a martial pride as if a barons crest he wore and sheathed in armor trod the shore slighting the petty need he showed he told of his benighted road his ready speech flowed fair and free in phrase of gentlest courtesy yet seemed that tone and gesture bland less used to sue than to command xxii a while the maid the stranger eyed and reassured at length replied that highland halls were open still to wildered wanderers of the hill nor think you unexpected come to yon lone isle our desert home before the heath had lost the dew this morn a couch was pulled for you on yonder mountains purple head have ptarmigan and heathcock bled and our broad nets have swept the mere to furnish forth your evening cheer now by the rood my lovely maid your courtesy has erred he said no right have i to claim misplaced the welcome of expected guest a wanderer here by fortune tost my way my friends my courser lost i neer before believe me fair have ever drawn your mountain air till on this lakes romantic strand i found a fay in fairy land xxiii i well believe the maid replied as her light skiff approached the side i well believe that neer before your foot has trod loch katrines shore but yet as far as yesternight old allanbane foretold your plight a grayhaired sire whose eye intent was on the visioned future bent he saw your steed a dappled gray lie dead beneath the birchen way painted exact your form and mien your hunting suit of lincoln green that tasselled horn so gaily gilt that falchions crooked blade and hilt that cap with heron plumage trim and yon two hounds so dark and grim he bade that all should ready be to grace a guest of fair degree but light i held his prophecy and deemed it was my fathers horn whose echoes oer the lake were borne xxiv the stranger smiled since to your home a destined errantknight i come announced by prophet sooth and old doomed doubtless for achievement bold ill lightly front each high emprise for one kind glance of those bright eyes permit me first the task to guide your fairy frigate oer the tide the maid with smile suppressed and sly the toil unwonted saw him try for seldom sure if eer before his noble hand had grasped an oar yet with main strength his strokes he drew and oer the lake the shallop flew with heads erect and whimpering cry the hounds behind their passage ply nor frequent does the bright oar break the darkning mirror of the lake until the rocky isle they reach and moor their shallop on the beach xxv the stranger viewed the shore around twas all so close with copsewood bound nor track nor pathway might declare that human foot frequented there until the mountainmaiden showed a clambering unsuspected road that winded through the tangled screen and opened on a narrow green where weeping birch and willow round with their long fibres swept the ground here for retreat in dangerous hour some chief had framed a rustic bower xxvi it was a lodge of ample size but strange of structure and device of such materials as around the workmans hand had readiest found lopped of their boughs their hoar trunks bared and by the hatchet rudely squared to give the walls their destined height the sturdy oak and ash unite while moss and clay and leaves combined to fence each crevice from the wind the lighter pinetrees overhead their slender length for rafters spread and withered heath and rushes dry supplied a russet canopy due westward fronting to the green a rural portico was seen aloft on native pillars borne of mountain fir with bark unshorn where ellens hand had taught to twine the ivy and idaean vine the clematis the favored flower which boasts the name of virginbower and every hardy plant could bear loch katrines keen and searching air an instant in this porch she stayed and gaily to the stranger said on heaven and on thy lady call and enter the enchanted hall xxvii my hope my heaven my trust must be my gentle guide in following thee he crossed the threshold and a clang of angry steel that instant rang to his bold brow his spirit rushed but soon for vain alarm he blushed when on the floor he saw displayed cause of the din a naked blade dropped from the sheath that careless flung upon a stags huge antlers swung for all around the walls to grace hung trophies of the fight or chase a target there a bugle here a battleax a hunting spear and broadswords bows and arrows store with the tusked trophies of the boar here grins the wolf as when he died and there the wildcats brindled hide the frontlet of the elk adorns or mantles oer the bisons horns pennons and flags defaced and stained that blackening streaks of blood retained and deerskins dappled dun and white with otters fur and seals unite in rude and uncouth tapestry all to garnish forth the silvan hall xxviii the wondering stranger round him gazed and next the fallen weapon raised few were the arms whose sinewy strength sufficed to stretch it forth at length and as the brand he poised and swayed i never knew but one he said whose stalwart arm might brook to wield a blade like this in battlefield she sighed then smiled and took the word you see the guardian champions sword as light it trembles in his hand as in my grasp a hazel wand my sires tall form might grace the part of ferragus or ascabart but in the absent giants hold are women now and menials old xxix the mistress of the mansion came mature of age a graceful dame whose easy step and stately port had well become a princely court to whom though more than kindred knew young ellen gave a mothers due meet welcome to her guest she made and every courteous rite was paid that hospitality could claim though all unasked his birth and name such then the reverence to a guest that fellest foe might join the feast and from his deadliest foemans door unquestioned turn the banquet oer at length his rank the stranger names the knight of snowdoun james fitzjames lord of a barren heritage which his brave sires from age to age by their good swords had held with toil his sire had fallen in such turmoil and he god wot was forced to stand oft for his right with blade in hand this morning with lord morays train he chased a stalwart stag in vain outstripped his comrades missed the deer lost his good steed and wandered here xxx fain would the knight in turn require the name and state of ellens sire well showed the elder ladys mien that courts and cities she had seen ellen though more her looks displayed the simple grace of silvan maid in speech and gesture form and face showed she was come of gentle race twere strange in ruder rank to find such looks such manners and such mind each hint the knight of snowdoun gave dame margaret heard with silence grave or ellen innocently gay turned all inquiry light away weird women we by dale and down we dwell afar from tower and town we stem the flood we ride the blast on wandering knights our spells we cast while viewless minstrels touch the string tis thus our charmd rimes we sing she sung and still a harp unseen filled up the symphony between xxxi song soldier rest thy warfare oer sleep the sleep that knows no breaking dream of battled fields no more days of danger nights of waking in our isles enchanted hall hands unseen thy couch are strewing fairy strains of music fall every sense in slumber dewing soldier rest thy warfare oer dream of fighting fields no more sleep the sleep that knows not breaking morn of toil nor night of waking no rude sound shall reach thine ear armors clang or warsteed champing trump nor pibroch summon here mustering clan or squadron tramping yet the larks shrill fife may come at the daybreak from the fallow and the bittern sound his drum booming from the sedgy shallow ruder sounds shall none be near guards nor warders challenge here heres no warsteeds neigh and champing shouting clans or squadrons stamping xxxii she paused then blushing led the lay to grace the stranger of the day her mellow notes awhile prolong the cadence of the flowing song till to her lips in measured frame the minstrel verse spontaneous came song continued huntsman rest thy chase is done while our slumbrous spells assail ye dream not with the rising sun bugles here shall sound reveill sleep the deer is in his den sleep thy hounds are by thee lying sleep nor dream in yonder glen how thy gallant steed lay dying huntsman rest thy chase is done think not of the rising sun for at dawning to assail ye here no bugles sound reveill xxxiii the hall was cleared the strangers bed was there of mountain heather spread where oft a hundred guests had lain and dreamed their forest sports again but vainly did the heathflower shed its moorland fragrance round his head not ellens spell had lulled to rest the fever of his troubled breast in broken dreams the image rose of varied perils pains and woes his steed now flounders in the brake now sinks his barge upon the lake now leader of a broken host his standard falls his honors lost then from my couch may heavenly might chase that worst phantom of the night again returned the scenes of youth of confident undoubting truth again his soul he interchanged with friends whose hearts were long estranged they come in dim procession led the cold the faithless and the dead as warm each hand each brow as gay as if they parted yesterday and doubt distracts him at the view o were his senses false or true dreamed he of death or broken vow or is it all a vision now xxxiv at length with ellen in a grove he seemed to walk and speak of love she listened with a blush and sigh his suit was warm his hopes were high he sought her yielded hand to clasp and a cold gauntlet met his grasp the phantoms sex was changed and gone upon its head a helmet shone slowly enlarged to giant size with darkened cheek and threatening eyes the grisly visage stern and hoar to ellen still a likeness bore he woke and panting with affright recalled the vision of the night the hearths decaying brands were red and deep and dusky luster shed half showing half concealing all the uncouth trophies of the hall mid those the stranger fixed his eye where that huge falchion hung on high and thoughts on thoughts a countless throng rushed chasing countless thoughts along until the giddy whirl to cure he rose and sought the moonshine pure xxxv the wildrose eglantine and broom wasted around their rich perfume the birchtrees swept in fragrant balm the aspens slept beneath the calm the silver light with quivering glance played on the waters still expanse wild were the heart whose passions sway could rage beneath the sober ray he felt its calm that warrior guest while thus he communed with his breast why is it at each turn i trace some memory of that exiled race can i not mountainmaiden spy but she must bear the douglas eye can i not view a highland brand but it must match the douglas hand can i not frame a fevered dream but still the douglas is the theme ill dream no more by manly mind not even in sleep is will resigned my midnight orisons said oer ill turn to rest and dream no more his midnight orisons he told a prayer with every bead of gold consigned to heaven his cares and woes and sunk in undisturbed repose until the heathcock shrilly crew and morning dawned on benvenue canto second the island i at morn the blackcock trims his jetty wing tis morning prompts the linnets blithest lay all natures children feel the matin spring of life reviving with reviving day and while yon little bark glides down the bay wafting the stranger on his way again morns genial influence roused a minstrel gray and sweetly oer the lake was heard thy strain mixed with the sounding harp o whitehaired allanbane ii song not faster yonder rowers might flings from their oars the spray not faster yonder rippling bright that tracks the shallops course in light melts in the lake away than men from memory erase the benefits of former days then stranger go good speed the while nor think again of the lonely isle high place to thee in royal court high place in battle line good hawk and hound for silvan sport where beauty sees the brave resort the honored meed be thine true be thy sword thy friend sincere thy lady constant kind and dear and lost in love and friendships smile be memory of the lonely isle iii song continued but if beneath yon southern sky a plaided stranger roam whose drooping crest and stifled sigh and sunken cheek and heavy eye pine for his highland home then warrior then be thine to show the care that soothes a wanderers woe remember then thy hap ere while a stranger in the lonely isle or if on lifes uncertain main mishap shall mar thy sail if faithful wise and brave in vain woe want and exile thou sustain beneath the fickle gale waste not a sigh on fortune changed on thankless courts or friends estranged but come where kindred worth shall smile to greet thee in the lonely isle iv as died the sounds upon the tide the shallop reached the mainland side and ere his onward way he took the stranger cast a lingering look where easily his eye might reach the harper on the islet beach reclined against a blighted tree as wasted gray and worn as he to minstrel meditation given his reverend brow was raised to heaven as from the rising sun to claim a sparkle of inspiring flame his hand reclined upon the wire seemed watching the awakening fire so still he sat as those who wait till judgment speak the doom of fate so still as if no breeze might dare to lift one lock of hoary hair so still as life itself were fled in the last sound his harp had sped v upon a rock with lichens wild beside him ellen sat and smiled smiled she to see the stately drake lead forth his fleet upon the lake while her vexed spaniel from the beach bayed at the prize beyond his reach yet tell me then the maid who knows why deepened on her cheek the rose forgive forgive fidelity perchance the maiden smiled to see yon parting lingerer wave adieu and stop and turn to wave anew and lovely ladies ere your ire condemn the heroine of my lyre show me the fair would scorn to spy and prize such conquest of her eye vi while yet he loitered on the spot it seemed as ellen marked him not but when he turned him to the glade one courteous parting sign she made and after oft the knight would say that not when prize of festal day was dealt him by the brightest fair who eer wore jewel in her hair so highly did his bosom swell as at that simple mute farewell now with a trusty mountainguide and his dark staghounds by his side he parts the maid unconscious still watched him wind slowly round the hill but when his stately form was hid the guardian in her bosom chid thy malcolm vain and selfish maid twas thus upbraiding conscience said not so had malcolm idly hung on the smooth phrase of southern tongue not so had malcolm strained his eye another step than thine to spy wake allanbane aloud she cried to the old minstrel by her side arouse thee from thy moody dream ill give thy harp heroic theme and warm thee with a noble name pour forth the glory of the graeme scarce from her lip the word had rushed when deep the conscious maiden blushed for of his clan in hall and bower young malcolm graeme was held the flower vii the minstrel waked his harp three times arose the wellknown martial chimes and thrice their high heroic pride in melancholy murmurs died vainly thou bidst o noble maid clasping his withered hands he said vainly thou bidst me wake the strain though all unwont to bid in vain alas than mine a mightier hand has tuned my harp my strings has spanned i touch the chords of joy but low and mournful answer notes of woe and the proud march which victors tread sinks in the wailing for the dead o well for me if mine alone that dirges deep prophetic tone if as my tuneful fathers said this harp which erst saint modan swayed can thus its masters fate foretell then welcome be the minstrels knell viii but ah dear lady thus it sighed the eve thy sainted mother died and such the sounds which while i strove to wake a lay of war or love came marring all the festal mirth appalling me who gave them birth and disobedient to my call wailed loud through bothwells bannered hall ere douglases to ruin driven were exiled from their native heaven oh if yet worse mishap and woe my masters house must undergo or aught but weal to ellen fair brood in these accents of despair no future bard sad harp shall fling triumph or rapture from thy string one short one final strain shall flow fraught with unutterable woe then shivered shall thy fragments lie thy master cast him down and die ix soothing she answered him assuage mine honored friend the fears of age all melodies to thee are known that harp has rung or pipe has blown in lowland vale or highland glen from tweed to spey what marvel then at times unbidden notes should rise confusedly bound in memorys ties entangling as they rush along the warmarch with the funeral song small ground is now for boding fear obscure but safe we rest us here my sire in native virtue great resigning lordship lands and state not then to fortune more resigned than yonder oak might give the wind the graceful foliage storms may reave the noble stem they cannot grieve for me she stooped and looking round plucked a blue harebell from the ground for me whose memory scarce conveys an image of more splendid days this little flower that loves the lea may well my simple emblem be it drinks heavens dew as blithe as rose that in the kings own garden grows and when i place it in my hair allan a bard is bound to swear he neer saw coronet so fair then playfully the chaplet wild she wreathed in her dark locks and smiled x her smile her speech with winning sway wiled the old harpers mood away with such a look as hermits throw when angels stoop to soothe their woe he gazed till fond regret and pride thrilled to a tear then thus replied loveliest and best thou little knowst the rank the honors thou hast lost o might i live to see thee grace in scotlands court thy birthright place to see my favorites step advance the lightest in the courtly dance the cause of every gallants sigh and leading star of every eye and theme of every minstrels art the lady of the bleeding heart xi fair dreams are these the maiden cried light was her accent yet she sighed yet is this mossy rock to me worth splendid chair and canopy nor would my footsteps spring more gay in courtly dance than blithe strathspey nor half so pleased mine ear incline to royal minstrels lay as thine and then for suitors proud and high to bend before my conquering eye thou flattering bard thyself wilt say that grim sir roderick owns its sway the saxon scourge clanalpines pride the terror of lochlomonds side would at my suit thou knowst delay a lennox foray for a day xii the ancient bard his glee repressed ill hast thou chosen theme for jest for who through all this western wild named black sir roderick eer and smiled in holyrood a knight he slew i saw when back the dirk he drew courtiers give place before the stride of the undaunted homicide and since though outlawed hath his hand full sternly kept his mountain land who else dared give ah woe the day that i such hated truth should say the douglas like a stricken deer disowned by every noble peer even the rude refuge we have here alas this wild marauding chief alone might hazard our relief and now thy maiden charms expand looks for his guerdon in thy hand full soon may dispensation sought to back his suit from rome he brought then though an exile on the hill thy father as the douglas still be held in reverence and fear and though to roderick thourt so dear that thou mightst guide with silken thread slave of thy will this chieftain dread yet o loved maid thy mirth refrain thy hand is on a lions mane xiii minstrel the maid replied and high her fathers soul glanced from her eye my debts to rodericks house i know all that a mother could bestow to lady margarets care i owe since first an orphan in the wild she sorrowed oer her sisters child to her brave chieftain son from ire of scotlands king who shrouds my sire a deeper holier debt is owed and could i pay it with my blood allan sir roderick should command my blood my life but not my hand rather will ellen douglas dwell a votaress in maronnans cell rather through realms beyond the sea seeking the worlds cold charity where neer was spoke a scottish word and neer the name of douglas heard an outcast pilgrim will she rove than wed the man she cannot love xiv thou shakest good friend thy tresses gray that pleading look what can it say but what i own i grant him brave but wild as bracklinns thundering wave and generous save vindictive mood or jealous transport chafe his blood i grant him true to friendly band as his claymore is to his hand but o that very blade of steel more mercy for a foe would feel i grant him liberal to fling among his clan the wealth they bring when back by lake and glen they wind and in the lowland leave behind where once some pleasant hamlet stood a mass of ashes slaked with blood the hand that for my father fought i honor as his daughter ought but can i clasp it reeking red from peasants slaughtered in their shed no wildly while his virtues gleam they make his passions darker seem and flash along his spirit high like lightning oer the midnight sky while yet a child and children know instinctive taught the friend and foe i shuddered at his brow of gloom his shadowy plaid and sable plume a maiden grown i ill could bear his haughty mien and lordly air but if thou joinst a suitors claim in serious mood to rodericks name i thrill with anguish or if eer a douglas knew the word with fear to change such odious theme were best what thinkst thou of our stranger guest xv what think i of him woe the while that brought such wanderer to our isle thy fathers battlebrand of yore for tineman forged by fairy lore what time he leagued no longer foes his border spears with hotspurs bows did selfunscabbarded foreshow the footstep of a secret foe if courtly spy hath harbored here what may we for the douglas fear what for this island deemed of old clanalpines last and surest hold if neither spy nor foe i pray what yet may jealous roderick say nay wave not thy disdainful head bethink thee of the discord dread that kindled when at beltane game thou ledst the dance with malcolm graeme still though thy sire the peace renewed smolders in rodericks breast the feud beware but hark what sounds are these my dull ears catch no faltering breeze no weeping birch nor aspens wake nor breath is dimpling in the lake still is the cannas hoary beard yet by my minstrel faith i heard and hark again some pipe of war sends the bold pibroch from afar xvi far up the lengthened lake were spied four darkening specks upon the tide that slow enlarging on the view four manned and masted barges grew and bearing downwards from glengyle steered full upon the lonely isle the point of brianchoil they passed and to the windward as they cast against the sun they gave to shine the bold sir rodericks bannered pine nearer and nearer as they bear spears pikes and axes flash in air now might you see the tartans brave and plaids and plumage dance and wave now see the bonnets sink and rise as his tough oar the rower plies see flashing at each sturdy stroke the wave ascending into smoke see the proud pipers on the bow and mark the gaudy streamers flow from their loud chanters down and sweep the furrowed bosom of the deep as rushing through the lake amain they plied the ancient highland strain xvii ever as on they bore more loud and louder rung the pibroch proud at first the sound by distance tame mellowed along the waters came and lingering long by cape and bay wailed every harsher note away then bursting bolder on the ear the clans shrill gathering they could hear those thrilling sounds that call the might of old clanalpine to the fight thick beat the rapid notes as when the mustering hundreds shake the glen and hurrying at the signal dread the battered earth returns their tread then prelude light of livelier tone expressed their merry marching on ere peal of closing battle rose with mingled outcry shrieks and blows and mimic din of stroke and ward as broad sword upon target jarred and groaning pause ere yet again condensed the battle yelled amain the rapid charge the rallying shout retreat borne headlong into rout and bursts of triumph to declare clanalpines conquest all were there nor ended thus the strain but slow sunk in a moan prolonged and low and changed the conquering clarion swell for wild lament oer those that fell xviii the warpipes ceased but lake and hill were busy with their echoes still and when they slept a vocal strain bade their hoarse chorus wake again while loud a hundred clansmen raise their voices in their chieftains praise each boatman bending to his oar with measured sweep the burden bore in such wild cadence as the breeze makes through decembers leafless trees the chorus first could allan know roderick vich alpine ho iro and near and nearer as they rowed distinct the martial ditty flowed xix boat song hail to the chief who in triumph advances honored and blessed be the evergreen pine long may the tree in his banner that glances flourish the shelter and grace of our line heaven send it happy dew earth lend it sap anew gayly to borgeon and broadly to grow while every highland glen sends our shout back again roderigh vich alpine dhu ho ieroe ours is no sapling chancesown by the fountain blooming at beltane in winter to fade when the whirlwind has stripped every leaf on the mountain the more shall clanalpine exult in her shade moored in the rifted rock proof to the tempests shock

woe lennox and levenglen shake when they hear again roderigh vich alpine dhu ho ieroe row vassals row for the pride of the highlands stretch to your oars for the evergreen pine o that the rosebud that

deepmost glen roderigh vich alpine dhu ho ieroe xxi with all her joyful female band had lady margaret sought the strand loose on the breeze their tresses flew and high their snowy arms they threw as echoing back with shrill acclaim and chorus wild the chieftains name while prompt to please with mothers art the darling passion of his heart the dame called ellen to the strand to greet her kinsman ere he land come loiterer come a douglas thou and shun to wreathe a victors brow reluctantly and slow the maid the unwelcome summoning obeyed and when a distant bugle rung in the midpath aside she sprung list allanbane from mainland cast i hear my fathers signal blast be ours she cried the skiff to guide and waft him from the mountain side then like a sunbeam swift and bright she darted to her shallop light and eagerly while roderick scanned for her dear form his mothers band the islet far behind her lay and she had landed in the bay xxii some feelings are to mortals given with less of earth in them than heaven and if there be a human tear from passions dross refined and clear a tear so limpid and so meek it would not stain an angels cheek tis that which pious fathers shed upon a duteous daughters head and as the douglas to his breast his darling ellen closely pressed such holy drops her tresses steeped though twas an heros eye that weeped nor while on ellens faltering tongue her filial welcomes crowded hung marked she that fear affections proof still held a graceful youth aloof no not till douglas named his name although the youth was malcolm graeme xxiii allan with wistful look the while marked roderick landing on the isle his master piteously he eyed then gazed upon the chieftains pride then dashed with hasty hand away from his dimmed eye the gathering spray and douglas as his hand he laid on malcolms shoulder kindly said canst thou young friend no meaning spy in my poor followers glistening eye ill tell thee he recalls the day when in my praise he led the lay oer the arched gate of bothwell proud while many a minstrel answered loud when percys norman pennon won in bloody field before me shone and twice ten knights the least a name as mighty as yon chief may claim gracing my pomp behind me came yet trust me malcolm not so proud was i of all that marshaled crowd though the waned crescent owned my might and in my train trooped lord and knight though blantyre hymned her holiest lays and bothwells bards flung back my praise as when this old mans silent tear and this poor maids affection dear a welcome give more kind and true than aught my better fortunes knew forgive my friend a fathers boast oh it outbeggars all i lost xxiv delightful praise like summer rose that brighter in the dewdrop glows the bashful maidens cheek appeared for douglas spoke and malcolm heard the flush of shamefaced joy to hide the hounds the hawk her cares divide the loved caresses of the maid the dogs with crouch and whimper paid and at her whistle on her hand the falcon took his favorite stand closed his dark wing relaxed his eye nor though unhooded sought to fly and trust while in such guise she stood like fabled goddess of the wood that if a fathers partial thought oerweighed her worth and beauty aught well might the lovers judgment fail to balance with a juster scale for with each secret glance he stole the fond enthusiast sent his soul xxv of stature tall and slender frame but firmly knit was malcolm graeme the belted plaid and tartan hose did neer more graceful limbs disclose his flaxen hair of sunny hue curled closely round his bonnet blue trained to the chase his eagle eye the ptarmigan in snow could spy each pass by mountain lake and heath he knew through lennox and menteith vain was the bound of darkbrown doe when malcolm bent his sounding bow and scarce that doe though winged with fear outstripped in speed the mountaineer right up benlomond could he press and not a sob his toil confess his form accorded with a mind lively and ardent frank and kind a blither heart till ellen came did never love nor sorrow tame it danced as lightsome in his breast as played the feather on his crest yet friends who nearest knew the youth his scorn of wrong his zeal for truth and bards who saw his features bold when kindled by the tales of old said were that youth to manhood grown not long should roderick dhus renown be foremost voiced by mountain fame but quail to that of malcolm graeme xxvi now back they wend their watery way and o my sire did ellen say why urge thy chase so far astray and why so late returned and why the rest was in her speaking eye my child the chase i follow far tis mimicry of noble war and with that gallant pastime reft were all of douglas i have left i met young malcolm as i strayed far eastward in glenfinlas shade nor strayed i safe for all around hunters and horsemen scoured the ground this youth though still a royal ward risked life and land to be my guard and through the passes of the wood guided my steps not unpursued and roderick shall his welcome make despite old spleen for douglas sake then must he seek strathendrick glen nor peril aught for me again xxvii sir roderick who to meet them came reddened at sight of malcolm graeme yet not in action word or eye failed aught in hospitality in talk and sport they whiled away the morning of that summer day but at high noon a courier light held secret parley with the knight whose moody aspect soon declared that evil were the news he heard deep thought seemed toiling in his head yet was the evening banquet made ere he assembled round the flame his mother douglas and the graeme and ellen too then cast around his eyes then fixed them on the ground as studying phrase that might avail best to convey unpleasant tale long with his daggers hilt he played then raised his haughty brow and said xxviii short be my speech nor time affords nor my plain temper glozing words kinsman and father if such name douglas vouchsafe to rodericks claim mine honored mother ellen why my cousin turn away thine eye and graeme in whom i hope to know full soon a noble friend or foe when age shall give thee thy command and leading in thy native land list all the kings vindictive pride boasts to have tamed the borderside where chiefs with hound and hawk who came to share their monarchs silvan game themselves in bloody toils were snared and when the banquet they prepared and wide their loyal portals flung oer their own gateway struggling hung loud cries their blood from meggats mead from yarrow braes and banks of tweed where the lone streams of ettrick glide and from the silver teviots side the dales where martial clans did ride are now one sheepwalk waste and wide this tyrant of the scottish throne so faithless and so ruthless known now hither comes his end the same the same pretext of silvan game what grace for highland chiefs judge ye by fate of border chivalry yet more amid glenfinlas green douglas thy stately form was seen this

verge that beetled oer the ocean tides incessant roar dreamed calmly out their dangerous dream till wakened by the morning beam when dazzled by the eastern glow such startler cast his glance below and saw unmeasured depth around and heard unintermitted sound and thought the battled fence so frail it waved like cobweb in the gale amid his senses giddy wheel did he not desperate impulse feel headlong to plunge himself below and meet the worst his fears foreshow thus ellen dizzy and astound as sudden ruin yawned around by crossing terrors wildly tossed still for the douglas fearing most could scarce the desperate thought withstand to buy his safety with her hand xxxii such purpose dread could malcolm spy in ellens quivering lip and eye and eager rose to speak but ere his tongue could hurry forth his fear had douglas marked the hectic strife where death seemed combating with life for to her cheek in feverish flood one instant rushed the throbbing blood then ebbing back with sudden sway

the chieftain strode the waving of his tartans broad and darkened brow where wounded pride with ire and disappointment vied seemed by the torchs gloomy light like the ill demon of the night stooping his pinions shadowy sway upon the knighted pilgrims way but unrequited love thy dart plunged deepest its envenomed smart and roderick with thine anguish stung at length the hand of douglas wrung while eyes that mocked at tears before with bitter drops were running oer the deathpangs of longcherished hope scarce in that ample breast had scope but struggling with his spirit proud convulsive heaved

aid her parting steps the graeme xxxiv then roderick from the douglas broke as flashes flame through sable smoke kindling its wreaths long dark and low to one broad blaze of ruddy glow so the deep anguish of despair burst in fierce jealousy to air with stalwart grasp his hand he laid on malcolms breast and belted plaid back beardless boy he sternly said back minion holdst thou thus at naught the lesson i so lately taught this roof the douglas and that maid thank thou for punishment delayed eager as a greyhound on his game fiercely with roderick grappled graeme perish my name if aught

giant strength chieftains forego i hold the first who strikes my foe madmen forbear your frantic jar what is the douglas fallen so far his daughters hand is deemed the spoil of such dishonorable broil sullen and slowly they unclasp as struck with shame their desperate grasp and each upon his rival glared with foot advanced and blade half bared xxxv ere yet the brands aloft were flung margaret on rodericks mantle hung and malcolm heard his ellens scream as faltered through terrific dream then roderick plunged in sheath his sword and veiled his wrath in scornful word rest safe till morning pity

heathen lore mixed in the charms he muttered oer the hallowed creed gave only worse and deadlier emphasis of curse no peasant sought that hermits prayer his cave the pilgrim shunned with care the eager huntsman knew his bound and in mid chase called off his hound or if in lonely glen or strath the desertdweller met his path he prayed and signed the cross between while terror took devotions mien v of brians birth strange tales were told his mother watched a midnight fold built deep within a dreary glen where scattered lay the bones of men in some forgotten battle slain and bleached by drifting wind and rain it might have tamed a warriors heart to view such mockery of his art the knotgrass fettered there the hand which once could burst an iron band beneath the broad and ample bone that bucklered heart to fear unknown a feeble and a timorous guest the fieldfare framed her lowly nest there the slow blindworm left his slime on the fleet limbs that mocked at time and there too lay

stream his hap to wail till frantic he as truth received what of his birth the crowd believed and sought in mist and meteor fire to meet and know his phantom sire in vain to soothe his wayward fate the cloister oped her pitying gate in vain the learning of the age unclasped the sablelettered page even in its treasures he could find food for the fever of his mind eager he read whatever tells of magic cabala and spells and every dark pursuit allied to curious and presumptuous pride till with fired brain and nerves oerstrung and heart with mystic horrors wrung desperate he sought benharrows den and hid him from the haunts of men vii the desert gave him visions wild such as might suit the specters child where with black cliffs the torrents toil he watched the wheeling eddies boil till from their foam his dazzled eyes beheld the river demon rise the mountain mist took form and limb of noontide hag or goblin grim the midnight wind came wild and dread swelled with the voices of the dead far on the future battleheath his eyes beheld the ranks of death thus the lone seer from mankind hurled shaped forth a disembodied world one lingering sympathy of mind still bound him to the mortal kind the only parent he could claim of ancient alpine lineage came late had he heard in prophets dream the fatal benshies boding scream sounds too had come in midnight blast of charging steeds careering fast along benharrows shingly side where mortal horseman neer might ride the thunderbolt had split the pine all augured ill to alpines line he girt his loins and came to show the signals of impending woe and now stood prompt to bless or ban as bade the chieftain of his clan viii twas all prepared and from the rock a goat the patriarch of the flock before the kindling pile was laid and pierced by rodericks ready blade patient the sickening victim eyed the lifeblood ebb in crimson tide down his clogged beard and shaggy limb till darkness glazed his eyeballs dim the grisly priest with murmuring prayer a slender crosslet formed with care a cubits length in measure due the shaft and limbs were rods of yew whose parents in inchcailliach wave their shadows oer clanalpines grave and answering lomonds breezes deep soothe many a chieftains endless sleep the cross thus formed he held on high with wasted hand and haggard eye and strange and mingled feelings woke while his anathema he spoke ix woe to the clansman who shall view this symbol of sepulchral yew forgetful that its branches grew where weep the heavens their holiest dew on alpines dwelling low deserter of his chieftains trust he neer shall mingle with their dust but from his sires and kindred thrust each clansmans execration just shall doom him wrath and woe he paused the word the vassals took with forward step and fiery look on high their naked brands they shook their clattering targets wildly strook and first in murmur low then like the billow in his course that far to seaward finds his source and flings to shore his mustered force burst with loud roar their answer hoarse woe to the traitor woe benans grey scalp the accents knew the joyous wolf from cover drew the exulting eagle screamed afar they knew the voice of alpines war x the shout was hushed on lake and fell the monk resumed his muttered spell dismal and low its accents came the while he scathed the cross with flame and the few words that reached the air although the holiest name was there had more of blasphemy than prayer but when he shook above the crowd its kindled points he spoke aloud woe to the wretch who fails to rear at this dread sign the ready spear for as the flames this symbol sear his home the refuge of his fear a kindred fate shall know far oer its roof the volumed flame clanalpines vengeance shall proclaim while maids and matrons on his name shall call down wretchedness and shame and infamy and woe then rose the cry of females shrill as goshawks whistle on the hill denouncing misery and ill mingled with childhoods babbling trill of curses stammered slow answering with imprecation dread sunk be his home in embers red and cursd be the meanest shed that eer shall hide the houseless head we doom to want and woe a sharp and shrieking echo gave coiruriskin thy goblin cave and the gray pass where birches wave on bealanambo xi then deeper paused the priest anew and hard his laboring breath he drew while with set teeth and clenched hand and eyes that glowed like fiery brand he meditated curse more dread and deadlier on the clansmans head who summoned to his chieftains aid the signal saw and disobeyed the crosslets points of sparkling wood he quenched among the bubbling blood and as again the sign he reared hollow and hoarse his voice was heard when flits this cross from man to man vichalpines summons to his clan burst be the ear that fails to heed palsied the foot that shuns to speed may ravens tear the careless eyes wolves make the coward heart their prize as sinks that bloodstream in the earth so may his hearts blood drench his hearth as dies in hissing gore the spark quench thou his light destruction dark and be the grace to him denied bought by this sign to all beside he ceased no

poured each hardy tenant down nor slacked the messenger his pace he showed the sign he named the place and pressing forward like the wind left clamor and surprise behind the fisherman forsook the strand the swarthy smith took dirk and brand with changd cheer the mower blithe left in the halfcut swathe the scythe the herds without a keeper strayed the plow was in midfurrow stayed the falcner tossed his hawk away the hunter left the stag at bay prompt at the signal of alarms each son of alpine rushed to arms so swept the tumult and affray along the margin of achray alas thou lovely lake

speed the lake is past duncraggans huts appear at last and peep like mossgrown rocks half seen half hidden in the copse so green there mayst thou rest thy labor done their lord shall speed the signal on as stoops the hawk upon his prey the henchman shot him down the way what woeful accents load the gale the funeral yell the female wail a gallant hunters sport is oer a valiant warrior fights no more who in the battle or the chase at rodericks side shall fill his place within the hall where torches ray supplies the excluded beams of day lies duncan on his lowly bier and oer him streams his

stranger step he hears tis not a mourners muffled tread who comes to sorrow oer the dead but headlong haste or deadly fear urge the precipitate career all stand aghast unheeding all the henchman bursts into the hall before the dead mans bier he stood held forth the cross besmeared with blood the musterplace is lanrick mead speed forth the signal clansmen speed xviii angus the heir of duncans line sprung forth and seized the fatal sign in haste the stripling to his side his fathers dirk and broadsword tied but when he saw his mothers eye watch him in speechless agony back to her opened arms he flew pressed on her lips a fond adieu alas she sobbed and yet be gone and speed thee forth like duncans son one look he cast upon the bier dashed from his eye the gathering tear breathed deep to clear his laboring breast and tossed aloft his bonnet crest then like the highbred colt when freed first he essays his fire and speed he vanished and oer moor and moss sped forward with the fiery cross suspended was the widows tear while yet his footsteps she could hear and when she marked the henchmans eye wet with unwonted sympathy kinsman she said his race is run that should have sped thine errand on the oak has fallen the sapling bough is all duncraggans shelter now yet trust i well his duty done the orphans god will guard my son and you in many a danger true at duncans hest your blades that drew to arms and guard that orphans head let babes and women wail the dead then weaponclang and martial call resounded through the funeral hall while from the walls the attendant band snatched sword and targe with hurried hand and short and flitting energy glanced from the mourners sunken eye as if the sounds to warrior dear might rouse her duncan from his bier but faded soon that borrowed force grief claimed his right and tears their course xix benledi saw the cross of fire it glanced like lightning up strathire oer dale and hill the summons flew nor rest nor pause young angus knew the tear that gathered in his eye he left the mountain breeze to dry until where teiths young waters roll betwixt him and a wooded knoll that graced the sable strath with green the chapel of st bride was seen swoln was the stream remote the bridge but angus paused not on the edge though the dark waves danced dizzily though reeled his sympathetic eye he dashed amid the torrents roar his right hand high the crosslet bore his left the poleax grasped to guide and stay his footing in the tide he stumbled twice the foam splashed high with hoarser swell the stream raced by and had he fallen forever there farewell duncraggans orphan heir but still as if in parting life firmer he grasped the cross of strife until the opposing bank he gained and up the chapel pathway strained xx a blithesome rout that morning tide had sought the chapel of st bride her troth tombeas mary gave to norman heir of armandave and issuing from the gothic arch the bridal now resumed their march in rude but glad procession came bonneted sire and coifclad dame and plaided youth with jest and jeer which snooden maiden would not hear and children that unwitting why lent the gay shout their shrilly cry and minstrels that in measures vied before the young and bonny bride whose downcast eye and cheek disclose the tear and blush of morning rose with virgin step and bashful hand she held the kerchiefs snowy band the gallant bridegroom by her side beheld his prize with victors pride and the glad mother in her ear was closely whispering word of cheer xxi who meets them at the churchyard gate the messenger of fear and fate haste in his hurried accent lies and grief is swimming in his eyes all dripping from the recent flood panting and travelsoiled he stood the fatal sign of fire and sword held forth and spoke the appointed word the musterplace is lanrick mead speed forth the signal norman speed and must he change so soon the hand just linked to his by holy band for the fell cross of blood and brand and must the day so blithe that rose and promised rapture in the close before its setting hour divide the bridegroom from the plighted bride o fatal doom it must it must clanalpines cause her chieftains trust her summons dread brook no delay stretch to the race away away xxii yet slow he laid his plaid aside and lingering eyed his lovely bride until he saw the starting tear speak woe he might not stop to cheer then trusting not a second look in haste he sped him up the brook nor backward glanced till on the heath where lubnaigs lake supplies the teith what in the racers bosom stirred the sickening pang of hope deferred and memory with a torturing train of all his morning visions vain mingled with loves impatience came the manly thirst for martial fame the stormy joy of mountaineers ere yet they rush upon the spears and zeal for clan and chieftain burning and hope from wellfought field returning with wars red honors on his crest to clasp his mary to his breast stung by such thoughts oer bank and brae like fire from flint he glanced away while high resolve and feeling strong burst into voluntary song xxiii song the heath this night must be my bed the bracken curtain for my head my lullaby the warders tread far far from love and thee mary tomorrow eve more stilly laid my couch may be my bloody plaid my vesper song thy wail sweet maid it will not waken me mary i may not dare not fancy now the grief that clouds thy lovely brow i dare not think upon thy vow and all it promised me mary no fond regret must norman know when bursts clanalpine on the foe his heart must be like bended bow his foot like arrow free mary a time will come with feeling fraught for if i fall in battle fought thy hapless lovers dying thought shall be a thought on thee mary and if returned from conquered foes how blithely will the evening close how sweet the linnet sing repose to my young bride and me mary xxiv not faster oer thy heathery braes balquidder speeds the midnight blaze rushing in conflagration strong thy deep ravines and dells along wrapping thy cliffs in purple glow and reddening the dark lakes below nor faster speeds it nor so far as oer thy heaths the voice of war the signal roused to martial coil the sullen margin of loch voil waked still loch doine and to the source alarmed balvaig thy swampy course thence southward turned its rapid road adown strathgartneys valley broad till rose in arms each man might claim a portion in clanalpines name from the gray sire whose trembling hand could hardly buckle on his brand to the raw boy whose shaft and bow were yet scarce terror to the crow each valley each sequestered glen mustered its little horde of men that met as torrents from the height in highland dales their streams unite still gathering as they pour along a voice more loud a tide more strong till at the rendezvous they stood by hundreds prompt for blows and blood each trained to arms since life began owning no tie but to his clan no oath but by his chieftains hand no law but roderick dhus command xxv that summer morn had roderick dhu surveyed the skirts of benvenue and sent his scouts oer hill and heath to view the frontiers of menteith all backward came with news of truce still lay each martial graeme and bruce in rednoch courts no horsemen wait no banner waved on cardross gate on duchrays towers no beacon shone nor scared the herons from loch con all seemed at peace now wot ye why the chieftain with such anxious eye ere to the muster he repair this western frontier scanned with care in benvenues most darksome cleft a fair though cruel pledge was left for douglas to his promise true that morning from the isle withdrew and in a deep sequestered dell had sought a low and lonely cell by many a bard in celtic tongue has coirnanuriskin been sung a softer name the saxons gave and called the grot the goblincave xxvi it was a wild and strange retreat as eer was trod by outlaws feet the dell upon the mountains crest yawned like a gash on warriors breast its trench had stayed full many a rock hurled by primeval earthquake shock from benvenues gray summit wild and here in random ruin piled they frowned incumbent oer the spot and formed the rugged silvan grot the oak and birch with mingled shade at noontide there a twilight made unless when short and sudden shone some straggling beam on cliff or stone with such a glimpse as prophets eye gains on thy depth futurity no murmur waked the solemn still save tinkling of a fountain rill but when the wind chafed with the lake a sullen sound would upward break with dashing hollow voice that spoke the incessant war of wave and rock suspended cliffs with hideous sway seemed nodding oer the cavern gray from such a den the wolf had sprung in such the wildcat leaves her young yet douglas and his daughter fair sought for a space their safety there gray superstitions whisper dread debarred the spot to vulgar tread for there she said did fays resort and satyrs hold their silvan court by moonlight tread their mystic maze and blast the rash beholders gaze xxvii now eve with western shadows long floated on katrine bright and strong when roderick with a chosen few repassed the heights of benvenue above the goblincave they go through the wild pass of bealnambo the prompt retainers speed before to launch the shallop from the shore for cross loch katrine lies his way to view the passes of achray and place his clansmen in array yet lags the chief in musing mind unwonted sight his men behind a single page to bear his sword alone attended on his lord the rest their way through thickets break and soon await him by the lake it was a fair and gallant sight to view them from the neighboring height by the lowleveled sunbeams light for strength and stature from the clan each warrior was a chosen man as even afar might well be seen by their proud step and martial mien their feathers dance their tartans float their targets gleam as by the boat a wild and warlike group they stand that well became such mountainstrand xxviii their chief with step reluctant still was lingering on the craggy hill hard by where turned apart the road to douglass obscure abode it was but with that dawning morn that roderick dhu had proudly sworn to drown his love in wars wild roar nor think of ellen douglas more but he who stems a stream with sand and fetters flame with flaxen band has yet a harder task to prove by firm resolve to conquer love eve finds the chief like restless ghost still hovering near his treasure lost for though his haughty heart deny a parting meeting to his eye still fondly strains his anxious ear the accents of her voice to hear and inly did he curse the breeze that waked to sound the rustling trees but hark what mingles in the strain it is the harp of allanbane that wakes its measures slow and high attuned to sacred minstrelsy what melting voice attends the strings tis ellen or an angel sings xxix hymn to the virgin ave maria maiden mild listen to a maidens prayer thou canst hear though from the wild thou canst save amid despair safe may we sleep beneath thy care though banished outcast and reviled maiden hear a maidens prayer mother hear a suppliant child ave maria ave maria undefiled the flinty couch we now must share shall seem with down of eider piled if thy protection hover there the murky caverns heavy air shall breathe of balm if thou hast smiled then maiden hear a maidens prayer mother list a suppliant child ave maria ave maria stainless styled foul demons of the earth and air from this their wonted haunt exiled shall flee before thy presence fair we bow us to our lot of care beneath thy guidance reconciled hear for a maid a maidens prayer and for a father hear a child ave maria xxx died on the harp the closing hymn unmoved in attitude and limb as listening still clanalpines lord stood leaning on his heavy sword until the page with humble sign twice pointed to the suns decline then while his plaid he round him cast it is the last time tis the last he muttered thrice the last time eer that angel voice shall roderick hear it was a goading thought his stride hied hastier down the mountain side sullen he flung him in the boat and instant cross the lake it shot they landed in that silvery bay and eastward held their hasty way till with the latest beams of light the band arrived on lanrick height where mustered in the vale below clanalpines men in martial show xxxi a various scene the clansmen made some sat some stood some slowly strayed but most with mantles folded round were couched to rest upon the ground scarce to be known by curious eye from the deep heather where they lie so well was matched the tartan screen with heathbell dark and brackens green unless where here and there a blade or lances point a glimmer made like glowworm twinkling through the shade but when advancing through the gloom they saw the chieftains eagle plume their shout of welcome shrill and wide shook the steep mountains steady side thrice it arose and lake and fell three times returned the martial yell it died upon bochastles plain and silence claimed her evening reign canto fourth the prophecy i the rose is fairest when tis budding new and hope is brightest when it dawns from fears the rose is sweetest washed with morning dew and love is loveliest when embalmed in tears o wilding rose whom fancy thus endears i bid your blossoms in my bonnet wave emblem of hope and love through future years thus spake young norman heir of armandave what time the sun arose on vennachars broad wave ii such fond conceit half said half sung love prompted to the bridegrooms tongue all while he stripped the wildrose spray his ax and bow beside him lay for on a pass twixt lake and wood a wakeful sentinel he stood hark on the rock a footstep rung and instant to his arms he sprung stand or thou diest what malise soon art thou returned from braes of doune by thy keen step and glance i know thou bringst us tidings of the foe for

side and stirred him with his slackened bow up up glantarkin rouse thee ho we seek the chieftain on the track keep eagle watch till i come back iii together up the pass they sped what of the foeman norman said varying reports from near and far this certain that a band of war has for two days been ready boune at prompt command to march from doune king james the while with princely powers holds revelry in stirling towers soon will this dark and gathering cloud speak on our glens in thunder loud inured to bide such bitter bout the warriors plaid may bear it out but norman how wilt thou provide a shelter for thy bonny bride what know ye not that rodericks care to the lone isle hath caused repair each maid and matron of the clan and every child and aged man unfit for arms and given his charge nor skiff nor shallop boat nor barge upon these lakes shall float at large but all beside the islet moor that such dear pledge may rest secure iv tis well advised the chieftains plan bespeaks the father of his clan but wherefore sleeps sir roderick dhu apart from all his followers true it is because last eveningtide brian an augury hath tried of that dread kind which must not be

had when swept our merrymen gallangad his hide was snow his horns were dark his red eye glowed like fiery spark so fierce so tameless and so fleet sore did he cumber our retreat and kept our stoutest

wizard waits prophetic dream nor distant rests the chief but hush see gliding slow through mist and bush the hermit gains yon rock and stands to gaze upon our slumbering bands seems he not malise like

evil augury but still i hold sir rodericks blade clanalpines omen and her aid not aught that gleaned from heaven or hell yon fiendbegotten monk can tell the chieftain joins him see and now together they descend the brow vi and as they came with alpines lord the hermit monk held solemn word roderick it is a fearful strife for man endowed with mortal life whose shroud of sentient clay can still feel feverish pang and fainting chill whose eye can stare in stony trance whose hair can rouse like warriors lance tis hard for such to view unfurled the curtain of the future world yet witness every quaking limb my sunken pulse my eyeballs dim my soul with harrowing anguish torn this for my chieftain have i borne the shapes that sought my fearful couch a human tongue may neer avouch no mortal man save he who bred between the living and the dead is gifted beyond natures law had eer survived to say he saw at length the fatal answer came in characters of living flame not spoke in word nor blazed in scroll but borne and branded on my soul which spills the foremost foemans life that party conquers in the strife vii thanks brian for thy zeal and care good is thine augury and fair clanalpine neer in battle stood but first our broadswords tasted blood a surer victim still i know selfoffered to the auspicious blow a spy has sought my land this morn no eve shall witness his return my followers

of mar by alpines soul high tidings those i love to hear of worthy foes when move they on tomorrows noon will see them here for battle boune then shall it see a meeting stern but for the place say couldst thou learn nought of the friendly clans of earn strengthened by them we well might bide the battle on benledis side thou couldst not well clanalpines men shall man the trossachs shaggy glen

affects mine eye or dost thou come illomened tear a messenger of doubt and fear no sooner may the saxon lance unfix benledi from his stance than doubt or terror can pierce through the unyielding heart of roderick dhu tis stubborn as his trusty targe each to his post all know their charge the pibroch sounds the bands advance the broadswords gleam the banners dance obedient to the chieftains glance i turn me from the martial roar and seek coiruriskin once more ix where is the douglas he is gone and ellen sits on the gray stone fast by the cave and makes her moan while vainly allans words of cheer are poured on her unheeding ear he will return dear lady trust with joy return he will he must well was it time to seek afar some refuge from impending war when een clanalpines rugged swarm are cowed by the approaching storm i saw their boats with many a light floating the livelong yesternight shifting like flashes darted forth by the red streamers of the north i marked at morn how close they ride thick moored by the lone islets side like wildducks couching in the fen when stoops the hawk upon the glen since this rude race dare not abide the peril on the mainland side shall not thy noble fathers care some safe retreat for thee prepare x ellen no allan no pretext so kind my wakeful terrors could not blind when in such tender tone yet grave douglas a parting blessing gave the tear that glistened in his eye drowned not his purpose fixed and high my soul though feminine and weak can image his een as the lake itself disturbed by slightest stroke reflects the invulnerable rock he hears the report of battle rife he deems himself the cause of strife i saw him redden when the theme turned allan on thine idle dream of malcolm graeme in fetters bound which i thou saidst about him wound thinkst thou he trowed thine omen aught oh no twas apprehensive thought for the kind youth for roderick too let me be just that friend so true in danger both and in our cause minstrel the douglas dare not pause why else that solemn warning given if not on earth we meet in heaven why else to cambuskenneths fane if eve return him not again am i to hie and make me known alas he goes to scotlands throne buys his friends safety with his own he goes to do what i had done had douglas daughter been his son xi nay lovely ellen dearest nay if aught should his return delay he only named yon holy fane as fitting place to meet again be sure hes safe and for the graeme heavens blessing on his gallant name my visioned sight may yet prove true nor bode of ill to him or you when did my gifted dream beguile think of the stranger at the isle and think upon the harpings slow that presaged this approaching woe sooth was my prophecy of fear believe it when it augurs cheer would we had left this dismal spot ill luck still haunts a fairy grot of such a wondrous tale i know dear lady change that look of woe my harp was wont thy grief to cheer ellen well be it as thou wilt i hear but cannot stop the bursting tear the minstrel tried his simple art but distant far was ellens heart xii ballad alice brand merry it is in the good greenwood when the mavis and merle are singing when the deer sweeps by and the hounds are in cry and the hunters horn is ringing o alice brand my native land is lost for love of you and we must hold by wood and wold as outlaws wont to do o alice twas all for thy locks so bright and twas all for thine eyes so blue that on the night of our luckless flight thy brother bold i slew now must i teach to hew the beech the hand that held the glaive for leaves to spread our

alice is singing on the beechs pride and oaks brown side lord richards ax is ringing up spoke the moody elfin king who wonned within the hill like wind in the porch of a ruined church his voice was

demon elf by him whom demons fear to show us whence thou art thyself and what thine errand here xv ballad continued tis merry tis merry in fairyland when fairy birds are singing when the court doth ride by their monarchs side with bit and bridle ringing and gaily shines the fairyland but all is glistening show like the idle gleam that decembers beam can dart on ice and snow and fading like that varied gleam is our inconstant shape who now like knight and lady seem and now like dwarf and ape it was between the night and day when the fairy king has power that i sunk down in a sinful fray and twixt life and death was snatched away to the joyless elfin bower but wist i of a woman bold who thrice my brow durst sign i might regain my mortal mold as fair a form as thine she crossed him once

were stayed a stranger climbed the steepy glade his martial step his stately mien his hunting suit of lincoln green his eagle glance remembrance claims tis snowdouns knight tis james fitzjames ellen beheld as in a dream then starting scarce suppressed a scream oh stranger in such hour of fear what evil hap has brought thee here an evil hap how can it be that bids me look again on thee by promise

no by my faith nor saw i ought could augur scathe o haste thee allan to the kern yonder his tartans i discern learn thou his purpose and conjure that he will guide the stranger sure what prompted thee unhappy man the meanest serf in rodericks clan had not been bribed by love or fear unknown to him to guide thee here xvii sweet ellen dear my life must be since it is worthy care from thee yet life i hold but idle breath when love or honors weighed with death then let me profit by my chance and speak my purpose bold at once i come to bear thee from a wild where neer before such blossom smiled by this soft hand to lead thee far from frantic scenes of feud and war near bochastle my horses wait they bear us soon to stirling gate ill place thee in a lovely bower ill guard thee like a tender flower o hush sir knight twere female art to say i do not read thy heart too much before my selfish ear was idly soothed my praise to hear that fatal bait hath lured thee back in deathful hour oer dangerous track and how o how can i atone the wreck my vanity brought on one way remains ill tell him all yes struggling bosom forth it shall thou whose light folly bears the blame buy thine own pardon with thy shame but first my father is a man outlawed and exiled under ban the price of blood is on his head with me twere infamy to wed still wouldst thou speak then hear the truth fitzjames there is a noble youth if yet he is exposed for me and mine to dread extremity thou hast the secret of my heart forgive be generous and depart xviii fitzjames knew every wily train a ladys fickle heart to gain but here he knew and felt them vain there shot no glance from ellens eye to give her steadfast speech the lie in maiden confidence she stood though mantled in her cheek the blood and told her love with such a sigh of deep and hopeless agony as death had sealed her malcolms doom and she sat sorrowing on his tomb hope vanished from fitzjamess eye but not with hope fled sympathy he proffered to attend her side as brother would a sister guide o little knowst thou rodericks heart safer for both we go apart o haste thee and from allan learn if thou mayst trust yon wily kern with hand upon his forehead laid the conflict of his mind to shade a parting step or two he made then as some thought had crossed his brain he paused and turned and came again xix hear lady yet a parting word it chanced in fight that my poor sword preserved the life of scotlands lord this ring the grateful monarch gave and bade when i had boon to crave to bring it back and boldly claim the recompense that i would name ellen i am no courtly lord but one who lives by lance and sword whose castle is his helm and shield his lordship the embattled field what from a prince can i demand who neither reck of state nor land ellen thy hand the ring is thine each guard and usher knows the sign seek thou the king without delay this signet shall secure thy way and claim thy suit whateer it be as ransom of his pledge to me he placed the golden circlet on paused kissed her hand and then was gone the aged minstrel stood aghast so hastily fitzjames shot past he joined his guide and wending down the ridges of the mountain brown across the stream they took their way that joins loch katrine to achray xx all in the trossachs glen was still noontide was sleeping on the hill sudden his guide whooped loud and high murdoch was that a signal cry he stammered forth i shout to scare yon raven from his dainty fare he looked he knew the ravens prey his own brave steed ah gallant gray for thee for me perchance twere well we neer had seen the trossachs dell murdoch move first but silently whistle or whoop and thou shalt die jealous and sullen on they fared each silent each upon his guard xxi now wound the path its dizzy ledge around a precipices edge when lo a wasted female form blighted by wrath of sun and storm in tattered weeds and wild array stood on a cliff beside the way and glancing round her restless eye upon the wood the rock the sky seemed naught to mark yet all to spy her brow was wreathed with gaudy broom with gesture wild she waved a plume of feathers which the eagles fling to crag and cliff from dusky wing such spoils her desperate step had sought where scarce was footing for the goat the tartan plaid she first descried and shrieked till all the rocks replied as loud she laughed when near they drew for then the lowland garb she knew and then her hands she wildly wrung and then she wept and then she sung she sung the voice in better time perchance to harp or lute might chime and now though strained and roughened still rung wildly sweet to dale and hill xxii song they bid me sleep they bid me pray they say my brain is warped and wrung i cannot sleep on highland brae i cannot pray in highland tongue but were i now where allan glides or heard my native devans tides so sweetly would i rest and pray that heaven would close my wintry day twas thus my hair they bade me braid they made me to the church repair it was my bridal morn they said and my true love would meet me there but woe betide the cruel guile that drowned in blood the morning smile and woe betide the fairy dream i only waked to sob and scream xxiii who is this maid what means her lay she hovers oer the hollow way and flutters wide her mantle gray as the lone heron spreads his wing by twilight oer a haunted spring tis blanche of devan murdoch said a crazed and captive lowland maid taen on the morn she was a bride when roderick forayed devan side the gay bridegroom resistance made and felt our chiefs unconquered blade i marvel she is now at large but oft she scapes from maudlins charge hence brainsick fool he raised his bow now if thou strikst her but one blow ill pitch thee from the cliff as far as ever peasant pitched a bar thanks champion thanks the maniac cried and pressed her to fitzjamess side see the gray pennons i prepare to seek my truelove through the air i will not lend that savage groom to break his fall one downy plume no deep amid disjointed stones the wolves shall batten on his bones and then shall his detested plaid by bush and brier in mid air stayed wave forth a banner fair and free meet signal for their revelry xxiv hush thee poor maiden and be still oh thou lookst kindly and i will mine eye has dried and wasted been but still it loves the lincoln green and though mine ear is all unstrung still still it loves the lowland tongue for o my sweet william was forester true he stole poor blanches heart away his coat it was all of the greenwood hue and so blithely he trilled the lowland lay it was not that i meant to tell but thou art wise and guessest well then in a low and broken tone and hurried note the song went on still on the clansman fearfully she fixed her apprehensive eye then turned it on the knight and then her look glanced wildly oer the glen xxv the toils are pitched and the stakes are set ever sing merrily merrily the bows they bend and the knives they whet hunters live so cheerily it was a stag a stag of ten bearing its branches sturdily he came stately down the glen ever sing hardily hardily it was there he met with a wounded doe she was bleeding deathfully she warned him of the toils below oh so faithfully faithfully he had an eye and he could heed ever sing warily warily he had a foot and he could speed hunters watch so narrowly xxvi fitzjamess mind was passiontossed when ellens hints and fears were lost but murdochs shout suspicion wrought and blanches song conviction brought not like a stag that spies the snare but lion of the hunt aware he waved at once his blade on high disclose thy treachery or die forth at full speed the clansman flew but in his race his bow he drew the shaft just grazed fitzjamess crest and thrilled in blanches faded breast murdoch of alpine prove thy speed for neer had alpines son such need with heart of fire and foot of wind the fierce avenger is behind fate judges of the rapid strife the forfeit death the prize is life thy kindred ambush lies before close couched upon the heathery moor them couldst thou reach it may not be thine ambushed kin thou neer shalt see the fiery saxon gains on thee resistless speeds the deadly thrust as lightning strikes the pine to dust with foot and hand fitzjames must strain ere he can win his blade again bent oer the fallen with falcon eye he grimly smiled to see him die then slower wended back his way where the poor maiden bleeding lay xxvii she sat beneath a birchentree her elbow resting on her knee she had withdrawn the fatal shaft and gazed on it and feebly laughed her wreath of broom and feathers gray daggled with blood beside her lay the knight to staunch the lifestream tried stranger it is in vain she cried this hour of death has given me more of reasons power than years before for as these ebbing veins decay my frenzied visions fade away a helpless injured wretch i die and something tells me in thine eye that thou wert mine avenger born seest thou this tress oh still ive worn this little tress of yellow hair through danger frenzy and despair it once was bright and clear as thine but blood and tears have dimmed its shine i will not tell thee when twas shred nor from what guiltless victims head my brain would turn but it shall wave like plumage on thy helmet brave till sun and wind shall bleach the stain and thou wilt bring it me again i waver still o god more bright let reason beam her parting light oh by thy knighthoods honored sign and for thy life preserved by mine when thou shalt see a darksome man who boasts him chief of alpines clan with tartans broad and shadowy plume and hand of blood and brow of gloom be thy heart bold thy weapon strong and wreak poor blanche of devans wrong they watch for thee by pass and fell avoid the path o god farewell xxviii a kindly heart had brave fitzjames fast poured his eyes at pitys claims and now with mingled grief and ire he saw the murdered maid expire god in my need be my relief as i wreak this on yonder chief a lock from blanches tresses fair he blended with her bridegrooms hair the mingled braid in blood he dyed and placed it on his bonnetside by him whose word is truth i swear no other favor will i wear till this sad token i imbrue in the best blood of roderick dhu but hark what means yon faint halloo the chase is up but they shall know the stag at bays a dangerous foe barred from the known but guarded way through copse and cliffs fitzjames must stray and oft must change his desperate track by stream and precipice turned back heartless fatigued and faint at length from lack of food and loss of strength he couched him in a thicket hoar and thought his toils and perils oer of all my rash adventures past this frantic feat must prove the last who eer so mad but might have guessed that all this highland hornets nest would muster up in swarms so soon as eer they heard of bands at doune like bloodhounds now they search me out hark to the whistle and the shout if further through the wilds i go i only fall upon the foe ill couch me here till evening gray then darkling try my dangerous way xxix the shades of eve come slowly down the woods are wrapped in deeper brown the owl awakens from her dell the fox is heard upon the fell enough remains of glimmering light to guide the wanderers steps aright yet not enough from far to show his figure to the watchful foe with cautious step and ear awake he climbs the crag and threads the brake and not the summer solstice there tempered the midnight mountain air but every breeze that swept the wold benumbed his drenchd limbs with cold in dread in danger and alone famished and chilled through ways unknown tangled and steep he journeyed on till as a rocks huge point he turned a watchfire close before him burned xxx beside its embers red and clear basked in his plaid a mountaineer and up he sprung with sword in hand thy name and purpose saxon stand a stranger what dost thou require rest and a guide and food and fire my lifes beset my path is lost the gale has chilled my limbs with frost art thou a friend to roderick no thou darest not call thyself a foe i dare to him and all the band he brings to aid his murderous hand bold words but though the beast of game the privilege of chase may claim though space and law the stag we lend ere hound we slip or bow we bend who ever recked where how or when the prowling fox was trapped or slain thus treacherous scouts yet sure they lie who say thou camest a secret spy they do by heaven come roderick dhu and of his clan the boldest two and let me but till morning rest i write the falsehood on their crest if by the blaze i mark aright thou bearst the belt and spur of knight then by these tokens mayst thou know each proud oppressors mortal foe enough enough sit down and share a soldiers couch a soldiers fare xxxi he gave him of his highland cheer the hardened flesh of mountain deer dry fuel on the fire he laid and bade the saxon share his plaid he tended him like welcome guest then thus his further speech addressed stranger i am to roderick dhu a clansman born a kinsman true each word against his honor spoke demands of me avenging stroke yet more upon thy fate tis said a mighty augury is laid it rests with me to wind my horn thou art with numbers overborne it rests with me here brand to brand worn as thou art to bid thee stand but not for clan nor kindreds cause will i depart from honors laws to assail a wearied man were shame and stranger is a holy name guidance and rest food and fire in vain he never must require then rest thee here till dawn of day myself will guide thee on the way oer stock and stone through watch and ward till past clanalpines outmost guard as far as coilantogles ford from thence thy warrant is thy sword i take thy courtesy by heaven as freely as tis nobly given well rest thee for the bitterns cry sings us the lakes wild lullaby with that he shook the gathered heath and spread his plaid upon the wreath and the brave foemen side by side lay peaceful down like brothers tried and slept until the dawning beam purpled the mountain and the stream canto fifth the combat i fair as the earliest beam of eastern light when first by the bewildered pilgrim spied it smiles upon the dreary brow of night and silvers oer the torrents foaming tide and lights the fearful path on mountain side fair as that beam although the fairest far giving to horror grace to danger pride shine martial faith and courtesys bright star through all the wreckful storms that cloud the brow of war ii that early beam so fair and sheen was twinkling through the hazel screen when rousing at its glimmer red the warriors left their lowly bed looked out upon the dappled sky muttered their soldier matins by and then awaked their fire to steal as short and rude their soldier meal that oer the gael around him threw his graceful plaid of varied hue and true to promise led the way by thicket green and mountain gray a wildering path they winded now along the precipices brow commanding the rich scenes beneath the windings of the forth and teith and all the vales between that lie till stirlings turrets melt in sky then sunk in copse their farthest glance gained not the length of horsemans lance twas oft so steep the foot was fain assistance from the hand to gain so tangled oft that bursting through each hawthorn shed her showers of dew that diamond dew so pure and clear it rivals all but beautys tear iii at length they came where stern and steep the hill sinks down upon the deep here vennachar in silver flows there ridge on ridge benledi rose ever the hollow path twined on beneath steep bank and threatening stone an hundred men might hold the post with hardihood against a host the rugged mountains scanty cloak was dwarfish shrubs of birch and oak with shingles bare and cliffs between and patches bright of bracken green and heather black that waved so high it held the copse in rivalry but where the lake slept deep and still dank osiers fringed the swamp and hill and oft both path and hill were torn where wintry torrents down had borne and heaped upon the cumbered land its wreck of gravel rocks and sand so toilsome was the road to trace the guide abating of his pace led slowly through the passs jaws and asked fitzjames by what strange cause he sought these wilds traversed by few without a pass from roderick dhu iv brave gael my pass in danger tried hangs in my belt and by my side yet sooth to tell the saxon said i dreamt not now to claim its aid when here but three days since i came bewildered in pursuit of game all seemed as peaceful and as still as the mist slumbering on yon hill thy dangerous chief was then afar nor soon expected back from war thus said at least my mountainguide though deep perchance the villian lied yet why a second venture try a warrior thou and ask me why moves our free course by such fixed cause as gives the poor mechanic laws enough i sought to drive away the lazy hours of peaceful day slight cause will then suffice to guide a knights free footsteps far and wide a falcon flown a greyhound strayed the merry glance of mountain maid or if a path be dangerous known the dangers self is lure alone v thy secret keep i urge thee not yet ere again ye sought this spot say heard ye nought of lowland war against clanalpine raised by mar no by my word of bands prepared to guard king jamess sports i heard nor doubt i aught but when they hear this muster of the mountaineer their pennons will abroad be flung which else in doune had peaceful hung free be they flung for we were loath their silken folds should feast the moth free be they flung as free shall wave clanalpines pine in banner brave but stranger peaceful since you came bewildered in the mountain game whence the bold boast by which you show vichalpines vowed and mortal foe warrior but yestermorn i knew naught of thy chieftain roderick dhu save as an outlawed desperate man the chief of a rebellious clan who in the regents court and sight with ruffian dagger stabbed a knight yet this alone might from his part sever each true and loyal heart vi wrathful at such arraignment foul dark lowered the clansmans sable scowl a space he paused then sternly said and heardst thou why he drew his blade heardst thou that shameful word and blow brought rodericks vengeance on his foe what recked the chieftain if he stood on highland heath or holyrood he rights such wrong where it is given if it were in the court of heaven still was it outrage yet tis true not then claimed sovereignty his due while albany with feeble hand held borrowed truncheon of command the young king mewed in stirling tower was stranger to respect and power but then thy chieftains robber life winning mean prey by causeless strife wrenching from ruined lowland swain his herds and harvest reared in vain methinks a soul like thine should scorn the spoils from such foul foray borne vii the gael beheld him grim the while and answered with disdainful smile saxon from yonder mountain high i marked thee send delighted eye far to the south and east where lay extended in succession gay deep waving fields and pastures green with gentle slopes and groves between these fertile plains that softened vale were once the birthright of the gael the stranger came with iron hand and from our fathers reft the land where dwell we now see rudely swell crag over crag and fell oer fell ask we this savage hill we tread for fattened steer or household bread ask we for flocks these shingles dry and well the mountain might reply to you as to your sires of yore belong the target and claymore i give you shelter in my breast your own good blades must win the rest pent in this fortress of the north thinkst thou we will not sally forth to spoil the spoiler as we may and from the robber rend the prey aye by my soul while on yon plain the saxon rears one shock of grain while of ten thousand herds there strays but one along yon rivers maze the gael of plain and river heir shall with strong hand redeem his share where live the mountain chiefs who hold that plundering lowland field and fold is aught but retribution true seek other cause gainst roderick dhu viii answered fitzjames and if i sought thinkst thou no other could be brought what deem ye of my path waylaid my life given oer to ambuscade as of a meed to rashness due hadst thou sent warning fair and true i seek my hound or falcon strayed i seek good faith a highland maid free hadst thou been to come and go but secret path marks secret foe nor yet for this even as a spy hadst thou unheard been doomed to die save to fulfill an augury well let it pass nor will i now fresh cause of enmity avow to chafe thy mood and cloud thy brow enough i am by promise tied to match me with this man of pride twice have i sought clanalpines glen in peace but when i come again i come with banner brand and bow as leader seeks his mortal foe for lovelorn swain in ladys bower neer panted for the appointed hour as i until before me stand this rebel chieftain and his band ix have then thy wish he whistled shrill and he was answered from the hill wild as the scream of the curlew from crag to crag the signal flew instant through copse and heath arose bonnets and spears and bended bows on right on left above below sprung up at once the lurking foe from shingles gray their lances start the bracken bush sends forth the dart the rushes and the willowwand are bristling into ax and brand and every tuft of broom gives life to plaided warrior armed for strife that whistle garrisoned the glen at once with full five hundred men as if the yawning hill to heaven a subterranean host had given watching their leaders beck and will all silent there they stood and still like the loose crags whose threatening mass lay tottering oer the hollow pass as if an infants touch could urge their headlong passage down the verge with step and weapon forward flung upon the mountainside they hung the mountaineer cast glance of pride along benledis living side then fixed his eye and sable brow full on fitzjames how sayst thou now these are clanalpines warriors true and saxon i am roderick dhu x fitzjames was brave though to his heart the lifeblood thrilled with sudden start he manned himself with dauntless air returned the chief his haughty stare his back against a rock he bore and firmly placed his foot before come one come all this rock shall fly from its firm base as soon as i sir roderick marked and in his eyes respect was mingled with surprise and the stern joy which warriors feel in foemen worthy of their steel short space he stood then waved his hand down sunk the disappearing band each warrior vanished where he stood in broom or bracken heath or wood sunk brand and spear and bended bow in osiers pale and copses low it seemed as if their mother earth had swallowed up her warlike birth the winds last breath had tossed in air pennon and plaid and plumage fair the next but swept a lone hillside where heath and fern were waving wide the suns last glance was glinted back from spear and glaive from targe and jack the next all unreflected shone on bracken green and cold gray stone xi fitzjames looked round yet scarce believed the witness that his sight received such apparition well might seem delusion of a dreadful dream sir roderick in suspense he eyed and to his look the chief replied fear naught nay that i need not say but doubt not aught from mine array thou art my guest i pledged my word as far as coilantogle ford nor would i call a clansmans brand for aid against one valiant hand though on our strife lay every vale rent by the saxon from the gael so move we on i only meant to show the reed on which you leant deeming this path you might pursue without a pass from roderick dhu they moved i said fitzjames was brave as ever knight that belted glaive yet dare not say that now his blood kept on its wont and tempered flood as following rodericks stride he drew that seeming lonesome pathway through which yet by fearful proof was rife with lances that to take his life waited but signal from a guide so late dishonored and defied ever by stealth his eye sought round the vanished guardians of the ground and still from copse and heather deep fancy saw spear and broadsword peep and in the plovers shrilly strain the signal whistle heard again nor breathed he free till far behind the pass was left for then they wind along a wide and level green where neither tree nor tuft was seen nor rush nor bush of broom was near to hide a bonnet or a spear xii the chief in silence strode before and reached that torrents sounding shore which daughter of three mighty lakes from vennachar in silver breaks sweeps through the plain and ceaseless mines on bochastle the moldering lines where rome the empress of the world of yore her eagle wings unfurled and here his course the chieftain stayed threw down his target and his plaid and to the lowland warrior said bold saxon to his promise just vichalpine has discharged his trust this murderous chief this ruthless man this head of a rebellious clan hath led thee safe through watch and ward far past clanalpines outmost guard now man to man and steel to steel a chieftains vengeance thou shalt feel see here all vantageless i stand armed like thyself with single brand for this is coilantogle ford and thou must keep thee with thy sword xiii the saxon paused i neer delayed when foeman bade me draw my blade nay more brave chief i vowed thy death yet sure thy fair and generous faith and my deep debt for life preserved a better meed have well deserved can naught but blood our feud atone are there no means no stranger none and hear to fire thy flagging zeal the saxon cause rests on thy steel for thus spoke fate by prophet bred between the living and the dead who spills the foremost foemans life his party conquers in the strife then by my word the saxon said the riddle is already read seek yonder brake beneath the cliff there lies red murdoch stark and stiff thus fate hath solved her prophecy then yield to fate and not to me to james at stirling let us go when if thou wilt be still his foe or if the king shall not agree to grant thee grace and favor free i plight mine honor oath and word that to thy native strengths restored with each advantage shalt thou stand that aids thee now to guard thy land xiv dark lightning flashed from rodericks eye soars thy presumption then so high because a wretched kern ye slew homage to name to roderick dhu he yields not he to man nor fate thou addst but fuel to my hate my clansmans blood demands revenge not yet prepared by heaven i change my thought and hold thy valor light as that of some vain carpet knight who ill deserved my courteous care and whose best boast is but to wear a braid of his fair ladys hair i thank thee roderick for the word it nerves my heart it steels my sword for i have sworn this braid to stain in the best blood that warms thy vein now truce farewell and ruth begone yet think not that by thee alone proud chief can courtesy be shown though not from copse or heath or cairn start at my whistle clansmen stern of this small horn one feeble blast would fearful odds against thee cast but fear not doubt not which thou wilt we try this quarrel hilt to hilt then each at once his falchion drew each on the ground his scabbard threw each looked to sun and stream and plain as what they neer might see again then foot and point and eye opposed in dubious strife they darkly closed xv ill fared it then with roderick dhu that on the field his targe he threw whose brazen studs and tough bullhide had death so often dashed aside for trained abroad his arms to wield fitzjamess blade was sword and shield he practiced every pass and ward to thrust to strike to feint to guard while less expert though stronger far the gael maintained unequal war three times in closing strife they stood and thrice the saxon blade drank blood no stinted draft no scanty tide the gushing flood the tartans dyed fierce roderick felt the fatal drain and showered his blows like wintry rain and as firm rock or castleroof against the winter shower is proof the foe invulnerable still foiled his wild rage by steady skill till at advantage taen his brand forced rodericks weapon from his hand and backward borne upon the lea brought the proud chieftain to his knee xvi now yield thee or by him who made the world thy hearts blood dyes my blade thy threats thy mercy i defy let recreant yield who fears to die like adder darting from his coil like wolf that dashes through the toil like mountaincat who guards her young full at fitzjamess throat he sprung received but recked not of a wound and locked his arms his foeman round now gallant saxon hold thine own no maidens hand is round thee thrown that desperate grasp thy frame might feel through bars of brass and triple steel they tug they strain down down they go the gael above fitzjames below the chieftains gripe his throat compressed his knee was planted in his breast his clotted locks he backward threw across his brow his hand he drew from blood and mist to clear his sight then gleamed aloft his dagger bright but hate and fury ill supplied the stream of lifes exhausted tide and all too late the advantage came to turn the odds of deadly game for while the dagger gleamed on high reeled soul and sense reeled brain and eye down came the blow but in the heath the erring blade found bloodless sheath the struggling foe may now unclasp the fainting chiefs relaxing grasp unwounded from the dreadful close but breathless all fitzjames arose xvii he faltered thanks to heaven for life redeemed unhoped from desperate strife next on his foe his look he cast whose every gasp appeared his last in rodericks gore he dipped the braid poor blanche thy wrongs are dearly paid yet with thy foe must die or live the praise that faith and valor give with that he blew a buglenote undid the collar from his throat unbonneted and by the wave sat down his brow and hands to lave then faint afar are heard the feet of rushing steeds in gallop fleet the sounds increase and now are seen four mounted squires in lincoln green two who bear lance and two who lead by loosened rein a saddled steed each onward held his headlong course and by fitzjames reined up his horse with wonder viewed the bloody spot exclaim not gallants question not you herbert and luffness alight and bind the wounds of yonder knight let the gray palfrey bear his weight we destined for a fairer freight and bring him on to stirling straight i will before at better speed to seek fresh horse and fitting weed the sun rides high i must be boune to see the archergame at noon but lightly bayard clears the lea de vaux and herries follow me xviii stand bayard stand the steed obeyed with arching neck and bended head and glancing eye and quivering ear as if he loved his lord to hear no foot fitzjames in stirrup stayed no grasp upon the saddle laid but wreathed his left hand in the mane and lightly bounded from the plain turned on the horse his armd heel and stirred his courage with the steel bounded the fiery steed in air the rider sat erect and fair then like a bolt from steel crossbow forth launched along the plain they go they dashed that rapid torrent through and up carhonies hill they flew still at the gallop pricked the knight his merrymen followed as they might along thy banks swift teith they ride and in the race they mock thy tide torry and lendrick now are past and deanstown lies behind them cast they rise the bannered towers of doune they sink in distant woodland soon blairdrummond sees the hoofs strike fire they sweep like breeze through ochtertyre they mark just glance and disappear the lofty brow of ancient kier they bathe their coursers sweltering sides dark forth amid thy sluggish tides and on the opposing shore take ground with plash with scramble and with bound righthand they leave thy cliffs craigforth and soon the bulwark of the north gray stirling with her towers and town upon their fleet career looked down xix as up the flinty path they strained sudden his steed the leader reined a signal to his squire he flung who instant to his stirrup sprung seest thou de vaux yon woodsman gray who townward holds the rocky way of stature tall and poor array markst thou the firm yet active stride with which he scales the mountainside knowst thou from whence he comes or whom no by my word a burly groom he seems who in the field or chase a barons train would nobly grace out out de vaux can fear supply and jealousy no sharper eye afar ere to the hill he drew that stately form and step i knew like form in scotland is not seen treads not such step on scottish green tis james of douglas by saint serle the uncle of the banished earl away away to court to show the near approach of dreaded foe the king must stand upon his guard douglas and he must meet prepared then righthand wheeled their steeds and straight they won the castles postern gate xx the douglas who had bent his way from cambuskenneths abbey gray now as he climbed the rocky shelf held sad communion with himself yes all is true my fears could frame a prisoner lies the noble graeme and fiery roderick soon will feel the vengeance of the royal steel i only i can ward their fate god grant the ransom come not late the abbess hath her promise given my child shall be the bride of heaven be pardoned one repining tear for he who gave her knows how dear how excellent but that is by and now my business is to die ye towers within whose circuit dread a douglas by his sovereign bled and thou o sad and fatal mound that oft hast heard the deathax sound as on the noblest of the land fell the stern headsmans bloody hand the dungeon block and nameless tomb prepare for douglas seeks his doom but hark what blithe and jolly peal makes the franciscan steeple reel and see upon the crowded street in motley groups what maskers meet banner and pageant pipe and drum and merry morris dancers come i guess by all this quaint array the burghers hold their sports today james will be there he loves such show where the good yeoman bends his bow and the tough wrestler foils his foe as well as where in proud career the highborn tilter shivers spear ill follow to the castlepark and play my prize king james shall mark if age has tamed these sinews stark whose force so oft in happier days his boyish wonder loved to praise xxi the castle gates were open flung the quivering drawbridge rocked and rung and echoed loud the flinty street beneath the coursers clattering feet as slowly down the steep descent fair scotlands king and nobles went while all along the crowded way was jubilee and loud huzza and ever james was bending low to his white jennets saddlebow doffing his cap to city dame who smiled and blushed for pride and shame and well the simperer might be vain he chose the fairest of the train gravely he greets each city sire commends each pageants quaint attire gives to the dancers thanks aloud and smiles and nods upon the crowd who rend the heavens with their acclaims long live the commons king king james behind the king thronged peer and knight and noble dame and damsel bright whose fiery steeds ill brooked the stay of the steep street and crowded way but in the train you might discern dark lowering brow and visage stern there nobles mourned their pride restrained and the mean burghers joys disdained and chiefs who hostage for their clan were each from home a banished man there thought upon their own gray tower their waving woods their feudal power and deemed themselves a shameful part of pageant which they cursed in heart xxii now in the castlepark drew out their checkered bands the joyous rout their morricers with bell at heel and blade in hand their mazes wheel and chief beside the butts there stand bold robin hood and all his band friar tuck with quarterstaff and cowl old scathelocke with his surly scowl maid marion fair as ivory bone scarlet and mutch and little john their bugles challenge all that will in archery to prove their skill the douglas bent a bow of might his first shaft centered in the white and when in turn he shot again his second split the first in twain from the kings hand must douglas take a silver dart the archers stake fondly he watched with watery eye some answering glance of sympathy no kind emotion made reply indifferent as to archer wight the monarch gave the arrow bright xxiii now clear the ring for hand to hand the manly wrestlers take their stand two oer the rest superior rose and proud demanded mightier foes nor called in vain for douglas came for life is hugh of larbert lame scarce better john of alloas fare whom senseless home his comrades bear prize of the wrestling match the king to douglas gave a golden ring while coldly glanced his eye of blue as frozen drop of wintry dew douglas would speak but in his breast his struggling soul his words suppressed indignant then he turned him where their arms the brawny yeomen bare to hurl the massive bar in air when each his utmost strength had shown the douglas rent an earthfast stone from its deep bed then heaved it high and sent the fragment through the sky a rood beyond the farthest mark and still in stirlings royal park the grayhaired sires who know the past to strangers point the douglascast and moralize on the decay of scottish strength in modern day xxiv the vale with loud applauses rang the ladies rock sent back the clang the king with look unmoved bestowed a purse wellfilled with pieces broad indignant smiled the douglas proud and threw the gold among the crowd who now with anxious wonder scan and sharper glance the dark gray man till whispers rose among the throng that heart so free and hand so strong must to the douglas blood belong the old men marked and shook the head to see his hair with silver spread and winked aside and told each son of feats upon the english done ere douglas of the stalwart hand was exiled from his native land the women praised his stately form though wrecked by many a winters storm the youth with awe and wonder saw his strength surpassing natures law thus judged as is their wont the crowd till murmur rose to clamors loud but not a glance from that proud ring of peers who circled round the king with douglas held communion kind or called the banished man to mind no not from those who at the chase once held his side the honored place begirt his board and in the field found safety underneath his shield for he whom royal eyes disown when was his form to courtiers known xxv the monarch saw the gambols flag and bade let loose a gallant stag whose pride the holiday to crown two favorite greyhounds should pull down that venison free and bordeaux wine might serve the archery to dine but lufra whom from douglas side nor bribe nor threat could eer divide the fleetest hound in all the north brave lufra saw and darted forth she left the royal hounds midway and dashing on the antlered prey sunk her sharp muzzle in his flank and deep the flowing lifeblood drank the kings stout huntsman saw the sport by strange intruder broken short came up and with his leash unbound in anger struck the noble hound the douglas had endured that morn the kings cold look the nobles scorn and last and worst to spirit proud had borne the pity of the crowd but lufra had been fondly bred to share his board to watch his bed and oft would ellen lufras neck in maiden glee with garlands deck they were such playmates that with name of lufra ellens image came his stifled wrath is brimming high in darkened brow and flashing eye as waves before the bark divide the crowd gave way before his stride needs but a buffet and no more the groom lies senseless in his gore such blow no other hand could deal though gauntleted in glove of steel xxvi then clamored loud the royal train and brandished swords and staves amain but stern the barons warning back back on your lives ye menial pack beware the douglas yes behold king james the douglas doomed of old and vainly sought for near and far a victim to atone the war a willing victim now attends nor craves thy grace but for his friends thus is my clemency repaid presumptuous lord the monarch said of thy misproud ambitious clan thou james of bothwell wert the man the only man in whom a foe my womanmercy would not know but shall a monarchs presence brook injurious blow and haughty look what ho the captain of our guard give the offender fitting ward break off the sports for tumult rose and yeomen gan to bend their bows break off the sports he said and frowned and bid our horsemen clear the ground xxvii then uproar wild and misarray marred the fair form of festal day the horsemen pricked among the crowd repelled by threats and insult loud to earth are borne the old and weak the timorous fly the women shriek with flint with shaft with staff with bar the hardier urge tumultuous war at once round douglas darkly sweep the royal spears in circle deep and slowly scale the pathway steep while on the rear in thunder pour the rabble with disordered roar with grief the noble douglas saw the commons rise against the law and to the leading soldier said sir john of hyndford twas my blade that knighthood on thy shoulder laid for that good deed permit me then a word with these misguided men xxviii hear gentle friends ere yet for me ye break the bands of fealty my life my honor and my cause i tender free to scotlands laws are these so weak as must require the aid of your misguided ire or if i suffer causeless wrong is then my selfish rage so strong my sense of public weal so low that for mean vengeance on a foe those cords of love i should unbind which knit my country and my kind o no believe in yonder tower it will not soothe my captive hour to know those spears our foes should dread for me in kindred gore are red to know in fruitless brawl begun for me that mother wails her son for me that widows mate expires for me that orphans weep their sires that patriots mourn insulted laws and curse the douglas for the cause o let your patience ward such ill and keep your right to love me still xxix the crowds wild fury sunk again in tears as tempests melt in rain with lifted hands and eyes they prayed for blessings on his generous head who for his country felt alone and prized her blood beyond his own old men upon the verge of life blessed him who stayed the civil strife and mothers held their babes on high the selfdevoted chief to spy triumphant over wrongs and ire to whom the prattlers owed a sire even the rough soldiers heart was moved as if behind some bier beloved with trailing arms and drooping head the douglas up the hill he led and at the castles battled verge with sighs resigned his honored charge xxx the offended monarch rode apart with bitter thought and swelling heart and would not now vouchsafe again through stirling streets to lead his train o lennox who would wish to rule this changeling crowd this common fool hearst thou he said the loud acclaim with which they shout the douglas name with like acclaim the vulgar throat strained for king james their morning note with like acclaim they hailed the day when first i broke the douglas sway and like acclaim would douglas greet if he could hurl me from my seat who oer the herd would wish to reign fantastic fickle fierce and vain vain as the leaf upon the stream and fickle as a changeful dream fantastic as a womans mood and fierce as frenzys fevered blood thou manyheaded monsterthing o who could wish to be thy king xxxi but soft what messenger of speed spurs hitherward his panting steed i guess his cognizance afar what from our cousin john of mar he prays my liege your sports keep bound within the safe and guarded ground for some foul purpose yet unknown most sure for evil to the throne the outlawed chieftain roderick dhu has summoned his rebellious crew tis said in james of bothwells aid these loose banditti stand arrayed the earl of mar this morn from doune to break their muster marched and soon your grace will hear of battle fought but earnestly the earl besought till for such danger he provide with scanty train you will not ride xxxii thou warnst me i have done amiss i should have earlier looked to this i lost it in this bustling day retrace with speed thy former way spare not for spoiling of thy steed the best of mine shall be thy meed say to our faithful lord of mar we do forbid the intended war roderick this morn in single fight was made our prisoner by a knight and douglas hath himself and cause submitted to our kingdoms laws the tidings of their leaders lost will soon dissolve the mountain host nor would we that the vulgar feel for their chiefs crimes avenging steel bear mar our message braco fly he turned his steed my liege i hie yet ere i cross this lily lawn i fear the broadswords will be drawn the turf the flying courser spurned and to his towers the king returned xxxiii ill with king jamess mood that day suited gay feast and minstrel lay soon were dismissed the courtly throng and soon cut short the festal song nor less upon the saddened town the evening sunk in sorrow down the burghers spoke of civil jar of rumored feuds and mountain war of moray mar and roderick dhu all up in arms the douglas too they mourned him pent within the hold where stout earl william was of old and there his word the speaker stayed and finger on his lip he laid or pointed to his dagger blade but jaded horsemen from the west at evening to the castle pressed and busy talkers said they bore tidings of fight on katrines shore at noon the deadly fray begun and lasted till the set of sun thus giddy rumor shook the town till closed the night her pennons brown canto sixth the guardroom i the sun awakening through the smoky air of the dark city casts a sullen glance rousing each caitiff to his task of care of sinful man the sad inheritance summoning revelers from the lagging dance scaring the prowling robber to his den gilding on battled tower the warders lance and warning student pale to leave his pen and yield his drowsy eyes to the kind nurse of men what various scenes and oh what scenes of woe are witnessed by that red and struggling beam the fevered patient from his pallet low through crowded hospital beholds its stream the ruined maiden trembles at its gleam the debtor wakes to thought of gyve and jail the lovelorn wretch starts from tormenting dream the wakeful mother by the glimmering pale trims her sick infants couch and soothes his feeble wail ii at dawn the towers of stirling rang with soldierstep and weaponclang while drums with rolling note foretell relief to weary sentinel through narrow loop and casement barred the sunbeams sought the court of guard and struggling with the smoky air deadened the torches yellow glare in comfortless alliance shone the lights through arch of blackened stone and showed wild shapes in garb of war faces deformed with beard and scar all haggard from the midnight watch and fevered with the stern debauch for the oak tables massive board flooded with wine with fragments stored and beakers drained and cups oerthrown showed in what sport the night had flown some weary snored on floor and bench some labored still their thirst to quench some chilled with watching spread their hands oer the huge chimneys dying brands while round them or beside them flung at every step their harness rung iii these drew not for their fields the sword like tenants of a feudal lord nor owned the patriarchal claim of chieftain in their leaders name adventurers they from far who roved to live by battle which they loved there the italians clouded face the swarthy spaniards there you trace the mountainloving switzer there more freely breathed in mountainair the fleming there despised the soil that paid so ill the laborers toil their rolls showed french and german name and merry englands exiles came to share with illconcealed disdain of scotlands pay the scanty gain all brave in arms well trained to wield the heavy halberd brand and shield in camps licentious wild and bold in pillage fierce and uncontrolled and now by holytide and feast from rules of discipline released iv they held debate of bloody fray fought twixt loch katrine and achray fierce was their speech and mid their words their hands oft grappled to their swords nor sunk their tone to spare the ear of wounded comrades groaning near whose mangled limbs and bodies gored bore token of the mountain sword though neighboring to the court of guard their prayers and feverish wails were heard sad burden to the ruffian joke and savage oath by fury spoke at length upstarted john of brent a yeoman from the banks of trent a stranger to respect or fear in peace a chaser of the deer in host a hardy mutineer but still the boldest of the crew when deed of danger was to do he grieved that day their games cut short and marred the dicers brawling sport and shouted loud renew the bowl and while in merry catch i troll let each the buxom chorus bear like brethren of the brand and spear v soldiers song our vicar still preaches that peter and poule laid a

challenge heard without stayed in midroar the merry shout a soldier to the portal went here is old bertram sirs of ghent and beat for jubilee the drum a maid and minstrel with him come bertram a fleming gray and scarred was entering now the court of guard a harper with him and in plaid all muffled close a mountain maid who backward shrunk to scape the view of the loose scene and boisterous crew what news they roared i only know from noon till eve we fought with foe as wild and as untamable as the rude mountains where they dwell on both sides store of blood is lost nor much success can either boast but whence thy captives friend such spoil as theirs must needs reward thy toil old dost thou wax and wars grow sharp thou now hast gleemaiden and harp get thee an ape and trudge the land the leader of a juggler band vii no comrade no such fortune mine after the fight these sought our line that aged harper and the girl and having audience of the earl mar bade i should purvey them steed and bring them hitherward with speed forbear your mirth and rude alarm for none shall do them shame or harm hear ye his boast cried john of brent ever to strife and jangling bent shall he strike doe beside our lodge and yet the jealous niggard grudge to pay the forester his fee ill have my share howeer it be despite of moray mar or thee bertram his forward step withstood and burning in his vengeful mood old allan though unfit for strife laid hand upon his daggerknife but ellen boldly stepped between and dropped at once the tartan screen so from his morning cloud appears the sun of may through summer tears the savage soldiery amazed as on descended angel gazed even hardy brent abashed and tamed stood half admiring half ashamed viii boldly she spoke soldiers attend my father was the soldiers friend cheered him in camps in marches led and with him in the battle bled not from the valiant or the strong should exiles daughter suffer wrong answered de brent most forward still in every feat of good or ill i shame me of the part i played and thou an outlaws child poor maid an outlaw i by forest laws and merry needwood knows the cause poor rose if rose be living now he wiped his iron eye and brow must bear such age i think as thou hear ye my mates i go to call the captain of our watch to hall there lies my halberd on the floor and he that steps my halberd oer to do the maid injurious part my shaft shall quiver in his heart beware loose speech or jesting rough ye all know john de brent enough ix their captain came a gallant young of tullibardines house he sprung nor wore he yet the spurs of knight gay was his mien his humor light and though by courtesy controlled forward his speech his bearing bold the highborn maiden ill could brook the scanning of his curious look and dauntless eye and yet in sooth young lewis was a generous youth but ellens lovely face and mien ill suited to the garb and scene might lightly bear construction strange and give loose fancy scope to range welcome to stirling towers fair maid come ye to seek a champions aid on palfrey white with harper hoar like errant damosel of yore does thy high quest a knight require or may the venture suit a squire her dark eye flashed she paused and sighed o what have i to do with pride through scenes of sorrow shame and strife a suppliant for a fathers life i crave an audience of the king behold to back my suit a ring the royal pledge of grateful claims given by the monarch to fitzjames x the signet ring young lewis took with deep respect and altered look and said this ring our duties own and pardon if to worth unknown in semblance mean obscurely veiled lady in aught my folly failed soon as the day flings wide his gates the king shall know what suitor waits please you meanwhile in fitting bower repose you till his waking hour female attendance shall obey your hest for service or array permit i marshal you the way but ere she followed with the grace and open bounty of her race she bade her slender purse be shared among the soldiers of the guard the rest with thanks their guerdon took but brent with shy and awkward look on the reluctant maidens hold forced bluntly back the proffered gold forgive a haughty english heart and o forget its ruder part the vacant purse shall be my share which in my barretcap ill bear perchance in jeopardy of war where gayer crests may keep afar with thanks twas all she could the maid his rugged courtesy repaid xi when ellen forth with lewis went allan made suit to john of brent my lady safe o let your grace give me to see my masters face his minstrel i to share his doom bound from the cradle to the tomb tenth in descent since first my sires waked for his noble house their lyres nor one of all the race was known but prized its weal above their own with the chiefs birth begins our care our harp must soothe the infant heir teach the youth tales of fight and grace his earliest feat of field or chase in peace in war our ranks we keep we cheer his board we soothe his sleep nor leave him till we pour our verse a doleful tribute oer his hearse then let me share his captive lot it is my right deny it not little we reck said john of brent we southern men of long descent nor wot we how a name a word makes clansmen vassals to a lord yet kind my noble landlords part god bless the house of beaudesert and but i loved to drive the deer more than to guide the laboring steer i had not dwelt an outcast here come good old minstrel follow me thy lord and chieftain shalt thou see xii then from a rusted iron hook a bunch of ponderous keys he took lighted a torch and allan led through grated arch and passage dread portals they passed where deep within spoke prisoners moan and fetters din through rugged vaults where loosely stored lay wheel and ax and headsmans sword and many an hideous engine grim for wrenching joint and crushing limb by artist formed who deemed it shame and sin to give their work a name they halted at a lowbrowed porch and brent to allan gave the torch while bolt and chain he backward rolled and made the bar unhasp its hold they entered twas a prisonroom of stern security and gloom yet not a dungeon for the day through lofty gratings found its way and rude and antique garniture decked the sad walls and oaken floor such as the rugged days of old deemed fit for captive nobles hold here said de brent thou mayst remain till the leech visit him again strict is his charge the warders tell to tend the noble prisoner well retiring then the bolt he drew and the locks murmurings growled anew roused at the sound from lowly bed a captive feebly raised his head the wondering minstrel looked and knew not his dear lord but roderick dhu for come from where clanalpine fought they erring deemed the chief he sought xiii as the tall ship whose lofty prore shall never stem the billows more deserted by her gallant band amid the breakers lies astrand so on his couch lay roderick dhu and oft his fevered limbs he threw in toss abrupt as when her sides lie rocking in the advancing tides that shake her frame with ceaseless beat yet cannot heave her from her seat oh how unlike her course at sea or his free step on hill and lea soon as the minstrel he could scan what of thy lady of my clan my mother douglas tell me all have they been ruined in my fall ah yes or wherefore art thou here yet speak speak boldly do not fear for allan who his mood well knew was choked with grief and terror too who fought who fled old man be brief some might for they had lost their chief who basely live who bravely died o calm thee chief the minstrel cried ellen is safe for that thank heaven and hopes are for the douglas given the lady margaret too is well and for thy clan on field or fell has never harp of minstrel told of combat fought so true and bold thy stately pine is yet unbent though many a goodly bough is rent xiv the chieftain reared his form on high and fevers fire was in his eye but ghastly pale and livid streaks checkered his swarthy brow and cheeks hark minstrel i have heard thee play with measure bold on festal day in yon lone isle again where neer shall harper play or warrior hear that stirring air that peals on high oer dermids race our victory strike it and then for well thou canst free from thy minstrel spirit glanced fling me the picture of the fight when met my clan the saxon might ill listen till my fancy hears the clang of swords the crash of spears these grates these walls shall vanish then for the fair field of fighting men and my free spirit burst away as if it soared from battle fray the trembling bard with awe obeyed slow on the harp his hand he laid but soon remembrance of the sight he witnessed from the mountains height with what old bertram told at night awakened the full power of song and bore him in career along as shallop launched on rivers side that slow and fearful leaves the side but when it feels the middle stream drives downward swift as lightnings beam xv battle of beal an duine the minstrel came once more to view the eastern ridge of benvenue for ere he parted he would say farewell to lovely loch achray where shall he find in foreign land so lone a lake so sweet a strand there is no breeze upon the fern nor ripple on the lake upon her eyry nods the erne the deer has sought the brake the small birds will not sing aloud the springing trout lies still so darkly glooms yon thunder cloud that swathes as with a purple shroud benledis distant hill is it the thunders solemn sound that mutters deep and dread or echoes from the groaning ground the warriors measured tread is it the lightnings quivering glance that on the thicket streams or do they flash on spear and lance the suns retiring beams i see the daggercrest of mar i see the morays silver star wave oer the cloud of saxon war that up the lake comes winding far to hero boune for battlestrife or bard of martial lay twere worth ten years of peaceful life one glance at their array xvi their lightarmed archers far and near surveyed the tangled ground their center ranks with pike and spear a twilight forest frowned their barded horsemen in the rear the stern battalia crowned no cymbal clashed no clarion rang still were the pipe and drum save heavy tread and armors clang the sullen march was dumb there breathed no wind their crests to shake or wave their flags abroad scarce the frail aspen seemed to quake that shadowed oer their road their vaward scouts no tidings bring can rouse no lurking foe nor spy a trace of living thing save when they stirred the roe the host moves like a deepsea wave where rise no rocks its pride to brave highswelling dark and slow the lake is passed and now they gain a narrow and a broken plain before the trossachs rugged jaws and here the horse and spearmen pause while to explore the dangerous glen dive through the pass the archermen xvii at once there rose so wild a yell within that dark and narrow dell as all the fiends from heaven that fell had pealed the bannercry of hell forth from the pass in tumult driven like chaff before the wind of heaven the archery appear for life for life their flight they ply and shriek and shout and battlecry and plaids and bonnets waving high and broadswords flashing to the sky are maddening in the rear onward they drive in dreadful race pursuers and pursued before that tide of flight and chase how shall it keep its rooted place the spearmens twilight wood down down cried mar your lances down bear back both friend and foe like reeds before the tempests frown that serried grove of lances brown at once lay leveled low and closely shouldering side to side the bristling ranks the onset bide well quell the savage mountaineer as their tinchel cows the game they come as fleet as forest deer well drive them back as tame xviii bearing before them in their course the relics of the archer force like wave with crest of sparkling foam right onward did clanalpine come above the tide each broadsword bright was brandishing like beam of light each targe was dark below and with the oceans mighty swing when heaving to the tempests wing they hurled them on the foe i heard the lances shivering crash as when the whirlwind rends the ash i heard the broadswords deadly clang as if an hundred anvils rang but moray wheeled his rearward rank of horsemen on clanalpines flank my bannerman advance i see he cried their column shake now gallants for your ladies sake upon them with the lance the horsemen dashed among the rout as deer break through the broom their steeds are stout their swords are out they soon make lightsome room clanalpines best are backward borne where where was roderick then one blast upon his buglehorn were worth a thousand men and refluent through the pass of fear the battles tide was poured vanished the saxons struggling spear vanished the mountainsword as bracklinns chasm so black and steep receives her roaring linn as the dark caverns of the deep suck the wild whirlpool in so did the deep and darksome pass devour the battles mingled mass none linger now upon the plain save those who neer shall fight again xix now westward rolls the battles din that deep and doubling pass within minstrel away the work of fate is bearing on its issue wait where the rude trossachs dread defile opens on katrines lake and isle gray benvenue i soon repassed loch katrine lay beneath me cast the sun is set the clouds are met the lowering scowl of heaven an inky hue of livid blue to the deep lake has given strange gusts of wind from mountainglen swept oer the lake then sunk again i heeded not the eddying surge mine eye but saw the trossachs gorge mine ear but heard the sullen sound which like an earthquake shook the ground and spoke the stern and desperate strife that parts not but with parting life seeming to minstrel ear to toll the dirge of many a passing soul nearer it comes the dimwood glen the martial flood disgorged again but not in mingled tide the plaided warriors of the north high on the mountain thunder forth and overhang its side while by the lake below appears the darkning cloud of saxon spears at weary bay each shattered band eyeing their foemen sternly stand their banners stream like tattered sail that flings its fragments to the gale and broken arms and disarray marked the fell havoc of the day xx viewing the mountains ridge askance the saxon stood in sullen trance till moray pointed with his lance and cried behold yon isle see none are left to guard its strand but women weak that wring the hand tis there of yore the robber band their booty wont to pile my purse with bonnetpieces store to him will swim a bowshot oer and loose a shallop from the shore lightly well tame the warwolf then lords of his mate and brood

spring of st fillan is on the summit of a hill near loch earn some miles northeast of the scene of the poem the reason why scott places the harp of the north here is that st fillan was the favorite

bending drooping caledon caledonia poetic name for scotland monans rill scott takes the liberty of assigning a rill to this scottish martyr of the fourth century on his own authority unless his

meaning of nice here what other meanings has the word had highland plunderers the clans inhabiting the region about loch katrine were in the habit of making incursions into the neighboring lowlands to

frequently in medieval romances of chivalry the first is better known as ferran under which name he figures in the orlando furioso of ariosto ascabart plays a part in the old english metrical romance of sir bevis of hampton to whom though more than kindred knew this is a very obscure expression for scott who is usually so careful to make himself clear the meaning seems to be ellen regarded her as a mother though that was more than the actual kinship of the two justified literally knew how to recognize knight of snowdoun james fitzjames as appears later in the poem these were not his true name and title though he was entitled to bear them a harp unseen in modern scotland the bagpipe has altogether taken the place of the harp a writer of the sixteenth century says they the highlanders take great delight to deck their harps with silver and precious stones the poor ones that cannot attain thereunto deck them with crystal they sing verses prettily compounded ie composed containing for the

confesses adding however that saint dunstan certainly did play upon that instrument wailed loud through bothwells bannered hall the minstrel tries to account for the strange way in which his harp gives back mournful sounds instead of the joyous ones he is trying to evoke by calling to ellens mind two other occasions when it behaved similarly one of these was when it foreboded the death of ellens mother the other when it foreboded the exile of the douglasses during the minority of james v for particulars see the introduction on the historical setting of the poem bothwell castle is on the clyde a few miles from glasgow from tweed to spey the tweed is in the extreme southern part the spey in the northern part of scotland lady of the bleeding heart the minstrel calls ellen so because

departure from the island lennox foray lennox is the district south of menteith in the lowlands it was the scene of innumerable forays and cattledrives in holyrood a knight he slew holyrood is the royal castle at edinburgh where the court usually was held it was deemed a heinous and desperate offense to commit an act of blood in the royal residence or its immediate neighborhood since such an act was an indirect violation of the majesty of the king and a breaking of the kings peace it was for this offense that roderick dhu was exiled and compelled to live like an outlaw in his mountain fastness who else dared give notice how skilfully scott manages to give us the relations of the chief characters of the poem to each other and to show that ellens father pursued by the hatred of james v has been given the island shelter in loch katrine by roderick dhu who is about to make his appearance in the story full soon may dispensation sought a papal dispensation was necessary because ellen and roderick dhu were cousins see next note all that a mother could bestow here again the poet takes the indirect way of making clear his point namely that the matron introduced in the first canto is the mother of roderick dhu the phrase an orphan in the wild is in apposition with the following phrase her sisters child ie ellen herself from this it appears that lady margaret is ellens aunt and that roderick dhu is therefore ellens cousin maronnans cell a chapel at the eastern extremity of loch lomond dedicated to the rather obscure saint here named bracklinns thundering wave the reference

were held to possess the property of drawing themselves from their scabbard at the approach of their owners deadly enemy this is the first vague hint which scott gives us as to the real identity of the knight of snowdoun to throw a further glamor of romance about the prophetical weapon he tells us that it was given by fairies to an ancestor of its present owner namely to archibald third duke of angus called tineman loseman because he always lost his men in battle and that this gift was made while archibald was in league with harry hotspur beltane game the sports of may day canna cotton grass

do not pretend to be exhaustive but they should be of practical aid it must be remembered that a long poem is sometimes not very definitely of any one class but combines characteristics of different classes narrative poetry like narrative prose aims primarily to tell a story the epic is the most pretentious kind of narrative poetry it tells in serious verse of the great deeds of a popular hero the iliad the aeneid beowulf paradise lost are important epics the idylls of the king is in the main an epic poem the metrical romance is a rather long story in verse of a less exalted and heroic character than the true epic scotts lady of the lake is a familiar example the verse tale is shorter and likely to be less dignified and serious than the metrical romance the stories in chaucers canterbury tales or burnss tam oshanter may serve as examples the ballad is a narrative poem usually rather short and in such form as to be sung it is distinguished from a song by the fact that it tells a story popular or folk ballads are ancient and of unknown authorship handed down by word of mouth and varied by the transmitters artistic ballads are imitations by known poets of traditional ballads descriptive and reflective poems have characteristics sufficiently indicated by the adjectives in italics the pastoral is a particular kind of descriptive and narrative poem in which the scene is laid in the country the idyll is according to the etymology of its name a little picture tennysons idylls of the king are rather more epic than idyllic in the strict sense of the term the terms idyll and pastoral are not definitely discriminated lyric poetry is poetry expressing personal feeling or emotion and in tuneful form songs are the simplest examples of lyric poetry formal odes such as wordsworths on immortality the most elaborate a lyric does not primarily tell a story but it may imply one or refer to one the elegy is a reflective lyric prompted by the death of some one tennysons in memoriam is a collection of elegiac lyrics a hymn is a religious lyric dramatic poetry presents human life in speech and action a tragedy is a serious drama which presents its hero in a losing struggle ending in his death a comedy does not end in death and is usually cheerful and humorous the dramatic monologue is a poem in which a dramatic situation is presented or perhaps a story is told by one speaker satire in verse aims to correct abuses to ridicule persons etc didactic poetry has the purpose of teaching transcribers note the following errors have been corrected in this
