who says that i am dead knows nought at all i am that is two mice within redwall the warrior sleeps twixt hall and cavern hole i am that is take on my mighty role look for the sword in moonlight streaming forth at night when days first hour reflects the north from oer the threshold seek and you will see am that is my sword will wield for me it was the start of the summer of the late rose mossflower country shimmered gently in a peaceful haze bathing delicately at each dewladen dawn blossoming through high sunny noontides languishing in each crimsontinted twilight that heralded the soft darkness of june nights redwall stood foursquare along the marches of the old south border flanked on two sides by mossflower woods shaded depths the other half of the abbey overlooked undulating sweeps of meadowland its ancient gate facing the long dusty road on the western perimeter from above it resembled some fabulous dusky jewel fallen between a green mantle of light silk and dark velvet the first mice had built the abbey of red sandstone quarried from pits many miles away in the northeast the abbey building was covered across its south face by that type of ivy known as virginia creeper the onset of autumn would turn the leaves into a cape of fiery hue thus adding further glory to the name and legend of redwall abbey book one the wall matthias cut a comical little figure as he wobbled his way along the cloisters with his large sandals flipflopping and his tail peeping from beneath the baggy folds of an oversized novices habit he paused to gaze upwards at the cloudless blue sky and tripped over the enormous sandals hazelnuts scattered out upon the grass from the rush basket he was carrying unable to stop he went tumbling cowl over tail bump the young mouse squeaked in dismay he rubbed tenderly at his damp snub nose while slowly taking stock of where he had landed directly at the feet of abbot mortimer immediately matthias scrambled about on all fours hastily trying to stuff nuts back into the basket as he muttered clumsy apologies avoiding the stern gaze of his elder er sorry father abbot i tripped ysee trod on my abbot father habit oh dear i mean the father abbot blinked solemnly over the top of his glasses matthias again what a young buffoon of a mouse only the other day he had singed old brother methuselahs whiskers while lighting candles the elders stern expression softened he watched the little novice rolling about on the grass grappling with large armfuls of the smooth hazelnuts which constantly seemed to escape his grasp shaking his old grey head yet trying to hide a smile abbot mortimer bent and helped to gather up the fallen nuts oh matthias matthias my son he said wearily when will you learn to take life a little slower to walk with dignity and humility how can you ever hope to be accepted as a mouse of red wall when you are always dashing about grinning from whisker to tail like a mad rabbit matthias tossed the last of the hazelnuts into the basket and stood awkwardly shuffling his large sandals in the grass how could he say aloud what was in his heart the abbot put his paw around the young mouses shoulder sensing his secret yearnings for he had ruled redwall wisely over a great number of years and gained much experience of mouselife he smiled down at his young charge and spoke kindly to him come with me matthias it is time we talked together a curious thrush perching in a gnarled pear tree watched the two figures make their way at a sedate pace in the direction of great hall one clad in the dark greenybrown of the order the other garbed in the lighter green of a novice they conversed earnestly in low tones thinking what a clever bird he was the thrush swooped down on the basket that had been left behind twisters the basket contained only hard nuts locked tight within their shells feigning lack of interest lest any other birds had been witness to his silly mistake he began whistling jauntily a few bars of his melodious summer song strolling nonchalantly over to the cloister walls in search of snails it was cool inside great hall sunlight flooded down in slanting rainbowhued shafts from the high narrow stainedglass windows a million colored dustmotes danced and swirled as the two mice trod the ancient stone floor the father abbot halted in front of the wall on which hung a long tapestry this was the pride and joy of red wall the oldest part had been woven by the founders of the abbey but each successive generation had added to it thus the tapestry was not only a priceless treasure it was also a magnificent chronicle of early redwall history the abbot studied the wonderment in matthiass eyes as he asked him a question the answer to which the wise mouse already knew what are you looking at my son matthias pointed to the figure woven into the tapestry it was a heroiclooking mouse with a fearless smile on his handsome face clad in armor he leaned casually on an impressive sword while behind him foxes wildcats and vermin fled in terror the young mouse gazed in admiration oh father abbot he sighed if only i could be like martin the warrior he was the bravest most courageous mouse that ever lived the abbot sat down slowly on the cool stone floor resting his back against the wall listen to what i say matthias you have been like a son to me ever since you first came to our gates as an orphaned woodland mouse begging to be taken in come sit by me and i will try to explain to you what our order is all about we are mice of peace oh i know that martin was a warrior mouse but those were wilddays when strength was needed the strength of a champion such as martin he arrived here in the deep winter when the founders were under attack from many foxes vermin and a great wildcat so fierce a fighter was martin that he faced the enemy singlepawed driving them mercilessly far from mossflower during the rout martin fought a great battle against overwhelming odds he emerged victorious after slaying the wildcat with his ancient sword which became famous throughout the land but in the last bloody combat martin was seriously wounded he lay injured in the snow until the mice found him they brought him back to the abbey and cared for his hurts until he regained his strength then something seemed to come over him he was transformed by what could only be called a mouse miracle martin forsook the way of the warrior and hung up his sword that was when our order found its true vocation all the mice took a solemn vow never to harm another living creature unless it was an enemy that sought to harm our order by violence they vowed to heal the sick care for the injured and give aid to the wretched and impoverished so was it written and so has it been through all the ages of mousekind since today we are a deeply honored and highly respected society anywhere we go even far beyond mossflower we are treated with courtesy by all creatures even predators will not harm a mouse who wears the habit of our order they know he or she is one who will heal and give aid it is an unwritten law that redwall mice can go anywhere through any territory and pass unharmed at all times we must live up to this it is our way bur very life as the abbot spoke so his voice increased in volume and solemnity matthias sat under his stem gaze completely humbled abbot mortimer stood and put a wrinkled old paw lightly on the small head right between the velvety ears now drooping with shame once more the abbots heart softened towards the little mouse poor matthias alas for your ambitions the day of the warrior is gone my son we live in peaceful times thank heaven and you need only think of obeying me your abbot and doing as you are bidden in time to come when i am long gone to my rest you will think back to this day and bless my memory for then you will be a true member of redwall come now my young friend cheer up it is the summer of the late rose there are many many days of warm sun ahead of us go back and get your basket of hazelnuts tonight we have a great feast to celebrate my golden jubilee as abbot when youve taken the nuts to the kitchen have a special task for you yes indeed ill need some fine fish for the table get your rod and line tell brother alf that he is to take you fishing in the small boat thats what young mice like doing isnt it who knows you may land a fine trout or some sticklebacks run along now young one happiness filled matthias from tail to whiskers as he bobbed a quick bow to his superior and shuffled off smiling benignly the abbot watched him go little rascal he must have a word with the almoner to see if some sandals could be found that were the right fit for matthias small wonder the poor mouse kept tripping up the high warm sun shone down on cluny the scourge cluny was coming he was big and tough an evil rat with ragged fur and curved jagged teeth he wore a black eyepatch his eye had been torn out in battle with a pike cluny had lost an eye the pike had lost its life some said that cluny was a portuguese rat others said he came from the jungles far across the wide oceans nobody knew for sure cluny was a bilge rat the biggest most savage rodent that ever jumped from ship to shore he was black with grey and pink scars all over his huge sleek body from the tip of his wet nose up past his green and yellow slitted eye across both his mean tattered ears down the length of his heavy verminridden back to the enormous whiplike tail which had earned him his title cluny the scourge now he rode on the back of the hay wagon with his five hundred followers a mighty army of rats sewer rats tavern rats water rats dockside rats clunys army fearing yet following him redtooth his secondincommand carried a long pole this was clunys personal standard the skull of a ferret was fixed at its top cluny had killed the ferret he feared no living thing wildeyed with the terror of rat smell in its nostrils the horse plunged ahead without any driver where the hay cart was taking him was of little concern to cluny straight on the panicked horse galloped past the milestone lodged in the earth at the roadside heedless of the letters graven in the stone redwall abbey fifteen miles cluny spat over the edge of the cart at two young rabbits playing in a field tasty little things a pity the cart hadnt stopped yet he thought the high warm sun shone down on cluny the scourge cluny was a god of war cluny was coming nearer beneath the great hall of redwall candles burned bright in their sconces this was the cavern hole xf the mice what a night it was going to be between them matthias and brother alf had caught and landed a fullygrown grayling they had fought and played the big fish for nearly two hours finally wading into the shallows and dragging it to the bank it was nearly two pounds in weight a tribute to brother alps angling skills combined with the youthful muscles of matthias and their joint enthusiasm constance the badger had to be called gripping the fish in her strong jaws she followed the two mice to the abbey kitchen and delivered the catch for them then she made her farewells they would see her at the jubilee feast that evening along with many other mossflower residents who had been invited to share the festivities brother alf and matthias stood proudly beside their catch amid the culinary hustle and bustle until they were noticed by friar hugo busy as he was the enormously fat hugo stopped what he was doing wiping the perspiration from his brow with a dandelion that he held with his tail he waddled about inspecting the fish hmm nice shiny scales bright eyes beautifully fresh friar hugo smiled so joyfully that his face disappeared amid deep dimples he shook alf by the paw and clapped matthias heartily on the back as he called out between chuckles bring the white gooseberry wine fetch me some rosemary thyme beechnuts and honey quickly and now friends now he squeaked waving the dandelion wildly with his tail i hugo wiu create a grayling a la redwall such as will melt in the mouth of mice fresh cream i need lots of fresh cream bring some mint leaves too they had left friar hugo ranting on delirious in his joy as they both went off to bathe and clean up combing whiskers curling tails shining noses and the hundred and one other grooming tasks that redwatl mice always performed in preparation for an epic feast the rafters of cavern hole rang to the excited buzz and laughter of the assembled creatures hedgehogs moles squirrels woodland creatures and mice of all kinds fieldmice hedgemice dormice even a family of poor little churchmice kindly helpers scurried about making everybody welcome hello there mrs churchmouse sit the children down ill get them some raspberry cordial why mr bankvole so nice to see you hows the back better now good here try a drop of this peach and elderberry brandy matthiass young head was in a whirl he could not remember being so happy in all his life winifred the otter nudged him i say matthias wheres this giant grayling that you and old alf hooked by the claw i wish that i could land a beauty like that nearly a twopounder wasnt it matthias swelled with pride such praise and from the champion fisher herself an otter tim and tess the twin churchmouse babes felt matthiass strong arm muscles and giggled aloud in admiration he helped to serve them two portions of apple and mint ice cream such nice little twins was it only three months ago that he had helped sister stephanie to get them over tail rickets how they had grown abbot mortimer sat in his carved willow chair beaming thanks as one by one the new arrivals laid their simple home made gifts at his feet an acorn cup from a squirrel fishbone combs from the otters mossy bark sandals made by the moles and many more fine presents too numerous to mention the abbot shook his head in amazement even more guests were arriving he beckoned friar hugo to his side a whispered conference was held matthias could only hear snatches of the convocation dont worry father abbot there will be enough for all how are the cellar stocks hugo enough to flood the abbey pond father and nuts we must not run short of nuts you name them weve got diem even candied chestnuts and acorncrunch we could feed the district for a year dairy produce oh that ive got a cheddar cheese that four badgers couldnt roll plus ten other varieties good good thank you hugo oh we must thank alf and young matthias for mat magnificent fish what fine anglers they are theres enough to keep the entire abbey going for a week excellent mice well done matthias blushed to his tails end the otters the otters a loud jolly cry went up as three otters in clown costumes came bounding in such acrobatics they tumbled balanced and gyrated cavorting comically across the laden tabletops without upsetting as much as a single sultana they ended up hanging from the rafters by a strand of ivy to wild applause ambrose spike the hedgehog did his party piece he amazed everyone with his feats of legerdemain eggs were taken from a squirrels ear a young mouses tail stood up and danced like a snake the incredible vanishingshell trick was performed in front of a group of little harvest mice who kept squeaking hes got it hidden in his prickles but had he ambrose made a few mysterious passes and produced the shell straight out of the mouth of an awestruck infant mouse was it magic of course it was all activity ceased as the great joseph bell tolled out eight oclock from the abbey belfry silently all the creatures filed to their allotted places they stood reverently behind the seats with heads lowered abbot mortimer rose and solemnly spread his paws wide encompassing the festive board he said the grace fur and whisker tooth and claw all who enter by our door nuts and herbs leaves and fruits berries tubers plants and roots silver fish whose life we take only for a meal to make this was followed by a loud and grateful amen there was a mass clattering of chairs and scraping of forms as everyone was seated matthias found himself next to tim and tess on one paw and cornflower heldmouse on the other cornflower was a quiet young mouse but undoubtedly very pretty she had the longest eyelashes matthias had ever seen the brightest eyes the softest fur the whitest teeth matthias fumbled with a piece of celery and selfconsciously turned to see if the twins were coping adequately you never could tell with these baby churchmice brother alf remarked that friar hugo had excelled himself as course after course was brought to the table tender freshwater shrimp garnished with cream and rose leaves devilled barley pearls in acorn puree apple and carrot chews marinated cabbage stalks steeped in creamed white turnip with nutmeg a chorus of oohs and ahs greeted the arrival of six mice pushing a big trolley it was the grayling wreaths of aromatic steam drifted around cavern hole the fish had been baked to perfection friar hugo entered with a slight swagger added to his ungainly waddle he swept off his chefs cap with his tail and announced in a somewhat pompous squeak milord abbot honored guests from mossflower area and members of the abbey ahem i wish to present my piece de resistance oh get on with it hugo after some icy staring about to detect the culprit and several smothered sniggers from around the room the little fat friar puffed himself up once more and declaimed firmly grayling a la redwall polite but eager applause rippled round as hugo sliced the fish and placed the first steaming portion on to a platter with suitable dignity he presented it to the abbot who thanked him graciously all eyes were on the father abbot he took a dainty fork loaded precariously with steaming fish carefully he transferred it from plate to mouth chewing delicately he turned his eyes upwards then closed them whiskers atwitch jaws working steadily munching away his tail curled up holding a napkin which neatly wiped his mouth the abbots eyes reopened he beamed like the sun on midsummer morn quite wonderful perfectly exquisite friar hugo you are truly my champion chef please serve our guests your masterwork any further speech was drowned by hearty cheers cluny was in a foul temper he snarled viciously the horse had stopped from sheer exhaustion he hadnt wanted that some inner devil persuaded him that he had not yet reached his destination clunys one eye slitted evilly from the depths of the hay cart the rodents of the warlords army watched their master they knew him well enough to stay clear of him in this present mood he was violent unpredictable skullface cluny snapped there was a rustle in the hay a villainous head popped up aye chief dyou want me clunys powerful tail shot out and dragged the unfortunate forward skullface cringed as sharp dirty claws dug into his fur cluny nodded at the horse jump on that things back sharpish give it a good bite thatll get the lazy brute moving again skullface swallowed nervously and licked his dry lips but chief it might bite me back swish crack cluny wielded his mighty tail as if it were a bullwhip his victim screamed aloud with pain as the scourge lashed his thin bony back mutiny insubordination cluny roared by the teeth of hell ill flay you into mangy dollrags skullface scurried over on to the drivers seat yelling with pain no more dont whip me chief look im going to doit hold tight to the rigging back there cluny shouted to his horde skullface performed a frantic leap he landed on the horses back the terrified animal did not wait for the rat to bite as soon as it felt the loathsome scratching weight descend on its exposed haunches it gave a loud panicked whinny and bucked spurred on by the energy of fright it careered off like a runaway juggernaut skullface had time for just one agonized scream before he fell the ironshod cartwheels rolled over him he lay in a red mist of death the life ebbing from his broken body the last thing he saw before darkness claimed him was the sneering visage of cluny the scourge roaring from the jolting backboard tell the devil cluny sent you skullface they were on the move again cluny was getting nearer down in cavern hole the great feast had slackened off so had a lot of belts redwall mice and their guests sat back replete there were still great quantities of food uneaten abbot mortimer whispered in friar hugos ear friar i want you to pack up a large sack with food hazelnuts cheese bread cakes anything you see fit give it to mrs churchmouse as secretly as you can without attracting attention poverty is an ugly specter when a mousewife has as many mouths to feed as she does oh and be sure that her husband doesnt suspect what you are doing john churchmouse may be poor but he is also proud i fear he might not accept charitable gifts hugo nodded knowingly and waddled off to do his abbots bidding cornflower and matthias had become quite friendly they were young mice of the same age though their temperaments were different they found something in common an interest in tim and tess the twin churchmice they had passed a pleasant evening joking and playing games with the little creatures tess had clambered on to matthiass lap and fallen asleep whereupon baby tim did likewise in the velvety fur of cornflower she smiled at matthias as she stroked tims small head ah bless their little paws dont they look peaceful matthias nodded contentedly in agreement colin vole tittered aloud and remarked rather foolishly ooh would you look at matthias an cornflower there anursin those two babbies like they was an old wedded couple well crumble my bank brother alf reprimanded him sharply here now you keep a latch on that silly tongue of yours colin vole dont you know that someday matthias will be a redwall mouse and dont let me hear you slandering young cornflower shes a decent mouse from a good family mark my words master vole i could say a thing or two to your mum and dad only last evening i saw you playing catch the bulrush with that young harvest mouse what was her name now colin vole blushed until his nose went dry he flounced off swishing his tail muttering about going outside to take die air matthias caught a nod and a glance from the abbot excusing himself to cornflower he deposited the sleeping tess gently upon his chair and went across to him ah matthias my son here you are did you enjoy my jubilee feast yes thank you father matthias replied good good chuckled the abbot now i was going to ask brother alf or edmund to go on a special errand but they are no longer young mice and both look quite weary at this late hour so i thought might ask my chief graytingcatcher to carry out this special task for me matthias could not help standing a bit taller say the word and im your mouse sir the abbot leaned forward and spoke confidentially do you see the churchmouse family well its such a long way back home for them on foot good heavens and there are so many of them i thought it would be a splendid idea if you were to drive them home in the abbey cart along with any others going that way constance badger would pull the cart of course while you could act as guide and bodyguard take a good stout staff with you matthias the young mouse needed no second bidding drawing himself up to his full height he saluted in a smart military fashion leave it to me father abbot old constance is a bit slowthinking ill take complete responsibility the abbot shook with silent laughter as he watched matthias march off with a soldierlike swagger flip flop flip flop he tripped and fell flat on his tail oh dear ill have to get that young mouse some sandals that arent so big the abbot said to himself for the second time that day well what a stroke of luck fancy cornflowers family living so close to the churchmouse brood matthias was only too glad to offer them a lift home would miss cornflower like to sit next to him she most certainly would cornflowers parents sat inside the cart her mum helping mrs churchmouse with the little ones while her dad chatted away with john churchmouse as they shared a pipe of old bracken twist friar hugo came out and dumped a bulky sack next to mrs churchmouse abbot says to thank you for the loan of bowls and tablecloths maam the fat friar gave her a huge wink all comfy back there called matthias right off we go constance the big badger trundled the cart away as they called their goodnights she nodded at methuselah the ancient gatekeeper mouse as the cart rolled out into the road a sliver of golden moon looked down from a starpierced summer night matthias gazed upwards feeling as if he were slowly turning with the silent earth peace was all about him the baby mice inside the cart whimpered fitfully in their small secret dreams constance ambled slowly along as though she were out on a nighttime stroll pulling no weight at all the stout ash staff lay forgotten on the footboard cornflower dozed against matthiass shoulder she could hear the gentle lull of her fathers voice and that of john churchmouse blending with the hum of nocturnal insects from the meadow and hedges on this balmy summer night the summer of the late rose cornflower turned the words over in her mind dreamily thinking of the old rambler that bloomed in the abbey gardens normally it was in full red flower by now but this year for some unknown reason it had chosen to flower late it was covered in dormant young rosebuds even now well into june a thing that happened only infrequently and usually heralded an extralong hot summer old methuselah could only remember three other such summers in his long lifetime accordingly he had advised that it be marked on the calendar and in the abbey chronicles as the summer of the late rose cornflowers head sank lower in sleep the old cart rolled on gently down the long dusty road they were now over halfway to the ruined church of st ninian where john churchmouse lived as had his father grandfather and greatgrandfather before him matthias had fallen into a deep slumber even constance was unable to stop her eyelids drooping she went slower and slower it was as if the little cart and its occupants were caught in the magic spell of an enchanted summer night suddenly and without warning they were roused by the thunder of hooves nobody could determine which direction the sound was coming from it seemed to fill the very air about them as it gathered momentum the ground began trembling with the rumbling noise some sixth sense warned constance to get off the road to a hiding place the powerful badger gave a mighty heave her blunt claws churned the roadside soil as she propelled the cart through a gap in the hawthorn hedge down to the slope of the ditch where she dug her paws in holding the cart still and secure while john churchmouse and cornflowers father jumped out and wedged the wheels firmly with stones matthias gasped with shock as a giant horse galloped past its mane streaming out eyes rolling in panic it was towing a hay cart which bounced wildly from side to side matthias could see rats among the hay but these were no ordinary rats they were huge ragged rodents bigger than any he had ever seen their heavy tattooed arms waved a variety of weapons pikes knives spears and long rusty cutlasses standing boldly on the backboard of the hay cart was the biggest fiercest most evillooking rat that ever slunk out of a nightmare in one claw he grasped a long pole with a ferrets head spiked to it while in the other was his thick enormous tail which he cracked like a whip laughing madly and yelling strange curses he swayed to and fro skillfully as horse and wagon clattered off down the road into the night as suddenly as they had come they were gone matthias walked out into the road staff in hand stray wisps of hay drifted down behind him his legs trembled uncontrollably constance hauled the abbey cart back on to the road cornflower was helping her mother and mrs churchmouse to calm the little ones tears of fright together they stood in the cart tracks amid the settling dust did you see that i saw it but i dont believe it what in heaven was it what in hell more like all those rats such big ones too aye and that one on the back he looked like the devil himself seeing matthias still stunned by what had happened constance took over the leadership she wheeled the cart around i think wed best head back for the abbey she said firmly father abbotu want to know about this straightaway knowing that the badger was far more experienced than himself matthias assumed the role of secondincommand right cornflower get in the cart and take charge of the mothers and babies he said mr fieldmouse mr churchmouse up front with constance please silently the mice did as ordered the cart moved off with matthias positioned on the back providing a rearguard the young mouse gripped his staff tightly his back to his charges facing down the road in the direction the hay cart had taken the horse had gotten away safely it was the hay cart that suffered most damage bolting recklessly from side to side down the road the blinkered animal failed to see the twin stone gateposts on its right skidding crazily the cart smashed into the uprights there was a loud splintering of shafts as the horse careered onwards trailing in its wake reins tracers and shattered timber his lightning reflexes serving him well cluny leaped dear he landed catlike on all fours asthe hay can upended in the roadside ditch its buckled wheels spinning awkwardly feeling braced after his mad ride and the subsequent narrow escape cluny strode to the ditchs edge the distressed cries of those trapped beneath the cart reached his ears he spat contemptuously narrowing his one good eye come on get up out of there you cringing load of catsmeat he bellowed redtooth darkclaw report to me or ill have your skulls for skittles clunys two henchrats pulled themselves from the ditch shaking their heads dazedly crack slash the whiplike tail brought them swiftly to his side threeleg and scratch are dead chief dead as dirt the cart crushed em chief stupid fools snarled cluny serves them right what about the rest old wormtail has lost a paw some of the others are really hurt cluny sneered aah theyll get over it and suffer worse by the time im done with them theyre getting too fat and sluggish by the tripes theyd not last five minutes in a storm at sea come on you deadandalive ragbags get up here and gather round rats struggled from the ditch and the cart frantic to obey the harsh command as quickly as possible they crowded about the undamaged gatepost which their leader had chosen as a perch none dared to cry or complain about their hurts who could predict what mood the warlord was in right cock your lugs up and listen to me cluny snarled first weve got to find out where we have docked lets take a bearing on this place redtooth held up his claw the church of st ninian chief it says so on the notice board over yonder well no matter cluny snapped itll do as a berth until we find something better fangburn cheesethief here chief scout the area see if you can find a better lodging for us than this heap of rubble trail back to the west i think we passed a big place on the way aye aye chief frogblood scumnose chief take fifty soldiers and see if you can round up any rats that know the lie of the land get big strong rats but bring along weasels stoats and ferrets too theyll do at a pinch mind now dont stand for arguments smash their dens up so they wont have homes to worry about if any refuse to join up then kill them there and then understood ah clear chief ragear mangefur take twenty rats and forage for supplies the rest of you get inside the church redtooth darkclaw check the armor see if there are things about that we can use as weapons iron spike railings theres usually enough of them around a churchyard jump to it cluny had arrived matthias had never stayed up all night in his life he was just a bit tired but strangely excited great events seemed to have been set in motion by his news immediately upon being informed of the hay cart incident the abbot had insisted upon calling a special council meeting of all redwall creatures once again cavern hole was packed to the doors but this time it was for a purpose very different from the feast constance and matthias stood in front of the council of elders all about them was a hum of whispers and muttering abbot mortimer called order by ringing a small bell pay attention everyone constance and matthias would you please tell the council what you saw tonight on the road to st ninians as clearly as they could the badger and the young mouse related the incident of the ratinfested hay cart the council began questioning them rats you say matthias what type of rat inquired sister ctemence big ones matthias replied though im afraid i couldnt say what kind they were or where they had come from what about you constance well i remember that my old grandad once knew a sea tat she answered going by his description id say thats what they looked like to me and how many would you say there were of these rats father abbot asked couldnt say for sure father abbot there must have been hundreds matthias oh yes father id agree with constance at least four hundred did you notice anything else about them constance indeed i did father abbot my badger senses told me right off that these were very bad and evil rats the badgers statement caused uproar and shouts of nonsense pure speculation and thats right give a rat a bad name without even thinking matthias raised a paw and shouted aloud constance is right i could feel it myself there was one huge rat with a ferrets skull on a pole i got a good look at him it was like seeing some horrible monster in the silence that followed the abbot rose and confronted matthias stooping slightly he stared into the young mouses bright eyes think carefully my son was there anything special you noticed about this rat matthias thought for a moment everyone was watching him he was much bigger than the others father what else think matthias i remember he only had one eye right or left left i think yes it was the left father now can you recall anything about his tail i certainly can matthias squeaked it must have been the longest tail of any rat alive he held it in his claw as if it were a whip the abbot paced up and down before turning to the assembly twice in my lifetime i have heard travelers speak of this rat he bears a name that a fox would be afraid to whisper in the darkness of midnight cluny the scourge a deathly hush fell upon the creatures in cavern hole cluny the scourge surely not he was only some kind of folk legend a warning used by mothers when youngsters were fractious or disobedient go to sleep or cluny will get you eat up your dinner or cluny will come come in this instant or ill tell cluny most creatures didnt even know what cluny was he was just some sort of bogey that lived in bad dreams and the dark corners of imagination the silence was broken by scornful snorts and derisive laughter furry elbows nudged downy ribs mice were beginning to smile from sheer relief cluny the scourge indeed feeling slightly abashed matthias and constance looked pleadingly towards the abbot for support abbot mortimers old face was stem as he shook the bell vigorously for silence mice of redwall i see there are those among you who doubt the word of your abbot the quiet but authoritative words caused an embarrassed shuffling from the council elders brother joseph stood up and cleared his throat ahem er good father abbot we all respect your word and look to you for guidance but really i mean sister clemence stood up smiling she spread her paws wide perhaps cluny is coming to get us for staying up late a roar of laughter greeted the ironic words constances back hairs bristled she gave an angry growl followed by a fierce bark the mice huddled together with fright nobody had ever seen a snarling angry badger at a council meeting before they could recover constance was up on her hind legs having her say ive never seen such a pack of emptyheaded ninnies you should all be ashamed of yourselves giggling like silly little otter cubs that have caught a beetle i never thought id live to see the elders of redwall acting in this way constance hunched her heavy shoulders and glared about with a ferocity that set them trembling now you listen to me take heed of what your father abbot has to say the next creature who utters one squeak will answer to me understand the badger bowed low in a dignified manner gesturing with her massive blunt paw the floor is yours father abbot thank you constance my good and faithful friend the abbot murmured he looked about him shaking his head gravely i have little more to say on the subject but as i see that you still need convincing here is my proposal we will send two mice out to relieve the gatehouse let me see yes brothers rufus and george would you kindly go and take over from brother methuselah please send him in here to me tell him to bring the travelers record volumes not the present issue but the old editions which were used in past years rufus and george both solidlooking sensible mice took their leave with a formal bow to the abbot through a high slitted window matthias could see the rosypink and gold fingers of dawn stealing down to cavern hole as the candles began to flicker and smoke into stubs all in the space of a night events had moved from festivity to a crisis and he matthias had taken a major role in both first the big grayling then the sighting of the cart large happenings for a small mouse old brother methuselah had kept the abbey records for as long as any creature could remember it was his lifes work and consuming passion besides the official chronicle of redwall he also kept his own personal volume full of valuable information traveling creatures migratory birds wandering foxes rambling squirrels and garrulous hares they all stopped and chatted with the old mouse partaking of his hospitality never dreaming of hurting him in any way methuselah had the gift of tongues he could understand any creature even a bird he was an extraordinary old mouse who lived with the company of his volumes in the solitude of the gatehouse seated in the father abbots own chair methuselah took his spectacles from a mossbark case carefully perching them cm the bridge of his nose all gathered around to hear as he opened a record book and spoke in a squeak barely above a whisper hmm hmm me lord abbot cedric it is cedric isnt it oh botheration youll be the new abbot mortimer the one who came after cedric oh dear me i see so many of diem come and go you know hmm hmm me lord abbot mortimer and members of redwall i refer to a record of winter six years back here the ancient mouse took a while to leaf through the pages hmm ah yes here it is late in november year of the small sweet chestnut from a frozen sparrowhawk come down from the far north peculiar chap spoke with a strange accent i repaired his right wing pinfeather news of a mine disaster caused by a large savage sea rat with an extraordinary tail it seems that this rat cluny they called him wanted to settle his army in the mine the badgers and other creatures who owned the mine drove them out cluny returned by night and with his band of rats gnawed away and undermined much of the wooden shoring this caused the mine to collapse the next day killing the owners brother methuselah closed the volume and looked over his glasses at the assembly i have no need to read further i can recite other misdeeds from memory as the hordes of cluny the scourge have moved southwards over the past six years i have gathered intelligence of other incidents a farmhouse set alight later that same year piglets an entire litter of them eaten alive by rats sickness and disease spread through livestock herds by clunys army there was even a report brought to me two years ago by a town dog an army of rats stampeded a herd of cows through a village causing chaos and much destruction methuselah halted and blinked over his spectacles and you dare doubt the word of our abbot that cluny the scourge exists what idiotic mice you are to be sure methuselahs words caused widespread consternation there was much agitated nibbling of paws nobody could doubt he spoke the truth he was already old and wise when the most elderly among them was a blind hairless mite puling and whimpering for a feed from its mother oh my whiskers what a mess hadnt we better pack up and move maybe cluny will spare us oh dear oh dear what shall we do matthias sprang to the middle of the floor brandishing his staff in a way that surprised even him do he cried ill tell you what well do well be ready the abbot could not help shaking his head in admiration it seemed that young matthias had hidden depths why thank you matthias he said i could not have put it better myself thats exactly what we will do well be ready cluny the scourge was having nightmares he had lain down in the churchmouses bed for a wellearned rest while his army was going about its allotted tasks he should never have tried to sleep on an empty stomach but weariness overcame his hunger in clunys dream everything was shrouded in a red mist the cries of ms victims rang out as barns blazed and ships foundered on a stormy red sea cattle bellowed in pain as he battled with the pike that had taken his eye the warlord thrashed about killing conquering and laying waste to all in his dream then the phantom figure appeared at first it seemed a small thing a mouse in fact dressed in a long hooded robe cluny did not relish meeting with it he could not tell why but the mouse kept getting closer to him for the first time in his life he turned and ran cluny went like a bat out of hell glancing back he saw all the carnage death and misery he had caused in his career the big rat laughed insanely and ran faster on and on past scenes of desolation and destruction wreaked by him cluny die scourge roating through the red mists he could still see die strange mouse hard on his heels cluny felt himself filled with hatred for his pursuer it seemed to have grown larger its eyes were cold and grim deep inside cluny knew that even he could not frighten this oddlygarbed mouse now it was wielding a large bright sword an ancient weapon of terrible beauty the battlescarred blade had a word written upon it that he could not make out sweat dripped from clunys claws like stinging acid he stumbled the strange figure was closer it had grown into a giant clunys lungs felt as if they were bursting he realized that he had slowed up and the mouse was getting closer he tried to put on an extra burst of speed but his legs would not obey they ran more and more slowly more and more heavily cluny cursed aloud at his leaden limbs he saw he was trapped in deep icy mud for the first time he knew the meaning of mindless fear and panic he turned slowly too late the enemy was upon him he was rooted helpless to the spot the avenging mouse swung the sword up high a million lights flashed from its deadly blade as it struck bong the loud toll of the distant joseph bell brought cluny whirling back from the realms of nightmare to cold reality he shivered wiping the sweat from his fur with a shaky daw saved by the bell he was puzzled what did the fearful dream mean cluny had never been one to put his faith in omens but this dream it had been so lifelike and vivid that he shuddered a timid paw tapping on the door snapped cluny from his reverie with a start it was ragear and mangefur his scavengers they slunk into the room each trying to hide behind the other knowing that the poor results of their search were likely to incur the chiefs wrath their assumption was correct clunys baleful eye watched them as his long flexible tail sorted through the paltry offerings which had dropped from their claws a few dead beetles two large earthworms some unidentifiable vegetation and the pitiful carcass of a longdead sparrow cluny smiled at ragear and mangefur with a sigh of relief they grinned back at him the chief was in a good mood at lightning speed the big rats claws shot out and grabbed them both cruelly by the ears the stupid henchrats yowled piteously as they were lifted bodily from the floor and swung to and fro in a fit of rage cluny bashed their heads together half senseless they were hurled towards the doorway with his angry words ringing in their skulls beetles worms rotten sparrows get me meat tender young red meat next time you bring me rubbish like this ill spit the pair of you and have you roasted in your own juice is that clear mangefur pointed an accusing claw at his companion please chief it was ragears fault if wed gone across the fields instead of up the road dont believe that big fat liar chief t was him who suggested going up the road not me get out the scavengers dashed off bumping clumsily into each other with panic as they tried to get through the door together cluny slumped back on the bed and snorted impatiently frogblood and scumnose were next to report they bore news that cheered cluny up somewhat theyd obtained over a hundred new recruits mainly rats but with a good scattering of ferrets and weasels and the odd stoat there had been some who needed convincing these had been pressganged by a savage beating from frogblood coupled with the threat of horrible death they were soon convinced that the wisest course was to enlist in clunys horde others were hungry nomads only too willing to join up with the infamous cluny they were greedy for plunder and booty and pleased to be on what they were sure would be the winning side lined up in the churchyard the recruits were supplied with weaponry by redtooth and darkclaw impassively they stood in ranks awaiting the warlords inspection cluny nodded his approval scurvy rats hungry ferrets sly weasels bad stoats exactly what he needed read em the articles redtooth he snapped redtooth swaggered back and forth on the churchyard paving as he recited the formula from memory right eyes front youre in the service of cluny the scourge now me buckoes desert and youll be killed retreat and youre under sentence of death disobey and youll die im redtooth clunys numberone rat you will obey the word of your captains they take orders from me i take orders from cluny remember that now if any one two or a group or even all of you together want to try and beat cluny and lead the horde this is your chance without warning cluny charged headlong into the new recruits lashing out wildly with his scourging tail he bowled them left right and center with his massive strength baring his teeth and slitting his eye he whipped fiercely away until they fell back and scattered in disorder hiding behind gravestones cluny threw back his head and roared with laughter no guts eh ha its just as well i dont want dead uns on my claws before i find a proper battle for you to fight and make no mistake when the right time comes ill see you fight aye and die too now raise your weapons and lets see if you know who your master is a motley collection of evillooking implements was framed by the cloudless sky as wild cries rang out from the newlyinducted recruits cluny cluny cluny the scourge abbot mortimer and constance the badger meandered through the grounds together both creatures were deep in thought had they spoken and voiced their thoughts they would have mentioned the same subject the safety of redwall down long ages the beautiful old abbey had stood for happiness peace and refuge to all diligent mice tended the neat little vegetable patches which every season gave forth an abundance of fresh produce cabbages sprouts marrows turnips peas carrots tomatoes lettuces and onions all in their turn flowerbeds heady and fragrant with countless varieties of summer blooms from rose to humble daisy were planted by the mice and husbanded by the hardworking bee folk who in their turn rewarded redwall with plentiful supplies of honey and beeswax the two friends wandered onwards past the pond earlymorning sunlight glinted off the water throwing out ripples from the fish caught by the overnight lines which were baited and left to drift each evening by brother alf ahead of them lay the berryhedges raspberry blackberry bilberry and the strawberry patch where every august sleepy baby creatures could be seen their stomachs full after eating the pick of the crop gradually they made their way around the big old chestnut trees into the orchard this was the abbots favorite spot many a leisurely nap had he taken on sunny afternoons with the aroma of ripening fruit hovering in his whiskers apples pears quince plums damsons even a vine of wild grape on the warm red stone of a southfacing wall old mother natures blessing lay upon a haven of warm friendliness now with the threat of cluny upon redwall the two old friends assessed the beauteous bounty of their lifelong abode sweet birdsong on the still air ringed constances heart with sorrow and regret that this peaceful existence would soon pass gruffly she snuffled deep in her throat blinking off a threatening teardrop the abbot sensed his companions distress he patted the badgers rough coat with a gentle paw there there old girl dont fret many times in our history has tragedy been forestalled by miraculous happenings constance grunted in agreement not wishing to disillusion her trusting old friend deep within her she knew a dark shadow was casting itself over the abbey furthermore it was happening in the present not in bygone days of fabled deeds matthias seated himself to an early breakfast in cavern hole nutbread apples and a bowl of fresh goatsmilk cornflower along with other woodland creatures granted sanctuary was sleeping in makeshift quarters provided by the good mice of redwall matthias felt that he had grown up overnight duty was a mantle that he had taken willingly upon his shoulders if there were a threat to redwall from outside it must be dealt with the mice of redwall were peaceful creatures but that must not be taken as a sign of weakness stolidly he munched away as he confronted the problem eat heartily matthias no point in facing trouble on an empty stomach feed the body nourish the mind the young mouse was surprised to see that old brother methuselah had been watching him his eyes twinkling behind the curious spectacles he invariably wore the ancient mouse sat dawn at the breakfast table with a small groan dont look so surprised young one your face is an open book to one of my years matthias drained the last of the milk from his bowl wiping cream from his whiskers with the back of a paw give me your advice brother methuselah he said what would you do the old mouse wrinkled his nose exactly the same thing as you would that is if i were younger and not so old and stiff matthias felt he had found an ally you mean you would fight methuselah rapped the table with a bony paw of course i would its the only sensible course to take he paused and stared at matthias in an odd manner hmm yknow theres something about you young feller did you ever hear the story of how martin the warrior first came to redwall matthias leaned forward eagerly martin tell me brother i love hearing about the warrior monk methuselahs voice dropped to a secretive whisper it is written in the great chronicle of redwall that martin was very young to be such a warrior he could have been the same age as yourself matthias like you he was impulsive and had a great quality of youthful innocence about him when he first came to our abbey but it is also written that in times of trouble martin had the gift of a natural leader a command over others far superior to him in age and experience the chronicle says that they looked to martin as some look to a strong father matthias was full of wonderment but he could not help feeling puzzled why do you tell all this to me brother methuselah the old mouse stood up he stared hard at matthias for a moment then turning he shuffled slowly off as he went he called back over his shoulder because matthias because he was very like you before the young mouse could question the old one further die joseph bell tolled out a warning sandals flapping matthias dashed out into the grounds nearly colliding with the abbot and constance who like everyone else were beading for the gatehouse brothers rufus and george had an incident to report a large evillooking rat covered in tattoos and carrying a rusty cutlass had turned up at the gate he had tried to gain entry by pretending he was injured limping about the rat explained that he had been in a hay cart that overturned into the ditch would they come with him and render assistance to his friends many of whom were lying trapped beneath the cart crying out for help brother rufus was no fool how many rats were traveling in the cart altogether he asked oh a couple of hundred came the glib reply then why reasoned brother rufus did the rats not give aid to their own companions surely all two hundred were not trapped the rat evaded the question and made a great show of rubbing his injured leg could they not take him in and dress his wound and perhaps give him a bite to eat at least brother george agreed on condition that the rat surrender his weapon the rat made as if to do so then suddenly lunged at brother george only to be sent sprawling by a blow from brother rufuss staff realizing that he was up against two big competent mice who would stand no nonsense he became abusive and badmouthed ha just you wait mice he raged theres a whole army of us camped down in the church when tell cluny how you treated me ho ho just wait thats all well be back by the fang we will with that he slunk off cursing all mice the grim news was digested in silence by the assembled creatures mrs churchmouse began sobbing oh dearie me did you hear that mdear they must be living in our home at st ninians church oh whatever shall we do our dear little home full of dreadful rats mr john churchmouse tried to comfort his wife as best he could there there hush now missus better to lose a house than lose our lives a good job we got sanctuary here at red wall but what about the other creatures in the area cried matthias sensible mouse said constance is ambrose spike anywhere about hed better do the rounds and tell them to take sanctuary here at the abbey as quickly as possible spike come to no harm once he curls up theres nothing can touch him this idea was greeted with enthusiasm brother alf went off to find the hedgehog the abbot suggested they all go inside the abbey and await further developments matthias piped up again wed best mount a guard on the walls one of the older mice sister clemence chided matthias as an upstart her voice was stern and condescending novice matthias you will be silent and do as your abbot commands much to everyones surprise the abbot came to matthiass defense one moment clemence matthias speaks sense let us hear what he has to say we are none of us too old to learn all eyes were turned on the young mouse as matthias heard himself boldly outline his plans for the defense of redwall it was eleven oclock on that glorious june morning mossflower wood and the meadowlands stirred to the brazen voice of the great joseph bell john churchmouse heaved on the bellrope as he had been told to by constance and matthias bong boom bong boom even the small creatures in wood and field who could understand no language save their own knew what it meant time of danger place of sanctuary carrying what simple belongings they needed woodlanders and their families hurried from far and near to gain the safety of the abbey before the storm of cluny broke upon diem squirrels mice voles moles otters all save the birds of the air who were safe anyway up the long dusty road they came mothers protectively herding young ones while fathers provided a rearguard brother methuselah stood at the gate with the abbot he translated fully to each group of creatures the abbots message in turn construing back to the father abbot their grateful thanks with pledges of help and loyalty to redwall abbey for what creature had not been freely given the aid and special knowledge of the kindly mice all knew that they owed their very existence to the abbot and his community healing aid food shelter and good advice were granted to all now was the time to unite and repay to give any help that was possible before much longer redwall would require the skills and knowledge of all its woodland allies they would be gratefully given matthias and constance stood on top of the high perimeter walls watching the road it was noon and the sun shone directly overhead despite the heat matthias had ordered all the mice to put on their hoods it served a double purpose to shield their eyes from the sun and create a camouflage effect silently each one stood armed with a stout staff the high red sandstone walls were far too lofty to be scaled by any normal creature instinctively matthias knew this was a good defense and a formidable deterrent constance could feel her hackles beginning to prickle she sniffed the air and shivered despite the heat that shimmered in waves across the meadowlands the big badger nudged matthias listen to that matthias pricked up his ears and looked at her questioning even the biros have stopped singing constance said quietly the young mouse gripped his staff tighter yes its the silence we can hear the grasshoppers have gone quiet constance peered down the road as she spoke strange for a summer day little friend bong every creature standing on the ramparts twitched with fright as the loud voice of the joseph bell rang out and john churchmouse shouted from his position high in the belfry theyre coming down the road i can see them i can see them io clunys army halted at the sound of the joseph bell as the dust settled fangbum looked to his leader for approval theyre ringing that big bell again chief ha ha maybe they think itll frighten us off the warlords eye rested balefully on his scout shut your mouth fool if youd done as i ordered and come right back to report the way cheesethief did we might have been inside that abbey by now fangburn slunk back into the ranks he hoped cluny had forgotten but cluny rarely forgot anything on a campaign the element of surprise had been lost now he must try another ploy the show of force the mere sight of a fully armed horde had worked before and he had little doubt it would prove effective now ordinary peaceful creatures were usually panicstricken at the sight of cluny the scourge at die head of his army the rat was a cunning general except die times when his mad rage took control of him but what need of berserk fits for a bunch of silly mice cluny knew the value of fear as a weapon and cluny was a fearsome figure his long ragged black cloak was made of batwings fastened at the throat with a mole skull the immense war helmet he wore had the plumes of a blackbird and the horns of a stag beetle adorning it from beneath the slanted visor his one eye glared viciously out at the abbey before him matthiass voice rang out sharp and clear from the high parapet halt who goes there redtooth swaggered forward and took up the challenge in his chiefs name as he called back up at the walls look well all creatures this is the mighty horde of cluny the scourge my name is redtooth i speak for cluny our leader constances reply was harsh and unafraid then speak your piece and begone rats silence hung upon the air while redtooth and cluny held a whispered conference redtooth returned to the walls cluny the scourge says he will not deal with badgers he will only speak with the leaders of the mice let us in so that my chief may sit and talk to your chief redtooth dodged back as his request was greeted by howls of derision and some loose pieces of masonry from the ramparts these plump little mice were not as peaceful as they first looked the rats looked to cluny but he was eyeing the abbot who had joined constance and matthias they appeared to be consulting quietly cluny watched tensely there seemed to be some disagreement between the old mouse and his two advisers they conferred awhile then matthias came forward to the parapet he pointed at cluny and redtooth with his staff you there and you also my abbot will talk with you both the rest must remain outside a rumble of protest from the horde was silenced by a crack from clunys tail he lifted his visor we agree mouse let us in but what about hostages for safe conduct hissed redtooth cluny spat contemptuously dont talk fools talk dyou imagine a load of mice in funny robes could take me captive redtooth gnawed anxiously on a split claw maybe not chief but have you cast a weather eye over that badger cluny answered quietly out of the side of his mouth dont worry ive been watching her a real big country bumpkin no these are mice of honor theyd sooner die than break their word to anyone you leave this to me as cluny and redtooth made for the gatehouse door constance shouted put down your weapons rats throw off your armor to show us that you come in peace redtooth spluttered angrily hells teeth who does that one think shes ordering around cluny shot him a warning glance quiet do as she says both rats took off their armor and placed it in a pile on the road matthias cried down to cluny if you really are cluny the scourge then we know of your tail it is a weapon therefore you will knot it tightly around your waist so that it cannot be used cluny laughed mirthlessly he squinted at matthias and cracked his tail dramatically young mouse he called you do right to ask this thing for truly you are looking at cluny the scourge having said this he took his tail in his claws and pulled the poison war spike from its rip tossing it on the armor pile cluny hitched his tail in a knot around his middle now will you let us inmice you can see we are unarmed ponderously the heavy gate inched open the two rats passed through a bristling forest of staves the gate slammed shut behind them cluny mentally estimated the walls to be of immense thickness as he and redtooth ducking their heads emerged from the tunnellike arch into the abbey grounds where constance and matthias were waiting in the sunlight the defenders followed the two rats closely menacing them with staves matthias rapped out a curt command leave us mice go back to your duties on the wall unhappy at leaving the abbot unguarded the mice hesitated to obey the order to withdraw cluny addressed matthias scornfully here mouse watch me shift em suddenly he whirled upon the apprehensive creatures the single eye rolled madly in its socket as cluny bared claws and fangs snarling ha harr ive got a powerful hunger for mice youd best get aloft on those walls ha harr cluny leaped into the air the mice scattered in panic constance stopped the proceedings with a loud angry bark here now enough of that rat you are here to talk with the abbot get along with you matthias was glad he was walking behind the rats he blushed with shame cluny had sent the defenders scattering like butterflies in a whirlwind matthias was furious the enemy now knew he was dealing with untrained and untested soldiers as the party walked towards cavern hole cluny could sense hostility emanating from the young mouse who flipflopped behind him in overlarge sandals strange for one so young to be counted as a captain he thought moreover the little fellow didnt seem to fear him ah but enough of that cluny would deal with him when the time came meanwhile the big rat gazed about his surroundings in secret admiration what an astounding place he allowed himself a peek at the future one day this would be called clunys castle he liked the sound of that secure from attack living off the fat of the land in his minds eye he saw it all those mice and the woodland creatures enslaved living just to serve him he would hold sway as far as the eye could see power an end to his rovings a dream come true king cluny entering the abbey the party stopped to make way for a pretty little fieldmouse bearing a tray oh matthias she said ive brought some refreshments for you and thank you cornflower put them down on the table said matthias abruptly redtooth nudged cluny cornflower eh satans nose shes a pretty little one for you cluny remained silent he stood insolently watching cornflower set the table in cavern hole a pretty one indeed the abbot indicated chairs they all sat except cluny who lounged against the table using the chair as a footstool he glared at redtooth until he stood and waited alongside his chief idly cluny picked up a bowl of honeyed milk and sampled it slop he spat it out on the floor the abbot folded his paws into the wide sleeves of his habit and stared impassively at the warlord what do you want at redwall abbey my son cluny kicked the chair over and laughed madly as the echoes died around the room his face went grim your son ha thats a good one ill tell you what i want mouse i want it all the lot everything do you hear me matthiass chair clattered on its side as he sprang forward breaking free from the restraining paws of the abbot listen rat you dont scare me ill give you our answer you get nothing now do you understand that shaking with fury matthias allowed himself to be pulled back on to the chair the abbot turned to cluny you must forgive matthias he is young and headstrong now as to your proposal i am afraid it is out of the question should you or your army require medical attention food clothing or help upon your way you will find us only too willing to assist cluny interrupted rudely by pounding upon the table until die abbot was silenced he pointed a claw at redtooth read them the articles redtooth held up a tattered parchment he cleared his throat these are the articles of surrender to be obeyed by all creatures who come under the claw of cluny the scourge or any of his commanders one surrender will be total and unconditional two cluny will execute the leaders of all who choose to oppose him three all property conquered will belong solely to cluny the scourge this includes homes food crops land and additionally all creatures dwelling on said property they shall be owned by cluny thwack redtooth got no further unable to contain himself matthias sent his staff ripping through the middle of the articles as the torn document fluttered to the floor redtooth launched himself at matthias with a snarl the rat was actually in midair when a huge blunt paw knocked him flat he lay stunned with constance standing over him why pick on a small mouse surely a big strong rat like you can deal with an old badger come on try me for size it was only the timely intervention of abbot mortimer that saved redtooths lifeconstance would you please let the rat up much as i would like to see him get his just desserts you must remember we cannot break the law of hospitality in our abbey redtooth staggered shakily to his feet backing warily away from the badger cluny spoke as if nothing had occurred you abbot mouse you have until tomorrow evening to give me your answer not normally given to anger the abbot stared cluny in the eye his face a mask of cold fury i will not need until tomorrow rat you can have my answer now how dare you come here with your robber band to read articles of death and slavery to me tell you that neither you nor your army will ever set paw or claw inside red wall not while or any of my creatures have breath in our bodies to fight and resist you that is my solemn word cluny sneered and turned on his heel followed by redtooth he stamped out on the stairs between cavern hole and great hall he stopped and turned his cold voice echoing between both chambers then die all of you every male female and young one you have refused my terms now you will suffer the punishment of cluny you will beg on your knees for death to come swiftly but i shall make your torment loud and long before you die it was then that constance did something that creatures would speak of in years to come exerting the full strength of a female badger she lifted the massive cavern hole dining table it was a huge solid oaken thing that no dozen mice could even move dishes clattered and food spilled as constance heaved the table above her head her voice was a roar get out rats leave this abbey im weary of your voices hurry before break the laws of hospitality and ask the abbots pardon later go while you still have skulls with the best grace he could muster cluny walked rather quickly up the stairs followed by redtooth who laughed nervously big country bumpkin eh chief one more word from you back there and shed have thrown that table and crushed us remembering who it was that he had spoken to in this insolent fashion redtooth cringed expecting cluny to deal him a blow for impudence but nothing happened cluny was standing transfixed oblivious to all about him even matthias and the abbot who had followed him out cluny stood staring at the tapestry who is that mouse he gasped matthias followed the direction of the rats gaze he walked to the tapestry with his paw outstretched do you mean this mouse cluny nodded dumbly matthias still with his paw outstretched declared proudly this is martin the warrior he founded our order and ill tell you something else rat martin was the bravest mouse mat ever lived if he were here today hed just take up his big sword and send you and all your bullies packing those of you he didnt chop up into crow meat much to everyones surprise cluny allowed himself to be shown out he was like one in a daze all the way back to the gatehouse a hush fell over the mice on guard as cluny and redtooth were let out on to the road swiftly the horde gathered around the warlord and his lieutenant they awaited orders deputizing for cluny redtooth called out form up backto die church everyone cluny marched automatically shaking his head in disbelief martin the warrior the mouse who pursued him through his nightmares what did it mean as redtooth marched away a voice hailed him from the wall he turned and looked upwards the torn articles the parchment wrapped around a fistful of rotting vegetables splattered in his face livid with rage he clawed the foul mess from his eyes and saw constance leaning over the parapet with a wicked grin of delight on her striped muzzle the badger shouted mockingly dont forget to call again rat id be delighted to see you weve got some unfinished business that im looking forward to settling just you and me redtooth before the rat could reply she had vanished from sight ii later that evening brother alf was patrolling his stretch of wall when he noticed a movement in the ferns at the edge of mossflower wood constance and matthias were summoned hastily they peered over the parapet brother alf pointed to where he had seen the ferns moving over there to the right of that aspen look theyre moving again matthias had better nocturnal vision than either of his friends he was the first to recognize the forlorn figure that rolled on to the grass its ambrose spike hes hurt quick lets get down there hold fast constance warned it may be a trap matthias was loth to hang about while a creature was lying injured within his sight but he had to heed his friends advice there just might be some of clunys rats lying in ambush for any creature that ventured into the shadowy fringes of mossflower however matthias was growing impatient we cant leave poor ambrose lying out there constance hell die weve got to do something the badger sat down with her snout between her paws yes weve got to think anyone got an idea the two mice joined her hardly had matthias sat down when he leaped up again ive got it stay here ill be back in a tick brother alf watched the little figure flipflopping off he gave a sigh and shook his head what do you suppose our matthias is up to the badger smiled affectionately more and more she was coming to trust matthiass natural skill as a leader and tactician dont fret brother alf whatever it is you can bet your habit itll be an original matthias gem that young mouse has got more in his head than a pile of acorns brother alf looked out at the still form in the grass it may be too late ambrose isnt even twitching look hes not rolled up in a ball anymore further speculation was curtailed by the appearance of matthias with him were half a dozen moles their leader glanced out at the hedgehog he scratched some hasty calculations on the wall with his claw then turned to matthias oi i think we can get yon edgepig back sur youm get us outen the gate and stan watch turning to his team the foremole began discussing tunnel width coupled with reverse prickle drag forward traction and all the other specialist details that are routine to the average qualified tunnelmole matthias whispered to constance and brother alf foremole and his crew are first class at rescue work theyve often rescued burrowers from caveins all we have to do is stand guard by the southeast wicket gate until theyre safely back right what are we waiting for lets go said the badger silently they slid outside the small greenpainted iron door matthias straining his eyes anxiously to see if there were any signs of life in the hedgehog he still lay about a hundred and fifty mouse paces from where they stood the moles unraveled a rope sling foremole stood watching as two of his team started the dig matthias looked on in wonderment one minute they were above ground a moment later there was a veritable shower bf loam and topsoil as they vanished beneath the earth natures own technicians in a trice they were back moist snouts poking from the excavation they made their ground report to foremole harr hem be noice an soft sur baint no rock nor root to stop usns straight furrer wem athinking satisfied foremole moved towards the test hole with the rest of his team oill dig ahead youm woiden workins gaffer and marge foller up ashorin he tugged his snout respectfully to matthias and constance youm gennelbeast bide by ere til us back another quick shower of soft dark earth and the moles were lost to view beneath the ground surface constance sniffed the breeze as matthias turned his ears to the nighttime woodland sounds they watched the ground humping into a continuous hillock that progressed farther as the moles tunneled towards ambrose spike the night remained calm and still but matthias and constance stayed alert both knowing if they failed to observe this rudimentary law of nature the penalty could be fatal matthias did a little shuffle of excitement look theyve come up right under poor old ambrose my word what splendid moles good heavens hes vanished completely they must have him inside the tunnel in a surprisingly short time the tunnelers were back emerging from the hole they carried the hedgehog in the rope sling across their backs refusing any help from the badger or the mouse foremole merely tugged his snout nay nay you uns ony get yer paws durted as swiftly as possible ambrose was hurried to the abbey infirmary and sick bay he was attended by the abbot himself a hasty diagnosis revealed that the hedgehog was suffering from a long jagged wound that ran from the back of his ear to the tip of his paw brother alf nodded sympathetically thats probably what caused old ambrose to pass out pain and loss of blood he must have traveled a fair way in that condition dyou think hell live father abbot the abbot chuckled quietly he cleaned the long ugly wound and applied a poultice of herbs no cause for alarm brother alf ambrose spike is made of leather and needles tough as a boulder this old ruffian is look hes beginning to come around already sure enough after some peculiar grunts and much curling and uncurling the hedgehog opened his eyes and looked about oh my aching ear father abbot you wouldnt see a poor son of the spike suffering like this without a drop of last octobers nutbrown ale to wet his parched gullet he pleaded all the creatures laughed aloud with delight and relief at seeing their old friend alive and well once again matthias was astonished at the amount of nutbrown ale that ambrose supped before he deemed himself fit enough to make a report the hedgehog smacked his lips noisily aaaahhh thats better now let me see i did as you asked me gave as many creatures fair warning as i could the joseph bell helped a great deal to warn everyone well to cut a long story short it must have been near noon when i stopped at vole bank i told the voles the bad news and blow me if that little ninny colin vole didnt go to shrieking and screaming all over the place as to how theyd all be murdered in their beds believe me there was no way of silencing the daft young thing anyhow his noise must have alerted a pack of those rats who were out foraging before you could say knife they were upon us there was such a gang of them that i couldnt do anything i had to curl up they carried off young colin and his mum and dad but try as they would there was no laying claws on ambrose spike no sir then one of them had a go at me with a point of an iron churchyard railing stabbed away at me the devil did they reckoned i was dead said i was too spiky to eat so they dragged the vole family off and i lay still until the coast was clear i made it as far as mossflower and thats all i can remember er is there any more left in that jug this wounds giving me jip i need ale for medicinal purposes father abbot matthias groaned and hung his head in despair the vole family taken captive death or slavery was all the wretched creatures could look forward to emboldened by the rescue of the hedgehog matthias was about to suggest that he and constance together with some handpicked helpers venture to undertake a rescue mission to st ninians church it was as if the abbot and constance both read his thoughts at the same time abbot mortimer sighed and shook his head at matthias the badger was more voluble matthias forget it abandon any hopes you have of snatching the vole family from under clunys nose imagine it a few of us going up against several hundred armed rats in their own camp ridiculous a fat lot of good wed be as defenders of redwall with our heads fixed to clunys standard matthias youre a very brave young mouse so please try to set an example to the rest by not becoming a foolish or dead one on reflection matthias could see the wisdom of the badgers counsel long after they had all retired for the night he sat up thinking a hundred mad ideas pounded through his brain each one wilder than the last feeling at a loss he wandered up into great hall and stood in front of the tapestry without consciously realizing it he found himself talking to martin the warrior oh martin what would you have done in my place i know that im only a young mouse a novice not even a proper redwall member yet but once you were young too i know what you would have done youd have buckled on your armor picked up your mighty sword gone down to that church and battled with the rats until they released the voles or perished beneath your blade but alas those days are gone i have no magic sword to aid me only the advice of my elders and betters to which i must listen matthias sat down upon the cool stone floor he gazed longingly up at martin the warrior so proud so brave what a dashing figure he cut looking back down to himself in his baggy green robes and oversized sandals matthias felt hot tears of shame and frustration spilling from his eyes and dripping on his young whiskers unable to stop himself he wept freely the soft touch of a gentle paw on his back caused him to look around it was cornflower matthias wished he were dead he quickly turned his face away knowing she could see his tears cornflower please go away matthias sobbed the little fieldmouse howeverf would not go she sat down on the floor next to matthias taking the edge of her pinafore she softly wiped away his tears for such a shy little mouse she had quite a bit to say matthias dont be ashamed i know why you cry and grieve it is because you are kind and good not a hardhearted pitiless rat like cluny please listen to me even the strongest and bravest must sometimes weep it shows they have a great heart one that can feel compassion for others you are brave matthias already you have done great things for one so young i am only a simple countrybred fieldmouse but even i can see the courage and leadership in you a burning brand shows the way and each day your flame grows brighter there is none like you matthias you have the sign of greatness upon you one day redwall and all the land will be indebted to you matthias you are a true warrior matthias with his eyes dry and his head held high stood up he felt himself stand taller than he ever had he helped cornflower to her feet and bowed to her cornflower how can i ever thank you for what you have said you too are a very special mouse it is late now go and get some rest i think i will stay here a while longer the fieldmouse untied her headband it was her favorite one pale yellow bordered with the cornflowers after which she was named she tied it to matthiass arm the right one just above the elbow a maidens colors for her champion warrior silently she crept off matthias could feel his heart beating against his chest he spoke to the image of martin thank you warrior you spoke to me through cornflower you gave me the sign that i asked of you at the church of st ninian cluny sat in the wreckage of what had once been a pulpit redtooth darkclaw cheesethief and fangburn lounged about at his feet on old burst hassocks cluny was in one of his strange moods again he showed little interest in the captive vole family merely ordering that they be kept under guard until he found time to deal with them most of his army slept in the choir loft or the lady chapel the rest were posted on sentry duty outside cautiously his captains watched the warlord cluny s long tail swished restlessly the single eye stared at a carved eagle holding the rotting lectern on its outspread wings what thoughts occupied the dark devious mind of cluny the scourge finally he looked up and spoke go and get shadow bring him here to me darkclaw and fangburn scurried off to obey the command silently the others waited their eyes glinting in evil anticipation the chief had a plan like all of his schemes it would be cunningly simple and wickedly brilliant there was no better general than cluny when it came to strategy shadow had been with cluny for many years nobody was sure if he was rat or weasel or even a bit of both he was very lithe and wiry and his long sinewy body was covered in sleek black far there was no hint of another color in his coat it was blacker than moonless midnight his eyes were strangely slanted black without any brightness in them the eyes of shadow were like those of a dead thing he stood before cluny who had to strain his one eye against the darkness of the church to make sure he was really there shadow is that you the reply sounded like a whisper of wet silk across a smooth slate cluny i am here why do you want shadow the captains shivered at the sound of the voice cluny leaned forward did you see the walls of that abbey today i was there shadow sees all tell me true could you climb them no beast i know of could climb those walls except you except me cluny gestured with his tail come closer then i will tell you what must be done shadow sat on the top pulpit step cluny issued his orders you will climb the abbey wall many sentries patrol the top of the wall take the utmost care if you get captured you are of no use to me there is no point in one alone trying to attack the gatehouse and open the aoor it is too well guarded so forget the gate shadow gave no hint that cluny had inadvertently read his mind he remained motionless as cluny continued once you have scaled the wall make for the main abbey door should it be locked for the night you will use all your skill to open it without any noise it is vital that you get inside the first room you will find yourself in is the main one the mice call it great hall walk in turn around and on the left wall facing you is a long tapestry covered in pictures and designs now listen carefully in the bottom righthand corner of that tapestry is a picture of a mouse dressed in armor leaning on a big sword i want it cut it rip it or tear it out but get it for me i must have it dont come back without it shadow puzzlement was written on the faces of the four captains who had overheard the orders a picture of a mouse cluny had never been known as a collector of pictures fangburn whispered to cheesethief what use is a picture of a mouse to the chief cluny heard he came to the edge of the pulpit grasping the sides of the lectern he surveyed his small congregation like some satanic minister ah brother fangburn let me explain i will tell you why it is that you and all your kind will forever remain servants while i shall always be the master did you not see the faces of those mice today the mere mention of martin the warrior sends them into ecstasies dont you see he is their symbol his name means the same to those mice as mine does to the horde in a different way maybe martin is some sort of angel im the opposite think for a moment if anything were to happen to me youd all be a leaderless rabble a headless mob so if the mice were to lose their most precious omen the picture of martin where would that leave them redtooth slapped his haunches he rocked to and fro sniggering with uncontrolled glee brilliant chief diabolical theyd just be a crowd of terrified little mice without their wonderful martin clunys tail banged down on the rotting lectern smashing it into several fragments and thats when well strike the powerful tail lashed backwards wrapping itself around shadows body he was dragged forward face to face with his master clunys rancid breath blasted into shadows face as he ground out each syllable bring that picture back here to me do this and your reward will be great when i sit on the abbots chair in redwall abbey but fail me and your screams will be heard far beyond the woodland and meadows cluny the scourge had spoken the suns first rays flung wide the gates of dawn the inhabitants of redwall were already up and about after breakfast the abbot issued daily orders all those not employed defending the abbey would husband the crops and gather in supplies for the larders in the event of a prolonged siege young otters collected watercress and fished cornflower headed a party of mice to reap the early cereal crops more youngsters tended die salad gardens the bright summer morning hummed to the bustle of industrious woodlanders ambrose spike now sufficiently recovered sat in the storeroom taking stock lots of nuts and preserved berries from last autumn apples and pears aplenty unfortunately the hedgejiog could not check the cellars brother edmund and friar hugo had the only two keys he licked his lips at the thought of barrels of nutbrown ale strong cider creamy stout and the little kegs ah the dear little kegs full of elderberry wine mulberry brandy blackcurrant port and wild grape sherry yurr edgepig wherem us aputtin these roots an dannylines asten up theym roight eavy ambrose sighed wistfully as he attended the two moles staggering under a bundle of dandelions and tubers arr old em liddle taters steady bill yurr tip em up more baby moles ambrose pawed the bandage on his wound a hedgehogs work was never done matthias and constance stood in the cloisters they had taken charge of weapon training the woodlanders were each showing off their special skills in more peaceful days these skills had only been used at fairs and sporting contests but now when the need arose they would be used with more deadly effect the otters carried bags of smooth pebbles which they hurled from vine slings with great force and accuracy groups of fieldmouse archers nocked thistledown shafts to the strings of their longbows many a marauding bird had been driven off by these same tiny archers bands of redwall mice practiced at thrust and parry with staves below the wall on the abbey grass foremole directed his crew as they dug a trench this was lined with sharpened stakes by a solitary beaver a system of ropes and pulleys carried the baskets of stone and trench debris up to the ramparts defenders piled it in heaps at the edge of the parapet matthias took a group of redwall mice to instruct in the use of the quarter staff he had discovered in himself a natural skill with the long ash pole none of the mice had ever competed in any type of violent sport they were awkward and timid but as it was a personal choice between learning cudgel and wrestling from constance or quarter staff from matthias to a mouse they had opted for the latter matthias found he had to be quite severe with them accordingly he dealt out some hefty blows and hard falls to make the more timid souls angry enough to retaliate keep that head guarded brother anthony thwack i warned you brother now look out im coming after you again thwack no no dont just stand there brother defend yourself hit out at me thwack crack this time matthias sat down hard rubbing dazedly at his sore head constance chuckled well matthias youve only yourself to blame you asked brother anthony to hit out at you and my word he certainly obliged ill have to recruit him for my cudgel class he shows promise matthias stood up smiling ruefully he rested on his staff yes hes very strong but i do wish that we had some real weapons of war swords and daggers and such like we wont kill many rats with wooden staves maybe not the badger replied but you must remember that we are here to defend not to attack or kill matthias threw down his staff he took a dipper of water from an oaken pail drinking deeply then splashing the remains over his aching head a wise observation constance but you try telling that to cluny and his horde see how far you get lunch that day was served out in the orchard matthias lined up with the other woodland creatures to collect his food a bowl of fresh milk a hunk of wheaten loaf and some goatsmilk cheese cornflower was serving she gave matthias an extra large wedge of the cheese he rolled up the sleeve of his habit and pulled out the corner of her scarf look cornflower a very close friend gave me this last night she laughed at him get along and eat your lunch warrior mouse or ill show you my deadly aim with a piece of this cheese strolling through the dappled shade of the orchard matthias sought out old methuselah slumping down beneath a damson tree the young mouse munched away at his lunch methuselah was sitting with his back against the tree his eyes closed in an apparent doze without opening them he addressed matthias how goes the practice war young stavemaster matthias watched some of the tiny ants carrying off his fallen breadcrumbs as he answered as well as possible brother methuselah and how are your studies coming along methuselah squinted over the top of his spectacles knowledge is a thing that one cannot have enough of it is die fruit of wisdom to be eaten carefully and digested fully unlike that lunch you are bolting down little friend matthias set his food to one side tell me what knowledge have you digested lately old one methuselah took a sip from matthiass milk bowl sometimes i think you have a very old head for such a young mouse what more do you wish to know about martin the warrior matthias looked surprised how did you know i was going to ask about martin methuselah wrinkled his nose how do the bee folk know there is pollen in a flower ask away young one before i doze off again matthias hesitated a moment then blurted out brother methuselah tell me where martin lies buried the old mouse chuckled drily next you are going to ask me where to find the great sword of the warrior mouse bbut how did you know that stammered matthias the ancient gatehousekeeper shrugged his thin shoulders the sword must lie buried with martin you would have little use for the dusty bones of a bygone hero a simple deduction even for one as old as i am then you know where the warrior lies methuselah shook his head that is a thing no creature knows for many long years now i have puzzled and pored over ancient manuscripts translating following hidden trails always with the same result nothing have even used my gift of tongues speaking to the bees and others who can go into places too small for us but always it is the same rumors legends and old mouse tales matthias crumbled more bread for the ants then the warriors sword is only a fable methuselah leaned forward indignantly who said that did i no but you bah nothing of the sort young mouse listen carefully to me i have an uncanny feeling that you may be the one i have been saving this vital piece of information for matthias forgot his lunch he listened attentively about four summers ago i treated a sparrowhawk who had pulled a sinew in her foot she could not use her talons properly hmm as i remember i made her promise never to take a mouse as prey she was a fierce frightening bird have you ever been close up to a sparrowhawk no of course you havent well let me tell you they can hypnotize small creatures with those savage golden eyes born killers they are but this hawk said something that made me think she talked of the sparrows called diem winged mice said that many years ago they had stolen something from our abbey a treasure that belonged to the mice wouldnt say what it was just flew off huh who expects gratitude from a sparrowhawk anyway matthias interrupted have you ever spoken to the sparrows about this something methuselah shook his head im too old i cant climb up to the roof where they nest besides the sparrows are odd birds forever quarreling and chattering on in their strange voices they are warlike creatures extremely forgetful and completely savage theyd throw you from the roof and kill you before you had a chance to get near their tribal nests yes im far too old for that son of thing matthias and anyhow im not too sure that die sparrowhawks story was true some birds can be dreadful liars when they have a mind to be matthias tried questioning brother methuselah further but the warm sun had worked its magic upon the old gatekeeper as he sat in the orchard savoring the peace and tranquility of a june afternoon this time there was no deception he was genuinely fast asleep clouds drifted across the sky obscuring the thin sliver of moon the joseph bell tolled out its midnight message to the slumbering countryside a warm sort drizzle was falling over the parched meadows and dry woodland bringing relief after the hot dry day damping down the dust from the road in the ditch a frog opened its eyes disturbed by some slight noise from the hedgerow it blinked was that three figures creeping along or two the frog remained perfectly still there seemed to be two figures and some sort of shadow the moon came out from behind a cloud it was two huge rats and a dark shadowy something they crept along under cover of the hedge towards the big dwelling of the mouse folk rats were hunters thankfully they had not noticed him the frog stayed motionless and let them pass it was none of his business cluny ragear and shadow padded noiselessly towards redwall this was such an important mission that cluny had decided to come along and supervise it personally around shadows waist was strapped a skin pouch it contained a thin strong rope a padded grappling hook a vial of oil some locfcpicks and a dagger shadows usual burgling kit ragear ambled proudly along thrilled that he had been specially picked to accompany his chief on such a vital task little did he know that cluny had only included him as an insurance if they should get into a tight corner ragear would serve as an expendable fool that way cluny could make good his own escape the trio halted beneath the lofty abbey walls cluny silenced them with a wave of his tail then vanished into the night ragear felt distinctly nervous at being left alone with shadow he attempted a whispered conversation nice drops of rain eh shadow good for the grass blow me these walls are pretty high im glad its you climbing them and not me id never make it too fat hahaha ragears voice trailed off he fumbled with his whiskers wilting beneath the basilisk stare of shadows dead black eyes he shuddered and fell silent within ten minutes cluny was back he nodded up at the parapet ive been up and down the length of the wall for a fair distance the sentry mice are all asleep the fools theyve never had to do guard duty before as soon as night falls so do their eyelids thats what soft living does for you ragears head bobbwd in agreement youre right chief if they were in our army and old redtooth caught them snoozing hed shut your trap stupid cluny hissed are you ready shadow now dont forget your instructions shadow bared his yellowed fangs and started climbing slowly he made his way upwards like a long black reptile his claws seeking hidden niches and crevices in the sandstone ever upwards sometimes stopping spreadeagled against the surface as he figured out his next movement taking full advantage of every crack and joint in the wall no other animal in clunys army could have attempted such an ascent but shadow was a climbing expert he concentrated his whole being on the job in hand sometimes clinging to the stones by no more than a single claw below on the ground cluny and ragear strained their eyes upwards they could hardly make out his shape he was not far from the top of the wall shadow shifted position and levered with his back legs and tail now he wedged his claws into a fissure and stretched upwards gaining inch by inch on top of the wall brother edmund was snoring gently he was nestled in a pile of rubble wrapped in a warm blanket with his hood up against the light rain edmund was oblivious to the long sharp claws that latched themselves over the parapet edge a moment later the sleek black head appeared two dense obsidian eyes stared at the sleeping mouse shadow had succeeded in climbing the abbey wall like a sinuous black lizard he slithered past slumbering creatures and around rubble heaps never once making a sound friar hugo mumbled gently in his sleep and moved his head so that his cowl slid off drizzle fell upon the fat friars face threatening to wake him gently as a night breeze shadow replaced the hood pausing for an instant shadow looked about before descending the stone steps from the ramparts to the cloisters using shrubs and bushes as cover he moved furtively forwards never taking any needless chances or making sudden movements sometimes he stopped and waited letting the minutes tick away as he planned his next progression gliding like a clouds shadow cast upon the ground by the moon the door to great hall was not locked shadow judged that the latch was probably old and creaky he took out the vial of oil and lubricated the latch and hinges carefully he inched the door ajar apart from a tiny squeak it swung effortlessly open sliding inside he released the door by mistake a swift night breeze slammed it shut with a dull thud shadow cursed inwardly and flung himself behind a nearby pillar he lay inert not daring to breathe one two three minutes good nobody had been disturbed by the noise he ventured out to inspect the tapestry that hung upon the wall a black moth on a moonless night would not have escaped shadows notice he needed no lamp to scrutinize the thing before him so this was the picture of the warrior mouse that cluny lusted after using his razorsharp fangs he began gnawing into the ancient tapestry working from the tasseled hem upwards matthias tossed and turned in his bed exhausted but unable to sleep his mind revolved around a host of problems and schemes the sword martins grave defense of the abbey cornflower finally after much kicking and rumpling of sheets sleep started to take over he was somewhere in a long deserted room not unlike great hall a voice called to him matthias oh go away the young mouse muttered drowsily get someone else im tired but the voice persisted boring into his mind matthias matthias i need you he peered down the length of the darkened hall what is it why do you need me matthias began to walk towards the voice he could hear a wicked snigger followed by a cry of despair matthias help dont let them take me he ran forwards the hall seemed to grow longer who are you where are you far ahead in the murky darkness matthias could vaguely distinguish a figure leaning out from the wall it was a mouse in armor please matthias you must help me quickly bump matthias landed on the floor of his bedroom sheets were tangled about his body slowly he sat up and rubbed his eyes what a strange dream the long hall the plea for help the armored mouse matthias felt the fur on the back of his neck rising of course it had to be great hall martin the warrior something terrible was going on downstairs he was needed urgently matthias kicked the sheets from him as he leaped up and dashed headlong from the bedroom along the dormitory corridor and helter skelter down the spiral staircase through cavern hole he clattered in the darkness stumbling and tripping over furniture his heart hammering loudly and legs pumping like twin pistons matthias fell over the top stair and went sprawling into great hall he lay on the floor gazing through the gloom to the tapestry martin was still there but he was moving was it the breeze no it couldnt be the likeness of the warrior mouse was jiggling about as though it were being tugged in some way matthias could see a shadow but there was nothing to cast it he jumped to his feet and ran forwards as the picture of martin was ripped away from the tapestry a rat held it there was no doubt in matthiass mind it was a rat entirely black from tip to tail barely distinguishable from the night itself shadow heard the footsteps on the floor behind him with cold calculated detachment he wheeled about as his opponent charged he was certain to defeat such a small creature in combat but his orders were to get the picture not to fight little mice besides there was always the additional hazard that the mouse might hang on to him and shout for help until it came like a wraith of oily smoke shadow completed a clever double maneuver bowling his body into a forward roll he knocked matthias down like a skittle bounding up he slipped around the door slammed it and fled off through the cloisters matthias sprang up roaring at the top of his voice stop that rat stop that rat immediately the mice on sentry duty were alerted as shadow ran he saw constance dash across the grounds at an angle which cut him ofpfrom the stairs up to the ramparts switching direction he made for the next set of stairs silently cursing the badger now he would have to use his climbing rope to descend quickly to the road matthias emerged from the abbey he saw shadow change direction thinking fast he ran diagonally catching up with the thief at the foot of the stairs throwing himself in a flying tackle matthias grabbed shadow by the legs sending him crashing on to the lower steps still dinging to the tapestry shadow wriggled like an eel turning over on to his back he kicked savagely at the young mouses head with a free foot matthias tried valiantly to hang on but his larger and heavier opponent kicked him viciously in the face again and again the big bony foot with its sharp claws pounding and gouging away soon took its toll matthias went limp and blacked out constance had mounted the far steps gaining the ramparts she ran along dodging the heaps of rubble she saw matthias go down under the onslaught of kicks and ran even faster impeded by mice all around who scattered in panic thinking they were under mass invasion the only one besides constance who had the sense to see what was happening was cornflowers father being nearer the top of the stairs than the badger he ran straight into the intruder shadow was struggling to get out his climbing rope surrender rat ive got you cried mr fieldmouse as he grabbed hold of the thief but rummaging in his pouch to free the rope shadows claw had closed on the handle of his dagger he drew it out swiftly and drove it twice into the fieldmouses unprotected body constance arrived just as the victim fell wounded shadow turned on her with the dagger upraised constance swung her paw round in a mighty arc and it caught shadow square on the chin the force of the blow lifted the thief clean off his feet and before constance could grab hold of him he overbalanced and hurtled over the edge of the parapet with a horrible scream downwards he plunged his body thudding oflfthe unyielding masonry he landed in the wet roadway with a sickening crunch cluny came dashing towards the stricken shadow with ragear scuttling in his wake despite his appalling injuries shadow managed to lever himself up on one paw cluny im hurt help me he gasped the piece of tapestry lay upon the road cluny snatched it up eagerly behind him he could hear the gatehouse bolts being withdrawn amid the shouts of angry mice ruthlessly he kicked at shadows broken body get up and run for it or stay there fool i dont carry cripples or bunglers leaving the injured shadow to the mice cluny sped off across the road he covered the width of the ditch with a mighty leap and ran off across the meadows in open country he could outdistance any mice that dared follow him waving the tapestry cluny laughed in exhilaration as he put on an extra burst of speed ragear had panicked completely he could not jump the ditch so he scuttled off down the road in the opposite direction from the way they had come a group of mice ted by brother alf tried fording the ditch and dimbing up into the meadow unfortunately the rain had made the going hard and slippery cluny was long gone and die tapestry with him turning back to redwall the pursuers came upon matthias he was leaning on friar hugos arm in a dazed condition painfully he staggered up the road to where shadow lay wincing he cast about searching the muddy roadway for the fragment of tapestry its got to be here somewhere cried matthias he fell upon die injured shadow searching his waist pouch his flat black eyes clouding over shadow watched matthias laconically he spoke his voice was strangely calm too late mouse martin is with cluny now it was the last thing shadow ever said he gave one final shudder and lay dead dawn arrived as if it were aware of the previous nights events heavy grey skies and steady rain prevailed over redwall and the mossflower area abbot mortimer looked old and stern as he addressed the assembly in cavern hole the atmosphere was decidedly subdued sleeping at your posts allowing the enemy into our abbey to steal that which we hold most dear is this the way you defend us the abbots shoulders slumped wearily there was an awkward hush anger and guilt lay thick upon the air the kindly old mouse shook his head and held up a conciliatory paw forgive me friends criticize you unjustly we are all creatures of peace unskilled in the art of war yet when i saw the late rose this morning i could not help but notice mat its leaves are all shriveled the tiny rosebuds have died martin the warrior is gone from our abbey he has left redwall we are forsaken there will be hard and sorrowful days to come without him among us the mice and woodland creatures shuffled their feet and gazed at the floor they knew the truth in their father abbots words but hope springs eternal there was one voice raised that of matthias a bit of good news he said have just come from the infirmary mr fieldmouse is out of danger he will live the relief was audible throughout cavern hole tensions were eased even the abbot temporarily forgot his gloomy predictions thank you matthias he cried what heartening news i must say that the terrible injuries received by mr heldmouse almost had me believing the worst but look at yourself my son you should be resting your face is still swollen after the fight with the black rat matthias gave a lopsided grin he shrugged cheerfully dont worry about me father abbot ill be all right the mice smiled with pride a brave little warrior matthias he put new heart into them their resolve strengthened as he continued huh black rat indeed he didnt even scratch me well only a bit but where is he now this sly one deep under the soil if the insects are doing their job properly listen to me friends we of redwall are a tough lot to kill off they couldnt finish ambrose spike could they why even the black one armed with a dagger couldnt slay mr fieldmouse so whats a scratch or two to a mouse like me cheers for matthiass speech rang to the rafters constance sprang up beside him shouting heartily thats the spirit friends now lets see you all back out there at your posts well be wide awake this time and heaven help any dirty rats that come marching up to redwall this day with wild yells very uncharacteristic of peaceful mice the friends seized their staves and charged out fired with new zeal after a while constance accompanied the abbot to see mr fieldmouse while matthias went with methuselah to great hall together they surveyed the torn tapestry the young mouse stood with his paws folded an expression of disgust upon his features the old gatekeeper patted his shoulder i know how you feel matthias i could see you were only putting on a brave face for the benefit of the others that is good it shows you are learning to be a wise leader you hide your true feelings and encourage them not to give up hope matthias gingerly touched the swellings on his face aye thats as may be old one but you can see as well as i that martin is gone without him i do not think we can win methuselah nodded in agreement you are right my young friend but whats to be done matthias staggered slightly he leaned against the wall rubbing a paw across his brow i dont know in fact the only thing i know right now is that the abbot was right i think id better go and lie down for a bit refusing methuselahs help the young mouse left the old one gazing at the torn tapestry he tottered off unsteadily in the direction of the dormitory on the spiral staircase he met cornflower hello there he said as cheering as he could how is your father cornflower looked at matthias solicitously hes doing fine thank you matthias im just going to get some herbs for the abbot shouldnt you be lying down your face looks terribly puffy matthias winced and leaned against the banister yes as a matter of fact im just going to my room for a good long rest but dont you worry before long ill make those rats pay dearly for hurting your father matthias staggered weakly into his room but the moment he closed the door he became a different mouse with bright eager eyes he groped under his bed and brought forth the waist pouch that had belonged to shadow tucking the long dagger into his belt he wrapped the climbing rope around his shoulder and said aloud to himself right cluny you and i have a score to settle keeping a mound of earth between himself and brother rufus matthias silently looped the rope around a projection at the edge of the parapet fortunately for him rufus was looking in the opposite direction matthias started to slide down the rope on the mossflower side of the wall where the woods came close up to the abbey he had imagined the descent would be very difficult and surprised himself by handling it with ease his confidence growing as he slid swiftly and noiselessly to the ferncovered ground crouched in the undergrowth he mentally rehearsed his plan of action he would go through the woods to st ninians church avoiding the road that was being watched by sentries once at the church he would discover where the piece of tapestry was kept then he would create a diversion of some kind while clunys horde was occupied he would snatch the tapestry and get back to redwail with all speed matthias ducked deeper into the ferns and was soon just a silent ripple making through the lush summer green of mossflower towards the church of st ninian at the camp of cluny the scourge the rat army was girding itself up for war weapons were being sharpened upon churchyard headstones under the critical eye of redtooth a band of rodents was gnawing off a length of planking from a rickety lychgate fence at the rear of the church others collected stones to provide ammunition for slings while some coiled ropes about their bodies inside the church cluny sat up in the choir loft the image of barbaric authority he held the scourging tail in one claw while gripped in the other was his war standard topped by the ferret skull with the addition of the tattered tapestry square depicting martin the warrior he gazed proudly at it as his armorer dressed him for war at clunys feet were the vole family they were bound he flicked his tail at them and sneered ha look at me you spineless little creatures did you ever see such a leader of fighting animals as cluny the scourge soon i will have every creature that moves down on its bended knees to me mr abram vole glared defiantly at his captor you filthy great bilge rat why ill silence roared cluny hold your tongue vole or i will deal with you and your family here and now before i set out to conquer your precious abbey do you see my new battle flag that is martin the warrior yes the same one who is supposed to protect that doddering old abbot and his witless mob of mice now martin is mine it is more fitting that he travels at the head of real warriors he will lead us to victory cluny ranted and raved on the light of madness in his eye death and desolation shall be the reward of those who dare stand against cluny the only ones i will spare are those might choose to serve me mrs vole struggled upright but was forced back down by scumnose and fangbum chattering with rage she shouted at cluny youll never bend redwall to your evil will good will prevail youll see cluny we are tied up but our minds are free crack cluny lashed out with his long tail sending the vole family flat upon the floor mr abram vole struggled to shield his wife and son with his body as the tail flailed out a second time a touching little speech vole but you wrong me i dont want to capture the spirit of redwall i mean to kill it take these whining creatures out of my sight lock them in the hut out at the back leave them to imagine what their fate will be when i return colin vole shrieked in terror his mother and father struggled bravely as they were dragged off redtooth marched in and saluted cluny the horde is ready to march chief a rat armorer set the war helmet firmly upon clunys head he snapped the visor down and kicked aside the rat who had fixed the poison barb on his tail striding out into the churchyard cluny climbed up on the wrecked gatepost his fierce eye gazed out across the mighty army black rats brown rats grey rats piebald rats skulking weasels furtive stoats and sinuous ferrets all gathered round their weapons glistening and dripping with the rain as cluny exhorted them they roared back their frenzied replies where does clunys army go redwall redwall what is the law of cluny kill kill kill who will lead you to victory cluny cluny cluny the scourge springing down among his army the warlord waved the banner high overhead with a mighty shout the horde of cluny the scourge marched out upon the road to redwall abbey ragear was hopelessly lost separated from cluny he could not think for himself scuttling off down the road in the wrong direction he had kept on going in a state of funk frightened by the sound of a bird chirping suddenly he rushed blindly into mossflower wood and pressed on deeper and deeper into this strange new territory it was only with the arrival of pale dawn that he stopped slumping down under some bushes exhausted soaking wet and dispirited he curled up into a wretched damp ball and slept some time about midmorning ragear was awakened by the sound of footsteps as matthias tramped past he lay low silently congratulating himself what a find a little mouse he would take him prisoner and bring him back alive to cluny that way he could gain some prestige cluny might even forget that he panicked and deserted at the abbey matthias risked a swift glance over his shoulder there was a rat clumsily trying to stalk him a fat awkwardlooking rodent but nevertheless an enemy the young mouse strode onwards his mind working coolly and without fear confident that he could handle the situation breaking twigs underfoot stumbling ineptly from tree to tree ragear watched the mouse and fantasized there was six ofem chief they tried surrounding me but i fought like a devil then i says to meself ragear says i youd better capture this last one and fetch him back for the chief to question then clunyll say to me ragear good old ragear i knew i could depend on you why dyou suppose i took you along in the first place mangefur bring food and wine for my old pal ragear the brave ha yes then ill pat the chief on the back and say by satans whiskers you old rodent have you never thought of retiring and letting me lead the horde why with a gallant warrior tike me in comm thwack a long whippy larch branch sprang forward suddenly it crashed into ragears head poleaxing him matthias stepped out of hiding rubbing his hands it had been a strain holding the branch back for so long uncoiling shadows climbing rope he bound ragear paw and claw to a sturdy oak the young mouse could not afford to wait around for the rat to regain his senses there was still a deal of traveling to be done he pressed onwards leaving his senseless enemy bound to the tree the rain stopped within minutes the hot june sun burst down on mossflower as if in apology for its absence clouds of steaming mist arose from die woodland floor mingling with the golden shafts slanting down through the trees the birds began singing each flower and blade of grass was decked out in jeweled pendantry with necklaces of sparkling raindrops the sudden warmth flooded over matthias cheering him onwards humming a tune beneath his breath he strode out with a will almost breaking from the cover of the trees straight out into the flat meadowland he checked himself just in time directly ahead lay a vast overgrown area which was neither pasture nor meadow it was the common land mat had once belonged within the curtilage of st ninians matthias crouched at the edge of the woods he could see the back of the church there were ten or twelve rats patrolting it some distance away before he dealt with that problem mere was still the common land to be crossed clumps of thistle and slight ground hummocks would be his only cover the young mouse spoke his thoughts aloud hmm this could present a little problem a strange voice answered him problem a little problem well at least its not a fullygrown adult problem matthias squeaked aloud with fright whirling about he looked for the source of the mystery voice there was no one about taking a grip of himself he squared his shoulders and called out boldly come out here this instant and show yourself the voice answered it seemed to come from directly in front of him show mself indeed how many pairs of eyes dyou want young feller eh eh fine state of affairs bless msoul what what matthias narrowed his eyes and looked hard still nothing i warn you come out and show yourself he shouted irritably im in no mood for playing games as if by magic a lanky hare popped up right beside matthias an odd patchworked creature his fur was an ashen hue with blots of grey and lightbrownflecked white on the underbelly he was very tall with formidable hefty hind legs and a comical pouched face topped off by two immense ears which flopped about of their own accord with a courtly oldfashioned manner the hare made a leg bowing gracefully his voice carried a slightly affected quaver basil stag hare at your service sir expert scout hindleg fighter wilderness guide and camouflage specialist ahem liberator of tender young crops carrots lettuce and other such strange beasts pray tell me whom i have the pleasure of addressing and please state the nature of your little problem matthias decided the peculiar hare was either slightly mad or tipsy but his outmoded manner was certainly friendly the young mouse humored him accordingly bowing low with a paw at his waist good day to you mr basil stag hare my name is matthias i am a novice in the order of redwall mice my immediate problem is to cross this land to the church over yonder without being discovered by the rats who are guarding it basil stag hare tapped one of his huge feet gently on the ground matthias he laughed what an odd name to be sure the young mouse laughed back as he replied not half as odd as your own name whoever heard of a hare being called basil stag the hare disappeared momentarily he reappeared next to matthias ah well hares the family name dont yknow my parents njmed me basil though the old mater wanted me to be called columbine agnes always longed for a young lass she did but why stag matthias inquired noble creatures stags the hare sighed did i ever tell you i wanted to be one a magnificent royal stag with great coathanger antlers so i went down to the jolly old river one night and christened mself stag had two toads and a newt as witnesses yknow oh yes matthias was unable to hide his merriment he sat down and chuckled basil started chuckling too he sat down beside matthias i think im going to like you mboy he cried now what about getting you to that church why theres nothing simpler but enough time for that later young rip how about telling me what brings you here i love listening to a good yarn yknow oh by the way i hope you like fennel and oatcakes of course you do youll share lunch with me of course you will young un like yourself in a flash basil had lugged a haversack from the undergrowth and was spreading a repast on the grass between mem for the next half hour matthias related his story between mouthfuls of the hares tasty luncheon basil listened intently interrupting only when he required clarification on some point matthias finished his tale and sat back awaiting comment basils long ears flopped up and down like railway signals as he digested his food and his friends information hmm rats i knew theyd come eventually through intelligence on me grapevine yknow could feel it m the old ears too as for redwall i know it well excellent type abbot mortimer splendid chap i heard the joseph bell tolling out the sanctuary message huh even had some cheeky old hedgehog telling me to run for it couldnt go of course dear me no thatd never do chap deserting his post bit of a bad show what what i prefer me own company yknow present company excepted of course oh of course matthias agreed he had taken enormously to the hare basil sprang up in a smart military fashion and saluted right first things first must get you across to the church young feller me mouse i say that green thingummyjig youre wearin habit isnt it capital camouflage you just try lying down anywhere in the shadows believe you me youd have trouble finding yourself top holecover absolutely basil stopped and ruminated for a moment his ears lay flat stood up men pointed in opposite directions he continued now when youve liberated your bit of tapestry or whatever make straight back across the common ill be waiting never fear good well come on young bucko we cant sit about here all day like two fat rabbits at a celery chew up and at em quicks the word and sharps the action nip about a bit young un again basil vanished only to reappear some three yards out on the common come on matthias tack to the left and wheel to the right bob and weave duck and wriggle look its easy matthias hurried to follow keeping in mind basils instructions surprisingly they seemed to work perfectly and before long the two friends had covered nearly threequarters of the common land matthias could even count the whiskers on some of the rats he covered his mouth with a paw to stifle a giggle its really very simple isnt it basil how am i doing the hare bobbed up beside him capital bung ho like a duck to water young feller flop me ears if you arent the best pupil ive ever had by the way is there anything i can do to help matthias stopped and looked serious yes there is basil but i feel reluctant to ask you to involve yourself in my fight basil stag hare snorted rubbish my fight indeed dyou fondly imagine that id sit there munching at the old nosebag while some ugly great rodent and his band of yahoos run about conquering my countryside huh never let it be said in the mess that basil stag hare was backward in coming forward ask away matthias you young curmudgeon the hare puffed out his narrow chest and stood with paw on heart his eyes closed and ears standing straight up he awaited orders the young mouse hiding a smile at basils noble pose said admiringly oh mr hare you do look heroic standing like that thank you basil opened one eye to look at himself yes he did look rather gallant a bit like the monarch of the glen or the stag at eve not that a young moused understand anything of that nature matthias expressed his wishes to the stag would it be possible for you to create some kind of diversion while im getting the tapestry could you keep the rats occupied basil the hare twitched his ears confidently say no more laddie youve come to the right stag listen carefully you cut across the flank to their left they took a piece of planking out of the fence by the lychgate thats where youll slide through when youve got what you came for then make your exit the same way ill be somewhere about keeping an eye on you right off you go matthias went swiftly still remembering to bob and weave as basil had taught him he made it with ease to the fence glancing back to check on his companion basil went into a speedy run he cleared the fencetop at a bound and tapped the nearest rat on the back i say old thing wheres this leader feller cluny or loony whatever you call him completely staggered the rat stood slackjawed basil left him and popped up beside another rat phew dear dear dont you chaps ever take a bath listen here you dreadful creature dyou realize that you smell to high heaven er by the way did your parents ever call you pongo or did they smell as bad as you it took the rat sentries a moment or two to recover from their surprise then they let out yells of rage and tried to seize the impudent hare it was tike trying to catch smoke with their claws basil ran rings round them keeping up a steady stream of insults and adding to the rats bad temper they shouted angrily grab that big skinny rabbit lads big skinny rabbit yourself catsmeat ill stick his damned guts on my pike temper temper tut tut such language if your mother could hear you blast hes as slippery as a greased pig some of my best friends are greased pigs bottle nose oops missed me again you old butterfingers you matthias chuckled quietly and shook his head in admiration he watched twelve rats falling over each other and bumping heads as they chased his friend around the common land every now and then basil would pause and strike his noble stag attitude letting the rats get to within a whisker of him nimbly he would kick out with his long powerful legs and send them all sprawling in a heap adding insult to injury he danced around the fallen sentries sprinkling them with daisies until they arose cursing him to continue the chase wary that there might be other rats about matthias climbed into the church through a broken stainedglass window he dropped down into the lady chapel the young mouse wrinkled his nose in disgust the beautiful old church was rank with the heavy odor of rats furniture was overturned statuary broken walls stained the pages of torn hymn books lay about everywhere where was die fragment of tapestry and where was cluny with the rest of his army instant realization sent a leaden weight thudding into the pit of matthiass stomach they had gone to attack redwall cluny must have the tapestry with him matthias felt sick at the thought hastily he climbed back out of the window halfway across to the fence he noticed a small shed somebody was pounding upon its locked door and calling his name aloud matthias quickly over here in the hut through a small gap in the door he could see the vole family their paws were tightly bound colin vole huddled piteously on some dirty sacking in a corner while mr abram vole and his wife battered away at the door with their paws tied together matthias called through the crack to them stop banging stay quiet ill have you out of there as soon as i can break the lock matthias cast about for something that would force the padlock and hasp doubtless some rat had the key but there was no time for that by a stroke of luck he found an iron spike that had been thrown at basil by one of the rats forcing the spike in the hoop of the lock matthias levered away its not budging he muttered from the corner colin vole started to weep aloud oh well be locked in here until cluny gets back i dont want to face him again do something matthias save me despite the voles wretched predicament matthias could not help showing his contempt for colin do stop whining colin it doesnt help matters and keep your voice down there may still be rats about try to be brave like your mum and dad in his frustration matthias swung the spike at the lock it bounced off lodging deep between the hasp and the woodwork he grunted in exasperation pulling it savagely towards himself to loosen it taken off balance he went head over tail the hasp had broken it came away bringing with it some twisted rusty screws the door swung open drawing his dagger matthias hastily cut the bindings from the paws of the voles issuing orders as he worked follow me and do as i say move as quickly and quietly as you can cautiously they slid through the broken fence and began making their way across the common there was no sight of the rat sentries matthias guessed that they were off somewhere still trying to catch the elusive hare it was midafternoon the common was peaceful and sunny butterflies perched on thistle flowers and grasshoppers serenaded each other with their ceaseless cadences abram vole insisted on shaking matthias by the paw and congratulating him matthias thank you with all my heart for saving my family we thought we were doomed the young rescuer looked grim were not back home yet by any means mr vole and even if we do make it back to the abbey i dread to think what we may find mrs vole nodded vigorously aye we saw them leave the church to march on redwall cluny was leading the villains with martins picture tied to his banner my oh my you never did see so many wild rascals in all your born days matthiass brow creased in a worried frown i wish i hadnt sneaked off from the abbey this morning i do hope constance has all the defenders on the alert it was only seconds later that matthias wished he had also been on the alert the sentry rats had become tired of chasing basil wearily they made their way out of the woods and back to the common land they sat on the grass behind a low hummock taking a break together matthias and the vole family walked straight into die middle of them cluny massed his forces in the roadside ditch opposite redwall abbey he stood well back in the meadow behind the ditch surrounded by his captains here where he was out of range he could direct the entire operation but at the moment he was not having things all his own way for a start he did not have many archers rats are notoriously bad at bowmaking and the fletching of arrows from the ramparts of redwall the field and harvest mice sent down volley after volley of tiny arrows which while they had no great killing power were causing much wounding and discomfort in the ranks of cluny s horde standing beneath his banner which was rammed into the earth cluny cracked his tail redtooth darkclaw tell the slingthrowers to stand ready when i give the signal i want to see a good heavy barrage of stones hitting the top of that parapet thatll make them keep their heads down frogblood scumnose you two will organize the gangs with the scaling ladders and grappling hooks see they all get up on top of that wall and no blunders v the rat captains marched off to the ditch to make ready cluny held his tail up to give the signal on top of the wall the mouse archers kept up their relentless hail of arrows into the ditch constance strode up and down holding a heavy cudgel in her paws as she urged them on thats the stuff to give em mice keep those bows twang knowing the supply of arrows was not endless the badger looked to the heaps of rubble and stone along the parapet edges brother rufus foremole be ready to shift that lot overboard at a moments notice smack clank bang thud a hail of sharp stones and pebbles whizzed upwards rattling against the masonry as cluny waved his tail in the meadow below taken unawares several mice were felled and a mole lay stunned get your heads down everyone lie flat constance shouted the defenders instantly obeyed as the showers of missiles increased running along the ramparts bent double the abbot cried out stretcher bearers over here help me to get the casualties down into the cloisters winifred the otter lay alongside constance and whispered to her hear that scraping clunys lot are putting something against the walls its my guess theyll be trying to climb up while weve got to lie low even as winifred spoke two grappling hooks with climbing ropes attached came clanging over the parapet and lodged in the joints stay low my friends whispered constance give them a bit of time to get off the ground i want plenty of rats to be high up before we make a move pass the word along below in the meadow redtooth waved his cutlass and laughed wildly your plan is working out chief look theres old fangbum and his gang nearly at the top of the wall cluny lifted his visor to get a better view it was too late to call out against what he saw happen next a veritable avalanche of earth and rocks cascaded over the parapet it smashed straight on to the main ladder rats screamed aloud and grasped at midair as they were swept from the ladder to the road below the ladder fell sideways cannoning into another one that had been set up beside it as both ladders fell there were scenes of mass chaos badly wounded and shocked the survivors on the roadway tried to crawl back to the safety of the ditch only to be buried beneath rubble which thundered down on them many lay trapped beneath the heavy ladders that had fallen the air resounded with screams and moans cluny ranted and swore leaving his standard he rushed across the meadow taking the ditch in a single leap he darted across the road grasping a hanging rope he began hauling himself up claw over claw as the solitary beaver gnawed through the last strands the rope parted cluny fell from a fair height and sprawled on the dusty road in an undignified heap cluny flung himself into the ditch regrouping the slingthrowers and a few archers he ordered them to await his command at the top of the walls the last climbing rope had been severed a hearty cheer rent the air as the redwall defenders broke cover to survey their handiwork fire cluny roared stones and arrows sped upward with devastating effect several mice and woodlanders cried out and fell the results heartened cluny all was not lost he began devising a new plan in mossflower wood ragear was struggling with the rope that bound him to the oak tree he could hear faroff sounds which meant only one thing his chief was attacking the abbey straining his neck downwards at an uncomfortable angle ragear was able to get his teeth into the tough climbing rope if he could manage to free himself he might be able to sneak back and join the horde he could mingle with them and deny that he had ever been missing cluny might also take a lenient view of his desertion if he could distinguish himself during the battle the rope tasted foul ragear could tell by its scent that it had once belonged to shadow hed never liked that surly pokerfaced rodent ragear congratulated himself as his teeth bit through another strand ha take that rope and that no rope can keep ragear prisoner for long he he he poor old shadow if only you ould see your lovely rope now ragear straightened up for a moment to ease his neck the laughter died on his lips a horrified gurgle bubbled from his throat icy claws of terror gripped his chest swaying hypnotically a foot from his face was the biggest strongest most evillooking adder that had ever been born the rat was completely petrified the breath seemed to freeze in his lungs the sinister blunt head moved in a lazy rhythm its forked tongue flickering endlessly in and out the round beadlike jet eyes never leaving his for an instant its voice was like dry leaves rustling in an autumn breeze asmodeus asmodeussssssss it hissed so kind of you to untie yourself rat come with me i will show you eternity asmodeus asmodeussssssss it struck with lightning speed all that ragear felt was a sudden sharp sting to the side of his neck his limbs became flaccid his eyesight shrouded by a dark mist the last words ragear ever heard on this earth were uttered in the adders sibilant hiss asmodeus asmodeusssssssssss cluny scratched the floor of die ditch with his claw it was all there the design for his next move he would attack the abbey secretly from the mossflower side it would be a surprise maneuver a handpicked squad led by him would carry out the mission dressed in clunys war helmet and armor redtooth would stay back in the meadow his disguise would be sufficient to fool the defenders from the distance of the high walls the rats in the ditch were ordered to continue pressing home the attack until cluny and his party scaled the walls from behind and fought their way across the grounds to open the abbey gates after issuing orders to his remaining captains cluny accompanied by a score of assorted rats weasels stoats and ferrets crept off along the course of the ditch they carried with them the long plank from st ninians lychgate fence silently they traveled in a northerly direction until they were out of sight of the walls climbing out of the ditch they crossed the road into mossflower wood cluny sat on a fallen tree trunk and told his squad what was required of them ill wait here with the plank carriers the rest of you split up and search the area for any big high trees growing near the abbey walls make sure that the tree you pick is higher than the wall itself and not too difficult to climb got that right get going cluny watched them strike off into the undergrowth his previous good mood had deserted him he was working himself into a foul temper over the days performance by his mighty conquering horde shown up by the simple tactics of woodland creatures and mice he snorted and dug his powerful claws into the rotten tree trunk sending beetles and woodlice scurrying as he tore out a chunk of the spongy timber oh he had had them frightened at first as a commander he knew the power of fright but once they had gained the upper hand in the initial skirmish the mice lost their fear and became bolder that was when the battle had started to go against him granted he had scored one or two small victories but they were nothing to brag about he couldnt use them as an example to put fresh heart in his troops clunys only hope was that the mice would become overconfident and eventually make a mistake it was the old waiting game just let them make one slip that was all he needed meanwhile he had a greater obstacle to overcome man mice the walls it was those same accursed walls that were ruining all his plans cluny tore viciously at the rotting log until great chunks of it flew through the air if this scheme worked he wouldnt have to worry about walls anymore he would be inside those walls like a fox among dayold chickens chiny sniffed the air his senses told him the searchers were returning cheesethief and a ferret named killconey came crashing out of the underbrush they were trembling and twitching both looked as if they had been badly scared it was some time before cluny could get any sense out of mem cheesethief spoke haltingly glancing back fearfully over his shoulder er er we like we got a bit lost chief lost where cluny snarled killconey pointed a shaky claw over that way yer honor and didnt we find a great strappin oak was it close to the wall cheesethief shook his head no chief it was further out into the woods look what found wrapped around the trunk he held out the chewed and broken climbing rope cluny snatched it this looks like shadows climbing rope hes dead what are you fools trying to tell me killconey whimpered pitifully its ragear yer honor cluny seized the unlucky pair and shook them soundly have you both gone raving mad dyou mean to tell me youre frightened of that fool ragear cheesethief fell to his knees sobbing but you didnt see him chief he was just lying there his face was all swollen and his tongue was sticking out it had gone purple ugh he was all sort of bloated like it was horrible killconey bobbed his head vigorously in agreement aye so twas didnt we see him with our very own eyes sir pore ould ragear and him going backwards all the time going backwards echoed cluny indeed he was said the ferret and your man here says to me says he theres something pulling ragear along sure we couldnt see what it was for all the bushes so we pulled them to one side between us and what did we see well what did you see barked cluny irritably killconey stopped and shuddered he spoke incredulously as if he were unable to believe himself we saw the biggest snake you ever clapped eyes on the father of all serpents he had poor ragears body by the feet and was dragging it along backwards clunys one eye widened what did this serpent do when it saw you it let go of ragear and looked at us squeaked cheesethief the serpent stared at us it kept on saying asmodeus asmodeus cluny scratched his head with a sharp dirty claw asmodeus whats that supposed to mean do ye not know tis the dreaded name of the divvil himself sir wailed the ferret i know because me ould mother told me so and she always said never to look a serpent in the eye so i sez to me mate here cheesethief sez i dont look run for your life and thats exactly what we did sir oh youll never know how horrible it was id rather be tied in a blazin barn than go back there so i would the great scaly body of the quiet fool said cluny i think i hear the others coming back now straighten yourselves up and not a word to anyone about this serpent thing or youll feel my serpent across your backs clunys long tail waved menacingly under their noses they took his point a weasel called scragg came running up he reported smartly with great efficiency high tree near the abbey wall chief elm i think much higher than the wall lots of branches jutting out just the job for climbing how far to this tree cluny asked about ten minutes march to the east scragg replied when the rest of the party arrived back cluny had them form up in single file they marched eastwards at a smart pace the high tree did prove to be an elm an ancient giant covered in gnarled bumps and handy branches cluny sized it up exactly what he wanted the perfect distance from the wall he turned to his commando squad listen were going to climb this tree when we get up high enough ill find a strong branch that we can bridge to the wall with the plank if we go carefully the mice wont suspect a thing before they can gather their wits about them well be inside redwall it was difficult to tell who was the more surprised matthias and his party or the rat sentries there was a seconds pause then they scattered one or two of the rats were a bit slow off the mark but not as slow as colin vole and his mother who were roughly grabbed by the faster sentries matthias dodged wriggled and ran free tripping a rat who was about to seize mr vole the young mouse ran pushing the vole in front of him and calling out run keep going mr vole try to make it to the woods and hide the vole faltered but my wife colin the rats have got them matthias pushed him roughly forward theyll get you too if you dont hurry move yourself vole youll be no good to your family as a prisoner again taking matthiass advice abram vole ran as fast as his legs would carry him matthias turned and picked up a heavy branch he faced the oncoming rats only a dozen of you he taunted lets see what you rats are made of first come first served matthias swung the branch it whooshed through the air causing the rats to stop in their tracks as he advanced on them flailing the branch he shouted at the top of his voice basil basil stag hare where are you the rats tried to circle matthias one got too near a hefty mow from the improvised staff sent him crashing to die ground oh wdl hit sir jolly well hit it was die hare he came bounding up for all the world as if he were on a sunday school picnic grinning from ear to ear colin and mrs vole came panting in his wake matthias gasped with relief basil where in heavens name did you get to the skillful creature dodged a rat spun round and landed a fierce doublefooted kick to its stomach the rat bowled over completely winded all the fight knocked out of its body basil chuckled sorry about that matthias my old lad when these chaps gave up chasing me i scooted back to my den spring cleaning yknow a bit late but im only a bachelor in single quarters what matthias was flabbergasted here he was fighting off a dozen rats trying to rescue the vole family while basil was dusting out his den the young mouse could scarcely hold his temper oh how nice of you mr hare so glad you could join us he said sarcastically as they beat off rats and hurried die voles along dont suppose you put the kettle on for tea basil bowed to mrs vole and offered her his paw allow me maam why yes as a matter of fact i did nothing like a fresh pot of mint tea after some good healthy exercise what what matthias struck a rat square in the face with the butt of his branch the hare was obviously insane mint tea indeed well i dont suppose you think im going to sit in your den drinking tea all afternoon he yelled basil had a hammerlock on a rat he swung him and knocked two more flat on the ground he winked at matthias certainly hope not old bean you see itd be perishin awkward as ive only got a fourpiece teaset and if im not mistaken the small gent who took off for the woods tike a scalded duck is obviously the husband of this delightful lady vole so have to invite him too wont i matthias tripped a rat with the branch he was learning to take basil in his stride why of course you will mr hare what a bore you must think me ill probably sit around on the common here and teach the rats to make daisy chains basil dodged around a rat and laughed approvingly no need to get uppity young feller i thought id best shelter the voles and see em safe to the abbey later obviously you need to get back to redwall posthaste a family of voles would only slow you up matthias grinned ruefully i apologize sir i accept your offer of help gratefully i didnt mean to be rude by now they were at the edge of the common land the rats had fallen back momentarily basil shook paws with matthias good mouse right cut along young un ill see you when i deliver my charges back to the abbey alone and unencumbered matthias struck off into the woods traveling doggedly on wearied legs he realized that his entry to redwall would have to be from the mossfiower side as the main gate would probably be under attack could the defenders hold out was constance organizing the retaliation correctly without him had the sentries stayed alert was cornflower safe questions raced through matthiass brain as he fought his way through the undergrowth taking a check on his bearings he began to worry a little the abbey walls should be in sight over towards the northwest perhaps he hadnt fully realized the sprawling size of the woodlands yes that was it maybe if he kept on trekking the walls would soon come into view from somewhere ahead matthias could hear the trickle and gurgle of a stream he remembered that it had been some time since he had eaten and drunk changing direction he followed the water sounds until he came to the banks of the stream lying face down on a low outcrop of red sandstone matthias drank his fill of the cool sweet stream water further down the bank he found some young dandelions gathering a bunch of tender leaves and buds he made his way back to the sunwarmed sandstone and stretched out on his back nibbling dandelions and gazing up at the cloudless blue june sky through the treetops what an actionpacked day it had been matthias was glad of the brief respite after all the excitement but he told himself that he could not afford to stay long he must press on to redwall he heaved a great sigh the life of a warrior was very tiring closing his eyes momentarily he thought of martin the warrior did he ever feel tired he must have defending the abbey with his large heavy sword wearing all that armor whatever happened to the sword it had to be somewhere legendary weapons didnt rust and wear away to nothing otherwise theyd never get to be legends a dragonfly hovered directly above the young mouse gently stirring his whiskers what was this strange creature doing in his territory he glided a little closer it was quite safe the oddly garbed animal posed no threat to his authority as bailiff of this stretch of water he was fast asleep snoring like a squirrel in midwinter oblivious to all about him o it was late afternoon there had been one or two minor setbacks but ctuny and his squad had finally made it up into the elm tree some of the rats were really hopeless climbers in clunys estimation there had been quite a bit of jostling and slipping and as for that idiot cheesethief imagine waiting until you were six yards above ground to find out that you were afraid and had no head for heights cluny thought angrily that if there hadnt been such an urgent need for silence hed have given him what for the warlord began to wish that he had brought along more ferrets and weasels they possessed good natural climbing ability and that weasel what was his name scragg hed been an enormous help boosting and encouraging the others even organizing the lifting up of the plank cluny made a mental note for future reference officer material that one despite all efforts however they were still below the edge of die parapet higher up the elm branches became thin and whippy not strong enough to support the planks weight cluny took stock of the situation this was really as far as he could go while still retaining some kind of safety factor on their hazardous assignment he decided to call a halt right take a breather find somewhere that you wont fall from in an hour or two itll be evening therell be lots of shadow and less daylight the mice will have slowed up a bit by then well catch them oil guard scragg see this lot keep still and quiet will you scragg saluted smartly and offered a helpful comment this branch im sitting on chief ive just been testing it and it feels good and strong maybe we should mount the plank from here to the wall itll reach easily enough i know its a bit of an uphill climb but it shouldnt be too difficult i dont fancy those branches higher up theyre too thin cluny climbed across and sat next to scragg he spoke in a whisper good thinking weasel yes this branchll do fine stick by me scragg youre a useful soldier with some of the blockheads ive got around me i could be on the lookout for a new captain soon you know what that means extra loot a bigger share of the plunder cluny always rewards initiative scragg play your cards right and youll soon get promotion thanks chief dont worry i wont let you down scragg murmured on a lower branch cheesethief sneered inwardly yes chief no chief three bags full chief who did that snotty weasel think he was and as for cluny promoting a weasel to captain over rats of his own kind well redtooth and darkclaw and the others might have something to say about that upstart weasel hed only joined up a day or two ago if he got half the chance cheesethief would fix scragg all right abbot mortimer looked thankfully up at the sky evening had come they had lasted out well the rats had not breached die wall in any way most of the main fighting had gone into a lull clunys horde was only making spasmodic sallies from the ditch now taking advantage of the interval the defenders hauled up more rocks and rubble to the ramparts cornflower and her band of helpers were on top of the walls keeping their heads low they moved from post to post serving each creature with a bowl of stew some wild grapes and a small teaf of honeyed nutbread what a calm efficient young mouse cornflower is the abbot remarked to constance the badger passed a bundle of arrows to ambrose spike for distribution as she replied aye that she is father abbot but she looks worried matthias do you think doubtless said the abbot dryly that young mouse is on my mind as well as hers and yours constance shook her large striped head its not like matthias to go off like that ive searched everywhere in my spare moments but hes not in the abbey well wherever he is the abbot replied im certain that he is helping our cause so well just have to await his return and trust to matthiass judgment and good sense the two friends thankfully accepted food from cornflower and her helpers both watched mystified as winifred the otter and foremole hoisted and pulled a seesaw into view it was a plaything made in the distant past for the use of infant woodlanders it had lain near the strawberry patch for as long as anyone could remember baby animals played on it throughout the year as a seesaw it was in perfect working order winifred and foremole set it down on the parapet bent double two moles staggered up carrying between mem an enormous rock foremole indicated the opposite end of the seesaw arr purrumthur thats a noice bowlder my beauties when the bowlder was in position winifred and foremole hugged each other tightly with a nod they jumped heavily on to the near seat whoosh the big rock catapulted over the top of the parapet several seconds of silence followed then there was a crash accompanied by screams of pain and shock from the rats packed into the ditch below winifred and foremole gravely shook paws yurr oi reckon they pesky varmints gotn an eadache chuckled foremole as everybody on the ramparts ran to seek cover from the retaliatory missiles hurled by clunys horde the battle had started again in earnest mouse archers sprang up and loosed their shafts down towards the ditch otter slingthrowers whipped hard pebbles off with fierce rapidity long rat javelins flew upwards causing death and injury in the ranks of the defenders but now there was a new hazard some inventive rat had devised a fearsome weapon chunks of iron graverailings from the churchyard strung to lengths of cord the rats would swing the cord round and round gaining momentum until judging the right direction they loosed the cord the missiles sped upwards two or three times higher than the wall almost out of sight then they would plummet downwards whistling viciously to burst on the ramparts any defender struck by a missile was either instantly killed or horribly maimed even if the iron missed its target the stones and shattered metal fragments ricocheted about dangerously realizing the danger of this new device constance ordered all but a chosen few to leave the wall for the safety of the abbey grounds however the strung iron bits soon proved to be a twoedged weapon many that were released wrongly came hurtling back down into the ditch sometimes slaying the very creatures that had hurled them even redtooth in clunys armor guarding the standard in the meadow had to make an undignified scurry to avoid being hit but he could see the demoralizing effect the missiles were having on the defenders so he ordered the throwers to continue constance bravely stood her ground on the parapet as did her small band of picked fighters whenever one of the missiles landed intact on the rubble pile she would seize it standing in fall view as she whirled the corded iron round and round releasing it in a blur of speed constance was a far more powerful and accurate thrower than any rat the attackers bared angry fangs at her from the cover of the ditch of all the redwall defenders the big badger was the one they most hated and feared seated in the branches of the elm tree at the north wall of the abbey cluny watched the shadows lengthen to the west the sky was crimson with sunset soon he would raise the plank to the parapet then let them beware no tinpot order of mice was going to stand against the might of cluny the scourge methuselah the gatehousekeeper stood facing the damaged tapestry in the great hall of redwall being too old for active battle service he reasoned that the best way he could serve his order was by putting his fertile brain to work somewhere there had to be at least a clue a single lead that might tell him where the resting place of martin the warrior could be found or where he could regain possession of the ancient sword for his abbey but where every now and then over he years methuselah had searched through redwall for martin and his sword now he stepped up his questing activities alas with no success vital dues and answers still eluded him what he needed was a younger fresher mind to assist him what a pity that matthias could not be found now there was a young mouse with a head on his shoulders long years and much mental strain had taken their toll on the ancient mouse wearily he swayed on his feet and putting out a paw to steady himself he touched the wall the exact patch of stone over which martins likeness had once hung methuselah gave a sigh of satisfaction and allowed a small smile to creep across his features his search had not been in vain beneath his paw there was writing carved into the dustcovered wall book two the quest matthias came awake slowly he blinked yawned and stretched his body luxuriously the sun was setting turning the little stream into a flow of molten red and gold tinged with deep shadow he lay calm savoring the peace and quiet of the woodland summer evening reality struck him like a thunderbolt he sprang to his feet instantly forgetting the beauty that surrounded him lying there snoring and sleeping like a lazy little idiot and all the while redwall abbey and his friends were under attack furious with himself matthias strode off angrily into the darkening trees he could find no words strong enough to express his selfcontempt it was not until he had blundered and crashed along his way for some time wildly upbraiding himself that he calmed down with the realization that he was well and truly lost no tree path or landmark looked remotely familiar he despaired of ever seeing redwall again night closed in on the small mouse wandering alone in the depths of mossflower wood strange imaginary shapes bitted about in the gloom eerie cries pierced the still air trees and bushes reached out their branches to catch and scratch like living things with claws trembling matthias took refuge in an old beech trunk that had once been riven by lightning gradually he became critical of himself again the great warrior frightened of the dark like a baby churchmouse from somewhere overhead he heard a in scratching noise summoning up all his courage he banished his fears drawing shadows dagger he stepped out into the open calling aloud in what he hoped was a gruff voice whos doing all that scratching and scraping come out and show yourself if you are a friend but if its a rat out there then youd best start running otherwise youll have to deal with me matthias a warrior of red wall having spoken his piece matthias felt his confidence surge back he stood tense and alert however he received no answer save the mocking echo of his own voice ringing back at him through the dark woodlands a slight noise at his back caused matthias to wheel about with die dagger upraised he found himself confronted by a baby red squirrel it gazed up at him curiously sucking noisily on its paw matthias practically dropped the dagger through laughing so much so this was the nameless terror that stalked the night the tiny creature continued sucking its paw shifting from foot to foot its bushy tail curled up over the small back higher than the tips of its ears matthias stooped speaking gently for fear of frightening the infant hello there my names matthias whats yours the baby squirrel continued sucking on its paw do your mummy and daddy kndw you are out it nodded its head are you lost little one it shook its head do you talk it shook its head do you often wander about like this at night it nodded matthias smiled disarmingly he threw his paws open wide im lost he said the pawsucking continued without comment i come from redwall abbey suck suck suck do you know where that is the baby squirrel nodded matthias was overjoyed oh my little friend please could you show me the way he asked it nodded thank you very much the tiny squirrel hopped and shuffled a short way into the woods turning to matthias it took its paw from its mouth and beckoned him to follow he needed no second urging suck suck suck well at least matthias thought aloud if lose sight of this fellow ill be able to hear him the baby squirrel smiled and nodded and sucked abbot mortimer sat in the grass of the abbey cloisters all around him the defenders who had been sent down from the wall lay in slumber not knowing when the rats were going to stop fighting and realizing that they might not the kindly abbot advised those who had been relieved to try and get some sleep methuselah came shuffling up with a sigh and a groan he sat down on the grass alongside his abbot who greeted him courteously good evening brother methuselah the old gatehousekeeper adjusted his spectacles and sniffed the air and a good evening to you father abbot how goes the battle against the rats the abbot folded his paws within his wide sleeves it goes well for us old one though how i can say that anything goes well which causes death and injury to living creatures is beyond me we live in strange times my friend methuselah grinned and wrinkled his nose but still it goes well indeed it does but why do you smile methuselah what secret are you keeping from me ah father abbot you read me like a book i do have a secret but trust me all will be made known to you in the fullness of time the abbot shrugged no doubt it will but please make it soon we are not getting any younger you and i come now said methuselah compared with me you are still a mouse in your prime yet like many others that think my senses are failing you cannot see half the things that my old eyes observe how so inquired the abbot methuselah touched a paw to his nose knowingly for instance did you notice that there is a southerly breeze tonight no i dont suppose you did then look at the top of that old elm tree sticking up above the wall yes that one over by the small door tell me what you see the abbots eyes followed methuselahs paw until he saw the tree in question he studied it for a moment then turned to the old mouse i see the top of an old elm tree growing out in the woods but what is unusual about that methuselah shook his head reprovingly he still cannot see dear me if the breeze is blowing from the south then die elm tree would move its leaves and branches in a northerly direction as it has always done but that particular tree is choosing to disobey nature it is swaying from east to west this can mean only one thing somebody is using that tree for a purpose at least that is what i think do you agree without replying or showing any sign of alarm whatsoever die abbot arose walking calmly over to the gatehouse wall he beckoned silently to constance the badger descended the steps she held a whispered conference with the abbot nodding in the direction of the elm less than a minute later constance accompanied by winifred the otter ambrose spike and a few others padded carefully along the top of the wall taking great pains not to be seen on the woodland side cluny whispered commands to his followers as they pushed the plank towards the wall from their perch in the elm tree steady now cheesethief you moron keep your end up keep it going upwards not down cheesethief struggled to obey it was all right for the chief sitting back there giving out his orders he didnt have to balance with one claw while pushing a silly plank about with die other cheesethief slipped with a squeak of dismay he let go of the plank it clattered against a branch fortunately scragg the weasel was on the alert he caught the end of the plank steadying it cheesethief regained his balance and clung miserably to his perch as cluny hissed in rage at him clown bungling buffoon get out of the way shift your fat idle carcass and let scragg take over burning with resentment cheesethief was shoved unceremoniously aside cluny aimed a kick at him as the efficient weasel took his place you just sit there and be still cluny snarled and try not to make enough noise to waken the entire abbey scragg moved with skill and economy issuing quiet confident directions to the others up a bit left a touch take it forward steady now good hold it the long plank snaked out and upwards coming to rest gently but firmly on the parapet edge scragg saluted cluny plank in position and ready chief cheesethief shot scragg a venomous glance cluny climbed on to the plank and tested it the improvised bridge wobbled and sprang a bit but it held cluny turned to the raiding party ill go first wed better have only one at a time on the plank when im on the parapet ill steady the other end scragg you come next the rest of you follow cluny held on to branches for as long as he could soon he was out on the middle of the plank with nothing to steady him trying hard not to glance downwards at the dizzying drop he inched his way up the plank towards the wall cluny was almost in reach of his goal when constance appeared on the parapet she gave the plank a mighty kick sending it off into space with a shout of dismay cluny plunged earthwards snapping branches as he went winifred fired off a pebble from her sling knocking a ferret clean out of his perch into empty space scragg still held one end of the plank he leaned precariously out from the elm to see where cluny fell seizing his opportunity for revenge cheesethief shoved scragg hard in the back the weasel dropped like a stone with the plank on top of him clunys followers were kicking at each other and screaming as they tried to clamber down from die high elm branches leaning across the parapet constance and her friends watched the panicstricken animals descending winifred the otter managed to speed up the retreat with a few wellaimed stones from her sling the defenders viewed their work with grim satisfaction ambrose spike squinted shortsightedly down at the darkened woodland floor he tried to assess the casualties how many did we get he inquired hard to tell in this light replied winifred but id swear that was cluny constance tipped off the plank the badgers brow creased she shot a quizzical glance at die otter so you saw him too im glad you did i thought i was seeing double for a moment back there how could cluny be in two places at once im sure i saw him standing in the meadow not ten minutes ago winifred shrugged well lets just hope that it was cluny personally pd like to think that hes lying somewhere down there now dead as a doornail constance peered downwards difficult to say really there seem to be around half a dozen or so laid out down there cant tell for sure too much shadow and darkness still i dont think any creature could survive a fall from this height maybe wed better go and see suggested ambrose the defenders looked towards constance maybe not said the badger thoughtfully no i dont hke it it suddenly strikes me that this could be a diversionary tactic to draw us away from the gatehouse wall if it was cluny who fell from die plank all well and good but if it wasnt then hes still around the front it wont serve any useful purpose counting dead bodies lets get back to the main action led by constance the defenders riled hurriedly off cheesethief slunk cautiously out of the undergrowth it was safe to move now the woodlanders had gone from the parapet behind him limping and complaining came the survivors of the illfated raiding party cheesethief ignored them as he moved among the bodies that had fallen from the high branches four rats a ferret and one weasel three of the rats and the ferret were dead they lay where they had fallen their limbs in grotesque positions the survivors immediately pounced upon the bodies of their fallen comrades plundering weapons and objects of clothing that they had coveted cheesethief stood riveted by the single eye cluny was alive beneath the plank scragg stirred and groaned amazingly he too had survived cheesethief sprang into action surprised that scragg still lived but fatalistically accepting that nothing could kill cluny quick get that plank over here you lot weve got to get the chief out of here using the plank as an improvised stretcher they carefully lifted cluny on to it cheesethief knew cluny was watching him tenderly he lifted the dangling tail and arranged it gently alongside his leader try not to move chief lie still well soon get you back to camp the stretcher bearers moved off slowly through the woods cheesethief avoided clunys eye an idea was taking form in his mind he sniffed piteously wiping an imaginary tear from his cheek poor old scragg what a good weasel i think hes still alive listen you lot carry on and get the chief home safely ill double back and see if i can help scragg cheesethief sniggered to himself as the survivors disappeared into the night carrying cluny on the plank matthias followed the baby squirrel through bramble and bush whenever he tried to communicate all that he received was a nod or a shake of the tiny creatures head they had been traveling for quite a long time as the pale fingers of dawn crept across the sky matthias was beginning to doubt that his companion knew the way then suddenly the little fellow pointed to the east with his paw in the distance matthias could make out the shape of the abbey theres no place like home he said thankfully what a splendid pathfinder you are my friend still sucking his paw the small squirrel smiled shyly he took hold of matthiass tail as they went forwards together the mouse talking animatedly the squirrel nodding vigorously ill take you to friar hugos kitchen and see that he gives you the nicest breakfast youve ever had now what do you say to that suck suck nod nod when matthias arrived at the wall he felt like patting the old red sandstone he turned to his companion this is where i live a noise nearby caused them both to freeze momentarily it sounded like some creature groaning instinctively matthias and the squirrel ducked down among the ferns cautiously they crept along in the direction of the sounds silently parting the ferns they gazed in horror at the dreadful scene around the base of the elm tree among the dead animals that lay stretched in unnatural attitudes was a badly injured weasel he was moaning and twitching fitfally before either of the friends could decide what to do a rat appeared on the scene they remained motionless cheesethief was in a cheery mood he hummed happily under his breath as he prodded scragg with his foot scragg wake up its me cheesethief oh come on now im sure you remember me the stupid one the rat whose job you were going to take scraggs eyes were barely open he groaned in agony cheesethief cocked a mockingly sympathetic ear whats that scragg my old mate tired are you yes you must be lying there like that tell you what ill help you to go to sleep shall i the rat placed his foot on the weasels throat and began pressing down scragg struggled feebly fighting for breath unable to stop his tormentor cheesethief took malicious pleasure in his revenge cruelly he leaned his full weight upon die weasels rasping throat hush now go to sleep scragg dream of the command you never had scragg made one final gurgling whimper and lay still cheesethief slunk off chuckling with satisfaction hidden in the ferns matthias and the baby squirrel held their breath in disbelief they had seen murder committed matthias and the squirrel waited until they were sure the coast was clear at last they emerged from the ferns and matthias cupping his paws round his mouth ventured a low halloo up at the wall there was no reply the little squirrel shook his head he pointed to the floor with his paw in a gesture that matthias interpreted as stop here with breathtaking speed and skill the tiny creature raced up the trunk of the old elm reaching the thin branches above the parapet he ran out along one using it as a springboard he bounced nimbly on to the ramparts and vanished sucking fiercely at his paw matthias had not long to wait before the small door in the wall nearby grated open on its rusty hinges and constance peered cautiously out seeing matthias she ran to greet him with the little squirrel perched upon her back matthias was not sure what sort of a reception was in store for him he need not have worried constance hugged him patted his back and shook him by the paw the badger forestalled the explanation that was upon the young mouses lips she beckoned matthias inside shutting the door behind them you can tell us everything later matthias right now i insist that you come to the main gate theres something you must see a minute or two later all four were standing on the gatehouse wall shoulder to shoulder with countless other defenders clunys horde was retreating back down the road to their camp at st ninians church there was a wild cheering from the ranks of the mice and woodlanders cluny was being borne upon the plank in the midst of his army redtooth who was still disguised in the warlords battlearmor had draped a blanket over cluny to hide him and keep up the masquerade but nobody was fooled both sides of the wall had heard the tale of misadventure in all its gory detail they knew that the strutting rat in armor was not cluny the scourge redtooth nevertheless strode proudly along cluny might not recover besides he reveled in the respect that he received dressed as he was in such barbaric finery he knew that it was only borrowed plumage but he could always hope that die position might become permanent on top of the gatehouse ramparts feelings ran high the abbot had issued strict orders that no missiles or weaponry be discharged at the enemy in retreat amid the cheering there was quite a bit of resentful grumbling why not smash clunys army once and for all now that they were on the run this was the proper time to consolidate a resounding redwall victory but the good father abbot would not hear of it like a true gentlemouse he believed in tempering triumph with mercy thejubilatory sounds died away to an eerie silence as die rats toiled raggedly off down the road raising a column of dust in the early dawn dispirited and battleworn carrying their fallen leader the maimed and wounded hobbled painfully along at the rear the bitter ashes of vanquishment and defeat mingling with the dust from their stumbling vanguard even the silent victors began to realize that victory came at a high price freshly dug graves and a crowded infirmary bore silent witness to the reality of war matthias felt a gentle paw intertwining with his own it was cornflower relief showed in her eyes and her voice oh matthias thank goodness you are back safe it wasdreadful not knowing where you were or what had become of you i thought youd never come back im like an old bad penny i always come back matthias whispered oh by the way how is your father cornflower brightened up hes made a marvelous recovery he refused to lie in bed and has been up on the wall helping out you cant keep a good fieldmouse down my dad always says matthias barely had time to bid cornflower a hasty goodbye before he was ushered off to the abbots room for an early morning conference he took his seat and looked around the table there were constance ambrose winifred foremole the abbot and also his friend the baby squirrel he stood on a stool dipping his paw into a bowl of milk and honey sucking it with noisy enjoyment i think that you would have been in trouble without silent sam here matthias the abbot said the young mouse nodded i certainly would father abbot so thats his name silent sam well he certainly lives up to it indeed he does replied the abbot his mother and father are old friends of mine theyll pick up his tracks and be along here later to collect him do you know this little chap hasnt spoken since he was born ive tried every remedy known to redwall on him but none has worked so he was named silent sam but dont let that fool you he knows mossflower wood like the back of his paw dont you sam the tiny squirrel licked his paw and smiled he indicated a large circle with it pointing at himself with his unsticky paw matthias reached over and shook the paw heartily my thanks to you silent sam you are truly a great pathfinder during the meeting there was much useful information exchanged matthias told of the rescue at st ninians and his encounter with the strange hare surely you dont mean basil stag hare cried constance well i never is that old eccentric still bobbing around i expect well see him turn up with the vole family around about lunchtime i never knew basil to miss the chance ofa free lunch back in the old days the assembled creatures passed on a vote of thanks to matthias for his resourcefulness and bravery matthias blushed then he sat listening intently while those who had taken part in the battle recounted all they could remember in the aftermath of that memorable conflict there was much speculation as to what the future held would cluny recover from his injuries had his horde been so soundly defeated that they had learned their lesson or would they be back it was the abbots opinion that cluny and his rabble would not bother redwall again their leaders injuries would doubtless prove fatal this statement was strongly opposed by the others and constance was elected to speak for them cluny is still the prime factor said the badger that rat is physically tougher than we could ever imagine it is only a matter of time until he recovers sufficiently to attack us again constance pounded upon the table with a heavy paw emphasizing each word and make no mistake about it cluny the scourge will attack redwall again id stake my life on it think for a moment if cluny were to give up the idea of conquering this abbey he would lose both face and credibility with the army he commands furthermore and most important of all word would spread across the land that cluny was not invincible that he could be beaten by mice this would mean the end of cluny as a legend of terror so you see when cluny recovers he will be virtually forced to mount a second assault upon redwall there was a sober silence around the table the abbot arose he had arrived at a decision so be it i have listened to your counsel and opinions my dear and trusted friends although i yearn for peace i feel that i must base my judgment on your words which i know to be true therefore my power as abbot and any assistance that i can give are yours for the asking it is my wish that constance matthias winifred ambrose and foremole take complete command at redwall in the event of a second invasion i will concern myself with aiding the injured and feeding the hungry and now my friends i must adjourn this meeting as i have other matters to attend to come sam we must wash those sticky little paws before your parents arrive oh and before i forget matthias brother methuselah would like to talk with you he is in great hall cluny the scourge lay upon his bed racked with crippling pains rat captains gathered in the corner ofthe sickroom they sat silent the terrible injuries would have proved fatal to any other rat on earth but not to cluny a broken arm a broken leg numerous cracked ribs a fractured tail smashed claws and other hurts not yet diagnosed redtooth and four of the others might have set upon their leader and finished him off for good but the fear of his legendary powers was too strong nobody knew for sure the extent of clunys remorseless vitality watching him now the barrellike chest heaving up and down the stillstrong tail swishing spasmodically redtooth marveled at clunys strength he was not even sure if cluny was shamming pretending that his injuries were severe merely as some kind of test or trap that he had set for his captains the twelve sentry rats were locked in the hut they had been set to guard it was now repaired they had been soundly flogged for letting the vole family escape as a further punishment for concocting lies about a big hare and a young mouse redtooth ordered that the twelve be starved until further notice he had been lenient with them cluny would have sentenced them to death and personally killed them with his bare claws outside in the churchyard the leaderless horde did absolutely nothing to reorganize sitting about licking their wounds and waiting for the chief to recover seemed to be the order of the day again the mouse warrior armed with his ancient sword returned to haunt clunys fevered dreams once more he was falling from the plank on the abbey wall falling falling below him waited spectral figures ragear with a blue face bloated to many rimes its normal size a ratskeleton dressed in clunys own battle armor a huge hare with enormous feet and a thickbodied venomouslooking banded snake hetried to twist away from them as he fell but however much he swerved and tried to change direction cluny had only to look down and see the fierceeyed warrior mouse waiting always waiting the sword held point upwards for him to be impaled upon cluny tried to cry out but not a sound came it was as though his throat were being squeezed tightly he felt the sharp sword pierce his chest bong once more the sound of the joseph bell tolling out across the fields from redwall wakened the warlord fangburn who was trying to extract a piece of elm branch from his chiefs chest leaped backwards in fright as clunys eye snapped open inches from his own get away from me cluny rasped fangburn retreated mumbling excuses cluny eyed him suspiciously he didnt trust any of them if you really want to help go and get hold of some of those new recruits who live locally and bring them here to me he gasped within minutes fangburn had assembled a band of the recruits around clunys bed wheres scragg the weasel cluny growled cheesethief stepped forward wiping imaginary tears from his face with the back of a filthy claw dont you remember chief he fell out of the big tree after id taken care of you i went back for him but when i got to him the poor weasel was dead what a good kind ah shut your moaning face said cluny irritably if hes dead then thats that here you recruits come closer and listen to me apprehensively the little group shuffled forwards cluny raised himself slightly on one elbow do any of you know where a healer can be found i dont mean one like those mice i need a creature that knows the old ways a gypsy one who can cure anything for the right price killconey the ferret bowed elaborately ah tis your lucky day yer honor for dont i know the very vixen foxes echoed cluny aye foxes sir the ferret replied didnt me ould mother always used to say theres nothing like a fox to fix theres a whole tribe of em livin across the meadow sir old sela the vixen is the girl youll be wanting her and her son chickenhound theyll fix you up as right as rain if theres something in it for them does yer honor want me to fetch them slowly clunys tail wound itself about the ferrets neck drawing him in close get them cluny said hoarsely find the foxes and bring them here to me killconeys throat bulged as he tried nervously to swallow glug i will indeed if youll just let go of this pore ould ferrets neck sir ill go as fast as if the diwil himself was chasin me you lay back now and rest your noble self sir cluny released the ferret and lay back with an agonized sigh now was the time to think and plan ahead next time would be different redtooth he called take some soldiers and scout around see if you can find a great hard timber a big log or tree trunk something that will serve as a battering ram the mice might have won a battle but cluny had not yet lost the war by the claws of hellthunder those abbey mice were going to pay with blood for what they had done to cluny the scourge brother methuselah was busy with a small brush and a pot of black ink as he brushed the dust of ages from each letter on the wall he filled it in with ink this would make it easier to read the message that had been graven underneath the tapestry ah matthias there you are methuselah squeaked he blinked over the top of his glasses at the young mouselook this is something i want you to see quite by accident i discovered this writing beneath where martins picture once hung matthias was full of unconcealed excitement what does it say brother methuselah he cried the old gatehousekeeper sneezed as he brushed more dust from the lettering on the wall all in good time young mouse here make yourself useful you brush the dust off the words while i ink them in between us well soon get it done matthias set to work with an energetic goodwill he scrubbed vigorously sending up clouds of dust between sneezes methuselah hurried to keep pace with him one hour later they both sat on the stone floor drinking october ale to quench the dust while they admired their handiwork its written in the old hand said methuselah but i can read it clear enough matthias jostled him boisterously what does it say oldone hurry up and read it to me patience you young scallywag chided the ancient mouse be quiet and listen it takes the form of a poem who says that i am dead knows nought at all i am that is two mice within redwall the warrior sleeps twixt hall and cavern hole i am that is take on my mighty role look for the sword in moonlight streaming forth at night when days first hour reflects the north from oer the threshold seek and you will see i am that is my sword will wield for me matthias blinked and scratched his head he looked at methuselah well what did all that mean its a riddle to me precisely said die old mouse it is indeed a riddle but dont worry matthias we will solve it together i have sent for food and drink you and i will not move from here until we have the answer shortly afterwards cornflower arrived bearing a tray of breakfast for them both nutbread salad milk and some of friar hugos special quince pie she was about to strike up a conversation with matthias when methuselah sent her packing shoo away with you little fieldmouse i need matthias with a clear brain to help me solve an important problem so run along cornflower winked at matthias shook her head at methuselah and walked off with mock dignity her nose high in die air matthias watched her go until methuselah tweaked his ear pay attention now young mouse we must study this bit by bit lets take the first two tines who says that i am dead knows nought at all matthias waved a paw his mouth filled with salad he mumbled but we know that martin is dead methuselah took a sip of milk pulled a wry face and reached for his october ale ah but if we suppose that he is dead then the words tell us we know nothing at all so let us assume that he is alive what do you mean martin alive and walking about said matthias wed recognize him unless that is he was disguised as someone else the old gatehousekeeper choked spluttering ale over his habit good grief i never looked at it that way very good young one maybe the answer is in the next two lines what do they say iam that is two mice within redwall matthias repeated the words but he could make no sense of them iam that is what is two mice within redwall hmm two mice it tells of of two mice in one replied methuselah they sat silent awhile both racking their brains matthias mentioned something that was bothering him as he looked at the graven lines what i cannot understand is that sort of dash look am that is do you see there is a small dash between the words t and am in fact the same dash occurs three times throughout the rhyme here here and here matthias pointed methuselah adjusted his glasses and peered closely yes you may have something there it could be the key to the whole thing am that is lets say that the dash separates the line so that we will look at the last three words am that suppose we took that part out then it would read two mice within redwall matthias shook his head what do you make of that complete nonsense replied the old mouse lets stick with am that is sounds all mixed up to me matthias grumbled methuselah looked up sharply say that again say what again you mean that it sounds all mixed up to me methuselah executed a little jig of delight he patted the wall with his paw shouting thats it thats it why couldnt i see that its all mixed up of course the old mouse took a great draught of ale cackling with glee he pointed a paw at matthias i know something that you dont know am that is matthias the young mouse frowned so the old one had finally cracked he was in his second infancy methuselah he said kindly hadnt you better lie down awhile but the old gatehousekeeper kept pointing he began to chant matthias i that am matthias you that are the young mouse stood tapping his tail in exasperation i wish youd tell me what youre so excited about he said severely why are you saying my name methuselah wiped tears of laughter from his eyes as he explained when you said it was all mixed up that got me thinking martin was talking of two mice himself and another ergo martin is represented by the word i the other mouse is am that is all mixed up now do you see matthias leaned against the wall im afraid i dont follow you oh you young booby methuselah giggled i mixed the letters up and rearranged them its your own name am that is matthias are you sure said matthias in astonishment of course im sure replied methuselah it couldnt mean anything else your name has eight letters in it so has am that is an m two as two ts an h an i and an s whichever way you look at it matthias or am that is it comes out the same methuselah do you realize what this means the old mouse sat down beside him nodding gravely oh yes indeed i do it means that martin somehow knew that one day he would live on through you matthias was staggered he knew about me martin the warrior knew my name can you imagine that the enormity of it overwhelmed them both for several minutes they sat no word passing between them suddenly matthias leapt to his feet right lets get on with it look at these lines the warrior sleeps tivixt hall and cavern hole iam that is take on my mighty role well the last two lines are pretty clear said methuselah they mean that martin carrying on through you has a great task to perform what about the first two lines matthias said they seem fairly obvious too between great hall and cavern hole there is a flight of stairs come on old mouse in spite of his advanced years methuselah gripped matthiass paw and ran so fast that the younger mousehad difficulty in keeping up between great hall and cavern hole there were seven stone steps the problem was which one held the answer thinking caps on again said the old mouse lets make a close inspection of these steps together they examined the stone steps minutely going back over each one several times matthias sat on the bottom step he shrugged they appear to be seven ordinary broad stone steps nothing special quite the same as any other set of stairs in the abbey wouldnt you say methuselah was forced to agree after sitting awhile and letting his eyes roam about matthias remarked ive just noticed something the name of our abbey is carved into die wall as you go up the steps on the lefthand side and also as you descend on the righthand wall it reads redwall either way methuselah walked up and down the steps testing what matthias had said yes so it does do you see that each letter is one steps width hmmm seven letters for seven steps surely that must be some kind of a hint again the two friends sat to ponder the mystery this time it was matthiass turn to become excited and point a paw at his companion know something you dont know methuselah pursed his lips in annoyance you know matthias for a mouse that claims affinity with martin the warrior you can be singularly foolish sometimes huh no more foolish than you were when you were saying the same thing to me not so long ago matthias retorted methuselah coughed and cleaned his spectacles on his habit harrumph er yes well i apologize now please tell me what you have discovered matthias explained if you place the word redwall running both ways as it does here you will notice that only one letter occurs in the same place the letter w furthermore if you were to turn a w upside down it becomes a letter m which stands for martin matthias oh and also for methuselah my old friend well curl my whiskers the young scoundrel has a brain and it works too its got to be the fourth step the middle one up or down the step in question proved to be as solid and unmoving as its counterparts even with their combined strength the friends could not budge it a fraction matthias wiped sweat from his brow take a breather old one i know who can handle this foremole and his team the moles were not long in arriving they gathered around the step sniffing and scratching foremole exercised his authority clearing them out of his way yurr moles get outten th loight letn um dog at bone thurr foremole paced the length of the step then shuffled sideways over it he tapped it with his great digging claws he sniffed it licked it and rubbed it with his velvet head ummm worra youm gennelbeast know abouten this yurr step he asked together they related all the information to the attentive foremole he blinked shortsightedly as he ruminated arr fourthn uppards same downards yurr walt ark doby baint that same as your grandmum do foind when shem rooten about olden toim fortications whats he saying whispered matthias methuselah translated the curious mole dialect foremole said the fourth step upwards is the same as the fourth step down that much we already know then he consulted the two mole brothers walt and doby it seems the step is the same as one found by their grandmother when she was exploring an oldfashioned castle or fortification moles are very sensible creatures you know and think they have the answer to our problem good old foremole said matthias hush lets hear what walt and doby have to say whispered methuselah the two mole brothers respectfully tugged their noses to foremole before answering urr that be true zurr our grandmum shem foind lots o them aye that she do never diggen or breaken just turn em after dustin methuselah interpreted to matthias apparently their grandmother was somewhat of an authority on steps such as these the clever old mole would neither dig nor break them evidently she could turn the step over once she had brushed it matthias addressed foremole courteously excuse me sir but do you know how to deal with this step now if you do then my friend and i would be only too willing to help you foremole smiled his whole face almost vanishing into dark velvet wrinkles he clapped matthias on the shoulder in a chummy way the young mouse was amazed at the weight and strength of foremoles paw he was glad that it was a friendly pat foremole chuckled deeply nay nay bless your lil eart mattwise youn owd methuselam be but mouses best leave er to foremole oiu deal withn he says he can cope adequately without either of us said methuselah foremole produced a thick finehaired handbrush from his tunneling kit bending close he brushed furiously at the upper and lower insteps of the fourth stone as he swept he snuffled and blew following the path of his brush it soon became apparent that the stone had been cunningly jointed the dust came away to reveal a continuous hairline crack which ran around the edges of the step next foremole rummaged in his kit and came up with a tin of grease and a strong thin bar one end of which was flattened like a spatula smearing the grease liberally on top of the third step foremole inserted the flat metal tip against the base of the fifth step he dealt the blunt end of the bar a smart blow setting it firmly into the crack with a swift movement he levered the fourth step an inch forward exposing a long dark gap with a grunt of satisfaction foremole called out to his team yurr moles gather round an set your diggen claws in um crack the mole team dug their claws into the gap chanting together as they heaved with a will hurr she come if n you please movin bowlder sloid on grease to the astonishment of the watching mice the step slid smoothly outwards on the greased stone it turned completely over to reveal a dark opening with a downward flight of stairs running off into the blackness below old sela the vixen muttered her charms and spells in a singsong voice sometimes she did a hopping little dance around the sickbed cluny was not fooled he watched as the fox sprinkled magic herbs on the pillow reciting another strange spell as she did so the old fraud cluny thought all that mumbojumbo and magic nonsense why does she need it when she knows that shes a perfectly good doctor sela had placed herb poultices and healing salves on all the warlords wounds after bandaging them neatly she had administered a potion that would deaden the pain and induce sleep cluny was satisfied he had been treated by healers many times before sela was the best all the added muttering dancing and trickery was done merely to enhance her reputation to pull the wool over the eyes of stupid ignorant creatures she may be a fox but shell never outfox me cluny thought to himself sela had assured him that with three weeks restcombined with her healing skills he would be fighting fit once more three weeks at first the rat leader had raged and sworn he had never been out of action that long in all his life but secretly he knew that the fox was right without her cluny would have been dead or permanently crippled like all of her kind sela was a slippery character what did she expect to gain from all this loot and plunder from redwall sela had never been allowed past the abbey gates she was certain that if clunys army overran redwall there would be enough treasure to keep even the greediest creature happy for life now as the potions took effect cluny felt himself drifting off to sleep lulled by the ceaseless chantings and murmurings of old sela he would have come awake like a scorched tiger had he known what the fox was actually up to old sela had lived on her wits for many years she was a counterspy by nature in any dispute or conflict she invariably sold secrets to both sides it was a dangerous game but one that she had played well thus far her crafty golden eyes had not been idle for a second since entering clunys camp sela knew exactly how many rats weasels stoats and ferrets were ablebodied enough for combat also she had seen the working party gnawing industriously at the base of a tall poplar if that wasnt going to be used as a battering ram then sela was a trout and by her own diagnosis of three weeks she knew to the day when the date of the next attack on redwall would be the vixen watched clunys eyes closing under the influence of her medicine these warlords were all the same they never gave credit for brains to anyone except themselves there the big oaf was snoring like a fox cub in his earth on a winters night she turned to the armed rats who guarded the sickroom she issued orders in a confidential whisper i want no noise please your chief must have complete rest dont let him exert himself when he wakes now youll have to excuse me she made her way to the door fangburn and redtooth stood barring it where do you think you are off to fox sela licked her lips she tried to look kindly but earnest actually i was going back to my den to replenish my stock of herbs thats if you wish me to treat your leader properly of course redtooth prodded her with a spear cluny gave strict orders that you must stay here until hes better the sly fox blustered but my good rats surely you must realize that i can do nothing without my stock of herbs now please let me pass fangburn shoved her roughly sit down youre not going anywhere sela seated herself her mind was racing er then at least let me go out into the churchyard ive got to have some fresh air besides can tell my young assistant what herbs i require and he can fetch them for me redtooth was not convinced but the chief said youd got to stay here sela smiled inwardly she had them where she wanted them now she put on a serious expression shaking her head gravely then you had better let me have your names that way i can tell cluny when he awakes full of pain with festering wounds no doubt hell want to know who it was stopped me trying to cure him this crafty statement did the trick after a few whispered words between the two rats redtooth turned to sela listen fox you can go out into the churchyard and tell your assistant to run this errand but fangburn here will be right beside you with a cutlass in your ribs one false move out of you and youll be a dead healer is that clear sela smiled ingratiatingly by all means let your friend come along have nothing to hide out in the churchyard chickenhound who was the son of sela sat sunning himself upon a tombstone fangburn did not see the secret wink that passed between the two foxes chickenhound was as devious as his mother in matters of espionage his face was the picture of blank innocence as he listened to selas instructions now listen carefully my son we have a very sick rat inside that church he is in urgent need of my special remedies i want you to run as quickly as you can back to our den bring me back some snakewort cuckoo spit a medium eelskin three fine strips of willow bark oh theres so much to remember id better write it all down for you sela turned to fangbum do you carry any writing materials with you sir fangburn spat scornfully at the foxs feet are you trying to make fun of me healer what dyou think am huh writing materials the idea of it sela smiled disarmingly ah i thought not sorry no offense ill just make do with some bark and a burnt twig where could i obtain such things please fangburn pointed sullenly with his cutlass over there by the cooking fire be quick about it a few minutes later sela had presented chickenhound with a scroll of bark that she had written upon there that should do it now hurry along my son dont stop for anything on the way isnt that right captain fangburn puffed out his chest proud that the fox knew his rank he pointed a claw at chickenhound you listen to what your mother tells you young feller get back here with the stuff on that list as soon as possible be off with you now the young fox took off like a rocket fangburn leaned on his cutlass thats the way to deal with young uns sela looked at him admiringly indeed it is sir he never goes that fast for me its obvious that youve got an air of command about you fangburn colored slightly this vixen wasnt such a bad creature after all he gestured modestly to the church with his cutlass er i think its time we went back inside orders you know oh quite cant have you getting in trouble can we said sela in her most flattering tone as soon as he was out of sight of clunys stronghold chickenhound slowed to a leisurely walk he unfastened the bark scroll and read his mothers message to the abbot of redwall abbey i know exactly when where and how die hordes of cluny will attack your abbey what price will you give me for this important information sela the vixen chickenhound sniggered noisily he knew precisely what his mother required him to do he recalled selas favorite saying ive sold hens their own eggs back and stolen the whiskers from farmyard dogs the young fox ambled along the dusty road to redwall the hedgerows echoing with the sound of his sly chuckles j cornflower was having a very busy day having delivered food to matthias and methuselah she went out on the ramparts accompanied by her helpers they fed the sentries and took back all die dishes next she found herself making an extra two trays of food up for silent sams parents the two squirrels thanked her politely and set to with an appetite little sam stood watching them sucking his paw cornflower had a special soft spot for the baby squirrel she made up a tray for him too she had no sooner finished than constance called to ask a favor of her would she mind making up another four trays three for the vole family who had just returned and an extralarge one for basil stag hare cornflower cheerfully obliged later as they all ate her eyes grew wide with amazement she had never seen anyone shift such vast amounts of food not even constance or ambrose spike they were huge eaters but mere amateurs compared with basil stag hare basil wiped his mouth daintily on a napkin he had impeccable manners to match his insatiable appetite he gushed forth praise for the abbey victuals oh excellent absolutely top hole dyou know id forgotten how good the old tiffin at redwall could be i say mdear would you mind refreshing an old bachelor hares memory another tankard of that fine october ale and perhaps one more portion of your very good summer salad ah and i think i could manage another few slices of friar hugos quince pie superb ahem dont forget the goatsmilk cheese with hazelnuts im very partial to that cut along now you little charmer my word what an attractive young fieldmouse girl cornflower sent two of her helpers they had to go the long way around to reach the kitchens abbot mortimer had declared great hall and cavern hole out of bounds to all creatures with the exception of those helping matthias and methuselah below the newlydiscovered steps a pair of lanterns cast pools of golden light into the inky blackness the two mice made their way gingerly down the secret staircase the moles stayed outside ready to help if they were needed further the air was chilly but dry deeper and deeper the two friends went until the steps ended at the beginning of a downwardwinding corridor it had been neatly dug and shored up with wooden supports matthias suppressed a shudder how long had it been since any creature trod this silent musty passage he brushed away cobwebs which disintegrated at the touch of a paw methuselah held on to his habit now they turned left now right then another left turn left again then right methuselahs voice sounded hollow and eerie the passage was probably dug like this to give it extra strength have you noticed matthias we seem to be going downwards still yes we must be nearly underneath the abbey foundations matthias replied the friends pressed onwards they could not estimate how long they had been following the course of this ancient winding corridor methuselah had ventured slightly ahead now he halted aha this looks like the end of the line he squeaked it was a door together they inspected it built of stout timber banded with iron beset with florin spikes the door did not appear to be locked yet it would not budge matthias held his lantern high look theres some writing on die lintel over the door methuselah read it aloud the same as the steps twixt the hall remember and look to the center my password again is redwall am that is you alone are to enter the old mouse did not hide his disappointment humph after all the help and assistance that ive given countless hours of study and valuable time really his words fell upon deaf ears matthias was already counting the florin spikes that were driven into the door methuselah feigned indifference but his natural curiosity soon overcame any chagrin he felt at not being allowed to pass the doorway need any help young mouse fortytwo fortythree hush cant you see im trying to count came the reply the old gatehousekeeper put on his glasses well have you solved the riddle all by yourself matthias winked at his companion yes at least i hope i have there are three clues in the rhyme you see the same as the steps look to the center and the password is redwall now we must remember that redwall has seven letters if you look at these oldfashioned nails florin spikes methuselah corrected matthias continued yes if you look at these florin spikes youll find that they are in rows of seven the same as the number of letters in redwall there are seven rows of spikes going from side to side and seven rows from top to bottom fortynine spikes in all therefore the twentyfifth spike up down or across is the exact middle spike the rhyme says look to the center thats this one here as matthias placed his paw on the spike in question the door swung creakingly inwards both mice could feel the hairs standing on their backs as the door opened with agonizing slowness when it stood fully open matthias put his paw around methuselahs thin shoulders come on old friend we go in together he said but the rhyme methuselah protested it says that only you may enter matthias answered in a strange full voice he seemed to grow in years and stature am that is old one martin is matthias as my trusted friend and faithful companion i say that you may enter with me methuselah felt himself in the presence of one many times older than he lanterns held high the two mice advanced through the doorway it was a small lowceilinged chamber a stone block rested squarely in the center the tomb of martin the warrior all around the sides of the stone were detailed carvings depicting scenes from martins life deeds of valor and works of skillful healing lying along the top of the stone was a lifesized effigy of the warrior he was clothed in the familiar habit of a redwall mouse plain with no trimmings matthias stood reverently gazing upon the calm features of his own legendary hero in the silence of the small chamber methuselah whispered in his ear he bears an uncanny resemblance to you young one as the old mouse spoke the door behind him creaked shut feeling no panic matthias turned to look on the back of the door hung a shield and a sword belt the shield was a plain round steel thing of the type carried by the warriors of old the years had not dulled its highlyburnished front at its center was a letter m the sword belt was in pristine condition soft and as supple as if it had newly come from the tanners bench shiny black leather with a hanging tab to carry sword and scabbard its broad silver buckle gleamed in the lantern light without a word matthias undid his novices cord girdle handing it to methuselah he took down the sword belt and buckled it about his waist the belt fitted as if it had been made for him with great care he lifted the shield from the door and tried it on his arm it had two grips one below the elbow the other for the paw to grasp it felt oddly familiar to matthias there was more writing where the shield had hung upon the back of the door methuselah read it by the moonlight on the hour in my threshold space lay me watch the beam reflect my power unite once more my sword with me i am that is stand true for all o warrior mouse protect redwall as in a dream matthias gave the door a gentle tug it opened by the lantern lights the two mice made their way back from the lonely chamber back to the familiar warmth and cheer of redwall abbey back to the hot june noonday sun constance stood on the ramparts she leaned over the parapet watching as a young fox approached along the dusty road bearing a stick with a white rag of truce tied to it the big badger was uneasy she knew this one a fox from old selas brood you needed eyes in the back of your head to watch that lot stop right there and state your business fox constance called gruffly chickenhound sniggered but seeing the badgers stern expression he quickly took control of himself i want to see your abbot he called the reply was abrupt well you cant the fox waved his flag squinting up at constance but i must see the abbot i come in peace i have important information for sale the badger was unmoved i dont care if youve got the rumbling foxtrot you arent getting inside this abbey if you want to speak to anyone then speak to me constance watched the crestfallen fox then added as an afterthought and if you dont like it well you can sling your brush back up the road chickenhound was dismayed this last insult had taken die wind completely out of his sails he tried to think how sela would have handled a situation like this eventually he unrolled the bark scroll and waved it up at constance this message is for the abbots eyes only its important the badger eyed him coldly then chuck it up here ill see that he gets it no amount of wheedling and blandishment would cause the cynical badger to change her mind she was adamant in the end chickenhound had to throw the scroll up he made several puny attempts each one weaker than the last as the scroll fell back down into the road yet again constance called aloud put some energy into it you little milksop im not hanging about here all day chickenhound heaved the scroll with all his strength he was gratified to see constance lean out and catch it hopefully he called ill wait right here for an answer the badger grunted noncommittauy she sat down below the parapet out of sight of the fox and scanned the message constance stayed where she was until a reasonable time elapsed then stood up panting heavily for effect tell sela that the abbot will see her two days from tonight at ten oclock in mossflower wood she must come to the old tree stump and mind you tell her no tricks chickenhound waved the flag he went into a bout of uncontrollable sniggering right ive got the message fat one be sure your abbot brings lots of valuables with him goodbye old greyback constance poked an angry snout down at the insulting young fox youd better get running frogface im coming down there to put my paw behind you right now again constance dropped behind the parapet she hammered her paws loudly against the stones standing up she watched the terrified chickenhound racing off down the road in a cloud of dust snottynosed little upstart she muttered there was no need for the father abbot to concern himself with the underhand dealings of traitor foxes constance would be well able to deal with the situation herself matthias was famished he sat down and took his lunch with mr and mrs squirrel the vole family silent sam and basil the garrulous hare the young mouse ate mechanically he did not really want conversation this latest discovery of a new and baffling rhyme concerning moonlight the north and an unknown threshold nagged at his brain methuselah had gone off to seek the solitude of his gatehouse study where he claimed he could think more clearly matthias was not the liveliest of table companions he smiled and nodded paying little attention to the chatter of the voles and squirrels he was not even distracted by silent sam who sat upon his knee stroking his whiskers with a sticky paw basil stag hare eyed the food which matthias had hardly touched beg pardon young mouse old chap but if you cant finish that blackberry muffin or that redcurrant tart matthias absently pushed his plate across to the hare basil needed no second bidding abbot mortimer entered seeing the look on matthiass face he leaned across and murmured in his ear all work and no play makes matthias a dull mouse cheer up my son what i mean sorry father abbot didnt mean to be rude i was trying to solve a problem you see the abbot patted matthias indulgently i understand my son methuselah has told me of some of the difficulties facing you both my advice is dont let it get on top of you relax a little time provides all the answers youve done splendidly so far matthias meanwhile you must not forget your manners at table with the guests of our abbey matthias snapped out of his reverie silent sam was admiring his sword belt he laughed do you like that sam its the sword belt of a famous warrior the little squirrel leaped upon the table he darted up and down thrusting out his paw as if he held a sword in it stabbing away at thin air he pointed at matthias the young mouse gave him a hug no bless you sam i havent got a sword of my own yet but i will have some day silent sam pointed to himself cocking hishead on one side matthias prodded his fat little stomach a sword for you too sam well i dont know about that your mum and dad might not want you going about armed to the teeth basil stag hare had the answer he produced a beautifully made knife it was very small encased in a cunningly crafted willow bark sheath the hare beckoned sam cmere you dreadful little rogue ive got the very thing for you this is a leveret dagger all young hares carry one here lets try it on you for size young buccaneer what what basil picked up a worn and discarded sandal he undid the foot strap threading the dagger and sheath along the strap he fastened it around sams waist there by the left you look a regular little swashbuckler now chuckled the kindly hare bounding up and down with delight silent sam cut a comical figure as he fenced his way along the tabletop thrusting and parrying at cruets and candlesticks with his new sword and sucking furiously on his free paw matthias joined in the laughter as mr and mrs squirrel thanked basil for the generous gift to their tiny offspring forgetting his immediate problems matthias passed a happy hour in the company of the friendly woodlanders he enjoyed it even more when cornflower appeared she shared matthiass seat glad to be off her feet for a while basil nudged matthias excellent little filly that girl dyou know she can produce more tuck in the twinklin of an eye than you could shake a stick at you mark my words young feuermymouse a body would be lucky to settle down with her i say have you noticed the way she looks at you hinds look at stags like that noble creatures stags it strikes me that you could be just the stag for her why i remember when i was only a young lancejack cornflower was making such faces that matthias was about to silence basil when methuselah popped in at the door he beckoned urgently to matthias hastily the young mouse excused himself and left basil leaned closer to cornflower he smiled roguishly you didnt know i was a lancejack did you mdear ah those were the days of the old fortyseventh hare border rangers that was the first time i ever clapped eyes on a stag i sayim not boring you am i nods as good as a wink to old bachelor basil yknow methuselah was in a ferment of eagerness as he led his young friend over to the gatehouse matthias ive found out where the threshold is the ancient mouse refused to say more until they were safely inside his gatehouse study with the door firmly shut even then he said nothing that made any real sense shoving matthias to one side as he delved through old parchments and manuscripts scattering books left and right where is it i had it not five minutes ago hullo whats this oh the treatise on bee folk of redwaw methuselah hurled the dusty volume to one side narrowly missing his companion wait a tick i think i may have put it down over there matthias gazed in bewilderment at the overcluttered study books scrolls and manuscripts littered the small room in his excitement methuselah opened a desk and practically disappeared under an avalanche of paperwork hey steady on old mouse what are you up to cried matthias methuselah emerged jubilant clutching a yellowed book eureka this is it sister germames literal translation of martin the warriors abbey blueprints he flicked swiftly through the dusty pages of the aged volume lets see gardens cloisters belltowers ah here it is the great wall and its gates the old mouse winked at matthias gleefully as he adjusted his glasses listen to this on the west wall will be situated a main gate so that creatures may come and go obtaining entrance to or exit from the abbey of redwall this entrance will be guarded both night and day for it is the main gatehouse and as such is the very threshold of our abbey the two mice hugged each other they danced around amid the chaos of paper chanting with joy the gatehouse is the threshold the gatehouse is the threshold the abbot who was passing by heard the noise he shook his head at ambrose spike who was coming from the opposite direction mayhaps theyve been at the october ale a little too much father abbot said the hedgehog ii the abbot chuckled at the idea well if it helps them on their mission of discovery ambrose perhaps they ought to drink some more eh aye ambrose agreed tis enough to inspire any creature good october ale perhaps it might inspire you one day to make me keeper of the cellar keys father inside the gatehouse study the two companions were once more at work trying to break the code of the great hall rhyme well thats another piece of the puzzle in place said methuselah but weve jumped ahead of ourselves a bit there are four lines before that to crack yet look for the sword in moonlight streaming forth at night when days first hour reflects the north matthias interrupted those first two lines sound as if they could only be solved in the darkness look for the sword in moonlight streaming forth i agree replied methuselah but the next line is of vital importance it tells exactly when to look at night when days first hour hmm matthias mused lets look at this logically go through it word by word slowly they repeated the line together at night when days first hour methuselah slumped in his armchair im afraid it doesnt mean anything to me wait cried matthias midnight is the last hour of the old day so by the same token one oclock in the morning is the first hour of the new day but we still tend to class it as nighttime it is as the rhyme says at night when days first hour i believe you are right said the old mouse days first hour is not when it becomes light its one in the morning still dark matthias leaned wearily against a stack of books but if the gatehouse is the threshold where are we supposed to stand to see anything an hour after midnight thats easy grinned methuselah the rhyme says from oer the threshold seek and you will see its simple what is above our heads right now matthias shrugged the wall i suppose methuselah banged his paw down on the arm of the chair exactly and where is the only place you can stand on a wall but on top of it suddenly it became clear to matthias oh i see he cried from oer the threshold means that we must stand on the wall directly above the gatehouse as fast as they could run both mice hurried up the steps to the top of the wall with matthias in the lead they pounded along the ramparts matthias stopped above the gatehouse and stamped his foot upon the stones id say about here would you agree methuselah looked a trifle doubtful it looks to be a very rough approximation matthias had to concede he looked sheepishly about the stones where they stood were no different from any other part of the wall the trail seemed to have gone cold again dejectedly matthias sat down on a heap of rock and rubble that had been there since the invasion huh what are we supposed to do now hang about up here until after midnight and wait for a miracle the old gatehousekeeper raised an admonitory paw patience young one patience let us take stock and review the facts lend me your knife for a moment matthias drew shadows dagger from his belt and gave it to his friend he sat watching as the old mouse began writing in the dust from the rubble item one martin is matthias item two we have found martins tomb item three we have also found his shield and sword belt item four our task is to find martins sword item five where from here the top of the gatehouse wall item six when at one in the morning when moonlight streams forth item seven in which direction to the north they sat in silence digesting the facts on the list thenmatthias spoke suppose we look to the north both mice turned their heads northwards well what do you see young one queried methuselah matthiass voice was tinged with disappointment only the abbey part of the beehives the north side of this wall and the treetops beyond what do your eyes see old one exactly the same as yours do though perhaps a bit dimmer dont give up hope though let us keep looking maybe well see something the surveillance continued apart from retrieving his dagger matthias sat very still peering northwards eventually he had to give up as his eyes were beginning to water and he was getting a crick in his neck methuselah had fallen asleep in the afternoon sun angrily matthias slammed his dagger point deep into the edge of the rubble heap i told you it was a waste of time cant you stay awake for five minutes must you go to sleep on me the old mouse awoke with a start eh whats that oh matthias there you are dear me i must have dropped off for a moment sorry it wont happen again matthias was not listening he was digging in the nibble with his dagger methuselah watched him curiously what in the name of goodness are you up to now the rubble scattered as matthias dug away madly i think ive found what were after theres some sort of shape in the stone down here trouble is theres too much rubbish on top of it i think we need foremoles help again foremole and his team arrived panting with matthias running ahead the moles collapsed on the rubble breathing hard yurr ony gotten biddy short legs us moles do oi takes it youm gennelmice needin our elp agin this time matthias understood yes please mr foremole do you think that you and your team could possibly move this pile of rock and rubble theres something we need to get at underneath it all foremole spread his stubby paws wide he smiled winningly hurr no soon as saidn done young un wurr ud youm loik er shiften to matthias shrugged oh anywhere suppose as long as its not in our way foremole spat on his paws and rubbed them together arr roight mateys best dumpen this lot whurr it corned from the two mice had to jump aside smartly as the mole team took over with much hurring and arring they waded busily in bulldozing the enormous heap of rock and rubble off the top of the ramparts it tipped downwards in earthy showers back into the trench in the abbey grounds whence it had first come matthias watched admiringly what splendid workers these moles are methuselah as the hill dwindled his friend heartily agreed indeed they are their skills and knowledge are passed on through families you know earth rock shale or root they can handle it all do you know it was the moles that dug the foundations for this very abbey foremole can claim direct descent from the mole who was in charge of the operation in fact it was martin who bestowed the title foremole upon his ancestor as the mice conversed the moles hurled the last of the rubble from the ramparts then set about brushing the stones clean foremole tugged his nose in salute harr wem dum now zurrs oill bid ye gday ten seconds later they were all gone moles arent too fond of heights observed methuselah right lets see what theyve uncovered it was a circle cut into the stone on one side it was cut shallow while at the opposite side it was carved deeply the center was domed with two slots graven into either slope at the apex of the dome was the letter m beneath it were carved thirteen small circles each with a smiling face upon it constance came rambling along the wall checking on the road beneath hello there you two are you staying up here all day youll miss afternoon tea if you dont hurry therell be precious little left with three squirrels three voles and basil stag hare as guests studying the carvings matthias waved absently at the badger you carry on constance well be down shortly the badgers natural curiosity was aroused she came over and stood between the two mice after a cursory glance she threw up her paws in mock despair oh no not more puzzles and riddles methuselah gave her a severe stare over the top of his glasses my dear constance kindly do not pour scorn on things you know nothing of leave it to those with specialized knowledge turning to matthias the old mouse continued yes most interesting these thirteen small circles with smiling faces what do you make of them matthias could only shake his head he could not think what the circles might mean constance interrupted what do you mean those things huh theyre obviously the thirteen full moons of the year methuselah was distinctly piqued how do you know that explain yourself constance scoffed ha any badger worth its salt knows all about the moon do you want me to recite all its phases i can you know matthias was suddenly back on the track again he counted along the moons stopping at the sixth one that one will be this month june when is the full moon due in june constance its tomorrow night came the prompt reply why is something supposed to happen then some magic or a miracle methuselah ignored the badgers attempt at levity if we stand up here at one oclock in the morning on the night of the foil moon we may be able to find the sword of martin the warrior he said rather sternly constance scratched her muzzle how are you going to manage that matthias ran his foot around the edge of the circle were not quite sure yet but we are trying to figure it out you see its all linked closely with the rhyme from the wall of great hall martins tomb and the stuff we found in it this sword belt a shield another rhyme on the back of a d constance interrupted what type of shield oh pretty much the standard kind used by warriors matthias replied a round steel affair with hand and armholds the badger nodded knowingly and continued where matthias had left off yes ive seen that sort of thing before not much to look at in fact just the type of shield that would fit precisely into this circle cant you see the slots for the armholds but then again if you look at that carved circle youll notice that it is cut so that the shield would tilt probably to reflect the moonlight both mice stared at the badger there was awe and respect written upon their faces matthias shook her paw with great ceremony constance wonderful badger old friend dont worry about afternoon tea you just sit yourself down right there because i personally am going to bring you the largest most delicious tea that has ever been served within the walls of this abbey the warm red stone ramparts rang to the echo of the three friends delighted laughter cluny lay with his one good eye half open from beneath its slitted lid he watched sela the vixen the sly old devil was definitely up to something he was certain of it cluny had secretly questioned fangbum about the conversation that had gone on between sela and her son there was no doubt about it the foxes were trying to dupe the warlord cluny had cursed fangburn for twenty different kinds of an idiot fancy not being able to read and allowing sela to write out a message imagine letting chickenhound go free without first getting the scroll read if he had been a little fitter he would have personally slain his oafish captain but as it was cluny kept silent about it all even if sela was playing a double game he needed the foxs healing powers to regain his health and strength meanwhile cluny the scourge made his own counterespionage moves he allowed sela to minister to his wounds but he secretly stopped taking the herbs and potions to help him sleep early next morning chickenhound returned he carried a bag laden with medicinal ingredients cluny feigned sleep but secretly he observed the foxes closely they nodded and winked at each other quite a bit when they were reasonably sure he was asleep the two held a hurried whispered conver sation and though unfortunately he could not hear what they said their behavior was secretive enough to make cluny sure he was right they were planning a double cross cluny did not tell any of his officers of his suspicions he kept everything to himself this way there could be no possible leak of secrets cluny was content to watch and wait getting a little stronger each day then after a while he came up with a fiendishly simple idea he ordered that the room be cleared he wished to be alone so that he could rest when he was quite sure that he would not be disturbed cluny took a quill and parchment from the bedside table he drew a diagram complete with pointing arrows horde positions lines of attack and defense together with written instructions it was a plan for the second fullscale invasion of redwall abbey cluny made it clear that the success of the attack depended solely on the battering ram breaking through the main gate when he had finished writing cluny pushed the parchment under his pillow taking care to leave just a small corner of it jutting out his officers would be too slow and dull to notice it a tiny scrap of parchment showing from beneath the pillow even if they should they would attach no importance to it but sela the fox would cluny settled down to wait redtooth and fangburn returned with their captive guest an hour later cluny stretched himself luxuriously and yawned aloud aaaah i had a nice peaceful nap without you three clattering about the room and creating a noise hows that treefelling coming along redtooth leaned upon his spear shouldnt take much longer now chief ive ordered some of them to get a good blaze going so that the trunk can be fired and hardened cluny flexed his injured tail slowly good make sure that all the large branches are cut off close to the trunk itll make it easier to carry now fox how about changing these bandages and giving me something to make me sleep tonight that stuff you gave me yesterday wasnt much use i was tossing and turning for hours before i got any rest sela made a sweeping servile curtsey now that my son has brought my new ingredients i can certainly give you medicine to make you sleep sir i guarantee youll go off like a bug in a blanket if youll pardon the expression sir just as long as it gets me to sleep said cluny smiling inwardly that night cluny allowed redtooth and fangburn to guzzle their fill from a cask of barley wine that had been found in the church cellars he gave sela permission to drink also cluny watched as the fox pretended to drink as much of the barley wine as the rat captains while she was doing this cluny also pretended to take his sleeping medicine cluny and sela continued with their pantomime neither letting a drop pass their lips it was late night cluny joined in the snores of his drunken officers the room was comfortably warm a lone candle flickered in its socket cluny felt the pillow move slightly sela was taking the bait cluny gave a big imitation snore and smacked his lips contentedly some day he must learn to play chess he bet himself that he would be unbeatable cluny also made a wager with himself that the plans would be back safely tucked under the pillow by morning and that sela would have an accurate copy of them hidden away somewhere now he could catch a few hours sleep no doubt the mice would be interested to learn of his scheme to attack the main gate with a battering ram they would strengthen the gatehouse and deploy the main body of defenders in the immediate area cluny could have laughed out loud while they were defending the gate he would be tunneling under the southwestern corner of the abbey wall is the deep warm brazen voice of the joseph bell tolled across the tranquil meadows its echoes fading in the leafy depths of mossflower wood it was eleven oclock on the night of the full moon inside cavern hole the candles burned bright most of the woodland defenders and redwall mice had retired to their beds those who preferred to stay awake were gathered by invitation of matthias and methuselah to a party supper all who attended wished them well on their quest abbot mortimer took the floor my friends redwall mice and honored guests we are gathered here tonight not only to pay tribute but to add our heartfelt good wishes to matthias and brother methuselah may they have success and fortune in their venture this night and may our abbey soon be enhanced by the restoration of the sword that belonged to martin the warrior the abbot took his seat among cries of hear hear there was much pawshaking and furpatting matthias felt deeply honored but very impatient the hourglass had to empty twice more before the crucial time he awaited he stole a sideways glance at his companion methuselah could hardly stop his eyelids from dropping the hard work they had done combined with the nervous tension were beginning to tell upon the old gatehousekeeper matthias nudged him gently wake up old one if youre tired ill help you to your room constance and i can take the shield up to the threshold you get a good nights sleep well tell you all about it in the morning methuselah came wide awake with indignation youll do nothing of the son you young scallywag i could give you a tensecond start and still beat you to the top of the wall dyou want to try me constance coughed and spluttered upon a candied chestnut she roared with laughter ha ha ha ho ho ho i wouldnt attempt it if i were you matthias hes liable to beat you hollow in his present mood the old mouse seeing the humor of the situation began to chuckle and dont think i couldnt you great stripey lump here what do you say we put this young mouse up in the dormitory its way past his bedtime you and i could go to the threshold together constance and methuselah collapsed against each other laughing helplessly it was all matthias could do to keep a straight face he pretended to take offense at methuselahs statement why you old pair of relics it wouldnt take me two ticks to bring you some warm milk and tuck you in your own beds then id be free to get on with the job myself the three friends laughed until tears streamed down their cheeks methuselah held his sides as he spoke between gusts of merriment i say constance ha ha ha you old fogey oh ha ha ha tee hee youd better come along with us ha ha ho ho oooh matthias is a bit old for this sort of thing hahahahahahaha matthias had fallen off his chair he waved his paws pleading for the joking to stop as he rolled about on the floor exploding from bouts of giggling to fits of laughter basil stag hare tuttutted severely as he remarked to ambrose spike teh tch dreadful table manners just look at those three kicking up a hullaballoo like that eatings a serious business they havent touched a bite of supper yknow aye so i see grunted the hedgehog here you dont suppose theyd mind do you not at all not at all dear fellow said basil regally as he shared the contents of the three plates between himself and ambrose saves it all going to waste what what it was fifteen minutes before one oclock in the morning three figures crossed the abbey gardens as the moon broke from behind a drifting cloudbank the nearby pond was bathed in a silver sheen parts of the sandstone wall reflecting back a wavery bluish light constance and methuselah carried lanterns matthias bore the warriors shield upon his arm they ascended the wall steps in single file acknowledging the murmured good wishes of those on sentry duty matthias had decided against trying the shield in its niche before the appointed hour he felt somehow that they must abide by the rules of the verse waiting until days first hour on the night of the full moon it just had to be so no use tempting fickle dame fortune solemnly the three friends gathered around the carving upon the ramparts matthias clutched the shield tightly waiting for the stroke of one high above the small world of redwall the moon also waited suspended in velvety space like a pale gold coin it seemed that the minutes stretched into an eternity in which silence reigned over all the great joseph bell boomed out once it was one oclock days first hour slowly reverently matthias lowered the shield of martin down on to the stone circle that had been carved many long years before to receive it the shield made a mild clanking sound as it was laid to rest in its niche it fitted perfectly into the stone receptacle all three creatures stood back a pace to see what might happen matthias was first to cry out look the shield is reflecting the moonlight back into the sky moonlight seemed to concentrate upon the highlypolished steel dome in its designated position sending an intense beam of white light back off into the night sky methuselah blinked holding his paw across his eyebrows he stared into space trying to follow the path of the reflected moonlight truly it is a most beautiful wondrous sight he breathed alas my old eyes are not what they were all i see is a light shooting off into infinity wait look at the abbey roof constance murmured the beam cuts right across the top gable i can see the weather vane as clearly as if it were day good heavens matthias squeaked youre right the abbey weather vane its the one thing thats caught in the path of the light the north the north methuselah shouted its the weather vane arm that points north thats where the sword must be solemnly the three friends placed their paws one on top of the other at long last the mystery was solved they knew now where the sword of martin the warrior had been for countless years on the arm of a weather vane pointing north however it was three rather disconsolate creatures that sat down to early breakfast after a few hours fitful sleep they had encountered a major problem how to get the sword down what a pity we havent got about thirty or forty extralong ladders that we could tie together to reach the roof muttered constance oh do be quiet constance matthias grumbled that must be the tenth time youve said that in the last hour sorry only trying to help she mumbled methuselah pushed his porridge aside there are only two ways that you could help my friend one by keeping silent two by turning yourself into some creature that could climb all the way up to that roof a bird or a squirrel or something they sat and stared at methuselah in amazement a solution of stunning simplicity had been found i do hope that mrs squirrel hasnt decided to sleep in said matthias shell need an early start if shes going to make it back by lunchtime mrs squirrel was only too pleased to oblige her friends from redwall having been given full instructions by matthias jess stood at the base of the immense abbey building the squirrel performed what looked like an intricate acrobatic dance followed by several cartwheels at lightning speed shes just limbering up mr squirrel explained to matthias a large crowd of mice and woodlanders had gathered to witness the epic ascent not even in the oldest recorded writings was there any mention of a creature venturing to climb as high as the abbey roof it was a most formidable task for the roof soared to nearly twice the height of the bell tower jess elbowed her way through the throng she kissed mr squirrel patted her son silent sam upon the head then shook paws with constance matthias and methuselah with a brisk cheery manner she scooped up a handful of soil rubbing it into her paws to give some extra gripping power lovely day for a climb she remarked offhandedly then away she went paw over paw up the massive abbey face the lower wall with its arched sandstone window frames held no difficulties for the tough squirrel she climbed with speed and alacrity lifting herself over the gutter with a neat flick of her bushy tail jess clattered across to a small slate side roof she was temporarily lost to view at the start of the second stage as she came into sight again the watchers below could not help but notice that the climb was more difficult progress was slower mr squirrel cupped his paws and called up are you all right there jess latching her tail around a projecting gargoyle jess shouted back well im making headway mdear this stone though its a bit rough on the old paws and claws not like good old wood or tree bark chins went up heads tilted back the crowd below followed the ascent of the plucky jess squirrel by this time she seemed to the watchers to be rapidly diminishing in size as she forged upwards foremole covered his eyes with a paw gurr moi dearie dearie me shem loiken an owlyburd alia ways up thurr nay oim afeared to look although matthias had to agree with foremole he con tinued looking upwards jess was reduced to a mere speck now the young mouse gritted his teeth willing the brave squirrel onwards go on jess you can do it not far to the gable now the crowd fell silent all that could be heard was silent sam sucking his tiny paw as he clutched on to his fathers tail suddenly winifred the otter broke the quiet look jess has made it over the gutter shes on the roof a mass cheer went up the squirrel was on the last lap now she would have to call into play all of her climbing ability to keep going up the treacherously steep smooth slates methuselah polished agitatedly at his spectacles where is she now will someone please enlighten me shes on top of the roof walking with a foot either side of the apex towards the gable yelled abbot mortimer methuselah sniffed no need to shout father abbot im only hard of sight not hearing mr squirrel clapped his paws joyfully oh shes made it my jess has made it amid the riot of jubilation matthias watched the weather vane moved slightly indicating that jess actually out upon the north pointer must be trying to retrieve the sword what a daring climb what a courageous creature jess squirrel would surely take her place in the annals of redwall abbey mr squirrel held silent sam up in his arms look sam mums done it shes on the way back down now silent sam clenched his little paws over his head he shook them like a tiny champion nobody in all the world was a better climber than his mother matthias waited for a glimpse of the sword but jess was not halfway down when a shout of consternation arose from the crowd below look out shes being attacked by sparrows sure enough the fierce birds were whirling in close to the intrepid jess they tried to peck at her seeking to dislodge her or distract her enough to make her fall it was a fearsome sickening drop should she lose hergrip matthias took command he acted swiftly hurry get the six best field and harvest mouse archers those birds have got to be stopped immediately the angry sparrows persisted with their savage assault jess kept on descending resolutely she couldnt seem to defend herself the abbot and constance had to leap forward to restrain silent sam he had left his father and was trying to scramble up the base of the abbey wall with the small dagger clenched in his teeth constance attempted to reason with sam stay clear little one youll only distract your mum look shes doing splendidly an old bunch of sparrows cant bother her stand back now here come the bowmice speedily notching shafts to their strings the archers angled their bows upwards do not aim to kill any of the birds the abbot cried shoot to frighten them off shoot matthias yelled the first volley of arrows was launched they fell short of the sparrows jess carried on scrambling downwards beating off attackers whenever she had a free paw theyre getting within range now shouted matthias aim fire the mouse archers sent off a hail of arrows that came close enough to cause a scatter among the sparrows taking advantage of their brief confusion jess clambered down on to the small side roof the tenacious birds regrouped and came at her again below the bowmice stood ready shell make it down ambrose spike yelled one more good volley should scare them off ready fire called matthias the deadly shafts hissed upwards causing a mad flurry among the attackers purely by accident a stray arrow struck one young sparrow it came tumbling down the slope of the small roof dropping to earth like a stone the arrow sticking in its leg just above the knee joint cheated of their intended victim the sparrows flew off chirping badtemperedly constance snatched up a woven rush washing basket holding the small sparrow firmly with her paw she gripped the arrow in her teeth and yanked it clear from the birds leg the badger then upended the basket imprisoning the maddened sparrow beneath it shouts of joy mingled with relief greeted jess squirrel as she dropped wearily to the grass phew she gasped what a wild bunch of savages those sparrows are i thought they had me once or twice back there before the heroic squirrel could be united with her family matthias came dashing across jess where is the sword he panted the squirrel shrugged and shook her head it wasnt there matthias i climbed out along the north pointer and actually saw the shape of the sword in the holder where it was supposed to rest there were even some loose rusty wires that may have held it in position at one time or another but there was definitely no sword im sorry matthias i tried my best of course you did jess said matthias hiding his disappointment thank you very much for your valiant efforts half an hour later the crowd had dispersed and gone about their business matthias sat with his back against the abbey wall his mind in a turmoil all that hard work solving the clues burning midnight oil endangering the lives of his friends it had all come to nothing he beat his paws against the stones of the abbey a tear of frustration gleaming in his eye why martin why he moaned the captive sparrow fluttered her wings against the upturned basket i killee you she chattered angrily at matthias i killee mouse let warbeak free you dirty worm matthias peered through the cracks at the insulting prisoner oh shut your beak you little monster he muttered youre in no position to kill anyone the sparrows venomous temper increased king bull sparra he killee you make dead quickfast matthias laughed mirthlessly will he indeed well you tell king thingummy if you should bump into him again that youve met matthias the warrior and i dont kill that easily my badtempered little friend this last statement sent the young sparrow off into a veritable dance of rage mouse no friend of warbeak kkillee kkkilleed matthias tapped the basket with his foot listen warbeak if thats your name youd better improve your temper or youll find yourself without food to eat or any medical attention so if i were you id sit quietly for a while and think about that matthias spun on his heel and marched off the enemy sparrows chirps still ringing in his ears no wanta food no needa tenshun warbeak sparra all brave killeet matthias sighed wearily there was just no talking to some creatures io sela the fox continued to complain she must have a certain type of herb that was not in her kit it could only be found in mossflower wood at the dark of night cluny listened to the foxs pleas knowing that they were merely an excuse to gain her freedom he paused as if to deliberate watching the hopeful expression on selas face hmm i can see that you need this herb so why dont you send your son chickenhound to get it sela was never stuck for a ready answer no no im afraid thats useless sir hes too young and inexperienced chickenhound wouldnt know where to start looking cluny nodded sympathetically aye youre probably right i suppose ill have to stretch a point you can go off to the woods to search for this vital herb but be warned fox there will be two rats with you all the time one false move and ill have that bushy tail of yours to trim the collar of my war cloak is that understood selas head bobbed vigorously of course sir what reason would i have to play you false im looking forward to a good share of plunder once ive healed you and redwall is conquered the huge tail snaked out and caressed the fox of course you are my friend how silly of me cluny actually smiled sela shuddered that evening sela left the church accompanied by redtooth and fangburn secretly she could have danced with delight only two guards with her knowledge of mossflower sela could quite easily give them the slip for fifteen minutes or so back at the church cluny had risen from his bed he attempted an exploratory walk leaning on his banner as he stumped gingerly around the room good in a short while he would be back to his old self again cluny spoke aloud to the picture of martin bound to his standard ha that fox should easily give those idiots of mine the slip then she can deliver my false plans to your abbot its all going along quite smoothly bit of a blow for your side eh mouse twilight tinged mossflower wood sela sniffed the breeze she glanced up at the sky it would soon be dark and she could keep her rendezvous with the mouse abbot at the old stump redtooth and fangburn were both unhappy and uncomfortable for the last hour sela had led them through stinging nettles swarms of midges and marshy ground they blundered along hacking at the undergrowth with cutlass and spear i think we must be somewhere near the mouse abbey fangburn said stow the gab keep your eyes on the fox redtooth snarled i wish id brought some lanterns along with us fangburn whined redtooths already dangerouslythin patience snapped he grabbed hold of his sniveling crony and started shaking him listen thickhead if you dont stop your moaning ill chop your tongue out with my cutlass dyou hear me fangburn struggled free angrily he jabbed at redtooth with his spear you dare try anything with that blunt old breadknife and ill spear your gizzard before you can blink an eye oh you will will you yes i will smarty rat then take that big mouth ouch punch me would you ill soon show you together the rats crashed into a prickly bush kicking biting and pummeling each other claws tails and teeth came into play they went at it hammer and tongs for several minutes until redtooth emerged the victor his nose was bleeding and he had lost a tooth but he was in better shape than his opponent fangburn crawled miserably out of the wrecked bush both eyes were blacked a chunk of his left ear was missing and his whole body was covered in long raking claw marks and prickles he bent painfully to retrieve his spear seizing the opportunity redtooth landed him a mighty kick on the bottom his nose plowed up a furrow of soil panting furiously redtooth berated fangburn you halfwitted fool now see what youve done while you were busy assaulting a superior officer you let the fox escape fangburn sat up he winced through discolored eyes let the fox escape me oh no youre the one in charge you let her get away not me wait i report this to cluny ill tell him that you will you shut up redtooth yelled its no use us standing here arguing wed better get searching for the fox ill go this way and you go that way the first one to find her keeps shouting until the other arrives have you got that now get moving the two rats stumbled off through the woods in different directions meanwhile in another part of mossflower wood sela sneaked along looking from left to right there was the threetopped oak there was the abbey wall ah here it was the old stump the moonlight illuminated the scene clearly she was alone where was the mouse abbot a heavy paw clamped itself around selas neck from behind her tongue shot out struggling uselessly she gagged and choked constances gruff voice growled into her ear be still fox or ill snap your neck like a dead twig sela froze there was nothing more dangerous than a follygrown badger their strength and ferocity were renowned constances free paw snapped the herb pouch from the foxs belt she shook the contents out on to the stump grabbing the copy of clunys invasion plans she studied it briefly then stuffed it into her belt your abbot was supposed to meet me with a reward sela whispered the badgers eyes blazed with contempt as she spun the vixen around heres your reward traitor wkump constance dealt sela a sharp blow between the ears the fox fell in a senseless heap constance ducked behind a tree and called out in a highpitched voice over here ive got die fox quick over here redtooth was first to arrive he came dashing through the bushes and halted at the sight of the unconscious fox among the ferns hells teeth fox wheres fangburn what the devil do you mean slinking off like that get up on your feet and answer me constance emerged from behind the tree i dont think shell wake up for a while yet fancy meeting you here rat redtooth got over his surprise quickly seeing the badger unarmed he swished his cutlass through the air and smiled menacingly well well its the friend of the mice so we meet again badger constance stood tall her huge paws folded redtooth isnt it i see you still remember me from your defeat at the wall i told you then we had a score to settle redtooth bared his teeth and snarled im going to enjoy this badger ill make sure you die slowly the rat leaped at constance swinging his cutlass expertly for a heavy badger his adversary moved lightly and skillfully neatly sidestepping a cutlass thrust she cuffed the rat smartly on the point of the nose stung into retaliation redtooth charged constance with the point of his blade a fierce kick in the ribs and a swift chop to the claw sent the rat and the cutlass in opposite directions redtooth lay winded upon the ground constance leaned over him get up and retrieve your weapon the badger growled as redtooth stood he grabbed a handful of earth and flung it in constances eyes the big badger staggered back rubbing at the grit which clogged her vision the rat picked up the cutlass and swung it slashing wildly at his enemys thick fur he scored several hits suddenly panic gripped him the wounded badger had seized the blade regardless of its keen edge constance pulled redtooth in close she gave a sideways push snapping the cutlass blade in two pieces kicking the rat over on his back she flung the broken blade away and grabbed the rodents tail tightly with both paws redtooth screamed in terror as he felt himself leave the ground to go spinning aloft over the badgers head with his tail pulled taut and the wind whistling through his fangs redtooth howled as the trees went by in a green blur like an athlete throwing the hammer constance whirled on her hind legs faster and faster until suddenly she threw her burden with a colossal heave redtooth would have flown a record distance had there not been a stout sycamore tree several yards away ignoring her injuries constance called into the surrounding woods over here hes over here then she limped swiftly off in the direction of redwall with the captured plans only moments later fangburn came blundering through the ferns he tripped upon the groaning fox who was just coming round here whats happened wheres redtooth he asked anxiously sela sat up rubbing her head trying to recognize her surroundings she saw the old stump littered with her herbs and potions the pouch lay nearby holding her head with both paws she tried to halt the thumping ache damn that badgers hide shed taken the plans from sela as if she were confiscating acorns from a baby mouse so much for the rich rewards fangburn prodded sela with the spear hey you pay attention i asked you where redtooth is sela probed a loosened tooth with her tongue leave me alone how should i know fangburn persisted now listen fox i want to know whats been going on here im sure i heard redtooth calling out hells whiskers wait until cluny gets to hear about this sela pointed a shaky paw theres your rat by that big sycamore yonder huh looks like hes had a spot of bother too fangburn touched redtooth with his foot aaaaargh hes dead look this swords been broken in two the fox and the rat stood looking at each other their thoughts running on parallel lines it was fairly obvious what must be done if they were to save their skins right said sela wed better work out a good story to tell cluny when we get back hes not stupid so wed better get it right the unlucky pair stumbled off through the nighttime woodland gesticulating and muttering together weaving a fabric of lies that they hoped would satisfy cluny the scourge ii once again the abbots room was the scene of a late repast the news that constance had brought showed without a doubt that cluny would soon be on the attack again abbot mortimer was the first to admit that he had been mistaken the intelligence brought to us by our friend constance is conclusive cluny will never rest until he has redwall under his heel therefore i feel that i must apologize for my misjudgment of the situation you my commanders were right and now thanks to cluny we know the secret details of the enemy hordes next attack the abbot slapped a paw down on the plans it is all here but as i have said before i will not concern myself with the fighting of a war it is my task to heal the injured and give sustenance to the defenders it is the duty of you my generals to plan the repulse of this invasion matthias held up a paw father abbot it is our duty not only to defend but to retaliate there was a strong murmur of agreement from around the table the abbot bowed and placed his paws within his wide habit sleeves so be it he said with great solemnity i leave the salvation of redwall to you my commanders the abbot bowed once more then retired for the night leaving matthias constance winifred foremole and ambrose spike the meeting continued they were joined by basil stag hare and jess squirrel methuselah also attended to act as mediator and counselor approving some ideas while discouraging others calming the hothead and encouraging the timid much good sense was talked and the tone of the meeting was that of creatures who were determined to win at all costs the discussion running on sensible lines went on until it was nearly dawn it was a confident and satisfied group of friends who shook paws as the meeting ended basil insisted on taking constance to the infirmary to have her wounds treated the badger tried to shrug him off pah such a fuss over a few minor scratches she grumbled the hare chuckled admiringly a few minor scratches will you listen to the heroine why my dear badger those are honorable wounds gained on the field of combat i say jess lend a paw here have you seen the dreadful gashes that friend constance has collected by the left old girl you should be hors de combat not even a stag could put up with slashes like that come on now lets have you theres a sensible girl constance was led off muttering by basil and jess all the rest retired to their beds with the exception of matthias and methuselah they strolled around the cloisters savoring the peace of the midnight hours you know old one i cant help thinking that a victory would be assured if only we had the warriors sword matthias said methuselah nodded wistful agreement indeed it would but alas for all our efforts the trail is as cold as a midwinter night im afraid we must resign ourselves to the fact that the sword is lost or hidden somewhere forever the old gatehousekeeper leaned upon the young mouses arm as they walked along talking of this and that eventually die conversation came around to the sparrows attack upon jess methuselah shook a warning paw extremely dangerous birds sparrows very warlike and quarrelsome luckily they keep to themselves and will only attack if their territory is intruded upon as you saw today by the way did you see that young one who was brought down by the archers j i certainly did matthias replied constance has got the badtempered little wretch imprisoned under a wash basket what a nasty young villain the arrow only scratched her really it was shock more than anything else that brought her down says her name is warbeak methuselah was taken aback do you mean to tell me youve talked with her remarkable the sparrow language or sparra as it is called is very difficult to comprehend oh i dont know said matthias casually i didnt find it too hard and at least the little hooligan seems to understand what im saying to her methuselahs curiosity was aroused and what has she been saying to you this er warbeak pretty much what youd expect matthias replied either she or the leader king bull sparra is going to kill me evidently she looks on anything that cant by as an enemy they strayed over by the gatehouse the old mouse invited matthias in for a late nightcap methuselah appeared very interested in sparrows he leafed through his record books let me see summer of the big drought winter of the deep drifts yes thought id find it here do you remember i told you of a sparrowhawk whom i treated about four years back well here is my report some small notes i made at the time this hawk talked of the sparrows she called them winged mice though for the life of me i cannot see any comparison between highly civilized mice and those primitive savages point was though this sparrowhawk said shed been told that the sparrows once stole an object of great value to our abbey she didnt say what it was i thought the bird was merely trying to impress me with idle gossip i should have questioned her further we may have found out just what that object was matthias looked pensive do you think it could have been the sword the old mouse sat tapping his paw upon the record book it could have been matthias it could have been you see the sparrows never communicate or bother with us they never fly into our abbey but up on the roof well thats a different matter they consider that to be their territory as j see it the sword was the only object of value we had up there although we did not know it at the time so who else but another bird would know that the sparrows had stolen it by the whiskers old one matthias said excitedly i think youve hit the nail on the head do you think that our badtempered captive might know something about the rumor methuselah grinned mischievously lend me your dagger i have a simple experiment that i wish to try on our prisoner come on matthias escorted his friend to where the basket lay by the abbey walls there was no sound from within methuselah tapped the basket sharply with the blade of the dagger warbeak had been caught napping she came to life in an irate mood worms all worms you old mouseworm stay way warbeak killee methuselah tried his level best to act tough be silent you little baggage or ill spike you on this dagger and your king too if he dares to come down in a fury warbeak smashed her small body against the sides of the basket causing the old mouse to take a step back ha go on you killee warbeak with dagger wait see you not get king bull sparra with little worm knife king have a big sword chop all mouses up killee pretty quick you betcha methuselah laughed with delight you see the sparrow king owns a big sword matthias did a cartwheel he whooped withjoy methuselah youre a magician an ancient wizard the old mouse shook his head modestly oh dear me no i like to think of myself as an aged but extremely erudite scholar sitting comfortably propped up on pillows cluny sipped a beaker of barley wine as he listened to the improbable tale spun by sela and fangburn they both fidgeted nervously during the course of their deceitful narrative trying desperately not to contradict one another while at the same time avoiding the cold impassive eye of the warlord er it was like this chief fangburn stammered me and old redtooth were keeping our eyes on the fox here when suddenly redtooth hears a noise in the woods so off he goes to investigate where was the noise coming from snapped cluny the deceivers spoke together north said sela west said fangburn simultaneously er er it was sort of northwest sela gulped realizing how foolish she sounded knowing that cluny was smarter than either of them she wished she didnt have this big dumb rat to corroborate the story so redtooth went off to see what the noise was sela faltered we told him not to go sir but he insisted cluny watched selas legs shaking go on what happened then he murmured fangburn took up the tale again well you see chief he was gone an awful long time we both called out to him but there was no answer so we both went to look for him said sela cluny toyed with the beaker his eye bored into the fox we searched and searched sir sela mumbled but all we could find was this big stretch of marshland and bog which poor old redtooth had wandered into and been sucked down never to be seen again cluny supplemented sela kept wishing the floor would open up and swallow her fangburn sobbed brokenly our poor friend redtooth gone forever yes our poor friend redtooth cluny agreed sympathetically suddenly his voice hardened as he shot a question at fangburn you how did your face get knocked about and where did you get those long scratches from sela jumped in hastily er er he walked into a big thorn tree didnt you fangburn what oh yes i was dashing about and didnt see it chief the fox can tell you she saw it and if she didnt well i already told her said fangburn his voice trailing off miserably cluny laughed mirthlessly his fangs showing yellow and sharp so you walked into a big thorn tree and got two black eyes a torn ear and your whole hide covered in long scratches fangburn stared at the floor he had to swallow twice before he could answer his voice subdued thats what happened chief clunys tone was laden with sarcasm and then i suppose that three little pigs with wings flew down and gave you a toffee apple each er yes er i mean what was that chief oouch fangburn hopped on one leg as sela kicked his ankle to silence him you fox cluny snarled wheres the special herb you went to search for sela was completely nonplussed special herb i cluny hurled the beaker it bounced off fangburns nose splashing barley wine over them both get out out of my sight before i have you tortured and roasted cluny roared at the unlucky pair there was an undignified scramble the door slammed shut behind the conspirators cluny lay back and smirked everything was going according to plan he had lost redtooth but what the devil redtooth had been an ambitious rat cluny only admired ambition in one rodent himself far off in mossflower wood the night breezes stirred the treetops gently the moon rode in a cloudless sky its pale light filtered through the waving foliage to create the beautiful but strange effect of a shimmering swaying carpet on the woodland floor asmodeus asmodeussssssss the covering of dead moonlit vegetation on the ground trembled and rustled what better cover than a light breeze and a hunters moon glittering black eyes searched the night a forked tongue tasted the air the small living plants appeared to shudder as the long scaly body brushed by them trailing its way along asmodeus asmodeusssssssss softly rustling deceptive as the speckled shadows the huge adder roamed his domain patience and stealth were acquired by long experience sometimes the serpent would he totally inert awaiting the unsuspecting paw that trod too close other times it would raise itself uncoiling to look into bushes for eggs and birds on the nest some nights it was lean hunting many creatures sensed the approach of the slithering evil or scented its dry musty deathlike odor the snake had often gone hungry at times like these but patience and stealth patience and stealth a lesson soon learned is a meal soon earned at the foot of the sycamore the adder stretched itself alongside the still form of redtooth well an unexpected bonus this was another rat that could not scurry off no expenditure of venom or hypnosis needed how fortunate the huge reptile coiled itself languorously around the dead rodent asmodeus asmodeusssssssssss no need of burial patties nature and the woodlands took care of their own funeral arrangements there was but one efficient undertaker the adders jaws opened in something resembling the nightmare of a smile the pathway to eternity was open matthias was excused from duties at the gatehouse fortifications the council had agreed that both he and methuselah plus any creature they chose to help them were to be left to their own devices the majority of the redwall mice thought that matthias was acting a little oddly but the young mouse knew exactly what he was about he strolled slowly through die abbey grounds behind him hopped warbeak on a lead with a collar about her neck on the sparrows uninjured leg matthias had tied a brick not a very big brick but one large enough to stop the bird getting airborne or trying any sneak attacks upon its captor thoroughly disgruntled the sparrow hopped along like a feathered convict with a ball and chain forced to follow the young mouse wherever he chose to wander at first warbeak had raved and threatened death was too good for matthias warbeak was going to kill him twice then cut him up and drop him from the top of a high tree for the worms to feed upon matthias had merely tugged the lead sharply and quickened his pace when the savage young sparrow showed signs of good behavior matthias would feed her morsels of candied chestnut the treatment was working outside the gatehouse matthias rested he fed the sparrow ome more of the candied nut there now you good bird well done he said approvingly warbeak scowled fiercely but she munched the nut readily methuselah popped his head out briefly and beckoned come into the study matthias oh and bring that little horror too in the cluttered study the old mouse produced a yellowed volume our old friend sister germaines translation of the original redwall abbey blueprints i think ive found what we are looking for in the main diagram see matthias studied the blueprint carefully brilliant he exclaimed youve done it again my friend a route to the abbey roof from the inside methuselah breathed upon his glasses polishing them on his fur really its thanks to sister germaine for keeping such fastidious records young mouse now heres where youll start an hour later matthias left the gatehouse with warbeak bobbing behind as they went the young mouse muttered to himself ill need five or six strong climbing ropes some spikes oh and a hammer must have a hammer now lets see a good haversack to carry it all enough food and drink ah and some candied chestnuts for you my friend warbeak uttered a stream of curses as she stumbled on the brick matthias waited as she picked herself up tut tut such language for a young sparrow constance and ambrose spike watched the odd pair pass by the badger tapped the side of her head with a paw bats in the belfry or sparrows giggled the hedgehog basil stag hare superintended the willing creatures who carried logs and ruling to shore up the gatehouse entrance the hare had brought a touch of military efficiency to bear upon the exercise he had formed the volunteers into a living chain which constantly passed the defense materials along basil brought his goodnatured authority into play you there fourth from the end chappie liven your ideas up laddie buck thats the third time youve spilled a basket of soil here let me show you how the timid mice smiled among themselves the blustering hare was quite a kindly creature really all bark and no bite at all he shared the tasks with them working as hard as anyone no no brother whatsyourname you pass logs along like this look you go and get a bite to eat come on the rest of you beautiful dreamers stir your stumps or ill have your whiskers for bootlaces the helpers laughed and did the best they could now and again there would be barely stifled giggles as they watched the performance of silent sam he stood behind basil pantomiming the hares every movement puffing up his tiny chest and strutting about importantly in the abbey kitchens cornflower carefully wrapped matthiass food in fresh dock leaves matthias sidled up helping himself to a candied chestnut cornflower rapped his paw with a wooden ladle those nuts are for that poor little sparrow leave them alone you great glutton she scolded matthias snorted indignantly poor little sparrow my eye listen miss if i letthat young hussy off her lead for five minutes wed all be murdered in our beds the young fieldmouse helped matthias with the haversack straps she tried not to let her concern for him show matthias i know you wont tell me where you are going but wherever it is please take care of yourself matthias adjusted the dagger in the black sword belt he stood framed in the doorway smiling confidently dont worry cornflower i fully intend to take care of myself for the safety of redwall abbey and for you a moment later he was gone halfway along the top dormitory passage matthias halted a stepladder was set up underneath a wooden loft door in die ceiling methuselah came along leading warbeak the sparrow was still wearing the collar lead and brick shackle matthias looked up to the door so thats where were going eh the old gatehousekeeper gave him a neatlydrawn map youll find it all marked down there matthias that door leads to a loft turn to your right and keep walking until you touch the wall to your right you will find a gap in the wall on the other side of that gap you will come out about halfway up the wall of great hall it is a ledge between the arches of the sandstone columns from there you must climb up to a higher row of ledges alongside the stainedglass windows scale the rib in the center of the first window to the left you will find yourself on a wooden ridge that runs along parallel to the curve of the roof further along that ridge there is another wooden loft door im sorry but i cannot locate it exactly you must find it yourself when you do go through it and you should be directly underneath the top roof attic from there on you are on your own i cannot help you matthias the ancient mouse placed his paws on his young friends shoulders his voice trembled as he bade goodbye good fortune go with you matthias i wish that i were young and agile once again so that i could accompany you methuselah embraced the young mouse as if he were his own son and as matthias ascended the ladder the old mouse called out final instructions to him if that sparrow causes you any trouble dont hesitate to kick her off into thin air shell come down as fast as the brick shes tied to warbeak scowled but made no comment she knew methuselah spoke the truth the brick was like an anchor against her leg matthias gave the loft door a strong shove upwards and slid it to one side he covered his eyes and coughed as the dust of ages poured down upon his head tugging the sparrow behind him he climbed into the loft it was very dark and gloomy matthias peered over to his right faintly he could make out a strip of wan greyish light filtering in him be gap in wall like old worm mouse say about warbeak chimed hey keep a civil tongue in your head sparrow thats my friend youre talking about gritted matthias as he strode off to the right tugging the lead his concentration broken he stepped awkwardly upon a joist and tripped heavily into the thick dust warbeak was upon the young mouse in a flash the sparrow scratched hard at matthiass neck and pecked at the back of his head forcing it down to the floor matthias felt the suffocating dust clog his mouth as he struggled to turn his body over warbeak pecked and scratched frantically her target obscured by the bulky haversack reaching up behind himself the mouse felt around until he grasped the sparrows leg giving it a hard pull he rolled over plucking out his dagger in the same movement matthias lay across warbeak pinning her to the floor the point of his dagger pricking the sparrows throat listen warbeak matthias panted one more move like that and it will be your last do you hear me both creatures lay still awhile their faces close together breathing heavily the sparrow was still defiant i get chance warbeak killee mouse sparra not give up you see matthias sprang to his feet tugging the lead viciously he dragged the sparrow stumbling and tripping to the crack of light swinging the bird forwards matthias pushed her through the narrow aperture squeezing through after her with great difficulty they were on the first ledge high above great hall without warning matthias shoved warbeak roughly off die ledge the startled sparrow shot downwards and stopped with a jerk only thick neck feathers saving her from strangulation matthias held the lead tightly with both paws straining backwards as the sparrow dangled and fluttered over great hall now you promise to behave yourself or down you go my friend matthias shouted with her heart hammering at the surprise attack and her predicament warbeak realized that she was completely at the mercy of her captor burdened with the brick she had no chance of flying as she hung flapping uselessly matthias called down make up your mind my paws are getting tired this leads beginning to slip a forlorn little voice answered warbeak not wanta die mouse win pull sparra up be good give word bracing himself against a stone arch matthias pulled the sparrow back to safety together they sat on the ledge sharing a canteen of water both weary and dusty matthias was still wary of his prisoner how good is the word of a sparrow he asked warbeak puffed out her chest sparra word always good warbeak no say lie me swear by mothers egg that big swear matthias reflected that he had used desperate measures to secure a promise but with justification he was being uncompromising with himself as well as his captive no more could he afford to be the silly little novice that had bumbled about the abbey before the start of the present troubles he was maturing learning the warriors way this mission was vital redwall depended upon him just as it had once depended upon martin the warrior warbeak cocked her head quizzically to one side what matthias think about the young mouse repacked the water canteen into his haversack oh nothing much warbeak come on wed better get on with an odd feeling matthias realized that he and warbeak were now on firstname terms cluny might be making promotions there were now three rat officers on the list of the dead first it had been skullface killed beneath the wheels of the cart next to go was ragear there was talk of a serpent he was never seen again now redtooth cluny s first officer was missing presumed dead most of clunys army had an eye to promotion not only for prestige there were the extra shares of loot to be considered killconey the ferret extolled the virtues of his weasel friend scragg who had met his death at the foot of the big elm tree aye let me tell you buckos scragg now there was a weasel with a head on his shoulders officer material he was definitely dyou know i still cant figure how a smart boyo like that could let himself be killed in a fall from some old tree cheesethief sneered clumsiness id say was there and saw it all besides cluny wouldnt have a weasel officer ordering rats about and why not challenged the ferret ill wager the chief would promote any creature that showed good sense and a fightin spirit will you look at me now im a fine figure of a ferret why if i was the chief id make me a captain just like that the ferret snapped his claws cheesethief spat upon the ground in contempt of killconey knowing there was not much chance of promotion for himself he was only rated as a minor sort of officer if it came to a decision darkclaw was the natural choice fangburn had fallen from favor since the incident with sela and redtooth nevertheless the weasels and their brethren the stoats and ferrets argued their case hotly why shouldnt others be promoted what was so superior about rats mangefur scumnose and frogblood considered rats to be the elite of clunys horde darkclaw sided with them while trying to placate the others attempting to keep a foot in either camp should it come to a vote one never knew little chance there was of anything democratic being allowed by cluny the scourge who lay on the bed with his eye closed ignoring the whispered bickering and backbiting around him he would promote only when he was good and ready meanwhile just let any of his horde dare try to press the issue sela and her son skulked in a corner they felt trapped nobody had spoken to them since the demise of redtooth it was as if they were being blamed suddenly cluny called over to sela hey fox take that brat of yours outside for a bit get some fresh air and remember no wandering off send darkclaw in here to me and that gabby ferret whatsisname killconey the foxes hastened to do as they were told glad to be out of the oppressive atmosphere of the sickroom darkclaw and the ferret came marching in not knowing whether to be confident or apprehensive you never knew with cluny they both saluted chief cluny got out of bed he paced back and forth testing his legs each day they were a bit stronger he walked past the pair and spoke without turning to face them who knows anything about tunneling killconey stepped smartly forward ah the tunnels yer honor youre talkin tt the very creature cluny rested upon his standard you who else but meself sir the ferret wheedled and dont i know some grand ould animals that could help ferrets like me stoats and weasels why sure were as good as any mole when it comes to the tunnelin so we are shorin and bankin sinkin shafts and galleries cluny banged the standard against the floor enough where are these others that you mentioned killconey cocked a claw over her shoulder sure theyre all outside your worship shall i go and fetch them go and dont be all day about it cluny replied killconey threw a fancy salute and departed cluny pulled darkclaw close to him he spoke confidentially dont you know anything about tunnels darkclaw the rat shook his head unhappily cluny put his claw around darkclaws shoulder well never mind ive got other work for you we cant let ferrets stoats and weasels take all the glory can we youve always been a good solid rat darkclaw you help me and ill see that you get a rich reward when the time comes darkclaw nodded obediently some time later cluny was deep in conference with killconey and his squad it was interrupted by a scuffle and commotion from outside cheesethief strode in dragging chickenhound and prodding sela ahead of him with a spear whats going on here cluny demanded cheesethief smirked triumphantly its these two foxes chief i caught them with their ears against the door they were listening in he skillfully tripped sela and chickenhound with the spear butt they fell in a heap at clunys feet where they lay shivering and protesting their innocence not us sir we werent eavesdropping we were just leaning there for a rest were only simple healers cluny nodded understandingly i see you just wanted to help with the digging is that it eager to please and panicstricken chickenhound blurted out yes thats right sir give us a chance and well tunnel with the best of them sela groaned despairingly as cluny kicked her son viciously who said anything about tunneling fox i only mentioned digging sela attempted to save the situation please sir take no notice of the young fool all he meant was that when you said dig a whack from the bannerstaff silenced sela clunys voice was icy with condemnation traitors all that he meant was that you slipped up when you copied my plans for an attack with a battering ram so now you know that i intend to tunnel into redwall sela licked dry lips she stared pleadingly at the warlord there was no mercy in the single eye you know too much vixen you and your son played a dangerous game nobody outsmarts cluny ive won and you have both lost the foxes clasped their claws they knelt whimpering pitifully cluny stood over them enjoying his power as judge he signaled to cheesethief and darkclaw take these miserable turncoats out of my sight you know what to do shrieking and screaming for mercy the foxes were dragged away cluny turned back to the ferrets weasels and stoats now about this tunnel matthias and warbeak had made slow progress the climb up to the arches and stainedglass windows was long and arduous matthias had relieved the sparrow of her brick hobble pinioning her wings make the going easier at intervals the young mouse drove spikes into the joints of the stone he was careful not to look down it was a terrifyingly impressive distance down to the abbey floor only once did he risk a quick glance not certain if the dark spot on the ground might be methuselah watching them there was real peril negotiating the curve at the top of the arch hanging tightly to the spikes he had fixed matthias leaned out dangerously there was nothing but determination and the strength in his paws to stop him from plunging down to a frightening death gritting his teeth he made it to the apex of the arch he reached over the stone ledge which divided the arch from the stainedglass windows above and taking a firm grip propelled himself upwards and sideways his legs landed further along the ledge with his cheek resting on the stone he gave one last heave and rolled on to the safety of the ledge sitting up matthias knotted two ropes together he lowered them to warbeak who was waiting below at the base of the arch the sparrow looped the rope about herself as she climbed she aided matthias by finding clawholds and making use of the spikes leaning back against the stainedglass windows they ate lunch warbeak gave a twittering laugh matthias all red mouse ha you should talk warbeak matthias replied look at yourself youre blue all over the bizarre effect was created by sunlight shining through the stainedglass as they ate warbeak would dodge her head from side to side changing color as she did so lookeet now me green blue again now red like a matthias mouse if you dont sit still youll be white with fright because youll fall matthias warned when they were sufficiently recovered to start again matthias tried the sandstone center rib of the window it was carved into a profusion of curlicues and niches which made the climb considerably easier soon they reached the wooden ridge at the bottom of the roof curvature it was perilously narrow together they edged along it their backs bent unsafely forward with the curve of the ceiling behind neither of them was aware of the inquisitive beaked face of a sparrow who watched them from the corner of a stainedglass window it noted the wouldbe intruders then flew off matthias drew his dagger he stuck it into the wooden ceiling to steady himself as they halted to look for the next loft door i can see it said matthias there along to your left youll have to lead warbeak gingerly the sparrow slid her claws along the smooth wooden ridge suddenly matthias felt the dagger come free from the wood he lost his grip and leaned outwards teetering and waving his paws warbeak stopped him falling by pulling him back the dagger went spinning down it was a considerable time before they heard the faint clatter as it hit the abbey floor gosh said matthias in an awed voice i thought id had it then i was certain id fall thanks for saving me warbeak gradually they inched their way along until they arrived beneath the loft door it was too high and difficult for either of them to reach matthias made several attempts before he had to admit defeat he sat upon the ridge kicking his legs and feeling quite angry with himself failure stared him in the face a fool thats what am a little fool climbing all this way to be beaten by an old loft door the sparrow tapped him with her claw why not matthias cut warbeak free then fly with sparra wings and open little worm door matthias looked blank beg pardon warbeak explained again you no listen warbeak say cut wings free fly up and open door give me your sparrows word that you wont fly off is good give sparra word promise no scape swear by your mothers egg by mothers egg warbeak swear matthias undid the twine that pinioned the sparrows wings and warbeak flapped her wings experimentally long time no fly me good you see the young sparrow launched herself off the ridge she went into a series of zooming circles and performed a few acrobatic turns for her companions benefit matthias grinned righto im impressed now get back here you little showoff and open this door warbeak sped back hovering level with the loft door as she set her claws into the latch watch out door open fall on mouse the young mouse backed away as the sparrow released the door it banged down hard flapping on its hinges this time matthias was aware that there would be another shower of falling dust when the door opened downwards wisely he had edged sufficiently along the ridge to avoid both with warbeak flying behind him as a backup in case he fell matthias used the open door as a ladder he was soon up through the opening though the inside was dull and gloomy he could see they were in a long trenchlike defile one side of which was a fairly straight wall while the other side was a high curving slope the reverse side of the arched wooden ceiling matthias called warbeak to him he undid the collar and lead from the sparrows neck and packed them away in the haversack he patted his flying friend warbeak i can no longer keep you collared you are a free sparrow and a very good friend the young sparrow blinked her fierce little eyes matthias my mouse friend i no leave stay with you together they spent several minutes searching the high ceiling above warbeak having the advantage of flight was first to find the final trapdoor that they had guessed must exist it was not a hard climb for matthias merely an excited and rather undignified scramble up the curving wooden roof back this time they found that the door opened inwards it was really heavy the two companions strained together until it creaked loudly and opened matthias scrambled through followed by warbeak they found themselves completely surrounded by sparrows as the door slammed shut behind them the birds argued and chattered aloud as they sprang upon matthias pinning him to the lid of the door with many claws he was unable to move a single whisker as quickly as it had started the noise ceased the flock of birds parted matthias found himself staring straight into the bold aggressive face of a big stronglooking male sparrow the bird glared at him with a crazy light in its bright mad eyes mouse worm you my prisoner this court of sparra me king bull sparra the bodies of sela and chickenhound the two traitor foxes lay limp in the ditch that ran alongside the road the rats of clunys horde had executed them with spears and tossed them there sela lay still her once bright cunning eyes glazed over in death but gradually chickenhound began to twitch and groan he was still alive the foxs entire body was afire with pain twice they had stabbed him once in the back leg and again right through the loose skin and fur at the scruff of his neck chickenhound had screamed and fallen into the ditch helped by the feet of the rat executioners he had immediately blacked out selas carcass landed on top of her sons body in the shallow muddy water the rats were satisfied that both foxes were dead and if they were not well who was going to climb down through all of those stinging nettles into the slippery ooze to find out they hurled clods of earth at the prone forms in the ditch and stood watching them for a time when flies began to gather on the foxes the rodents lost interest and wandered off chickenhound regained his senses he lay quite still with selas body draped across him when he was satisfied that the coast was clear he struggled painfully clear of the grisly carcass that had once been his mother old fool she would never have been in this mess if shed let a much younger and smarter fox handle things with a total lack of sorrow for his deceased parent chickenhound began figuring out his next move he would have to he low in this stinking ditch until darkness fell even though he was severely hurt the irony of the situation caused the young fox a silent snigger it was he not his mother who had outwitted cluny now he would soon be free with die revised plans of the attack upon redwall abbey surely that would be worth something as soon as it was dark chickenhound made his move he was only too glad to do so flies wasps worms and all manner of crawlies had been thoroughly investigating him all afternoon slowly and carefully he rolled about in the thick mud until it formed a poultice cooling the wounds in his leg and neck preventing further blood loss under the cover of night he wobbled unsteadily to his feet limping away up the bed of the ditch towards redwall the going was painfully slow but chickenhound consoled himself on the long journey by boosting his own ego maybe a silly bunch of rats could put one over on sela huh she was old and had lost a lot of her guile not like me they hadnt reckoned with a smart intelligent young fox like i am ill show them revenge will be mine theyll see what its like to be up against an expert in espionage hours later within sight of the abbey walls chickenhound discovered a slope that was not too steep and started to pull himself up out of the ditch he gasped and cried out in agony as he climbed using some creepers and an overhanging bush the young fox finally made it to the road completely exhausted he lay in the dust how long he had been dragging his wounded body along the ditch bed he could not tell in his present weakened condition he could not go a step farther but fell into a state halfway between unconsciousness and sleep silent sam was cornflowers bodyguard on her nightly round of the ramparts he marched solemnly by her side as she gave out mugs of hot soup to the grateful sentries that watched through the night hours ambrose spike watched hungrily as she poured him a steaming mug of the delicious soup the hedgehog thanked her profusely hoping that there might be seconds after the others had been served what a thoughtful little body you are miss cornflower i always say theres nothing like some good homemade vegetable soup to keep the life in my old spines its a fair night but mark you it gets a bit chill twixt dark and dawn mdear while the hedgehog and the mouse were chatting silent sam was never still for a second he trotted about on the parapet always sucking his paw leaping from stone to stone fighting off imaginary foes with his tiny dagger at first cornflower thought he was playacting as usual the baby squirrel stood on top of the gatehouse threshold pointing down to the road with his knife he beckoned cornflower and ambrose with his wellsucked paw to come and see something the young fieldmouse wagged her ladle put that dagger away and stop your climbing you little scamp silent sam remained as he was like a welltrained pointer dog praps hes trying to tell us summat miss grunted ambrose he waddled over to the parapet and looked down to where sam pointed well bless msoul miss cornflower i do believe that our little soldier ere has spotted a hobject theres a creature a layin down there but im blowed if its fish or fowl theres so much mud and dust plastered on it whispered the hedgehog you stay put missy ill go and fetch help cornflower and silent sam stood looking down from the parapet ambrose aided by jess squirrel and foremole ventured out into the road to investigate at their back stood a dozen stout mice guarding the gatehouse door under the command of basil stag hare steady in the ranks there said the hare quietly keep your eyes peeled for signs of ambush and no talking now chickenhound was lugged inside as rapidly as possible unable to contain their curiosity the defenders questioned the limp halfawake fox as they carried him across the abbey grounds did your friends the rats do this i suppose its sanctuary you want now harr warra youm be about a layin in yon road chickenhound s head flopped from side to side as he was borne along he would only say one thing the abbot i must see the abbot keep that badger away from me or youll learn nothing basil dismissed the rearguard and caught up with ambrose i say youd best get that rascal straight to the jolly old abbot let him make his statement before he pegs out doncha know chickenhound was hauled into the abbey building and laid out on a bench abbot mortimer shuffled up in his nightshirt rubbing sleep from his eyes he inspected the foxs wounds with a critical practiced look and spoke dispassionately well fox what do you want from us no doubt cluny your master has sent you here to spy chickenhound shook his head in weak denial please i must have some water jess squirrel picked up the water jug but withheld it tell the father abbot what you want sly one she rasped sternly the fox reached out feebly for the water jug much to the abbots dismay jess still held it at a distance speak first youll get water when we get information she insisted the sight of an injured animal distressed the abbot but he decided wisely to leave matters to jess the squirrel knew what she was doing clunys horde did this to me croaked the fox my mother sela they killed her i know of clunys new plans care for me and i will tell you all chickenhound fainted clean away huh i certainly wouldnt waste good time and medicine on this one said jess coldly ambrose spike scratched his stomach speculatively true jess neither would i but mayhap he has vital information otherwise why would he drag himselfere in this state the abbot inspected the foxs neckwound beneath the muddied fur what ambrose says makes sense would you lift the wretched creature up and carry him to the sick bay please cornflower and silent sam watched the fox being carried away sam stood in front of her his dagger drawn to protect them both she ruffled his pointed ears its all right now sam she said gently the fox cannot hurt us thank you for protecting me the little squirrel sheathed his knife and resumed pawsucking winifred and abbot mortimer sat by the bed in the sick bay they kept up their vigil until chickenhound regained consciousness the fox whimpered he gazed around at the homely little room oh my neck what is this pjace where am i he groaned winifred pushed the patient gently back on to the pillows and held a bowl of water to the cracked dry lips please drink this and lie still she ordered chickenhound slurped and gulped greedily at the water as the abbot enlightened him you are in the infirmary at redwall abbey as yet i do not know the full extent of your injuries when you have rested my friends will cleanse you and dress your wounds chickenhound could hardly believe his ears you mean i can stay but i havent told you of the new plans yet the abbot wiped driblets of water from his patients chin listen to me my son we would not turn you away from our gates unless you were an enemy that meant us harm all creatures are cared for at redwall abbey and it is my task to care for the sick and injured you are my responsibility whether or not you choose to give information is a matter that your own heart must deal with meanwhile you will receive our hospitality and sanctuary until you are fully recovered chickenhound lay thinking about what the kindly old mouse had said suddenly he blurted out the battering ram is only a decoy cluny means to use it as a diversion so that he can tunnel underneath your abbey walls i dont know exactly where he plans to start digging but i do know that he will come at you from under the ground the abbot shook his head reprovingly as winifred lowered the lamp flame and drew the curtains cluny is surely the spawn of darkness he will stop at nothing my son now i realize this and i believe what you tell me is true but why did you crawl all the way to redwall with this information almost at the cost of your life chickenhound did his best to look sorrowful and outraged as he lied because they killed old sela sir she was my mother i will not rest until justice is done to her murderers the abbot patted the young foxs paw thank you for entrusting your confidence in us young one close your eyes now and try to get some rest when the abbot had departed chickenhound snuggled his filthy body down against the clean white sheets he felt a little better already well enough to have a quiet snigger there was no fool like an old fool this mouse was as stupid as sela had been let the mice fight the rats and the rats fight the mice what did he care redwall must be a veritable treasure house to a clever young fox dunwing was the widowed mother of warbeak she was also sister to the mighty king bull sparra when her daughter was shot down by the arrow she had given her up as dead now that she was back safe and sound she stroked and scolded her at the same time with relief when she could get a chirp in edgeways warbeak related the strange story to her mother in the rapid sparra dialect as she was doing this matthias lay pinned to the floor by the claws of many fierce sparra warriors as far as he could tell the place was one enormous loft this was the court of king bull sparra whose wrath seemed about to descend upon him the sparrows lived higgledypiggledy here in one great untidy tribe the roof above met in the shape of an upturned v thus making the court a long triangular structure under the eaves at either edge were countless scruffylooking nests all of which appeared to be filled to overflowing with shrieking baby sparrows at one end the loft was blocked off by roofing slates and old nesting materials this was the kings own private chamber matthias estimated that it was probably underneath where the weather vane was situated king bull sparra was not a bird to be trifled with he noticed the young mouses evident interest in his surroundings and quickly diverted his attention with a savage kick at the helpless figure whatta mouseworm want in court of king he snapped matthias realizing that this was no time for idle chitchat promptly shouted out in a loud courtly manner o king i come to return one of your brave young warriors the statement caused an immediate hullaballoo bull sparra flapped his wings once and quiet descended he cocked his head to one side assessing this bold young intruder you lie mouseworm not help sparra mouse enemy he shrieked king bull sparra say killee enemy kkilleet instantly matthias found himself fighting for his life the sparra soldiers piled in on him jabbering clawing and pecking he managed to get a paw free and struck out left and right dealing hefty blows to several of the sparrows matthias realized that he would soon be overwhelmed as more sparrows pressed in on him urged on by the mad exhortations of their king kkilleet kkiueet make mousa dead killeet as matthias battled to free his other paw he felt himself enveloped by two pairs of wings warbeak and dunwing were attempting to shelter him the mother sparrow was crying out no killee mouse good save my egg sparra the king was not convinced mouse enemy gotta make dead king bull sparra had no fledglings of his own warbeak who was his favorite niece called out to her uncle appealing for mercy no no king bull not killee matthias mouse him save warbeak give sparra word to mouse that you no killee the king sprang in among his warriors scattering them kke chaff they cowered before him as he shouted out a new edict foolworms stop king say no killee mouse we have sparra word of my sisters eggchick the sparra warriors backed off matthias picked himself up luckily he had not come to much harm he dusted his habit off whew thank you once again warbeak my friend i owe you my life the king issued orders to two sparra warriors battlehawk windplume getta bag find out what mouse carry matthias stood firm as the haversack was pulled from his back the two warriors could not figure out how to open it they tore at the material with beak and claw until it gave way the contents scattered upon the floor matthias stood respectfully to one side as the king rummaged through his meager possessionsking bull sparra drank some water from the canteen he spat it out no worms only mousefood he commented warbeak sighed wistfully she looked longingly on as her uncle found the package of candied chestnuts and ripped it open bull sparra dubiously sampled one his face lit up with pleasure this good food for sparra king not good for mouseworm me keep he tucked the candied chestnuts under his wing then picked up the collar and lead and beckoned to matthias mouseworm come here you lucky king letta live the young mouse approached the sparrow with trepidation not wanting to antagonize the moody dangerous bird the sparra king buckled the collar tightly about matthiass neck scarcely leaving him room to breathe he attached the lead and laughed aloud dutifully the other sparrows laughed with him matthias felt his blood boil he tried to contain his rising temper the court of the sparra king was no place to have tantrums mentally he promised himself that he would never again use a collar on any living creature the indignity was unspeakable bull sparra handed the lead to warbeak turning to his subjects he chuckled insanely and pointed at matthias king bull sparra spare mouse how you like him for pet my niece mouse you obey my sister and her eggchick funny ha all the sparrows laughed loud and long vying with each other to show the most merriment the king was a completely unpredictable tyrant when he made a joke it was always funny warbeak gave the lead a tug and whispered to her friend matthias you see warbeak and mother not make laugh sorry the young captive winked at his warder he was beginning to hatch a plan dont worry my friend at least im alive warbeak handed the lead to her mother this dunwing she mother good sparra not hurt mouse see dunwing gave the lead a light pull she gave matthias a smile and a nod he decided that he liked warbeaks mother the king issued his orders to warbeak and dunwing you keep mouseworm on lead no wander no stray give plenty work much kick like this bull sparra raised a kick at matthias who dodged nimbly and started to dance and sing with a silly expression on his face the king stood with his head cocked to one side amazed at the performance of this strange mouse matthias pranced comically about improvising a song as he went up higher than before im near the roof indeed the king gave me a collar his sister holds the lead round and round he skipped repeating the verse over and over bull sparra happed his wings and laughed hysterically hahahahahahaha look battlehawk see windplume mouseworm be hurt in headbrain he crazy hahahahahahaha obediently everybody laughed with the mad monarch after a while the sparrows drifted off some to their nests others to hunt worms a chosen few went with the king to play three feathers a popular sparra gambling game of which bull sparra was very fond dunwing and her daughter led the dancing mouse off to their nest at the rear of the court under the farthest eaves despite its outwardly untidy appearance the nest was neat and cozy on the inside warbeak had gathered matthiass gear together repacking it into the torn haversack she returned it to her mouse friend eyeing him in an apprehensive manner matthias be sick in head she inquired the young mouse lay back gratefully in dunwings nest and smiled reassuringly at them both not at all im as sane as you are however ifl act as if im mad then maybe your king and his warriors will not regard me as a threat perhaps they will leave me alone and forget about me dunwing looked up from the meal she was preparing her eyes were serious matthias mouse do right thing she said bull sparra be wicked bad temper sometimes dunwing think bull sparra mad best he thinks you noharm mouse matthias bowed deferentially to her thank you dunwing you are a very brave sparrow you put yourself and warbeak in great peril saving me as you did dunwing served them both some food thankfully matthias noted that she refrained from putting worms and dead insects on his portion the mother sparrow watched him with soft intelligent eyes the mouse was about the same age as her daughter matthias save my warbeak she said we have no sparra warrior to look after us warbeak brave like father was now father he dead i learn to stand up for us til warbeak grow into great warrior some day the hours slipped by as the three conversed matthias learned much of the sparra customs and way of life dunwing being the kings sister was of royal blood her husband had been killed the previous spring in a battle with some starlings he had saved the life of the king whereupon bull sparra had vowed to care for her and her daughter but he had instantly forgotten his promises leaving the pair to fend for themselves only in moments of urgency would dunwing remind him of his vow knowing that bull sparra was a dangerous despot so normally dunwing maintained a diplomatic silence in his presence sometimes bull sparra would retire to his private chamber he would remain in there brooding for days suddenly emerging to fire his warriors with grandiose schemes and wild ideas no one dared to disobey him even though half an hour later he had forgotten his previous foolhardy notions and wandered off to hunt worms later he would return to find that his plans had not been carried out in a furious squabble of accusation and recrimination he would demote officers and promote the most unlikely soldiers from the ranks next day he had forgotten it all again and was hatching more crazy plans matthias was constantly amazed at the mode of life in the sparra court the sparrows showed no kindness or civility to one another often fighting savagely among themselves on the slightest pretext warriors and even fledglings joined in the injuries they inflicted upon each other were appalling sparra folk knew nothing of the firemakers art by day the court was illuminated by sunlight that streamed in through the cracked and broken slates and slanted up through the eaves all food was eaten uncooked worms and small insects providing the main diet the sparra did not discriminate between different species of insects all came under the genera heading of worm thus a sparrow might make a meal of a butterfly or a grasshopper and refer to it as wormfeed worm was also used to denote an enemy or a coward or anything alien to the sparra fresh flowers and tender shoots of vegetation were used to supplement the worm diet also berries and whatever fruit a sparra could carry in flight matthias was grateful for this he abhorred the idea of eating live worms or dead insects there was no strict routine of chores ever carried out apart from parents feeding fledglings everything was left undone until tomorrow which meant it never was done the evidence of this lay all about the court dirt dust filth and general chaos prevailed matthias gradually found that once he could keep pace with the speedy delivery of sparra language it was relatively simple some of the sparra chattered with such rapidity that matthias was sure they could not understand themselves matthias was not sure whether warbeak knew of his mission to bring back martins sword certainly dunwing did not the young mouse had had a good look round most of the court but the sword was not to be seen matthias reasoned that it must be in the one place he had not yet explored the private chamber of the king he thought long and hard about how he might obtain access to the royal apartment he did not want to cause trouble for his friends nor did he want tbem to suspect what he had come for and supposing he did regain the sword the next problem would be how to take it safely back down to the floor of the abbey and his own kind i i i matthias figured that he had been in his new surroundings for a night and a day towards the evening of that day he was sitting outside the nest repairing his torn haversack and taking stock of his personal effects each time a sparrow passed by he would grin vacantly and strike up his song no one bothered to take much heed of him warbeak flew in from a lone wormhunt she stood watching matthias me hunt worms she chirped bring dandelions for matthias mouse like eat flowers matthias replied in sparra language warbeak good hunter mouse like flower make good wormfood where be dunwing mother warbeak pointed to the kings chamber dunwing get bull sparra wormfood ready king have no wife to make food matthias acted unconcerned he pulled at the collar to loosen it collar hurt mouseneck he grinned warbeak shrugged sympathetically king say you weara no can take off me sorry matthias continued sorting through his belongings he came across an unopened package what a stroke of luck it was candied chestnuts hastily he slipped them into the haversack hiding the nuts from warbeak under normal circumstances he would gladly have given them to his friend but this was different matthias needed them as bait they continued gossiping until dunwing returned after a decent interval the young mouse spoke to her you go to kings room all lotta time dunwing nodded me only sparra king bull let into there she laughed he lazy sparra not make own wormfood matthias shared her laughter betcha king not know how to make own wormfood he chuckled what you think dunwing matthias find a gift for king the sparra mother looked up sharply what mouse mean gift matthias drew close and whispered conspiratorially you member how king bull like mouse candynuts me find more you take me we give nuts to king dunwing looked doubtful what for mouse wanta give nuts to king matthias spread his paws as if stating the obvious so king let mouse free wanta go back to mousehome matthias held his breath and watched dunwing finally tier face softened she smiled sympathetically all right matthias we try not do much harm but member not fttake bull sparra bad temper he killee sure with an inward sigh of relief matthias swept up the packet of nuts thank you sparra mother he said mouse not make jbrouble for you nuts make king happy you see with matthias trailing behind her on his lead dunwing lapped on the slates which formed king bull sparras wall an irate voice came from within fly way sparra king wanta sleep dunwing realized they had chosen a bad moment nevertheless she persisted this time tapping harder let in king iferother it dunwing and crazy mouseworm gotta gift for great king a sleepy head poked round the door opening bull sparra ced owlishly at them and yawned in their faces better be portant majesty no like to be woked he grumbled as they entered the room matthias skipped about and sang his ditty whipping out the packet he selected a nut and topped it straight into the open beak of the astonished ruler mouseworm find more candynuts for big king sparra matthias giggled fetch here quick maybe mouse give king lib nuts king letta mouse go home free the king munched and chomped greedily on the sweet ut eyeing the packet covetously ha mouseworm give king alia nuts majesty have great things on mind me thinka out hmmm letta mouse go freehome matthias capered about he went down on one knee offering the nuts bull sparra snatched the parcel hoggishly he stuffed far more of the nuts into his beak than it could cope with closing his eyes in ecstasy he gobbled furiously pieces of nut falling from his beak littered his breast feathers matthiass eyes roved about the chamber searching it was nothing special as sparra habitations went a straw palliasse some butterfly wings stuck to the wall by way of decoration in one corner there was a huge overstuffed old chair how it got there would forever remain a mystery matthiass attention was held by something that protruded out of the back of the chair it was an oldfashionedlooking object made from black leather with lots of silver trimming identical to the belt he was wearing the scabbard of martins sword surely the sword must be somewhere close by matthias wished that he could see around the back of the chair to confirm his discovery but he had to bring himself back to the issue at hand king bull sparra crammed the last candied chestnuts into his beak and chomped with evident enjoyment dunwing attempted to press for justice king eat gift now mouse go free the king held out a grasping claw more mouseworm got more candynut gift for majesty matthias remained kneeling he appealed to the gluttonish ruler o king mouse have no got more candynuts give all to great majesty now you let mouse go freehome he said hopefully bull sparra pecked nut morsels from his feathers his eyes gleaming craftily ah now king give sparra word i say if mouseworm give more candynuts then go free but must give lot the king spread his wings wide apart this many lot the young mouse bowed his head but majesty me got no more nut unexpectedly bull sparras mood changed for the worse he crumpled the empty dockleaf packet and hurled it into matthiass face mouseworm get more more you hear his eyes shone madly as the feathered hackles rose around his neck king not argue with crazy mouseworm you get gone now plenty quick or me killee go now majesty sleep sensing that the king had become dangerous dunwing did not hesitate roughly she dragged the mouse by the lead from the chamber matthias spluttered with uncontrolled rage dunwing how you letta stupid oaf be king of sparra he choked the mother sparrow shushed soothingly and dragged matthias off to the safety of her nest warbeak had gone off hunting again dunwing sat down and tried to reason with the angry young mouse matthias not let king pull hear say him stupid oaf you be dead wormbait much soon matthias opened his mouth to protest the sparrow silenced him with an upraised wing all birds know that king bull mighty fighter him save sparra tribe many time from enemy he sometime lazy sometime bad temper but not stupid bull sparra sly like fox only pretend to be stupid just like matthias i dunwing had guessed that matthias had gone to the kings chamber for other reasons than to gain his freedom this was very wise mother bird he decided to put all of his cards on the table dunwing listen i want to tell you a story he said it ik all about the mice who live in the abbey beneath us and of one mouse in particular called martin the warrior v the sparrow listened intently as the young mouse unfolded ithe story of redwall abbey and the part that he was playing in its hour of need when matthias had finished his tale dunwing saw the truth of it in his open face she drew close land said quietly matthias dunwing knew first day you come here i see belt you wear it all same as thing behind yfihair in kings room v but why matthias interjected again dunwing v silenced him young mouse sit still she said now me tell you story vmany time ago before my mother was egg king named

happy bull sparra rule for now huh lose heart lose sword no good crazy bird bull sparra that night as he settled down to sleep in dunwings nest matthias had a good deal to reflect upon so king bull had lost the sword to a giant worm with poison teeth matthias knew the description fitted only one thing a snake poison probably meant it was an adder he had never seen an adder nor any other type of snake at redwall he had learned of snakes from the talk of others they spoke of the adder as if it were a reptile that was half legend half nightmare it was said that even the father abbot himself would flatly refuse to treat a snake no matter how bad its condition might be luckily there had never been cause to there had never been reports of an adder in the area of mossflower that was why most creatures tended to treat it as a mythical reptile but wise ones like constance the abbot and old methuselah assured everyone that the adder was cold deadly fact they said that in all the world there was nothing more feared the strong coils hypnotic eyes and poison fangs matthias shuddered it sounded even more fearsome than cluny the scourge how could a mere mouse take the sword from this adder that dunwing had described the one that said asmodeussss matthias tried to put it from his mind gradually sleep overtook him you come quick mouseworm king wanta see you rough claws seized matthias dragging him from the nest only half awake it was the two sparra warriors battlehawk and windplume they lugged matthias off without further explanation tugging cruelly on his lead the last things lie saw before he was pulled off into the darkness of the court were the pale worried faces of dunwing and warbeak he shouted to reassure them dont worry ill be all right take care of yourselves battlehawk hit matthias in the face with a stiff bony wing mouseworm shut beak or me killee not before i see your king you wont the young mouse retorted battlehawk aimed a kick at him but windplume deflected it leave mouse alone you killee him king killee us windplume grinned at matthias mouse cheeky but brave like sparra warrior king bull sparra had finished napping something was disturbing him about the captive mouse he had been too busy guzzling candied chestnuts to let it bother him but now that he was wide awake it hit him like a ton of bricks the mouseworms belt what had taken dunwing a single glance to recognize had finally dawned on the king matthiass belt was the same as the sword case behind his own chair a broken piece of mirror reflecting the moonlight was the only illumination in the kings chamber he dismissed his two warriors to wait outside the king of the sparra folk sat staring at the young mouse in silence matthias stood his ground bravely not knowing what to expect bull sparra stood up he strutted about in front of matthias then around behind him matthias felt his belt gripped from behind by strong claws the crazed king whispered close in his ear where mouseworm get belt matthias swallowed hard he tried to act casual belt oh you mean this belt mouse always have belt for many long time not know where me get thump matthias hit the floor as the king shoved him fiercely in the back mouse lie king bull not wormfool where you get tell tell as he shouted madly the sparrow pulled at the belt matthias knew he was facing death with the insane ruler in one of his lunatic rages he must think fast no got more candynuts the young mouse cried please majesty give mouseword no more candynuts me give great king this belt then he letta mouse go freehome matthiass plea had the desired effect upon the mad king he sat in the big chair his eyes glinting cunningly sparra law say king must killee mouseworm but me good majesty no killee mouse give belt to king matthias unbuckled the belt and handed it over king bull fondled it then fastened it on himself as he admired the belt strutting in front of the broken mirror the sparrow spoke in a normal voice nice good belt mouse know of great sword instantly matthias was on his guard one wrong word might spell death for dunwing and warbeak he must affect ignorance to allay the kings suspicions oh majesty that good belt make king look fine like mighty warrior not look so good on mouse bull sparra appeared flattered he preened himself then asked the question again this time in a coaxing tone surely matthias know of great sword in spite of his dangerous predicament matthias was inwardly amused at the kings use of his name slumping to the floor he sat with his head between his paws the picture of dejected innocence oh mighty king mouse not have more candynuts not know bout sword thing not even have belt now me die if not soon go free please letta poor mouseworm go home matthiass show of pathos seemed to cheer the king he tucked his wingtips into the belt that he had fooled the mouseworm into giving him ha he had eaten all the mouses nuts too feeling no end of a fine bird he gave a sharp whistle that brought his two warriors on the double looka this mouseworm he scoffed he not happy that i spare him you take mouse back to my sister dunwing tell her king say take care of mouseworm he give me good gifts candvnut belt maybe mouse find more gift for good majesty who let live take way now must get more sleep go as matthias was dragged off once more he pretended to cry out m distress this caused bull sparra much amusement he waved a wing in farewell calling out to the prisoner getta good sleep mouseworm thinka way to get more gift for majesty hahahahaha the two warriors and a nearby fledgling who was half awake laughed obediently with their king matthias thanked his lucky stars that he had once more come out alive had he refused to give the belt he would surely have died anyhow he reflected it was only a temporary loan as he planned on stealing the scabbard from bull sparra why not the belt to go with it basil stag hare and jess squirrel were as thick as thieves when they were not helping with the defenses they could be found in odd corners whispering together nobody knew what their conversations were about or what exactly they were plotting but with the fastest runner and the champion climber of mossflower it was sure to be something spectacular cornflower and silent sam watched them stealing off at lunchtime to continue their conspiracy beneath the trees in the orchard where they would not be disturbed what do you suppose your mum and basil are up to sam asked the young fieldmouse whose curiosity was aroused silent sam shrugged his tiny shoulders and buried his head in the lunchtime milkbowl he drank in a noisy enjoyable infant fashion whatever jess was planning had sams complete approval simply because his mother could do no wrong as far as he was concerned basil stretched comfortably in the shade while jess sat out in the sunlight her tail curled overhead acting as a sunshade ah this is the life jess me old climber basil yawned cavernously as he fed crumbs to the ants plenty to keep the inner creature satisfied scorching june weather and a tophole billet for snoozin what what jess nibbled on a wedge of cheese aye and its up to woodlanders like us to keep it that way basil what sort of a neighborhood would this be for young uns like my sam to grow up in if cluny and his lot were to take over basil humphed through his militarystyle whiskers good grief doesnt bear thinkin about old girl those rats and vermin an absolute shower of yahoos and cads bad influence yknow they both sat nodding in agreement faces full of grim righteousness uttering dire home truths and generally working themselves up into a fine old state of indignation huh cluny the scourge a bully and a braggart if ever i dapped eyes on one yes and a robber to boot fancy stealing martins tapestry from the mice what harm have they ever done to him yknow it strikes me that itd do the father abbots heart good to see that tapestry back in its rightful place again indeed it would and the troops would take new heart ha what a blow it would be to that feller cluny and his filthy band of robbers basil bounded up and ate the last of jesss cheese decisively well what are we waiting for then come on jess you old hazelnut woffler up and at em forward the fur jess flexed her climbing claws and bared her teeth angrily just you try and stop me she chattered fiercely without telling anyone of their intentions the two expert campaigners slid out secretly by one of the small doors in the abbey walls soon they were stealing through the green noontide depths of mossflower wood cluny was up and about his first decision was to put the horde through their paces he had decided that they had become fat and lazy from lying about in the church grounds while he was confined to bed but now that he was on the mend they were going to do some drill standing on a tombstone he leaned slightly upon his standard and viewed the army in training panting and sweating a large mob of rats dashed to and fro burdened by the battering ram the captains hoping to curry favor with cluny harangued the hapless runners pick your feet up you lilylivered scum come on lift that ram properly you idle devils practice tunnels were being dug willynilly owing to the lack of communication between rats and other species ferrets weasels and stoats their faces smeared with moist dark earth popped out of the ground in the oddest of places unaccustomed to such strenuous labor they would stop digging as they pleased basking in the sun until they were trodden on by columns of marching rats a squabble would ensue until they all became aware of the watchful eye of cluny then it would be heads down resume marching get back to tunneling either side of cluny on the tombstone stood darkclaw and killconey scornfully watching the chaotic maneuvers the warlord would criticize first one then the other for the shortcomings of the creatures they represented both squirmed under the lash of the chiefs tongue darfcclaw look at the way those rats are marching idiots they look like a flock of lambs at a village school outing havent you taught them anything oh hellfire that stupid lot with the battering ram have just marched straight into a tunnel killconey tell those morons of yours not to tunnel into the parade ground just a minute that weasel there the one grinning all over his face like a drunken duck lock him up without food or water for three days thatll wipe the daft smile offhis face well what a fine pair of commanders you two turned out to be i cant turn my back a minute and youve got all hands behaving like mad frogs in a bucket cluny ranted and fumed at the animals under his banner they were going to march sweat dig carry drill and tunnel until they performed to his satisfaction sloppy idle lot hed show them now that he was back hed keep them at it all day and all night if need be cluny had taken a vow while he by injured never again would he allow himself to be thwarted by mice and woodland creatures at that precise moment it was two of those same creatures who stood on the fringe of mossflower wood spying across the common land to where clunys army was exercising but for the gravity of the situation basil and jess would have seen the chance for many a good laugh what a difference between the antics of this rabble and the way in which the abbey defenders went about their business of training jess observed that it was the contrast between slaving under a tyrant and voluntary cooperation that arose from determination and good fellowship the plans of the two comrades were well laid basil decided that now was as good a time as any to put them into operation he turned to jess well you old treejumper lets see if we cant baffle the blighters with science they shook paws and ventured out on to the common land basil stag hare camouflage expert and foot fighter in the lead jess squirrel champion climber and pathfinder close behind him they were like twin cloudshadows drifting silently across the land cluny had climbed down from his perch on the tombstone he stood by the churchyard fence intent on trying out the whipping powers of his fearsome tail upon a few rats that he had dubbed the awkward squad flexing his long scourgelike tail he gave a few experimental swishes and cracks as he shouted commands left wheel i said left wheel you buffoons you there dont you know the difference between your left and your right hold out your left paw the frightened rat stuck out what he fervently hoped was his left paw swish crack the unfortunate rodent screamed and danced about with the stinging pain of the thick whiplike tail cluny foamed with illtemper blockhead that was your right paw now hold out your left stupid im going to make an example of you this lot wont forget a voice interrupted him tut tut officer striking an enlisted creature bad form old chap thumping bad form cluny whirled round just out of reach across the fence on the common land stood basil stag hare in the at ease position cluny goggled in thunderstruck silence at the audacious basil who merely scowled in mock censure not the sort of thing one expects from a horde commander what personally id have you blackballed from the church premises clunys voice was a strangled yell get him grab that spy i want his head basil chuckled whats the matter isnt your own head good enough no i dont suppose it is uglylooking brute arent you a mob of rats had scrambled through the fence to catch basil but it was like trying to catch smoke upon the wind he was there and gone from her hiding place jess tried hard to stifle her giggles after several exhausting minutes it became apparent that neither the rats nor the dozen or so panting ferrets weasels and stoats who had joined the chase on clunys orders were remotely close to apprehending the strange hare gripping the standard in bloodless claws cluny climbed over the fence to the common land the comrades scheme was beginning to work basil bobbed up alongside cluny what ho old rat showing a bit of initiative never ask the troops to do what you cant do yourself and all that splendid he dodged playfully out of reach cluny snarled and went after him basil ducked and weaved drawing cluny further out on to the common all eyes were upon the two figures this made it easier for jess to change hiding places as she followed them cluny pursued doggedly making no sudden moves waiting for the hare to get overconfident so that he could strike his soldiers moved about twenty paces behind the action cluny had warned them off he wanted a onetoone confrontation cluny jabbed out with the banner at basil the hare inwardly rejoiced they were getting closer to mossflower wood soon jess would make her move meanwhile he must draw the rat further out avoiding the stabs of the banner pole and the swift whiplike slashes of the tail basil realized that this was no clumsy rat he faced he chanced a sudden glance to check if jess was nearby as he did his back left leg shot down into a pothole it twisted and basil fell heavily to the ground cluny charged in he lifted the banner and slammed it down on the hares unprotected head basil twisted quickly to one side now jess now he yelled as basil shouted several things happened at once jess came blasting out of nowhere like a red whirlwind the banner thudded into the soft earth where basils head had been a fraction of a second before basil freed his leg as jess leaped like a salmon in midair she ripped the tapestry clean off the standard in one go cluny bellowed with rage his followers came surging across the common to aid him basil leaped to his feet and hobbled gamely in front of cluny shielding jess the squirrel raced about trying to distract cluny basil winced as he called out to his friend run for it jess ill hold em off jess ducked a blow from clunys tail not likely if you stay then so do i basil limped about keeping himself between cluny and jess you stubborn beast he yelled wilt you get going the horde was almost upon them quick as a flash jess grabbed the end of clunys tail she swung him with all of her might throwing him off balance and sending him crashing into the frontrunners of the horde jess threw basils paw about her shoulder come on basil head for the woods well make it together both creatures dashed from the common into the depths of mossflower behind them clunys horde was in headlong pursuit yelling and shouting as they ran jess panted here take this and give me the decoy hurry basil snatched the tapestry and reached beneath his tunic he gave jess the crude replica they had prepared which was in reality an old dishcloth from friar hugos kitchen the sounds of the pursuers grew louder they were gaining now you drop out of sight jess gasped ill draw them off then you can double back through the churchyard and up the road to red wall theyll never think of searching along that way as suddenly as she had spoken jess glanced to one side basil was no longer there a breathless military voice whispered from the undergrowth will do old chum see you back at the abbey have a good chase now cheerio basil stag hare camouflage expert had gone to earth jess could see cluny and the horde coming through the trees she stood and waited until they caught sight of her she saw cluny point and shout over there the squirrel shes the one whos got the tapestry get her take her alive if you can coolly jess stood her ground until they were almost upon her right at the last second she went like a blur up the side of a horse chestnut tree stopping just out of reach some of the more agile ones tried climbing to get at her jess merely scampered further upwards get down you nincompoops cluny hissed dont try to outclimb a squirrel see if you can keep her near the ground while i think what to do the rats climbed down as they did jess returned to the lower trunk she had to buy as much time as possible to allow basils escape cluny lounged nonchalantly against the tree well done squirrel very clever indeed i could use someone like you in my army somebody smart with brains like yours killconey also demonstrated his persuasive powers ah you take the chiefs word hes lookin for a good first officer why dont you come down now and talk it over sure the loot will be grand when we conquer the ab ouch a small green spiky chestnut still in its husk bounced off the vociferous ferrets head jess moved higher to a branch with a more plentiful supply she waved the decoy tapestry at cluny is this what youre after ratface cluny battled to keep his temper darkclaw nudged him and whispered what about the other one chief shall take some troops and start searching for him no ill deal with the hare another time right now i want you all here in case theres a chance of trapping this one cluny murmured jesss keen ears caught every word the warlord had said the plan had worked she threw a hard spiky nut and called to cluny hey ratface do you actually think that youve got this one trapped ha im about as trapped as a skylark in the air on a clear day theres not one of you can get near me i know that squirrel cluny answered but just think for a moment if i win the war against the mice and i will you know ive made a vow to kill everyone inside redwall now suppose that youve got someone dear to you in there you know what i mean a mate a little baby some family cluny dodged about as a shower of spiky chestnuts hurtled down you filthy murdering scum shouted jess you rotten loathsome slime f you come near my family ill rip that evil eye of yours right out of your face cluny knew that he was succeeding with his scheme against the squirrel as more hard chestnuts pelted down throwing things wont do you much good listen im a reasonable creature all im asking you to do is to think of your family you havent got to join us if you dont want to stay up in that tree forever if you want it doesnt bother me all i need is that little scrap of tapestry it isnt much to ask is it your loved ones will be safe if you hand it over jess was about to hurl more nuts and insulting remarks when the form of clunys plan dawned on her the rat was trying to do exactly as she and basil had done it was a trap to make her become careless two can play at that game jess thought to herself the horde soldiers watching the squirrel noticed a change come over her she appeared agitated gnawing upon her lip and rubbing her paws together in anguish she clutched the tapestry hugging it to her body i dont care about the others at redwall but ive got a husband and a small son you wouldnt hurt them would you cluny the warlord detected a sob in the squirrels voice no no of course i wouldnt he said soothingly all you have to do is let go of that scrap of doth and let it drift down here to me the moment you do your loved ones safety is assured believe me squirrel i give you my word of honor jess wiped her eyes on the decoy cloth and sniffled piteously as she answered well all right then if i have your promise that my family will be safe then you can have this old thing it means nothing to me jess released the piece of material it drifted down through the branches cluny could scarcely restrain himself from leaping for it killconey hurried forward his eyes shining with reverence he picked the dishrag up gently offering it to cluny here you are yer honor the lovely thing itself safe and sound avidly cluny snatched the cloth his eyes narrowed something was wrong he gave a scream of terrible rage instantly his followers scrambled into the bushes as their chief ripped the tapestry into shreds his mighty claws rending and tearing as he roared madly its a fake a copy worthless trash aaaaaarrgh from her perch in the tree jess watched with grim satisfaction aye worthless trash rat just as you are the real tapestry is back at redwall by now youve been fooled kill her kill the dirty little swindler clunys cry rang out but before a spear or a missile could be thrown jess had gone she darted from tree to tree with artistic speed far above mossfiower ground in the upmost terraces of foliage the champion squirrel turned her flight in the direction of redwall abbey sometime around early evening jess arrived back springing lightly from a high elm branch to the parapet of the abbey wall she could tell by the sound of happy chattering and general jubilation that once more the picture of martin was safely back bounding down into the grounds she was surrounded by cheering friends not the least of whom was mr squirrel who smothered her with kisses while their son silent sam sat upon her shoulder and dampened her head by patting it lovingly with a wellsucked paw the woodlanders carried jess shoulderhigh into the dining hall where sat another celebrated hero basil stag hare he looked up momentarily at his comrade from behind a staggering mountain of scrumptious food and pointed to his leg which was swathed in a hugely exaggerated bandage war wound basil muttered as he demolished a plateful of quince and elderberry pie got to keep the old strength up yknow lashings of nourishment only way to heal an honorable injury feed it what what silent sam hopped upon the table he showed basil a tiny scratch on his unsucked paw the kindly hare inspected it gravely egad looks like another serious war wound better sit here by me little warrior feed it well thats the ticket they both tucked in voraciously friar hugo came waddling up his face a picture of delight good creatures he chuckled the late rose is starting to flourish anew eat to your hearts content jess placed her paws on the fat mouses shoulders the squirrels face was a mixture of sadness and concern friar hugo old friend brace yourself i am the bearer of tragic news alarm spread across hugos pudgy features tell me jess what dreadful thing has happened jess spoke haltingly in a broken voice i fear that cluny tore up one of your oldest and most venerable dishrags alas redwall will never see it wipe another plate behind the friars back basil and sam almost choked with laughter in the middle of an apple cream pudding shafts of evening sunlight flooded great hall as old methuselah worked painstakingly away with needle and thread he was sewing martin the warrior back in his former position on the corner of the magnificent redwall tapestry matthias huddled deep into dunwings nest he shuddered comfortably wriggling to get further into the dried moss downfeather and soft grass during the night a wind had sprung up he peeped over the rim of the nest it was a grey day of the kind often found at the toobrilliant start of early summer clouds scudded nose to tail across the sky though it was not raining and the wind was quite warm nevertheless the eaves and the roof cracks magnified the sighing and moaning of the vagrant wind driving the young mouse back to snuggle up once more as he had often done in his own bed in the dormitory matthias thought of the neat cozy little bed and a wave of homesickness swept over him would he ever sleep in it again a busy flutter of wings announced the mother sparrows arrival matthias mousa sleepyhead get up things to be done this day matthias stretched yawned and scratched under the collar good morning dunwing he said politely what things are to be done today the sparrow settled herself she looked gravely at the young mouse today matthias escape sparra court me make plan king not right to keep mouse prisoner matthias was suddenly wide awake the sparrow had his undivided attention a plan what sort of plan oh please tell me dunwing the mother sparrow explained first no can go back through loft door king much angry have many great slate pile on door stop intruders door not open again me think matthias whistled well the crafty old sparrow but how am i going to get back down do you think you could fly me down in some way you are bigger than warbeak dunwing immediately squashed the idea matthias talk crazy even warbeak and dunwing together not able to do mat sparra very light maybe strong beak claws but wings small not like great birds fall like stone carrying mouse huh sometimes even worm too heavy carry in bits two three journeys matthias began to apologize for his ignorance but the mother sparrow cut him short dunwing think plan pay tention now me send warbeak to tell old gatemouse how you call athuselah good my eggchick she tell old mouse to getta big red squirrel bring plenty climbrope when she see you on roof she climb up help matthias mouse down why of course cried matthias what a splendid idea i wouldnt be a bit afraid with jess there to help me down but what about the king and his warriors if they see me i wont stand a chance dunwing waved impatiently that next part of plan pretty soon warbeak come back she tell what time squirrel meet you good then dunwing whisper big lie fib to other sparra it soon spread matthias was puzzled spreading lies what good will that do dunwing preened her feathers smiling craftily great fibba lie me whisper bit here there about giant poisonteeth say him lying hurt down in mossflower trees look to die poisonteeth have sword witha you see matthias gazed in admiration at warbeaks mother well never you are going to spread a rumor that the snake has the sword and is dying down in the woods amazing i can picture it now bull sparra will go chasing straight down mere with his warriors meanwhile i will escape out on to the roof correct dunwing nodded matthias steal belt sword case quickfast climb down off roof with red squirrel the young mouse could not meet the mother sparrows eyes he was overcome with guilt and shame dunwing im sorry how did you guess the sparrow placed a claw upon his paw me know alia time matthias mouse not come to bring my eggchick safehome come for sword not get sword alia same belt case belong mice you must take away these things trouble for sparra husband dead because of sword dunwing clasped matthiass paw warmly dunwing like mouse you good friend to my warbeak me think she dead til you bring back me help you steal case belt matthias was lost for words he laid his head against the mother sparrows soft feathers brushing a tear from his cheek warbeak came fluttering and bustling in wind much strongblow old mouse say he tell squirreljess you be out on roof when josabell ring lunchworm squirreljess meet there with climbrope matthias scarcely tasted the food that warbeak had brought back his mind was focused on the plan it was extremely hazardous there would be great danger not only for himself but also for his sparra friends supposing bull sparra took the belt and sword case with him what if the king left them behind but hid them in a new place would jess be able to catch sight of him if he did not make it out on to the roof what then there were so many things that could go wrong what would martin the warrior have done in a situation like this matthias decided that martin would have put on a brave face and trusted to a warriors luck and that was precisely what he was going to do dunwing left the nest an hour before the joseph bell tolled lunchtime she had to start spreading the tale of the snake rumors were often circulated among the sparra folk all it took was a few chosen whispers in the right places pretty soon the court of king bull sparra would be in uproar later when it all turned out to be nothing nobody would remember who started spreading the rumor it had always been the same with the sparra matthias passed a miserable few minutes in the nest with warbeak when the false news broke the young sparrow would have to fly along with king bull and the other sparra warriors the two friends might never see each other again however there was little time for emotional farewells outside the nest pandemonium was sweeping the sparra court dunwing had performed her task well a loud drumming like die beating of many wings against the wooden floor filled ifae air king call alia warrior warbeak murmured gotta go now me meet matthias mouse again one day warbeak undid the collar it fell from matthiass neck mousefriend set me free now me set you free warbeak go now matthias good wormhunt they shook paw to claw the young mouse said his farewell in the sparra language matthias look for warbeak see someday you go now be brave eggchick mighty sparra warrior great friend a swift rush of wings and warbeak was gone matthias kept his head well down inside the nest he listened as the flapping of wings and chirping of sparrows grew less and less finally there was silence dunwing popped her head over the rim of the nest matthias come quick not lose time together they hurried through the deserted sparra court dunwing knew there were mothers in every nest with small chicks these birds remained quietly out of sight when there were no warriors about to defend them matthias and dunwing pushed hastily past the scrap of sacking that served as a door to the kings chamber and began their search the scabbard had gone from the back of the chair oh i just knew it matthias cried that sly old bull sparra has taken them with him dunwing shook her head no me see king go he not take belt or case search hard we must find plenty quick the chamber was so sparsely furnished that it required very little searching dunwing fluttered about but matthias became discouraged oh whats the use he cried its gone all gone theres only bits of halffinished food old slates butterfly wings and this stupid old chair in his frustration matthias gave the sagging armchair a hefty shove one of the legs collapsed and it fell backwards revealing crossed lattice strips of hessian on its underside dunwing hopped on the upturned chair twittering with elation look see look see king hide stuff under old wormchair through the crossed latticework matthias could see the shine of black leather and silver hastily they ripped and tore with beak claw and paw dust and aged stuffing flew everywhere matthias triumphantly pulled the scabbard and sword belt free of the wreckage there it was supple shining black leather chased and trimmed with the purest silver the scabbard fitted perfectly into the wellmade holder on the belt this was truly the equipment which had belonged personally to martin the warrior of redwall abbey no time for mousedream you hurry quick matthias paid full heed to dunwings plea sweeping the belt and scabbard up he slung them across his shoulder im with you dunwing what next the usual way for sparrows to leave the court was to fly out from under the eaves not being a sparrow matthias felt his stomach turn a cartwheel at the prospect of what he must do next he would have to go on his back under the eaves and with nothing beneath him but a heartstopping void of space negotiate his way out and around the curving gutter to reach the steep upward sweep of the roof the first mistake he made was to peep over the edge of the eaves far far below the abbey grounds looked like a spreadout pocket handkerchief the great wall representing its border wkh the blustery howling wind pinning flat his ears and forcing the breath back down his throat matthias giddily covered his eyes with a paw he felt physically sick at the mere thought of it all its no good dunwing never be able to do it he gulped the mother sparrow pecked him sharply upon his paw matthias mouse got to do it you no go you mouseworm king bull come back he killee you huh me thought you warrior so did i until i saw how high this lot is matthias wailed dunwing patted him with a reassuring claw you go getta chmb rope bring here i show how the young mouse rushed headlong back to the nest rummaged in the haversack and found a stout climbing rope dunwing was waiting for him she tied it firmly around his waist matthias tested the knot apprehensively as the sparrow told him what she proposed to do me fly out on to roof hold other end of rope plenty tight you swing out no worry me pullee up grasping the rope in her beak dunwing flew out on to the roof and braced herself matthias come now me ready she called dont think about it matthias told himself aloud just do it clinging for dear life to the rope he launched himself over the edge of the eaves matthias closed his eyes his heart seemed to stop as he dropped the rope went taut and he came to a sudden halt the boisterous wind buffeted him about like a feather gritting his teeth he began pulling himself up paw over paw not being able to reach the wall for help as the rope was held outwards by the projecting gutter dangling him out in space chmb good dunwing have rope plenty tight hold the sparrow called out from the roof her voice muffled by the wind matthiass paws quivered with the strain of hauling up his own body weight he strove gallantly upwards reaching the gutter it took all the young mouses courage to let go of the rope and grab for the thin curving edge nerving himself he did it in one clean move clamping his paws heavily into die weatherworn sandstone groove under the unexpected weight it crumbled and broke matthias plunged downwards his feet where his head had been a second before a chunk of stone hurtled past him on its flight to earth the rope went taut with a jolt that drove the breath from him matthias dangled on the ropes end for a moment then he started to slip slowly down above him on the roof dunwing had lost her footing the sparrows claws screeched and grated on the roofing slates as the weighted rope pulled her downwards on the steep slope dunwing leaned back trying to dig her claws in somewhere to check the inexorable slide the broken gutter edge loomed up surprisingly bringing with it a desperate chance with lightning speed dunwing tugged hard on the rope gaining a little slack giving a skillfull flick she jammed the tope in the niche of the broken stone edge it slipped for a moment then held flying out dunwing took a few extra turns upon the rope locking it firmly off on the projecting edge letting go of her end the sparrow flew down underneath matthias she started pushing him upwards matthias climbed as he had never done before aided by dunwing he made it two things happened at once he grabbed for the gutter just as the sharp newlybroken stone sawed through the rope snap grab as the rope parted matthias clung to the gutter with dunwing pushing as she flew upwards he scrambled over the edge of the gutter and rolled inwards to safety dunwing joined him they both lay completely exhausted as the wind howled around them stunned by the danger they had come through the mother sparrow was first to recover she drove her mouse friend relentlessly to his feet matthias come hurry we waste time the climb of the sloping roof was extremely treacherous slightly unhinged by the perilous events matthias giggled to his friend its all in the average days work of a warrior no use of a warrior worrying ha ha ha taking into account loose slates buffeting wind and the occasional slide backwards matthias reckoned he had done pretty well as he gained the roof ridge he straddled it with both feet gazing straight ahead at the north point of the weather vane dunwing fluttered above him she saw the look of achievement upon his face and ruffled his ears with her claws matthias mouse me gotta go now no can help anymore take care good wormhunt dunwing flew off to her nest back at the court of king bull sparra matthias pressed forwards along the roof ridge he would never forget dunwing and her eggchick warbeak friends in need are friends indeed bracing himself against the weather vane matthias shielded his eyes and peered down into the abbey grounds starting from there he began a systematic search upwards most of it was too far below him to make out anything clearly the joseph bell boomed out the lunch hour at first matthias could not be certain he slitted his eyes and looked hard a small dark blob was definitely making its way up he waited with bated breath as it came nearer it was jess squirrel clinging to the vane with one paw matthias jumped up and down in a frenzy he waved frantically shouting at the top of his voice jess its me matthias hurry oh please hurry jess was trying her best but from the start she had been handicapped by her big curling bush of a tail the rude winds swept it about playfully she could not stop her own tail from dragging and pushing her hither and thither the champion squirrel climbed gamely onwards normally she would not have attempted the climb under such blowy conditions she concentrated hard on the ascent matthiass voice had not reached her across the vagrant wind but someone had heard the young mouses shouts king bull sparra having found neither sword nor snake the king had become peeved and bad tempered he issued orders to the search party that they were to stay on the floor of the woods until they found something meanwhile he must go back to the sparra court where he said there were important matters to attend to bull sparra flew away from the woods secretly relieved on reflection he did not fancy a second meeting with the giant poisonteeth whether it was alive dead or just pretending as poisonteeth often did muttering and grumbling to justify himself the king flew upwards to his court under the roof jess up here look ive got the scabbard bull sparras mad bright eyes glanced upwards to the weather vane there was the accursed mouseworm waving and shouting with the sword case and belt slung about him he saw it all now he had been tricked duped maddened by his own berserk rage bull sparra flew straight upwards when he was high above the young mouse he dropped like a stone right on target matthias screamed aloud in agonized terror as the kings beak buried itself into his shoulder instinctively he lashed out with his free paw and struck bull sparra in the eye the furious claws almost lifted matthias from the weather vane as the king gripped the belt trying to drag it offhim letting go of the vane matthias battered at bull sparras head with both paws he felt his feet leave the roof as the maddened sparrow heaved away at the belt causing the scabbard to become disarranged it flapped down across the young mouses face in a fighting fury matthias grabbed the scabbard he used it like a sword smashing it mercilessly once twice thrice into the sparra kings face the force of the blows from the weighty sword case knocked bull sparra senseless he toppled from the roof out into space matthias screamed in panic the kings claws were still caught fast in the sword belt below jess squirrel clamped a paw across her mouth in horror she heard the scream and saw matthias and bull sparra topple from the roof locked together by the sword belt they fell outwards into space from the topmost point of the abbey roof chickenhound was having one of his sniggering fits even attempting to dance a little jig he had been left to his own devices the old fool of an abbot and his stupid devoted band of creatures were all outside shoring up gatehouses drilling fetching carrying and generally being good and useful what a crowd of ninnies with a sack upon his back the wily fox roamed from room to room the abbey was his oyster hmm this is a nice green glass vase why hello what a lovely little silver plate my my fancy leaving a beautiful gold chain like you all on your own there now ill just pop you all into my sack dont worry uncle chickenhound will take care of you sniggering delightedly the fox trotted along the corridor into the next room more and more small valuables and family keepsakes belonging to the mice and their woodland pests vanished into the thief s sack he sniggered uncontrollably imagine all the hard work and fighting that cluny was going to do just to get at all this and here was he having first choice he was chickenhound master burglar he had outlived sela outwitted cluny and pulled the wool over the eyes of an abbeyfal of mice one day they would speak his name as the foxprince of thieves chickenhound paused to admire a i handsome pair of brass nutcrackers oh yes very elegant indeed into the sack they went he trotted down the stairs into cavern hole the tables had been laid for afternoon tea stuffing and gorging he moved from place to place choosing only the tastiest morsels on his tour of the dining hall he collected a good quantity of cutlery and some fine antique cruets anything that did not suit the young foxs taste was smashed or vandalized milk was spilt upon the floor and bread trampled into it candles were broken and vegetables squashed across the walls chickenhound shouldered his sack and turned his attentions to the kitchen he booted the door open and walked straight in slap bang into friar hugo the fat old mouse was bowled completely over the unexpected fright sent chickenhound dashing back through cavern hole with the outraged friars shouts ringing in his ears stop thief stop the fox chickenhound bounded up the stairs into great hall behind him the friar having regained his feet puffed along raising the hue and cry stop thief come back here you villain with great love and care methuselah was putting the final touches to his repair of the tapestry only a very sharpeyed observer would be able to tell that it had once been torn the warning shouts caused him to stop what he was doing he turned to see the fox racing towards the door with friar hugo trailing far behind shouting for all he was worth methuselah had but to move a few paces and he was blocking the doorway bravely he held up a frail paw at the oncoming fox you young blaggard so this is how you repay our kindness you are far worse than your wicked mother chickenhound swung the loaded sack with both paws at the old gatehousekeepers head out of my way you doddering old fool he panted the heavilyladen sack struck methuselah a crushing blow he collapsed instantly on the floor and lay still chickenhound froze momentarily the sack of loot clattered from his nerveless paws friar hugo halted in his tracks the fx stared down at the pitiful crumpled figure he had not meant to hit him so hard murderer oh you barbarous creature you have killed brother methuselah friar hugos cry galvanized the fox into action he grabbed the sack and fled from the abbey the fat little friar fell to his knees tears coursing openly down his plump face he cradled the sad small bundle that had once been the wisest and oldest mouse of red wall chickenhound sneaked along keeping close to the abbey he slunk swiftly across the grounds to one of the small doors in die massive outer wall the murderer had to get out into the woods before hugo regained his senses enough to raise the alarm wrestling wildly with the stout bars and bolts he managed somehow to open the small iron door without a backward glance the fox bolted offinto the mossflower woodland as he ran the joseph bell began tolling out the alarm chickenhounds confidence grew as he raced through the woods he sniggered daft old fool served him right he should have got out of the way hadnt he realized that he was facing chickenhound the overlord of all criminals pressing deeper into mossflower he paused and listened upon the wind for sounds of pursuit faintly he could distinguish certain noises whoever it was seemed to be traveling at a breakneck pace with little regard to obstructing bush or foliage the sound of snapping branches and undergrowth being trampled grew nearer the foxs finelyattuned sense of smell told him that there were two creatures on his trail one of them was a hedgehog but the other chickenhounds legs began to tremble his heartbeats echoed in his ears there was only one creature in all the wood with that heavy unmistakable scent constance the badger instinctively the terrified fox looked wildly about for a place to hide running was out of the question in his present state of panic it was as if some dark force had heard his silent plea not ten yards from where he stood was the ideal refuge a hollow in the base of a dead oak there was a space between two thick roots partially covered by ferns chickenhound slung the sack down the hole and dived in after it to his surprise he found it quite large and dry with a thick carpet of dead grass and leaves it was dismally dark but still it was the best place at a moments notice he would be quite invisible and safe from detection let them try and find him now with ambrose spike trailing in her wake constance crashed through the woods so great was the badgers anger and grief that she was oblivious to any notion of stalking or tracking she barged along straight through anything that stood in her way the heavy striped face a mask of cold fury the hedgehog stayed behind constance those huge blunt paws were ready to tear some creature into dourags no power on earth would save the murderous fox if constance caught him but the badgers retribution was not to be quaking with fear chickenhound held his breath as the woodland juggernaut thundered by within a couple of yards of the hideout he listened hopefully as the path of destruction trailed off into the distance of mossflower once more the woods grew quiet chickenhound finally exhaled a long sigh of relief once again the newly selftitled overlord of crime had outsmarted a couple of mere animals who on earth did they think they were when word got around of his daring exploits other creatures would come to him foxes perhaps yes he could see it all chickenhound at the head of a band of robber foxes plundering and thieving wherever the whim took him of course he would change his name to a title more fitted to his position redflash or nightfang or maybe mousedeath yes he liked the sound of that mousedeath his band of minions would admire him telling each other tales of his astonishing deeds convinced that the mysterious mousedeath had always been an infamous thief unaware of his humble beginnings as chickenhound son of old sela as he crouched in the darkness the young fox decided that the coast was now clear he could venture out again reaching behind he felt for the sack that contained his first solo haul before he left he wanted to fondle his treasures once more to reassure himself that they were an auspicious start to his new venture in the gloomy hideout his paw reached out and felt something it was not the sack of loot asmodeussssssssss that evening the joseph bell rang out a message of sadness and grief to redwall abbey mice and woodlanders sat about on the stone floor of great hall each creature with its own sorrowful thoughts two redwall mice dead upon the same day jess squirrel sat with her head between her paws mr squirrel had taken the inconsolable silent sam off to bed jess had explained fully to the abbot and the council how she had witnessed matthiass fall from the roof with the sparrow instead of falling straight down both creatures had been swept out of jesss line of vision by huge gusts of wind where matthiass body lay now nobody knew as soon as her feet touched ground the squirrel had gone about organizing search parties they had scoured the area until the light became too bad to continue returning after fruitless hours spent searching redwall grounds and mossflower wood the compassionate father abbot consoled the sad squirrel jess its no fault of yours there was not a thing that you could have done my friend the fall was so great that no creature could have survived it tomorrow we will search again then we must bury my old companion methuselah poor mouse he never did anything to deserve such a cruel fate the abbot pointed to the tapestry shaking his head see my old gatehousekeepers last good work he restored martin to his place of honor methuselah was the gentlest mouse ever knew oh what a tragic waste of two lives one who spent his years in search of knowledge the other cut down before his tree of youth had chance to blossom cornflower spoke up she was dryeyed and pale her paws tightly clenched father abbot the loss of matthiass life was not a waste it was a tremendous act of bravery and selfsacrifice he died trying to aid redwall and all of us in the struggle against the forces of evil as did his friend methuselah i am sure that this is the way they would wish to be remembered in our hearts as warriors and heroes there was an instant murmur of approval from all present overcome by the sad events the defenders left the hall some to do guard duty others to their beds constance remained sitting upon the floor her face expressionless the mighty paws clenching and unclenching brother alf rose and stretched youd best get some sleep constance the badger stood up wearily and rubbed her eyes no thank you brother i couldnt sleep a wink at a time like this you know how it is brother alf sighed deeply he knew having watched matthias since the first day he arrived at the abbey gates a woodland orphan always polite willing and cheerful but now come with me then said alf ive got work to do theres all the fishing nets to be laid for the night perhaps youd like to come along and help me glad of the chance to do something the badger agreed she and alf strode off talking of old times dyou remember that big grayling that you and matthias caught constance said brother alf chuckled do i matthias wouldnt be satisfied until that fish was landed on the bank i was all for giving up but not him constance nodded admiringly aye that fish fed the whole abbey i remember because i had three helpings two less than that spiky wastebin ambrose strolling leisurely around the bank of the abbey pond the two companions gathered up the nets preparatory to spreading them upon the water brother alf went farther along the bank looking for floats constance was about to sit down at the waters edge when she heard alf calling constance look down here theres a sparrow the badger ran and joined the mouse looking to where he pointed sure enough half in and half out of the water was the body of king bull sparra with a great splash constance waded into the shallows and dragged the corpse up on to the mossy bank it looks as if hes been drowned brother quick get some help and bring lanterns hurry the badger thrashed about in the water why oh why hadnt the search party thought of looking in the abbey pond help arrived swiftly out of the way constance the rest of you keep those lanterns high with hardly a ripple winifred and three of her otters slid into the water as she swam winifred issued orders spread out and dive deep well quarter the pond between us ill take the south corner tense moments ticked by a crowd of creatures lined the banks all that could be seen was the still dark water broken at intervals as the sleek form of an otter surfaced and dived again a cry went up as winifred appeared towing a still shape willing paws dragged the otters burden up on to the bank shaking herself like a dog winifred panted look what i found halfsunk in the water over there its a good job the rushes held him up creatures crowded around all asking the same questions is it matthias is he dead or alive constance pushed her way through to the limp sodden figure the abbot and cornflower were close behind her abbot mortimer appealed to the onlookers give us room there if you really want to help then stand back please someone give cornflower a lantern good mouse hold it i up obediently the crowd fell back more lanterns were brought forward the abbot worked feverishly resuscitat ing levering and pounding the prone form of matthias f cornflower voiced the question that was on the mind of every creature there oh father abbot is he alive he r doesnt seem to be moving p the otter clamped a damp paw about her shoulders hush now the abbot is doing everything in his power we will know soon enough brother alf pushed through carrying something winifred one of your otters has just come up with this sword belt and scabbard he found them near where matthias was bring them forward said constance they may be of some help if matthias opens his eyes you never know the abbot beckoned urgently cornflower give me that lantern child quickly holding the lanternglass close to matthiass nose and mouth the abbot was rewarded by the sight of the faint mist that appeared on it he lives cornflower matthias is alive bring blankets get a stretcher we must get him inside the abbey without a word to anyone constance lifted matthias gently as if he weighed no more than a feather carefully the big badger clasped the young mouse close into the warmth of her rough coat the crowd formed an aisle either side of her as she strode swiftly to the abbey lanterns bobbed about in the darkness like fireflies as the great joseph bell tolled out a message of joy and hope to mossflower o the new day dawned in a haze of soft sunlight it crept across the countryside suddenly to expand and burst forth over all the peaceful woods and meadowland bluegold tinged with pink each dewdrop turned into a scintillating jewel spiders webs became glittering filigree birdsong rang out as if there had never been a day as fresh and beautiful as this one the extravaganza of natures glory was completely lost upon cluny the scourge his one good eye squinted upwards through the smoke of the morning campfires huh its going to be as hot as the hells furnace but at least it wont rain he muttered aloud to himself under the impatient eye of the warlord clunys horde gulped down a hasty meal and scurried about picking up weapons suitably geared for battle they quickly fell into ranks clunys personal armorer put the final touches to his chiefs war apparel with the tip of the standard cluny signaled his captains darkclaw frogblood fangburn cheesethiec scumnose and mangefur scrambled into their positions as yet cluny had not chosen a new secondincommand though he had let it be known that any of his followers who distinguished himself in the coming battle would receive immediate promotion in the field killconey the ferret stood alongside his chief with a drum that he had made from an old water butt he had unofficially appointed himself drummercumsoothsayer the ferret watched cluny intently the chief was going to speak he banged the drum calling the horde to silence cluny lifted the visor of his war helmet and stared out across the waiting horde this time there will be no mistakes he yelled and there will be no retreat we stay even if it means putting redwall to siege we stand firm anyone who takes one backward step is dead anyone who disobeys orders is dead anyone who does not fight tooth and claw with all of his might is also dead that is my promise and cluny always keeps his word hear me all we face is a lot of peaceful mice and some local woodland creatures defeat them and i will give you rewards you never dreamed of the enemy are not trained fighters like we are not natural killers there is not one among them who can lead as i lead you at the center of the front rank stood a rat who had been wounded in the first encounter at the abbey he whispered out of the comer of his mouth to his comradeinarms alongside him huh leads us my foot last time we attacked he stood well out of the way back in some meadow the sharp ears of cluny had caught what the unfortunate soldier had said the warlord leaped down from his rostrum and seized the trembling miscreant booting him forward into plain view of the army see this traitor cluny shouted heres a rat who doesnt think i lead my horde cluny the scourge sees and hears all watch now and let this be a lesson to anyone that dares doubt me the wretched rat soldier lay shaking on the churchyard path a hush fell across the entire horde he stared beseechingly into the merciless eye of cluny oh please chief it was only a joke didnt mean to crack the powerful tail whipped expertly out slashing across the rats face with its poisoned metal war barb the army looked on in horror as the stricken victim shuddered and lay dead at clunys feet ignoring the slain soldier cluny the scourge pushed his way roughly through the horde until he reached the cemetery gates it was going to be a long march to redwall burdened as they were with the battering ram and all the paraphernalia of destruction they would have to camp overnight by the roadside and the great attack upon redwall would take place early the next day there was to be no secrecy for maximum effect the army must be seen marching boldly up to the very gates of the abbey in full array cluny shook his standard as the ferrets drum thundered out he roared madly on to redwall smash the gates kill kill the shimmering heat waves from the road reverberated to the shouts of the horde cluny cluny kill kill kill in his fevered dreams the young mouse wandered through dark caverns somewhere a voice was calling out to him matthias matthias it sounded vaguely familiar but he had other things to do than identify the voice he must find the sword in the stygian gloom he saw the late rose it was bathed in a pale blue light what was it doing here in this dark netherworld matthias saw that all the tiny thorns on the rose stems resembled small swords he felt he should speak to the rose please tell me late rose where will i find the sword the topmost rose quivered he watched it blossom before his eyes at the center of the blooming petals was the face of methuselah matthias my friend i can help you no more seek out the aid of martin i must go now the face of the old gatehousekeeper faded slowly his feet hardly touching the floor matthias traveled a long corridor at its end were two figures he halted by the first figure unable to distinguish who it was but feeling an aura of friendly kinship emanating from it matthias looked to the second figure here was something he had never before encountered it had neither arms nor legs with a hissing sound the spectral thing opened wide its mouth inside there were two sharp fangs and a nickering tongue which quivered and turned into a sword with a cry of joy the young mouse started running forward only to be restrained by the phantom figure of the first apparition matthias was not surprised to see that it was martin the warrior martin why do you stop me from getting the sword he asked martins voice was warm and friendly matthias am that is stay beware of asmodetis martin took hold of matthiass shoulder the young mouse tried to wrench himself free let me go martin i fear no creature that lives martin tightened his hold relentlessly upon matthiass shoulder pain shot through him like a redhot lance martin cried out hold him still now hold him still the agony increased matthiass eyes snapped open hold him still now hold him still it was the father abbot he was saying the same words as martin had said brother alf held tight to matthiass shoulder as the abbot dug deep with a probe he extracted a dark pointed object which he tossed into a bowl that cornflower was holding ouch that hurt father matthias said weakly the abbot wiped his paws upon a clean cloth well my son you are back with us at last he said that must have hurt there was half of a sparrows beak lodged in your shoulder matthias blinked and looked about hello cornflower you see i got back in one piece oh hello brother alf i say is that basil in the next bed hush now matthias and lie still cornflower chided him youre lucky to be alive it was touch and go right through the night abbot mortimer pointed at the first rays of sun streaming in through the window yes but you are back now and see youve brought with you a magnificent june summer morning the young mouse lay back upon the crisp white pillows aside from a bursting headache and the pain in his shoulder it felt good to be alive but whats basil doing asleep in the next bed he persisted oh him cornflower chuckled he says that he has an honorable war wound that requires a lot of food and rest the old rogue that may be replied the abbot but it would be churlish to begrudge basils requests after all he did recapture our tapestry from cluny it was a very daring deed matthias was delighted martins tapestry back here at the abbey how marvelous ill bet old methuselah is over the moon to have it back once more there was a moments silence the abbot turned to brother alf and cornflower please would you leave us alone for now i have something to tell matthias you may visit him tomorrow he still needs a lot of rest the two mice nodded understandingly and left half an hour later after unfolding the sad tale of methuselah the abbot also took his leave matthias turned his face to the wall bereft of any tears or lamentation after the stresses of the experience he had recently come through the death of his old and valued friend left a feeling like a large leaden lump inside his chest he curled up and tried to hide within himself how long he lay there racked by grief and misery he had no way of knowing but one morning basil stag hare awakened and called across what ho well bless me medals if it aint young matthias how are you laddie buck matthias replied in a small sad voice please basil leave me alone ive lost methuselah i dont want to speak to anyone basil hopped nimbly across and perched on matthiass bed there there young feller mlad dont you think i know how you feel good grief an old campaigner like me when i think of the chums i lost in bygone battles good and true friends they were but i taught meself to keep a stiff upper whisker yknow matthias remained with his back turned upon the hare but you dont understand basil the soldierly hare snorted he grabbed matthias and turned him over so they were face to face dont understand ill tell you what i dont understand young chip i dont understand how a chappie like yourself who is supposed to be a great warrior can lie there moping any longer youre like an old lady otter whos just lost a fish if old methuselah were here now hed chuck a jug of water over you and turf you right out of that bed on your fat httlc head matthias sat up and sniffed dyou think so basil the hare slapped his injured leg winced then laughed aloud think so i know so do you imagine that old mouse sacrificed his life so that you could lie about feeling sorry for yourself huh hed have told you himself thats not the way of a warrior get up sir stir yourself make methuselah proud of you matthiass eyes gleamed with a new determination by golly youre right basil thats exactly what my old friend would have wanted im sorry you must think ive behaved like a dreadful young fool the hares ears flopped comically as he shook his head not at all mdear feller think nothing of it i must confess mat i was a bit like you when i was a leveret yknow now what dyou say we get about the business of living properly again i say im positively famished what about you matthias could not help laughing at the irrepressible hare well i am a bit hungry now you come to mention it capital cried basil i could eat a stag antlers and all i say they do a wonderful nosebag for us wounded heroes yknow just watch this mlad the hare tinkled a small brass bell on the bedside table within seconds friar hugo and cornflower appeared ah yes the catering staff said basil er harrumph the other injured warrior here and myself would be greatly obliged for a little sustenance nothing too grand yknow just something for our poor wounded teeth to nibble on got to keep body and fur together what what cornflower was pleased to see matthias looking so much better she exchanged winks with him and friar hugo the fat friar bowed in a servile manner as he answered die hare very good mr stag sir two bowls of gruel coming up matthias and cornflower struggled not to laugh aloud basil exploded gruel what the devil do you mean by gruel what sort of slop is that to give renowned warriors eh we want to be cured not killed now listen to me you pair of scullery fusiliers i want a decent brunch half a dozen boiled eggs some crisp summer salad two loaves of hot bread two hazelnut cream junkets two no better make it four ovenbaked apple pies oh and chuck in some of those mediumsized quince tarts if you see any lying about well dont stand there with your great jaw napping cut along now quick as ylike cornflower curtsied with mock solemnity friar hugo held up a paw you forgot the october nutbrown ale sir basil thumped the bed good lord so i did er just four flagons thank you my good mouse cornflower and friar hugo exited leaning upon each other their faces crimson with suppressed laughter strange creatures basil mused slowed if i can see anything funny about a couple of heroes wanting to be fed so that they can stay alive takes all kinds to make a world young feller otherranks included later as they made a hearty meal matthias set about pumping the hare for information basil whats a viper hmm a viper well its an old poisonteeth snake yknow an adder never had a lot of truck with the slimy fellers meself youd do best to stay away from them old chum matthias continued probing the hares knowledge are there any adders around the mossflower region basil i mean if there were then youd be the very creature to know about them being an expert and all that basil puffed out his narrow chest as he absentmindedly ate one of matthiass quince tarts adders in mossflower now let me see no dont suppose there are nowadays there was talk of one a long time back but shouldnt think hes around anymore filthy reptiles adders nothing like stags yknow now what the devil was that adder chaps name no i cant remember it for the life of me could it be asmodeus matthias inquired innocently basil stag hare dropped a halfeaten apple pie on the i bedside table he was suddenly very serious asmodeus where did you hear that name a little bird told me matthias replied basil retrieved his apple pie he munched thoughtfully your sparrows eh savage little creatures no discipline of course darn good fighters though but tell me what do jolly old sparrows know about asmodeus it all has to do with martins sword matthias explained you see one of their kings stole the sword from the north point of the vane on the abbey roof that was many years ago from there the sword has been passed down through sparrow kings until it came into the claws of the late king bull sparra not the silly ass who managed to get himself drowned yesterday said basil through a mouthful of hazelnut junket the same one matthias replied but to cut a long story short the adder stole the sword from him thats why i want to know about asmodeus you see play with fire youll get yourself burned warned the hare matthias knew basil could be manipulated he was insistent oh please basil you must tell me all you know it was methuselahs lifework trying to find that sword i must continue for his sake the hare gnawed thoughtfully on some bread and salad well if you put it that way young feller anything i can do to help i will youll need a good guide matthias interrupted i must find the sword by myself basil just tell me all you know about the adder called asmodeus the hare lay back on his bed he took a long draught of october ale before answering quite frankly old chap know nothing about the bally snake i thought the blighter had died years ago matthias groaned aloud but basil cut him short mind you having said that i think have a pretty fair idea who will know listen if you strike out northeast across mossflower wood youll find a deserted farmhouse beyond the far edge now the chap you want to see is a whopping great snowy owl that patrols between the fringes of the wood and the old sandstone quarry his name is captain snow bear in mind though hell eat you on sight if he gets the chance military bird but a real bounder then how do i get to talk with him said matthias abruptly temper temper mlad basil chuckled reaching down to his bedside locker he dug out his dress tunic it was covered in medals and decorations from a hundred campaigns the hare selected a medal detaching it from the jacket he tossed it across to matthias here catch thats a medal doncha know captain snow gave it to me for saving his life you saved the owls life said matthias i should say i did basil laughed at the memory feathery old fool went to sleep in a rotten dead tree it got blown down in a gale and trapped the blighter underneath hed have died if hadnt come along dug under the thing and pulled him out popped out kke a shuttlecock under a door fellow officer you understand couldnt leave him there to get flattened his face is flat enough as it is so all do is show him this medal asked the young mouse basil laughed at his friends naivetј yes thats alt but if you dont want to be scoffed make sure he sees the medal before he sees you tell the old buffer that basil stag hare sent you and mind your manners make sure you call him by his proper rank capn oh and id like that medal back sometime spoils the look of me numberone dress tunic missing decoration matthias studied the medal it was a silver cross embellished with a spreadwinged owl the ribbon was of faded white silk though it was old it shone bright in the sunlight thank you basil he said ill see you get it back is mere anything else i should know not much just remember what ive said old chap this captain snow is a night hunter by the way he probably sleeps in some old tree all day with one eye open you mark my words laddie old snow doesnt miss a thing he knows all the creatures in his territory where they live what trails they use and so on ha they dont call owls wise for nothing bit of a duffer all the same letting a tree fell on him keep your eye on him though if he catches you napping hell chomp you up medal and all basil finished his ale and yawned now get some sleep matthias im fagged out after that snack my old honorable war wound is beginning to play me up i must have a bit of a snooze with that basil closed his eyes he was soon snoring gently matthias realized there was no more to be said so he decided to nave a rest too basil stag hare what an amazing old campaigner the young mouse thought as he drifted offto sleep shortly after twelve oclock matthias awakened the noontime sunlight flooded the room basil was flat on his back snoring stentoriously although his shoulder still throbbed matthias felt fit and refreshed well enough to travel he knew however that he must act with stealth and secrecy if die abbot or cornflower or any of his friends knew of his scheme he would have no chance at all they would make certain he was confined to bed until further notice quietly he arose and dressed himself hanging his sandals around his neck by their thongs taking a clean pillowslip he stocked it with the remainder of the food from the table someone had thoughtfully placed his dagger in the bedside locker it must have been found on the floor of great hall searching around matthias came upon a good stout pole probably used as a window or curtain opener he decided it would come in handy carefully he inched the door open closing it again swiftlyas the abbot and brother alf padded by matthias listened to alf s voice i looked in on them about ten minutes ago father theyre both sleeping like hibernating squirrels its not likely that theyll wake until evening the footsteps receded down the passage matthias crept from the room and stole off in the opposite direction he was surprised at the ease with which he left the abbey slipping off into mossflower through the side door in the wall where unknown to him methuselahs murderer had also passed on the previous day alone in the woods matthias felt a bit wobbly upon his legs he sat down against a beech tree until the feeling passed ng the pillowcase bundle to his pole he hefted it across ood shoulder and struck offboldly through mossflower towards the northeast matthias judged by the sun that it was past midafternoon he had made steady progress through the woods nothing untoward had occurred he had stopped and had a light snack gained his second wind and pressed forward taking care not to create too much noise lest he disturb any predators the young mouse had discovered a path of sorts skirting the dense underbrush and avoiding patches of marshland always keeping the tree moss on his left he continued eastwards matthias pinned the medal to his habit telling himself that he might stumble into captain snows territory at any moment lulled by the warm sun cool shade and birdsong he trekked onwards thinking of nothing in particular and enjoying the sense of freedom amid so much beauty seemingly from out of nowhere a mouse leaped barring matthiass path he halted sizing the strange mouse up it was an oddlooking wild thing matthias was not even too sure it really was a mouse the creature had spiky fur which stuck out at odd angles all over around its brow was bound a brightlycolored scarf the stranger was fully a head shorter than matthias it stood defiantly blocking his way glaring at him with the maddestlooking eyes he had ever encountered matthias smiled politely and addressed the odd mouse hello there beautiful afternoon isnt it never mind that nonsense it replied in a gruff voice who are you why are you trespassing on shrew land matthias paused so this was what a shrew looked like he had never seen one before but he had been told of their bad tempers the young mouse decided to ght fire with fire no point being good mannered with this little hooligan he snarled in what he hoped was an aggressive manner never mind who i am who do you think you are you little raghead the shrew seemed uncertain for a moment then she stormed back in her low gruff voice i am guosim and you still havent told me what you want in shrew territory guosim echoed matthias what sort of a name is that and anyhow if you dont want creatures coming across your land then you should put signs up as far as im concerned mossflowcr has always been free to all except this part snapped the shrew dont you know anything guosim stands for guerrilla union of shrews in mossflower matthias laughed scornfully i couldnt care less what it stands for make way for a redwall abbey warrior im coining through immediately matthias took a step forward guosim stuck her paws between her lips and emitted a sharp whistle there was a swift rustle in the undergrowth matthias found himself surrounded by at least fifty shrews they packed around him creating an angry hubbub in their deep rough tones all of them wore colored headbands all carried short rapierlike swords guosim had difficulty in calling them to order comrades she shouted tell this mouse what happens to a trespasser the replies that came back were varied break his paws skin him alive chop off his nose hang him by the tail stuff his whiskers down his ears a stemlooking old shrew barged guosim out of the way and whistled sharply he produced a round black pebble and held it up any comrade who wants to speak must hold the pebble otherwise shut up complete silence fell he handed the pebble to matthias now explain yourself mouse there were one or two murmurs of dissent that a stranger who was not a shrew should have first say the old shrew danced with rage will you lot shut up the mouse has the stone silence fell once more matthias cleared his throat er ahem guerrilla union of shrews in mossflower forgive me as you see i am astranger in these parts i do not intentionally trespass on your land had i known i would have taken a different route you have probably noticed by my habit that i come from redwall abbey though i am a warrior we are a healing and helping order it is usual for all creatures to allow a redwall mouse to pass in peace this is the unwritten law the older shrew took the pebble from matthias and addressed the others right comrades now we know a bit more about things lets have a show of paws all those in favor of letting the mouse go free paws went up logalog counted them exactly half of those present he called for those against and took another count half one way half the other the casting vote is mine now let me tell you i know we take care of our own but the redwall mice are a legend in mossflower they do no harm to any creature in fact they do a lot of good logalog raised his paw therefore conirades i vote that the mouse goes free there followed an equal number of cheers and boos a squabble ensued and fighting broke out guosim snatched the stone from logalog and waved it about listen to me she roared i know that logalog is a wise elder but i am president of our union conirades the mouse hasnt told us where he is going there was a brief silence another shrew snatched hold of the stone aye thats right where are you off to mouse the stone was thrust at matthias ill tell you he said but my name is not mouse its matthias redwall abbey is in danger from cluny the scourge and his horde there was immediate shouting and gruff oaths matthias knew the drill it was surprising how the stoneholder could gain quiet among such a noisy quarrelsome gathering matthias continued as i was saying before i was so rudely interrupted we at redwall are under attack by cluny and his horde evidently you have heard his name before well i believe that i have the solution to cluny it is an ancient sword that once belonged to a great mouse named martin the warrior to find the sword i must ask captain snow the whereabouts of asmodeus the shrews made a frenzied rush into the undergrowth matthias found he was standing alone after a few minutes logalog and guosim ventured stealthily out again forgetting the stone guosim spoke in an awed voice dyou mean you actually intend to walk right up and speak to snow matthias nodded logalog continued where his comrade had left off youre going to ask the capn where you can find giant poisonteeth mouse er i mean matthias you are either very brave or raving mad a little bit of both i suppose said the young mouse do you know much about captain snow and asmodeus both shrews trembled visibly guosims voice had risen an octave matthias you must be crazy dont you know what youre walking into captain snow why youd be just a snack to him and as for the other one giant ice eyes who could even go near him he eats as many shrews as he wants no living creature can stop the poisonteeth a heartrending moan arose from the shrews in the undergrowth matthias still had the stone he held it up and addressed them boldly guerrilla shrew comrades i do not ask you to do my fighting merely point me in the direction of captain snow who knows if i finally get the sword i may be able to liberate you logalog took the stone matthias of redwall you are on our land we will escort you the guerrilla union of shrews in mossflower would never live down the shame of having a stranger fight their battles for them you may not always see us but we will be close by come now matthias moved northeastwards with the company of shrews whose numbers seemed to swell as they went along at nightfall there were upwards of four hundred members of the shrew union seated around the campfire breaking bread with the warrior from redwall that night matthias slept inside a long hollow log with both ends disguised to make it appear solid like basil the shrews were masters of camouflage their very survival depended upon it half an hour before dawn the young mouse was roused by a shrew who gave him an acorn cup full of sweet berry juice a loaf of rough nutbread and some tasty fresh roots that he could not identify by dawns first light they were on the move again marching until midmorning matthias saw the edge of mossflower wood the tall trees thinned out bush and undergrowth were sparse before them lay an open field of long lush grass dotted with buttercup and sorrel in the distance he could see the abandoned farmhouse that basil had spoken of all the shrews had disappeared with the exception of guosim and logalog the latter pointed to the barn adjoining the farmhouse you might find captain snow in there taking a nap now is the best time to approach him after he has a full stomach from the night hunt the two guerrilla shrews melted back into the woods alone now matthias crossed the sunny field leading to the barn just as basil had taught him zigzag crouch wriggle and weave he tiptoed into the barn there was no sign of an owl in the semidarkness matthias could make out various old farming implements rusted with disuse on one wall there was a huge stack of musty dry straw bales he decided to climb up the bales in the hope of getting near captain snow who most probably would be sleeping perched in the rafters matthias scaled the packed straw he stood on top and looked about nothing he ventured forwards and suddenly slipped and fell down a hidden gap between the bales scrambling and clutching he plunged down to the floor matthiass feet never touched the earth he landed clean in the gaping mouth of a huge marmalade cat constance stood on the parapet overlooking the road dawn was breaking behind her in the east however more important things troubled the badgers mind the abbot came bustling up with basil limping in the rear both creatures looked extremely concerned have you seen matthias the abbot asked hes been missing from his room since yesterday afternoon basil looked rather shamefaced all my fault im afraid should have kept my eye on the little rascal well have to organize another search party no time for that snapped the badger look down the road in the distance a long column of dust was rising the three creatures sniffed the faint breeze it was unmistakable clunys army was coming to redwall well need every available defender constance murmured no need to cause a panic but this looks like a fullscale assault the foxs warning was true jess winifred foremole and ambrose were sent for together they leaned over the parapet watching the dustcloud draw nearer the beat of a drum was audible and individual rats could be picked out theyre heading right for us said jess grimly better get all defenders to battle stations at a given signal john churchmouse began tolling the attack warning upon the joseph bell all through the abbey and its grounds creatures stopped what they were doing picking up weapons that lay close to paw they assembled at their appointed posts to await further orders cluny waved his standard above the sunflecked dust rising from the road gradually the horde ground to a halt shading his eye against the sun he stared up at the walls surrender to cluny the scourge he bellowed harshly go and boil your head rat came constances gruff reply cluny took a pace back letting his standard dip low two score of slingrats ran forward whirling their stoneladen weapons they let fly a volley at the ramparts shouting bloodcurdling war cries the stones clattered harmlessly off the wall and fell back to the road cluny cursed inwardly for all his show of force and arrogance he had made a strategical error the sun was in his armys eyes the defenders had the advantage this soon became clear when a platoon of otters on the ramparts unloosed a rattling fusillade of heavy pebbles pandemonium broke out in the vanguard of clunys horde with cries of agony as the pebbles found their marks one stone actually struck clunys helmet back to the ditch and the meadow stay out of their range cluny did his best to keep his voice even as the army retreated to safety he was the last to go willing himself to walk slowly as if that were the way he had planned it four rats lay dead near the wall and killconeys drum stood unattended in the road basil stag hare sniffed dryly not a very well organized initial sortie for the invincible horde our chaps took the wind out of their sails what hurr they do ave to wait til sun moves round commented foremole but we dont cried jess bring the archers keep the slings going lets give that mob in the ditch something to think about out in the safety of the meadow killconey attempted to soothe clunys ego ah what a sly ould move of yours sir lullin them into a false sense of security make em think theyre winnin thats the game unexpectedly killconey received her reward for flattery at the wrong time a thwack over her head from the standard shut your mouth ferret cluny said sourly get me some sort of a command post rigged up here cheesethief where are the gangs with that battering ram coming up right away chief called cheesethief as he trotted off to find where the ramcarriers had got to it was not long before the tiny harvestmouse archers were bending their bows sending small pointed shafts darting into the ditch these supplemented by the stouter arrows of the fieldmice and the otter slingers caused many wounds and great discomfort to the wouldbe attackers pinning a good number of them down morale was low because cluny had ordered no retaliation until after midday jess squirrel rappelled swiftly down to the road on a rope looping the ropes end around the old waterbutt that had been the ferrets drum she sprang inside calling up to the parapet haul away constance the barrel fairly flew up under the badgers strong paws jess was quite pleased with herself she had plans for the drum to beat the rats basil stag hare strode the parapet with a swaggerstick tucked beneath his arm he dodged around the squirrel who was rolling the barrel along retaining the dignity befitting his rank basil kept up a constant stream of orders fire at will you mouse types otters pick out your targets any moles here report to foremole down in the grounds right away the hare had cast off his leg bandage now that he was back in active service the honorable war wound was completely forgotten meanwhile back at the meadow cluny sat brooding under a makeshift tent at least the ferret was good for something cheesethief came hurrying up urging on the contingent of batteringram carriers hoping to find favor with cluny he had put himself at the head of the party helping them to carry the cumbersome object come on mates he cried lets knock on the abbey door having negotiated the ditch they charged across the road once they had passed a certain point it created a difficult angle for the defenders on the wall to fire at them the massive ram shuddered as it smashed against the gatehouse door with cheesethief shouting encouragement the ramcarriers took a short run back and battered the door again cluny was heartened to see things going right for a change there was more to cheesethief than he had at first thought the door was rammed a third time now creatures on the wall stood up in full view as they retaliated by firing down on the ramcarriers cluny called up his best slingers and archers ordering them to pick off the defenders fortunately for him the sun was starting to move southwards and the otters and mice on the ramparts were clearly visible clunys archers caused numerous casualties forcing the defenders to drop below the parapet the battering ram continued although as yet it had made no lasting impression upon the solid construction missiles from the wall had slackened off giving clunys horde a chance to desert the ditch for the relative safety of the meadows cluny appeared well satisfied for the moment he called killconey to his side this is more like it ferret right get the tunnel gangs gather your weasels stoats and ferrets take them back along the ditch to the southeast corner of the abbey wall when it is dark ill send you a signal then you can start tunneling through the ditch wall across the road and under the abbey wall is that clear killconey threw an elaborate salute sure its clear as the mornin dew yer honor cluny closed his eyes intent upon keeping his present good mood then get going and try to get it right this time the battle continued sporadically all day and into the evening the ramcarriers kept up their attack but somehow the great door withstood them when the last vestiges of twilight were gone constance called the captains together they squatted beneath the parapet in darkness as the badger outlined the situation listen were all right for the moment but sooner or later something will have to be done about the battering ram has anyone got a good idea im open to sensible suggestions below them the ram kept up its remorseless battering ambrose spike had reported some minor splintering at the top inside edges of the door but the shoring of earthworks was holding out foremole had assured them that any attempted tunneling would take at least a few days before signs showed meanwhile he and his moles were carefully monitoring the earth in the abbey grounds throughout the daylong battle the animals not directly involved in the fighting had been busy too father abbot was tending the wounded in great hall friar hugo was constantly sending cornflower and her helpers back and forth to the ramparts with food and drink mrs churchmouse and mrs vole were making bandages from old clean sheets silent sam had been left with tim and tess the churchmouse twins he had played with the infants until they fell asleep in a heap of bandages sam wanted to go up on the wall but his parents had forbidden it slipping out of great hall he passed the time for a bit listening with an ear to the ground in the company of die moles but sam soon became bored he stabbed at the earth with his tiny dagger imagining that rats were popping up from makebelieve tunnels after a while he wandered over to the foot of the wall and sat sharing some food with jess the little squirrel signaled to his parent asking her what she wanted the big barrel for jess squirrel took her little son upon her knee and explained she had an idea that the barrel filled with something or other could be dropped down upon the ramcarriers but she was not too sure what it would be best to fill the barrel with sam jumped down from his mothers knee the barrel was lying on its side he sprang up on it and walked it about rolling it very skillfully under his feet all the time he was sucking hard on his paw trying to think how he could help the tunnel gangs lounged about leaning on the sides of the ditch kilkoney stretched full length on a mossy patch ah i tell you this is the life better than gettin shot at me ould mother always said get a good job and keep yer head down scumnose came creeping along in the darkness he nudged the ferret cluny says you can begin tunneling now killconey marked a cross on the ditch wall with her claw right you are well start about here buckoes come on now dig for victory book three the warrior the invasion at redwall continued throughout the night the whole scene illuminated by a bright summer moon neither side gave the other any quarter when the main action went into a lull sporadic sniping would break out bow lance sling and spear all coming into play with deadly effect one thing that remained constant throughout the battle was the sound of the battering ram pounding away remorselessly at the abbey gatehouse cluny made it his duty to assess personally the progress at the tunnel workings he was scathingly critical of the small hole that had been gouged into the side of the ditch roundly cursing any creature who dared to complain of difficult obstacles cant get past the rocks and tree roots my eye he snarled idle stupid laziness thats what is holding up the progress of this tunnel ill be around first thing tomorrow to see how much farther you lot have dug and if its not to my liking ill cave it in and bury the whole shirking crowd of you however the battering ram pleased cluny much more he knew it was worrying the abbey defenders the rat crews that manned the heavy object were changed every hour by cheesethief who stayed with the ram the whole time encouraging the carriers on to greater efforts cluny had gained a new respect for cheesethief mentally he had already promoted him to secondincommand sens ing this had made cheesethief redouble his efforts he worked the rat crews like a slave driver no rodent dared complain about one whom the chief held in such high regard constance stood on the wall with her captains the badgers brow was furrowed with anxiety basil stag hare the most seasoned campaigner among them was the only one who apparently took it all quite lightly ton my word he chuckled the way those blighters down there are carrying on with the jolly old ram they wont need to tunnel in soon ill give it half a day at most then well have rats piling in over the shoring what ambrose spike positively bristled at the nonchalant hare well i must say that is a comforting thing to know any more bttle gems of information to cheer us up eh basil strode off in high dudgeon reemphasizing his previously forgotten limp dearie me old lad no need to be so touchy merely making a military observation yknow constance called the two old friends together look its no use quarreling among ourselves we should be thinking of a solution come on you two stop sulking and be pals again smiling sheepishly basil and ambrose shook paws winifred the otter pounded the stones of the parapet in frustration say theres got to be a way to stop that confounded ram weve lost far too many defenders they get picked off every time they stand up to retaliate its got to be a very simple solution a small obvious thing mat weve all missed jess squirrel aided by silent sam maneuverd the barrel up on to the ramparts she patted it something simple like this the captains gathered around the barrel examining it the top had been covered over with gauze a strange noise issued from within well jess dont keep us in suspense whats in the barrel the badger growled shall we tell them sam grinned jess silent sam gave a broad wink and tapped a wellsucked paw against his nose he and his mother were enjoying this what we have here my good comrades in arms said jess grandly is stage one of our antibatteringram scheme thanks to my small offspring here who found the hornets nest basil clapped the two squirrels soundly upon their backs of course thats the ticket a hornets nest in a barrel just chuck it down on the beastly old enemy what jess and sam smiled with wicked delight ha but thats only the first stage said jess heres the second she and sam ducked out of sight a moment later they were back with two buckets two pails of good fine slick vegetable oil jess announced the minute they drop the battering ram well tip this down all over it lets see them try to break a door with it then jess and sam were congratulated heartily by all smiles appeared on faces that had been gloomy shortly before sam bowed graciously each time he was thanked nobody was refusing him permission to be up on the wall now down below the scrabbling of rats feet and the monotonous thud of the ram continued winifred and constance lifted the barrel on to the parapet edge they angled and tipped it until a fine delicate balance had been achieved the badger peeped over at the activity below waiting for the best moment she beckoned silent sam to her the time was exactly right pray would you do us the honor master samuel said constance with mock courtliness feigning an equal gravity sam made an elegant leg and delivered a short sharp kick to the barrel buzzing angrily it dropped out of sight over the edge of the abbey wall there was a crash and a yell followed by the shocked screams of agonized rats they milled about in the roadway dancing in pain as myriads of maddened hornets attacked furiously some rats ran off down the road others hurled themselves into the ditch pursued by the relentless stinging insects the long battering ram lay unguarded conveniently spotlighted by the rats abandoned torches two wellaimed buckets full of vegetable oil were hurled down they smashed directly on target saturating the entire length of the ram before the hornets could seek out new victims basil ordered the defenders down to the gatehouse study where they had a celebration snack cluny stooped inside the tunnel workings surrounded by as many of his followers as could pack in without causing mass suffocation killconey held clunys cloak over the entrance hole outside the air resounded with buzzing and pitiful screams the ferret gingerly touched the tip of his swollen nose cluny stooped in stony silence he did not sit or attempt to touch his own injuries the others might laugh dumbly he endured me pain of the fiery stings farther across the meadows there was a mass scramble of bodies into a small pond the hornets zinged about waiting for snouts to break the surface dawn revealed a sadlydisorganized horde cluny wisely held back his temper many of his soldiers looked so demoralized that they were liable to make a run for it and desert he reasoned that there was little to be gained by adding insult to injury seven rats two ferrets and a stoat lay dead in the ditch unable to escape the main body of hornets they had been stung so many times it had proved fatal cheesethief limped slowly up covered in ugly lumps chief theyve poured some stuff over the battering ram we cant hold on to it we tried but its like trying to pick up a wet eel the blasted thing slid right out of our claws one of the bearers had both legs broken when it slipped and fell sorry chief but we didnt expect them to think anything up like that hornets and slippery stuff its not fair cluny pointed across the meadow regroup the army over there let them feed and rest send someone scouting for dock leaves to rub on those stings im going into my tent to do some serious planning were not beaten yet not by a long chalk they cant produce a hornets nest every day cluny stumped off dejectedly rubbing his backside with one claw there were one or two insectsting casualties to be treated at the abbey inrmary fortunately brother rufus had a specific compound that he had invented some years back to deal with such emergencies as summer stings silent sam was reenacting the entire episode in pantomime for the benefit of tim and tess and some other infant creatures they were in tucks of laughter at his antics as sam slapped at his fur and performed somersaults with a comical expression on his face constance and the captains assembled back on the wall after a few hours rest they could see no immediate threat from the horde licking their wounds across the meadow this gave ample opportunity to assess the damage caused to the gatehouse door jess squirrel was lowered over the ramparts on a rope she went swiftly down and inspected the door in a short while she was back up again to report that although there were many deep dents and at least two long cracks the old gatehouse door was still holding well constance decided that later on they could lower some carpenters and smiths to deal with the repairs of late the badger had become preoccupied with an idea that was rapidly turning into an obsession cut off the head and the body would die by some means she must kill cluny the scourge out across the meadow she could plainly see the warlords tent in the strong sunlight the badger watched the silhouette of the big rat moving about behind the canvas the main problem was that the tent had been pitched too far out of range for sling or bow unless the weapon was big and powerful enough to reach that far that was it a large powerful bow something along the lines of a crossbow what if it could be mounted upon the ramparts unknown to cluny and his horde at a given time say midafternoon clunys shadow would be clearly visible through the tent fabric in the bright june sunlight a big arrow or bolt properly aimed from the bow and twang exit cluny delighted with the plan constance shared her knowledge with only one other creature the solitary beaver enlisting the aid of the beavers highly capable molars the badger left him gnawing away at a yew sapling in the orchard while she went off to find an arrow that would fit her brainchild an ash staff that had seen service as a candlesnuffer proved to be ideal with a heavy stone constance flattened the conical brass extinguisher fitted to the top of the staff until it resembled a viciouslooking spear she flighted it with duck feathers a thin plaited climbing rope rubbed with beeswax made an excellent bowstring with the help of the beaver constance bent the yew sapling against the abbey wall and strung it to the right tension together they mounted it upon a dining table with nails and strapping and bore it up to the ramparts constance would only grunt brusquely at anyone inquiring what the strange contraption was for only she and the beaver needed to know that the two creatures sat out upon the ramparts sharing lunch conversing in low secretive tones that should do the trick aye lets keep our paws crossed that it does well only get one shot ha one shot is all well need shall we wait until the sun has passed its zenith that way we can see him clearer good idea when the joseph bell tolls midafternoon should be best having finished lunch the pair lay out like old watchdogs on the sunwarmed stones half an hour later they were snoring cluny was a resourceful rat he often wished that his army thought as he did instead of being just a mob of incompetents but then if the horde were as clever as he was there would be no need of a leader such was life he reflected nobody could think up a new strategy as he could and this time cluny reckoned that he had hit upon a foolproof plan he strode across the meadow and handpicked thirtyodd rats follow me cluny rapped cheesethief im leaving you in charge until i get back without another word cluny marched off with his selected rodents first to the upturned hay cart in the ditch down the road then a quick circle around into mossflower wood like his predecessor redtooth cheesethief was ambitious he interpreted clunys order as the muchcoveted promotion to secondincommand the chief had not even acknowledged darkclaw in his elation cheesethief even forgot the painful hornet stings he strutted about asserting his newfound authority darkclaw send those ferrets out for more dock leaves will you he ordered oh and see that no one else strays loo far ill be in the tent if you need me for anything but try not to disturb me darkclaw scowled resentfully nevertheless he carried out die orders if he didnt he was certain that cheesethief would report him to cluny for insubordination cheesethief swaggered into the tent and glanced around cluny had left the better part of a wood pigeon some cheese and there was still a handsome measure of the best st ninian barley wine in the chiefs canteen cheesethief tucked in with satisfaction redtooth used to so why not he it was his entitlement as clunys secondincommand he sprawled languidly in the warlords chair tilting it and resting his feet on the mapstrewn camp table happy in the knowledge that his destiny was being fulfilled he secretly hoped that it would start raining heavily then the rest of the army would recognize his exalted position when they were outside getting soaked while he was snug and dry inside the tent cheesethief tried studying the maps he could not make head or tail of them and soon grew restless there was clunys poisoned tailbarb which he wore in battle careful not to pierce his claws by accident he fitted it to his own tail next he draped the warlords cloak about him it was a bit long but what a dashing figure he must cut for a while he contemplated die massive war helmet peeping around the tent flap he checked that there was no sign of the chief returning good cluny would probably be gone for another hour or two yet the joseph bell tolled for midafternoon constance shook the beaver into wakefulness look what a golden opportunity theres the scourge himself all dressed up to kill well never get another chance like this the giant bow worked perfectly cheesethiefs latest promotion was swift but brief he never knew what it was that snuffed his life out matthias screamed aloud with fright inside the cats mouth it was sloppy and hot pink and black smelling indescribably tad seemingly full of huge yellowed teeth phut the marmalade cat spat the young mouse out upon the bam floor he lay wet and sticky quivering all over dust and straw clinging to his fur instinct warned matthias to tie inert and play dead he had no chance to make a run for it surrounded as he was by the cats paws he could not stop liis body from quaking badly he lay staring into the feline eyes great twin pools of turquoise flecked with gold the cat stared back at matthias in disgust disdainfully it wiped a fastidious paw across its soiled tongue and spat as if toying to rid itself of a horrible taste ugh i simply cannot abide the taste of mouse filthy little vermin one can never tell where theyve been the cats voice though cultured was a high reedy tenor it would have sounded comical under different circumstances matthias lay as still as possible the marmalade cat prodded him with an indolent paw oh get up you disgusting little beast i know youre not dead slowly the young mouse rose to his feet the cat seemed uninterested in him as a possible food source matthiass legs were shaking so much that he had to sit down again they stared at each other matthias could think of nothing to say the cat spoke again this time its voice was indignant well have you nothing to say for yourself mouse where are your manners dont you think you should apologize for leaping into my mouth like that matthias managed to stand again he bowed shakily i beg your pardon sir it was purely accidental i fell you see please accept my humble apologies i am matthias of red wall and i sincerely hope i have not disturbed you in any way the cat sniffed distantly yes at least you seem to have some sort of decent upbringing matthias of red wall i accept your apology allow me to introduce myself i am squire julian gingivere pleased to meet you squire julian said matthias politely the cat yawned regally you may call me julian the title is hereditary i never wanted it squire of what a brokendown ramshackle farm building and a stretch of river over yonder one has no real friends no trusty servants not even a mate for that matter hmmm i suppose the gingivere line will become extinct when i die matthias could not help feeling a certain amount of sympathy for the lonely aristocrat at least you seem to lead a peaceful life he said hopefully oh spare me your platitudes mouse julian replied in a worldweary voice what would you know about loneliness and trying to preserve ones standards in a decaying world i say do you think you could manage to clean yourself up a bit you look an absolute fright standing there all covered in dust and straw and while youre doing that maybe youd like to explain how you came to be sneaking around my bam as matthias brushed himself down he related the object of his mission julian looked down at him in surprise captain snow eh that old maniac ive forbidden him the use of my barn you know what a thoroughly dreadful bird he eats anything that moves or crawls atrocious table manners too all that regurgitating of bone and fur ugh could you tell me where i might find him please matthias asked certainly replied julian snow lives in a hollow tree these days ill stretch a point and take you there but please dont expect me to introduce you or even talk to him when i barred snow from here we had a dreadful quarrel things were said that cannot be rescinded i vowed that day never to speak to that old owl for as long as i live matthias sensed that julian and snow had once been good friends maybe the rift in their relationship was the cause of julians present state of fatalism and gloom he decided wisely not to pursue the matter further at the moment riding upon a cats back was a new and unusual experience for matthias although he took great care to disguise it julian was quite an observant creature as he strode with an easy grace across the farmyard he remarked idly your friends the shrews are out in force today ignorant little things they think i cant see them give logalog and guosim a message from me will you tell them it is quite safe to come into die barn for hay and other items snow doesnt roost there any more goodness knows i certainly wont hurt them my diet consists of herbs grasses and an occasional fish from the river i gave up red meat years ago you might also mention that if they must come to my barn would they please desist from arguing and fighting so much theres nothing quite as upsetting as quarrelsome little shrews disturbing ones meditations matthias agreed to convey the message to the guerrilla shrews they had arrived at a small overgrown orchard julian halted within twenty paces of a stunted oak as he bade matthias climb down he cautioned him you probably cant see captain snow but hes watching us i can tell when hes at home be extra careful matthias the old glutton wifl more than likely eat you on sight typical of an owl well im off now if you get the chance say squire gingivere said that he must surely admit he was in the wrong and apologize only then can we resume our friendship and uve together in the barn goodbye matthias and do take care goodbye julian and thank you matthias called after the retreating figure of the last survivor in the gingivere dynasty the young mouse unpinned basils medal from his tunic he ventured cautiously forwards holding it aloft if julian said that captain snow was about then it must be so an unearthly screech shattered the silence followed by a rush of wings the owl swooped out of nowhere straight for matthias ducking and weaving as basil had taught him matthias waved the medal and yelled at the top of his voice truce basil stag hare sent me here claim a truce he was knocked flat upon his back massive needlepointed talons tore the medal from his grasp captain snow landed in front of matthias raising the dust with his vast wings the young mouse found it hard to believe that such an awesome and impressive bird existed captain snow stood hugely tall with an incredible wingspan the owls purewhite plumage was broken only by a few brown bars on the wing and some dark spots on the crown he had six dangerous talons in front two at the back of his legs and a sharp heavilycurved beak his eyes were colossal twin golden orbs with circular black centers matthias continued ducking and weaving conscious that his life hung by a thread captain snow flicked out a talon matthias dodged nimbly aside state your name and rank who gave you my medal snapped the owl in a flat hard voice still moving quickly and panting for breath the young mouse gasped matthias mouse warrior of redwall abbey the medal belongs to my friend basil stag hare he sends his compliments capn sir stand fast snapped the captain matthias stood rigid the owls talons started to inch forwards as if they had a life of their own the young mouse moved steadily backwards away from the talons captain snow licked saliva from the edges of his beak it was plain that he desperately wanted to eat matthias what did the cat say to you mouse he rasped did he mention me matthias repeated the message from julian squire gingivere says sir that if you were to admit yourself in the wrong and apologize to him then you could both be friends and live in the barn again as he spoke matthias had been moving away from the seeking talons on a sudden instinct he dived to one side as die owl pounced he skipped and ran on a zigzag course away from the murderous bird bilked of his target captain snow madly tore at the grass and scattered dust all at once he wheeled about and flew upwards perching at the entrance to his nesthole in the stunted oak all right you can stop running away now little warrior come back here i want to talk to you matthias stood a safe distance away from the tree captain snow shifted from one foot to the other muttering huffily me in the wrong never i wont apologize to that cat i refuse to when the owl had finished arguing with himself matthias called out capn snow sir there is a question that i must ask you the great snowy owl beckoned towards his hole with a sweeping wing listen mouse you cant stand down there shouting up at me why not come into my lair er nest then we can chat together in comfort standing on tiptoe matthias could catch a glimpse of the nest the walls were lined with all types of fur shrew mouse vole even rat the skulls and bones of small creatures were hung up as macabre decorations matthias smiled nervously er if you dont mind capn i think id prefer to stay where i am the captain cackled raucously and pointed a talon so youd prefer to stay where you are sir well i dont blame you right out with it whats this question you want to ask me do you know of asmodeus the giant adder and where might i find him sir matthias called boldly the owl preened his breast feathers he cocked his head on one side i know of everything that moves within my territory mouse yes i do know of asmodeus i also know where he calls home why do you ask because the adder has something that belongs to our abbey an ancient sword sir matthias replied ah the sword said the owl i remember the night he passed here carrying it youll never get that sword from asmodeus a puny little mouse like you the adder has magic in his eye that would freeze you like a statue huh i wish mine could matthias felt his temper rising he shouted angrily at the selfopinionated bird i dont care if hes got magic eyes poison teeth coils of steel or whatever i mean to have that sword ill steal it from the snake or fight him for it if i have to ill the rest of matthiass words were drowned out by the hysterical screeching laughter of the owl who nearly fell from his perch with merriment he blinked tears from his huge eyes youll what did i hear you say that youd fight asmodeus you oh little mouse run away and play before i crack a wing laughing ha ha ha hee hee oh hohohoho oh dearie me are you sure you havent been drinking old apple brandy a mouse fighting an adder oh my now ive heard everything captain snow laughed helplessly matthias yelled up challengingly ha ill bet you couldnt fight asmodeus the owl wiped tears from his eyes with a snowy wing as he hooted ive never tried and i wouldnt relish the prospect little one the snake and i would probably both end up dead matthias called mockingly thats because youre afraid look i bet ill fight asmodeus and win too bet you wont bet i will bet you anything you wont matthias pointed at the medal in captain snows talons bet you that medal that i will the captain flung the medal backwards into his nest done hold on owl matthias shouted what are you putting up as a wager the medal is not yours you gave it to basil stag hare spreading his wings to their incredible length snow screeched ill bet anything whatever you say mouse matthias nodded cunningly oh i dont want to take everything you own lets just say that you guarantee to return my medal and make a few little promises again the owl had difficulty in controlling his unbridled hilarity ha ha ha the nerve of him all right my little warrior its a bet name your promises right said matthias solemnly you must promise on your oath that if i win you will never eat another mouse or shrew of any type agreed chortled the owl in fact ill go even further i promise you that if you defeat the snake ill admit i was wrong to that stuffy old cat ill even apologize to him on bended knees so there on your word as a captain matthias pressed the owl held out a wing and a leg as he recited i swear by my captaincy and by my illustrious ancestors nyctea and glacier that i captain snow will return the medal and cleave to my oath if you should win against asmodeus the owl broke into laughter again oh hahahaheeheeheehohoho this is the easiest bet i ever made itll be like taking the wings off a dead butterfly maybe to you sir but not to me matthias countered now tell me where i may find asmodeus capn in the old sandstone quarry the owl replied youll have to cross the river there are caves in the quarry passages too explore them you wont find asmodeus until you are least expecting him by then it will be too late youll be deader than an icicle in hell goodbye mouse matthias turned his back upon the snowy owl and strode off with a string of taunts ringing in his ears nice to have my silver medal back jeered the owl ill think of you when i wear it you should have let me eat you itd save you a journey to the quarry oh i almost forgot you wont be able to give the hare my best wishes youll be snug inside the snake matthias walked onwards ignoring the cruel jibes of the owl through the farmyard and across the grassland not stopping until he arrived at the fringe of mossflower wood the shrews broke cover and milled about noisily with their endless questions ha so you got back then why didnt snow eat you bet youve never seen an owl chat size before eh what news of poisonteetb did you find out where he is dont just stand there tell us tell us fierce quarreling broke out swords were being drawn as matthias sought out logalog and took the black stone from him shut up and stop fighting you hooligans or youll get to know nothing matthias bellowed an expectant hush descended upon the union members of the guerrilla shrews of mossflower matthias found it hard to keep the contempt out of his voice i found captain snow actually i was led to him by squire julian gingivere does that name ring any bells there was an embarrassed shuffling in the ranks of the listeners many turned their eyes to the ground particularly guosim and logalog matthias folded his paws he stared about in disgust oh yes pd just like to thank you all especially you guosim and logalog what a sly nasty despicable thing to do sending me into that bam without a single word of warning about the cat logalog ripped the cloth band from his brow and flung it down he took the stone up in his paw matthias i speak not only for myself but for all the guerrilla union we are very sorry you must believe that it completely supped our minds we forgot about the cat you see we are shrews not only by name but also by nature we argue quarrel bicker and fight so much among ourselves that we lose sight of the important issues that is the way it is with us please accept our apologies friend matthias retrieved the stone i forgive you this once you say you are shrews and you call me friend you tell me that you forget let me tell you i am a redwall warrior i always remember who my friends are and i never forget an injury done to me however we will say no more of this you must listen to me now what i have to tell you is of great importance it can change the life of every shrew here captain snow has told me that asmodeus lives in the old sandstone quarry across the river he has given me his promise on oath if i defeat asmodeus the owl will never again take the life of a shrew when the astonished hubbub had died down the young mouse continued think about it guerrilla shrews it would be a double blessing for you with asmodeus dead and captain snow held to his oath you could live in safety from both and while im on the subject my friend julian the cat is quite harmless he will not hunt you any time you need something from the barn you have his permission to take it providing you do so quietly with no fighting or arguing that is all i have to say to you save for one thing lead me to the quarry matthias stood patiently waiting as subdued conversation went on all about him surely they could not refuse so generous an offer he tried hard to pick up the threads of talk some seemed all for it but others were apparently reluctant to trust his word finally a small militantlooking shrew came forward and picked up the stone he addressed matthias in a very official manner our rules say that the quarry across the river is not in shrew territory mouse therefore we cannot go with you logalog sprang forward and dealt the speaker a mighty blow laying him fiat out on his back you cowardly ungrateful little fool cried logalog how can you say such a thing after all this warrior is trying to do for us guosim grabbed the stone from the ground stop logalog you have no right to strike a comrade he was only stating the facts our guerrilla union rules clearly state that no member can be forced to venture beyond official shrew boundaries before logalog had chance to reply a riot broke out shrews began kicking punching arguing screaming wrestling and shouting the edge of mossflower wood was in pandemonium matthias held up the stone and tried shouting above the melee his voice was lost in the uproar angrily he grabbed the nearest shrew and shouted at him listen you tell me which direction the river is in or else the struggling creature pointed a paw to the northeast before wriggling from matthiass grasp to dive headlong into the fray fury took hold of the young mouse he waved the stone and cried out go on fight then little fools you and your bossy little union i dont need any of you ill go it alone and he hurled the stone with a mighty effort it flew off over the heads of the rioters disappearing into the wood matthias turned on his heel and stormed off towards the river an air of apprehension lay across the camp in the meadow cheesethief was dead pierced by an immense arrow and dressed in clunys best battle armor he lay amid the wreckage of the leaders tent not one of the horde dared go near the gruesome scene lest they be found in a position of blame upon clunys return constance peered agitatedly over the parapet something was not quite right she felt it in her nostrils the badgers worst suspicions were confirmed by the sight of cluny crossing the road and heading back into the meadow constance watched him leap across the ditch there could be no doubt about it that rat was definitely cluny the scourge she had killed the wrong rat cluny had left his picked band back in the woodlands they knew what they had to do it would take a bit of time but it was a sound workable plan striding swiftly over the meadow some sixth sense told cluny that all was not right his one eye scoured the area there was the horde gathered together at the far end but what had happened to his tent cluny could vaguely discern a huddled figure tangled in the wreckage speculation was useless he speeded up his pace fangburn met him halfway cluny held up a claw silencing him he would get to the bottom of things without stuttering excuses he kicked the tent folds aside revealing cheesethief s stricken face the great arrowshaft protruded from the ruined armor his war gear cluny glanced backwards and forwards from the abbey to the body he took in at a quick rate all that had happened the big badger was peering over the wall it was her doing clunys brain raced ahead on the far edge of the meadow the horde were looking decidedly uneasy a mistake had been made the arrow was meant for him the warlords fertile mind suddenly came up with an idea of how to turn the situation to his own advantage fangbum was to say the least surprised cluny clapped him heartily on the back and led him across to where the rest of the horde waited apprehensively cluny laughed aloud to put them at their ease he winked his eye roguishly well i see my little scheme worked out just fine we got the dirty traitor didnt we fangbum my old mate fangbum was completely baffled but he knew better than to disagree what oh er of course we did chief cluny nodded over at where the body lay do you see that well let it be a warning to you all ha i knew what was going on with cheesethief didnt anyone see him at the battering ram last night acting all high and mighty there was a general murmur of agreement most of the rats had been pressed into volunteering as ram carriers by the ambitious cheesethief aye we saw him chief chucking his weight about shouting orders he kept me on that ram for two hours yes youd have thought that he was the commander of the horde exactly cluny shouted id had my eye on cheesethief for quite a while he was doing a fair piece of ordering about without my permission why i bet he ordered some of you lads around while i was gone he started shoving me around chief volunteered darkclaw indignantly it was do this fetch that jump to it im using the chiefs tent i think cheesethief was getting too big for his boots chief cluny threw a claw around the speakers shoulder thank you darkclaw youre an intelligent captain you could see as well as i did that cheesethief was planning to take control of my trusted horde why else would he start using my tent and dressing up in my battle armor the soldiers nodded sagely to each other cluny was right there was no fondness in the ranks for the dead powerhungry bully cluny continued you see i knew the badger and her friends were planning to kill me so i thought id kill two birds with one stone fool them and save myself the trouble of having to execute cheesethief in fact i let the redwall crowd do the dirty work for me i didnt want any of my loyal soldiers put to any trouble i gave the traitor enough rope and let our enemies hang him cluny slapped his thigh and burst out laughing the horde joined him falling about with merriment at their chiefs black joke what a cunning idea there was no doubt about it the scourge didnt miss a single trick cluny waved cheerfully to the distant figure of constance on the wall my thanks to you badger he shouted you did a fine job constance could not hear a thing from the distance of the ramparts which was just as well in the circumstances cluny was almost jovial as he turned to the horde well my good warriors has anything else happened while i was away killconey performed one of her most elaborate salutes the tunnel is goin very well yer honor good good said cluny anything else to report mangefur and scumnose piped up jointly we was out searching for dock leaves chief way out across those fields over there cluny halted them he nodded to scumnose you tell me well we was rootin about by some hedges chief said scumnose and we found a whole tribe of dormice fast asleep so we pounced on em and tied them up in a bunch nice big fat ones they are chief cluny interrupted dormice eh you havent killed them yet i hope scumnose shook his head vigorously oh no chief were keeping em nice and fresh in the ditch there dyou want to see em think theres about twenty all told good you did well i want them kept alive muttered cluny as he walked across to the ditch and peered down at the captives the dormice were huddled miserably together their necks looped cruelly together on a rope they whimpered fearfully at the sinister sight of cluny the scourge which one of you is the leader he snarled a bedraggled youngish mouse held up a timid paw i am sir my name is plumpen please let us go free we have done no harm to any living creature violence is against our nature we silence cluny snapped or ill teach you what violence means an anguished moan arose from the dormice lying in the ditch cluny cracked his tail cut out that cringing he said contemptuously you are my prisoners to do with as i like oh dont worry i wont let them kill you yet ive got other more useful things in mind you plumpen or whatever your name is tell your tribe that they wont be harmed as long as you do what i say for the present you are to stay down there under guard scumnose mangefur yes chief you two are responsible for these prisoners said cluny see that no creature goes near them stand guard night and day if just one of these dormice is missing youll both end up on a roasting spit is that clear after cheesethiefs carcass had been disposed of cluny sat beneath an awning that had been improvised from the damaged tent he watched the armorer diligently repairing his prized war gear and fumed inwardly his equipment had been battered and he had lost a valuable captain the redwall contingent had stolen a march upon him and the battering ram had failed miserably once again the thinking was left to him the horde were more concerned with licking wounds and feeding their stomachs strategy was not their responsibility however on reflection the balance was beginning to swing in his favor again he now had three possible keys to the abbey one was the tunnel the rats in mossflower wood were attending to his second scheme and the third cluny glanced over to the ditch the capture of the dormice would prove an even more devious avenue to the conquest of redwall provided he played his cards right early evening saw the attack upon the abbey get under way once more jess squirrel and ambrose spike had joined the ranks of archers they popped up and down selecting random targets i dont like it jess remarked ambrose grunted as he released a feathered shaft at the ditch dont like what jess the squirrel put aside her bow and sat down under cover of the parapet they seem to have slackened off somehow and we havent seen much of cluny lately its not like the horde to behave in this way personally i think theres something afoot that we dont know about winifred the otter was standing nearby she slung a stone hard nodded in satisfaction at the resultant scream and joined the two friends aye im inclined to agree with you jess the scourge has probably figured some new move this attack may only be a cover by the way is there any word from foremole and his crew oh theyve still got their ears to the ground ambrose said gruffly foremole says theyve heard the odd echo nothing definite though southwest corner is where he thinks they might surface eventually yes ive heard that too jess agreed well have to arrange a warm reception for those filthy vermin when they show up what baffles me winifred mused is where young matthias has got to its not like him to miss the chance of a battle abbot mortimer was on his rounds with food he had been eavesdropping on the conversation and could not help commenting dyou know i was just thinking that same thing myself but we must give matthias the benefit of the doubt and trust in his judgment ive a feeling that he could be the salvation of us all one thing you may rest assured of wherever that young mouse is hell be concerned with the survival of redwall in one way or another im sure ah well jess sighed as she picked up her bow and notched an arrow to it wed better make sure he has a home to come back to on with the war friends the squirrel drew the bow full stretch and stood up she paused a moment peering along the yew shaft then released the string with a vibrant twang below on the edge of the meadow a creature fell transfixed one stoat less to carry out clunys commands matthias set up a solitary makeshift camp that night after a frugal meal he wrapped his habit tight about his body to ward off the chill breeze and settled down to sleep alone with his bitter thoughts about the ungrateful shrews the young mouse finally dozed off sometime before dawn he became aware of movement and sound nearby carefully matthias slitted one eyelid open his feet were warm he felt the extra weight of a blanket that had been draped over him while he was asleep the guerrilla union of shrews in mossflower had returned small campfires had been lighted and breakfast was being prepared matthias decided that it must be nearly daybreak turning on his side he kept up the pretense of sleep ignoring the presence of the shrews he drifted back into a warm slumber it was fully daylight when he reawakened the sun beat down through the trees mixing its rays in the pale blue smoke of the cooking fires logalog brought toasted wheatcake and a bowl of herb tea sitting up matthias accepted them noncommittally he ate and drank in silence while logalog folded the blanket and packed it away the shrew stood beside him and gave a short nervous cough ahem er matthias im sorry about what happened yesterday as you can see weve decided by majority vote to come along with you the young mouse continued to ignore him logalog slumped down matthias listen we shrews of the union try to run our lives along democratic lines you must not think too harshly of us the shrew who spoke out against accompanying you was only stating chapter and verse of the act was wrong to hit him guosim did right to uphold his argument matthias arose and shouldered his bundle look logalog dont talk to me about your silly rules subsection three paragraph four and all that nonsense you are either with me or against me i havent got valuable time to waste on a lot of shrew union rules and disputes logalog picked up his pack and smiled broadly at the young mouse matthias my friend we are with you to a shrew tooth claw and nail lead on bold warrior matthias laughed in open relief well lets get started friend logalog weve got an adder to fight and a sword to win surrounded by a band of shrews that had started quarreling over the best route to the quarry matthias marched stolidly forward they trekked through the trees leaving mossflower wood far behind across open ground giving the farmhouse a carefully wide berth breeching hawthorn hedges and spanning driedout ditches through several fields that lay fallow in the summer stillness a halt was called at lunchtime on the banks of a slow broad river matthias sat next to guosim during the midday meal it would be the last cooked food they would get stealth and secrecy would be the order of the day upon the other side of the river no fires no noise matthias flicked a pebble into the water how are we supposed to cross this lot he asked guosim spoke through a mouthful of bread logalog how else thats how he got his name you know his father and his fathers father before him were all called logalog the whole family were all ferryshrews on this river if you needed to cross the water you stood on the bank and shouted logalog here lets see if it still works guosim walked to the rivers edge cupping her paws around her mouth she called in a ululating voice logalogalogalogalog the older shrew appeared out of a reed bed balanced upon a large floating tree trunk which he propelled skillfully with a long pole into the side of the bank angrily he sprang ashore upbraiding guosim puddenheaded shrew dyou have to broadcast the fact were here shouting out like a great foghorn wed better strike camp and get across now before someone conies i was only showing matthias how to call for the ferryshrew guosim muttered surlily is that all said logalog heatedly then why dont you show him the snake tracks in the mud there or didnt you notice them asmodeus passed through here not four hours ago hes probably gone hunting in mossflower wood its a mercy we didnt bump into him he might come back this way before the day is through matthias stared in horrified fascination at the broad slimy path that had been left in the mud by the snake the shrews had all clambered hastily aboard the strange craft hurry along matthias all hands on deck logalog hissed despite the danger of the enterprise the young mouse actually enjoyed the ride across the river on the tree trunk several of the shrews dug lines out of their packs and fished successfully amassing quite a tidy little catch before the ferry nosed into the opposite bank with a gentle bump the shrews disembarked and matthias helped logalog to conceal the ferry in some bulrushes i was thinking matthias mused do you suppose we could all hide somewhere that way we might see asmodeus return and track him to his lair thats exactly what i had planned myself the shrew replied if we spread out along the bank and remain hidden men well stand a good chance of spotting poisonteeth its a good idea but i can see a drawback supposing the adder catches the scent of shrews theres so many of us that its a distinct danger then again matthias argued would it not be better if we made our way to the quarry and waited there asmodeus is bound to head for home i wish it were that simple my friend logalog replied the land around the quarry offers no concealment too flat and bare poisonteeth is full of ancient cunning too he may have a secret entrance outside the quarry itself i think it is best we wait here ill spread the comrades out in a line well all keep watch throughout the long afternoon matthias lay hidden at the base of a lilac bush he was within calling distance of shrews secreted a short distance away as they were of their neighbors farther along fully a half mile of the bank was covered in this fashion whoever spotted asmodeus was to report after letting one minute elapse to matthias who was positioned roughly at the center of the line guosim and logalog were stationed on either flank the blazing sun hung over the watchers like a fiery disc matthias kept his sights on the river and the ground in front of him not daring to move whether to eat drink or scratch he was forced to endure the unwelcome attention of inquisitive flies and insects that buzzed about and walked across him at their leisure often he would focus so hard that his imagination played tricks a slight ripple upon the water or a vagrant breeze through the grass became asmodeus he would blink and reassure himself that it was only a product of his tensed mind the young mouse lost track of time until he became aware of the sun starting to sink in a reddening sky heralding the twilight surely the snake must pass this way soon as complete darkness descended a shrew sneaked up through the grass and tapped matthiass shoulder whats the matter has asmodeus been sighted matthias asked the shrew pointed out along the flank that guosim headed i dont know mouse youd better come and see for yourself ill go and get logalog matthias scrambled out from beneath the lilac something must have gone wrong throwing caution to the winds he dashed along the river bank other shrews left their hiding places and followed him guosim was seated upon the open ground her eyes wide with fright teeth chattering madly her whole body trembling tike a leaf logalog came racing up matthias shouted to him guosims in a state of shock help me lets get her into the water grabbing guosim between them they rushed her into the shallows and ducked her under the surface of the river she came up spluttering but coherent giant poisonteeth the snake asmodeus he was here i didnt spot him until it was too late hes taken mingo gave him the magic eyes then bit him and dragged him off poor mingo ugh it was horrible horrible i tell you the rotten filthy reptile guosim flung herself down sobbing into the grass logalog pulled her roughly to her feet come on dont lie there crying shrew the adder probably left a good wet trail for us to follow where did it happen guosim ran shakily some distance to the left she pointed to the ground right here you can see the great slithering marks look the evidence was quite clear the wet path in the dry grass gleamed in the dark they followed the trail with matthias and logalog in the lead it twisted and turned tortuously over small hillocks through hedges and across fields even when the wetness stopped there was the musty odor of death clinging to the ground ј at the top of a small rise matthias dropped into a crouchf signaling sveryone to do likewise he pointed downwards ј look logalog there spread out beneath them was a vast disused quarry it was as if some gigantic hand had scooped a great hole in the f landscape the shape was roughly oval the steep red sand stone sides were terraced halfway around into long flat shelves piles of fallen stone were dotted about amid the defunct workings the scant vegetation lent the quarry an air of stark desolation they lay on the edge of the pit straining their eyes into the dark floor area below steadily logalog gave orders to the guerrilla shrews to retire back across the field where they could rest up and eat a muchneeded meal only he and guosim remained at the edge of the quarry with matthias who settled any further debate by saying im going down there for a look around as soon as its light if you must go then we will come with you murmured logalog matthias shook his head no i cannot allow it its far too dangerous guosim who was fully recovered spoke out courageously you cannot stop us matthias you are not a union member therefore we are not under your command the rules clearly state this so the decision is out of your paws we go you and logalog get some sleep ill take first sentry duty the three friends slept in turns relieving one another through the long watches of the night hours matthias was on duty when the first fingers of dawn probed the quarry what a difference daylight made to the sinister nighttime appearance of the scene below the sandstone ranged through a spectrum of pale sunlight gold banded through every shade of yellow fawn umber brown down to the dusty red sandstone that must have been hewn out in distant ages to provide the masons with material to build redwall abbey he roused his companions to view the awesome spectacle to think that all this peaceful beauty should hide such cold evil he breathed wonderingly in silent indian file they began the descent the going was not too hard there were lots of handholds and steps and the sandy rock was quite firm not at all slippery it took less than an hour for the three friends to climb down they stood together on the bat quarry floor gazing around supposing poisonteeth decides to hunt today whispered guosim i have a feeling he wont logalog replied asmodeus got a full days hunt in yesterday with the unexpected bonus of poor old mingo on his way home hell probably sleep through today and go out to hunt tonight so that gives us all day to find out where he is added matthias shall we look together or split up stick together said guosim as she and logalog drew their short rapiers matthias took out his dagger they started searching the quarry for a possible hole or concealed entrance the trio scoured the lower slopes poking and probing they inspected underneath stunted bushes turned over chunks of rock crawled beneath huge slabs always watching keenly for the telltale single winding track of the adder the silence was oppressive there was neither birdsong nor the hum of insects inside the sunken arena having crisscrossed the floor they progressed to the middle terraces but the results were equally disappointing all morning they had searched the quarry without any success at midday logalog called a halt they sat on a flat tableshaped rock halfway up and shared a hardtack lunch followed by a canteen of water it was not a cheerful meal they each sat with their own thoughts finally guosim stood up dusting her fur off she clapped her paws together in a brisk manner urging her companions to resume the task right come on you two weve only got half a day left matthias and logalog gathered up their packs and weapons as guosim leaned on the side of a narrow slab and continued her summary if we search around the top lip this afternoon that only leaves us the heeeeeeeee the echo of the cry hung upon the still air guosim was gone the narrow slab she had been leaning against swung loosely on a pivot they had found the entrance to the lair of asmodeus poisonteeth cluny the scourge anxiously awaited the arrival of darkness one of his three plans had reached fruition a lot earlier than he had expected killconey had proved an invaluable help he had been across to the woods to satisfy his curiosity about what the rats were doing there it came as no surprise to the ferret to see a large siege tower under construction however there was a problem the cart still lay upturned in the ditch try as they would the rats had not been able to remove a set of wheels and an axle from it killconey had a word with cluny and was immediately sent down to supervise the operation the garrulous ferret showed the rats that he possessed a sound knowledge of the principles of fulcrum and leverage he rigged a block and tackle to supplement a dead tree limb that they were using as a lever ignoring wheels and axles he roped the cart to the block with all the rats and a great deal of luck he managed to lift the hay cart until it was halfway out of the ditch further pressure on the lever sent the hay cart past its own point of balance the block and tackle parted under the strain sending the ferret and the rats on the level shooting down into the ditch by mistake it did the trick with a crash the cart landed upright in the road they pushed it into the woods killconey oversaw the lifting of the tower on to the bed of the cart delighted by his own ingenuity he added the final touches in a short time the siege tower its wheels muffled with sacking stood completed ready for use cluny gathered his captains about him and outlined his strategy tonight when it was dark fangburn would step up the attack on the gatehouse wall as a diversionary measure cluny would command a picked band of the best fighters they would bring the siege tower from out of the cover of mossflower wood and wheel it to a part of the wall where the defense appeared weakest under cover of darkness they would filter from the top of the tower on to the ramparts a quick slaughter of the defenders would leave redwal wide open to them cluny watched the evening sky anxiously it would not be long now he signaled fangburn to begin the diversionary assault yelling and shouting fearsome war cries the attackers leaped from the ditch peppering the ramparts with a hail of arrows spears and stones redwall to me come on mice cried constance lets give better than we get redwall to me basil stag hare had formed three lines of bowmice on top of the wall they worked with military efficiency as the hare rapped out orders first rank fire drop back kneel and reload second rank fire drop back kneel and reload third rank fire drop back kneel and reload first rank forward again fire the commands continued unabated enemy soldiers fell stricken on the road darkclaw rushed about bringing up reinforcements keep those slings throwing bring up extra spears close up that line dont fire until you see them stand john churchmouse mr vole and friar hugo ran about bending low they collected up all the arrows spears and stones hurled by the horde issuing them to the defenders come on otters give them back a taste of their own medicine winifred urged her slingers on while directing fresh archers into the ranks of the bowmice constance and the beaver shared a stack of enemy spears they returned them with frightening power and devastating aim ferret archers at the edge of the meadow found the range of basils bowmice several were felled before jess squirrel and winifred along with some crack otter slingers sent down a barrage so swift and accurate that it decimated the ferrets within minutes while the battle went ahead ranging from the heights of the parapet to the depths of the ditch the joseph bell rang out over the carnage cluny snapped the battered visor down on his war helmet he rapped kilkoney on his shoulder good now is the time come on ferret together they slunk off down the ditch running crouched over to the southeast corner of the wall where it was relatively quiet keeping noise down to a minimum cluny ordered his troops to bring forward the siege tower straining and pushing the rat soldiers trundled the tall contraption from its woodland hiding place the going was even harder across the short space of soft meadow ground cluny himself lent a claw pulling on one of the lead ropes he tugged mightily causing the cumbersome tower to sway dangerously as it bumped over grassy hillocks bring it up close to the wall he whispered urgently thats it now make sure its on an even keel i dont want the top wobbling all over the place stones and sou were tamped around the wheels wedging them still the great tower stood ready for use when friar hugo hurried off to join the defenders he left cornflower in charge of the kitchens she had busied herself with setting pans of oatmeal and oven bread ready for the next mornings breakfast cornflower then thought of the sentries up on the wall and she set about making a large pan of vegetable soup it was a great favorite with the defenders at nighttime especially when she made it to her own recipe helped by mrs vole and mr squirrel she ladled it into three big earthenware jugs taking up a jug each with a small basket of fresh loaves and some goat cheese they set off with cornflower in the lead carrying a lantern the first stop was the southeast corner where foremole and his crew had a monotonous task night and day they monitored the grounds for sounds of tunneling they were glad of a short respite and some hot food while they chatted to the caterers in their gruff polite tones cornflower was never quite sure of what foremole was saying but she loved listening to his funny countrifiedmole dialect yurr missie they ratten varments be acomm upn two days oill reckern gar wem give em owd arry if n they shows thurr eads cornflower was only picking up one word in three but by the fierce scowl on foremoles face she was certain that the rats would not find it a pleasant experience being given owd any foremole tugged his nose graciously at her wurr thankee kindly nought loik vedgible soop to keepn loif in uz moles mr squirrel chuckled to cornflower and mrs vole well i take it the moles are quite fond of homemade vegetable soup i know my jess be ready for some yes and so would sam if he werent fast asleep in bed cornflower replied look you and mrs vole start serving along by the gatehouse keep your heads low and be careful ill start up here at the corner and see you back at the kitchen later with the lantern and basket in one paw and the jug in the other cornflower ascended the steps at the southeast corner of the wall brother rufus assisted her up on to the ramparts ah the young fieldmouse with the magic soup nice to see you cornflower it gets lonely up this end where theres no action brother rufiis held out his mug he watched gratefully through the cloud of steam that arose from the jug mmm that smells good vegetable soup my favorite cornflower was not listening she was staring openmouthed across brother rufuss shoulder the soup was overflowing from the mug and spattering on the stones as she continued to pour across the top of the parapet a ramshackle wooden platform had appeared as if from nowhere perched on top of it ready to spring was a villainouslooking rat with a cutlass clenched between his teeth cornflower shrieked aloud more by accident than design brother rufus spun around and sent the scalding contents of his mug splashing mil into the rats eyes with a piercing wail of agony the rat fell from the top of the platform scarcely aware of what she was doing cornflower threw the lantern it shattered on top of the siege tower drenching the dead wood in lamp oil instantly the flames licked hungrily over the platform turning it into an inferno attracted by the flaring blaze that lit the night defenders rushed from all quarters to see what was happening over thirty rats were in the high reaches of the burning tower many more were in the middle and still more on the lower frames rats were kicking and righting each other to get down from the blazing tower they bit and trampled and slashed some jumped while others were pushed screaming as they fell to the field far below cluny ran about in a berserk rage temporarily bereft of his senses he seized hold of smoldering injured rats some with their fur alight get back up there you cowards jump on to the wall he screamed in his madness the rats who had been attacking the gatehouse left off fighting and ran down the road to the fiery holocaust sparks crackled and shot off into the night sky cluny lashed out at all and sundry with his tail foaming at the mouth and cursing wildly his face a terrifying mask of insanity in the glare from the tower its only a bit of fireget back up there you blundering fools kill the mice darkclaw and fangburn grabbed hold of clunys smoldering cloak they dragged him backwards get out of the way chief its starting to fall with a roaring crackle and snap of blazing timber the siege tower leaned crazily to one side it tottered then collapsed in a flaring sheet of flame and sparks the hay wagon listed drunkenly and was pulled over on to its side where it lay burning furiously the incident put an end to that nights fighting on top of the wall cheering broke out cornflower was the heroine of the hour she blushed as foremole nodded admiringly air youm looken more andsome in this loight missy yurr you gotten any vedgible soop left didnt give it all to those varments did ye below the wall was a scene of mass carnage the ground was littered with the bodies of attackers who had fallen prey to the flames in the illstarred venture of the siege tower surrounded by his captains cluny was led down to the safety of the ditch apparently unaware of anything about him he muttered dark words to himself strange things that others could not comprehend behind the warlords back the captains looked at each other in a puzzled fashion had the mind of cluny the scourge finally snapped the fire had dwindled to smoldering embers by the next morning constance and the abbot looked at the results from the ramparts a wide area of the meadowland was burned black and scorched flat even now parts of it sizzled in the morning dew thank goodness it did not spread to die woods said the abbot otherwise all of mossflower might have gone up in flames the badger stared sadly at the scorched earth true no side uses fire as a weapon not even cluny it is the one thing that spells certain death to creatures on both sides we must look on it as an accident father abbot accident or not we owe cornflower a debt of gratitude replied the abbot she is a very brave young fieldmouse but for her swift action we would all have been under the heel of the tyrant today in the abbey kitchens cornflower stirred the oatmeal and checked on the bread baking in the oven she smiled to herself what would matthias have thought of it all last nights heroine this mornings cook while logalog held the rock from closing matthias peered into the hole it was a long dark tunnel sloping down the side of the quarrystone there was neither sight nor sound of guosim they called her name in loud whispers not wanting to shout for fear of disturbing the snake matthias became impatient come on logalog well have to go in there be as quiet as you can wait a tick the shrew replied taking a small boulder he jammed the entrance slab from swinging shut im ready now lead on matthias they ventured cautiously into the long sloping passage digging in their heels to prevent themselves sliding right down as guosim probably had done on reaching the bottom they stood awhile to let their eyes become accustomed to the gloom the floor leveled out the tunnel was high and broad enough to allow them to walk side by side without stooping as they walked further logalog pointed at strange symbols and weird signs that had been scraped into the surface of the soft stone though the quarry tunnels were natural they had obviously been the lairs of generations of serpents most of the signs were of a reptilian nature the friends pressed onwards until the passage broadened out into a small chamber with two more tunnels leading from it you take the left and ill take the right matthias whispered mark an arrow on the wall with your sword at intervals ill do the same with my dagger that way we wont get lost should you find asmodeus come straight back to this chamber if he finds you then the best thing to do is run as fast as you can and shout like mad take care warrior ill see you later said logalog gripping his dagger in readiness matthias crept into the righthand tunnel it was slightly narrower than the first but just as high the walls were yellow stone so soft that it was almost like damp sand scarcely daring to breathe and glad that his feet made no sound on the sandy floor matthias went ahead remembering to mark an arrow every few yards from somewhere up ahead the young mouse could hear the sound of dripping water the musical echoing plops made an eerie noise in the sinister stillness of the passage his paw encountered a space in the left wall it turned out to be a rectangular anteroom matthias was horrified to discover that it was full of castoff snake skins they lay about on the floor dry and withered he shuddered at the thought of their former occupants the hairs rising on the nape of his neck as he swiftly abandoned the repulsive scene and hurried along the passage it was more than twice as long as the entrance tunnel as matthias cut another arrow into the wall he noticed that the carved symbols looked older more primitive this place had been a serpents den long before it had been a quarry the passage ended abruptly matthias walked out into an immense cavern great hall of redwall would have fitted into a corner of this colossal structure at its center was a vast shimmering lake that glowed with a pale phosphorescent light the droplets of water came from somewhere high up in the dark recesses of the roof they dripped steadily down and broke the surface of the subterranean lake causing a continuous ripple matthias noticed that there were numerous other caverns and tunnels leading from this large cave asmodeussssssss the sound froze the very blood in his veins the adder was close by where he could not tell the deadly hiss echoed all around him asmodeusssssssssss matthias bravely tried to quell the panic that welled up inside him if the snake knew where i was he wouldnt waste his rime trying to scare me he reasoned he would have got me by now feeling slightly reassured but still very uneasy matthias circled the pool trying hard to ignore the loathsome hissing sound asmodeussssssssssss summoning up his courage he stole silently into the nearest cave in the glow that reflected from the pool matthias saw a sight that gladdened his heart there was guosim seated with her back against the wall matthias ran across and seized the guerrilla shrew by her paw guosim how did you get here you little nuisance weve been sear guosim toppled on her side dead with a strangled sob the young mouse recoiled he could see the poisonfang marks clearly upon the shrews chest guosim s face was bloated the eyes screwed shut the lips blackened asmodeussssssssssssss matthias stumbled from the gruesome deathlarder of the adder out into the main cavern he sat for a while shuddering with horror at what he had seen hardly believing that the still body had been a warm living breathing creature not long ago forcing himself to rise and carry on matthias continued his explorations the next entrance was a tiny hole in the wall scarcely worth bothering about nevertheless he decided to investigate it crouching on all fours matthias forced his way into the hole which proved to be another tunnel he began forcing his way along its narrow length asmodeussssssssssssss the dreadrul sound was much closer now struggling and pushing forward he came to the end of the tunnel suddenly matthias was face to face with the giant adder asmodeussssssssssssssss the huge reptile was sleeping with every breath it ex pelled the snakes tongue flickered out repeating the vile name asmodeussssssssssss matthias stared in mute fascination the snakes eyes were not shut but filmed over in sleep it was breathing slowly and regularly the huge muscular scaly body was coiled in no recognizable pattern at odd intervals the immense coils would shift lazily with a dry scaly rustle the head however remained fixed in the same position across the jumble of banded coils matthias thought he could catch a glimpse of the tapering tail there were other things in the lair of the snake a foxs tail woodpigeon wings the head of a big fish and fur pelts of many species of creatures but matthias saw only the sword of martin the warrior it hung from the fork of a tree root at the back of the vipers den a large red pommelstone was set into the top of the hilt the handle was of black leather and silver to match the belt and scabbard below a heavy silver crosspiece was the blade made from the finest steel its double edges tapered to a ruthlesslysharp tip down the center of the blade ran a blood channel either side of which there were symbols which matthias could not make out this was truly the sword of redwall abbey it was his duty to get it matthias moved more stealthily than he had ever done in all his life inch by careful inch paw by whisker slowly painstakingly trying to make his body as small as possible he flattened himself against the wall to get by the huge spadelike head the tongue almost slithered across his face as it slid in and out constantly repeating the dreaded name asmodeussssssssssssssss he felt the adder breathing its cold exhalations carrying the sweet musty odor of death stirring his whiskers a coil moved and faintly touched his leg matthias sucked in his breath and squeezed closer to the wall the snake blinked sending the opaque tissue upwards the young mouse was confronted by the wideopen eye of the monster staring directly at him asmodeussssssssssssssss the eye filmed over again as the snake carried on with whatever evil vision it was dreaming sweat like ice water drenched matthiass fur asmodeus had opened his eye while still remaining asleep there was no other explanation possible the moments of suspense ticked by for what seemed ages until matthias managed to squeeze past the serpents head avoiding the gigantic coils he walked quickly and quietly over to where the sword hung from the tree roots on the cave wall matthias lifted the ancient sword down reverently he placed both paws around the handle tighter and tighter he gripped it until the point lifted from the floor and the bright blade stood out level in front of him he sensed how martin must have felt each time he had held this beautiful weapon hie young mouse knew that he had been born for this moment his grip causing the tremor of the steel to run through his entire body it was part of him matthiass main concern was to get safely away with the sword in the confined space of the snakes den there was no room to wield the fabled blade if he struck at asmodeus he would be crushed to death against the walls by the powerful lashing coils of the adder in its death throes nothing would be accomplished by such a foolhardy action like a seasoned fighter the young mouse chose to nominate the time and place of combat he looked around the den the hole he had come through was obviously too small for the adder to have used for the same purpose it served as a breathing hole for asmodeus also as amplification to echo the dreaded name through the caves and tunnels as a warning to intruders near the snakes tail which lay directly across his path he saw the skins and pelts on the cave wall tremble slightly they were covering the only possible entrance and exit for a reptile of such enormous girth emboldened by his ownership of martins weapon matthias tickled the tail lightly with the sword point it had the desired effect the long scaleencrusted coils rippled as the serpent changed position in its sleep speedily he slipped through the curtain of skins into the passage it curved in a crescentshaped arc bringing matthias back into the main cavern with its luminous lake logalog came dashing palefaced out of the cave that contained guosims body eyes wide with terror he ran straight into the paws of his mouse friend narrowly missing injury on the sword blade before he could be silenced he yelled out in a panicstricken shout matthias guosims dead ive just seen her in that cave shes dead guosim is dead in his den down the tunnel asmodeus came awake the captains of redwall looked to constance for guidance there was no question of overriding her commands of all die woodlanders she was the oldest and wisest creature within the walls the badger was slowthinking and deliberate but straight as a die her knowledge was born of vast experience be natural cunning of a survivor jess winifred and basil stood solidly behind constance they had just related to her the latest piece of intelligence received the attackers would emerge from their completed tunnel sometime around midafternoon the badger thanked them and shook her striped head knowingly she had not been caught off guard thanks to foremole now she would need the aid and specialized knowhow of the mole leader to stave off this latest threat to die abbey cluny the scourge was still acting strangely he sat in his patchedup tent at the far edge of the meadow and said nothing even when killconey marched jubilantly up with die news that the tunnel was within a fraction of being completed cluny sat and stared at the ground he did not appear in the least moved by the good tidings the ferret stood awkwardly ill at ease awaiting orders cluny sat unmoving as if he had forgotten killconeys presence the ferret tried once more its the tunnel chief well have it ready by this afternoon the warlord looked up blankly oh yes the tunnel well carry on er you know what to do ive got things to think about he muttered absently outside in the meadow fangburn and darkclaw listened in disbelief to the ferret i tell you hes off his rocker said kilkoney sittin there like a stuffed dummy ha things to think about if you please meanwhile weve got the whole horde ready to go through that there tunnel and take the abbey whatre we supposed to do theres only one thing we can do replied the stolid darkclaw weve got to carry it through ourselves while the chiefs not well darkclaws right agreed fangburn the three of us will take charge of the whole business they both looked at the ferret waiting for him to express an opinion i suppose youre right killconey said but listen the rest of the army mustnt get to know about the chief otherwise theyll desert yknow i cant seriously believe that clunys out of his mind just you wait and see its probably just another grand ould plan hes thinking up the trio of selfappointed generals marched down to the tunnel they climbed inside to check upon progress it was long dark and smelly weasels and stoats jostled past them carrying baskets of earth or dragging rocks and roots killconey pointed out the finer details to his fellow commanders sure were right underneath the road now the ground is good and hard it didnt need any shoring at all now see the footings of the wall mind your heads from here ive had some props put in to hold the weight farther on the going gets really soft but weve run out of decent timber still i dont reckon itll make a great deal of difference if we move the army along fast enough we should all be inside the abbey before they know whats hit them above ground a mole leaning his ear against a thinlybeaten copper basin that was upturned on the earth listened carefully to every word the ferret was saying he repeated it to brother walter who wrote everything down word for word constance scanned the report and picked up her heavy cudgel before we know whats hit us eh she growled well be doing some hitting of our own before the day is through from the southwest corner of the wall moles had marked the exact run of the tunnel with two lines of cord and pegs foremole and his team knew all there was to know about the diggings depth approximate dimensions the placement of shoring even where the first rats head was likely to break ground the plan that constance and foremole had jointly worked out would require very little handtohand combat much to the badgers displeasure two oversized cauldrons of boiling water stood ready on tripods with slow fires burning beneath them to keep up the temperature constance and the beaver positioned themselves behind these tipstaves at the ready all available mice and woodland defenders were gathered in two groups on either side of the cordmarked aisle they waited looking to the badger for further instructions to a passing stranger it might have looked like some strange abbey ritual two fires twq parallel cords and all the seriousfaced creatures gathered h two groups on the grass in the hot juste afternoon wait silently the armed ranks of the horde were formed up in the ditch fangburn marched up and down issuing final instructions it had not been an easy task getting them in line without cluny there but the persuasive tongue of killconey had assured them that the chief was aware of their every move and would deal with malcontents and troublemakers later on pay attention now fangburn called darkclaw is up at the end of the tunnel when the diggers break through he will leap up into the abbey grounds four soldiers are with him theyll hold off any attack while the rest of us get above ground now once you are up dont hang about make straight for the abbey building try to capture the mouse abbot darkclaw wont be with you hell take some warriors and fight his way through to the gate once its open the others will be able to get in i dont need to tell you these are not peaceful creatures we are up against youve seen for yourselves theyve had a certain amount ofluck to date but they are determined tighten so when you get up there cluny wants you to show them what a horde of trained soldiers can really do dontforget the chief knows how to reward good fighters when it comes to splitting up plunder cluny had fallen asleep in his tent he needed peace to clear his troubled mind but peace was not easy to come by when the mouse warrior visited his dreams once more try as he would cluny could not evade the grim avenger with the sword shades of creatures that he had slain through the years came back to mock him they got in his way tripping him so that he stumbled and fell each time he would rise wearily and start to run again the nemesis at his back pursuing striding unhurriedly never changing pace as the wraiths of his dead captains skullface redtooth ragear and cheesethief hovered about urging him to turn and face die warrior mouse but he dared not turn he kept running the two weasel diggers thrust upwards in the narrow confines of the tunnel they sprang aside as earth showered down and daylight poured in with a seething press of soldiers behind him darkclaw stepped up to the waiting diggers they boosted him upwards he grabbed at the grass his spear tucked under one claw he stopped suddenly his body halfway out of the hole the first things he saw were two huddled crowds of small creatures they stood either side of a double line of pegs and rope darkclaw grinned wolfishly they were obviously playing some kind of silly little country game he had caught diem unarmed a noise from behind distracted the rat he swiveled around he found himself facing two huge cauldrons which bubbled and simmered ominously over twin fires behind them stood the big badger and another strangelooking creature equally well built darkclaw set his claws against the ground to lever his body out of the hole before he could do anything to stop them the badger and her companion tipped the bulky pots over darkclaw did not even get a chance to scream out a death cry boiling water cascaded down over his head in a hissing steaming deluge the force of the rushing water sent his body plummeting back down the hole endless gallons of scalding water hit the rats in the tunnel like a hellish tidal wave the tightly packed rodents were instantly slain on the surface constance cried out to the waiting defenders jump in between the ropes now the weight of combined bodies hit the ground between the lines constance began a steady chant jumptwothree jumjvtwothree jumptwothree under the constant pounding of countless feet the whole area that had been marked out by the moles suddenly sank into a trench the tunnel had collapsed the defenders stood and cheered in the depression directly above what had once been killconeys tunnel the badger gave the order to stop foremole and his crew moved in to block off the hole with rocks and rubble friar hugo ordered the cauldrons to be carried back inside to his kitchens the abbey creatures fell silent and drifted away from the heap of stones which blocked the hole a fitting headstone for a mass grave of the enemy at the tunnel entrance in the ditch fangburn and killconey were madly thrust aside as rats weasels ferrets and stoats fought their way out of the tunnel hey whats happened fangburn shouted come back here this minute where dyou think youre all going the defeated warriors ignored him caked with filthy mud and trailing broken spears they dashed off along thetfitch killconey peered into the tunnel all he saw was the battered body of a stoat being borne towards him on what appeared to be a boiling wave of ooze the ferret jumped backwards as the shoring burst and the tunnel workings caved in with a dull rumble of earth as cluny ran another specter appeared in his fevered dream it was a hideouslooking thing covered in a dark steaming substance it stood barring his way with its arms stretched wide as if to embrace him cluny pushed it savagely from him it moaned piteously chief its me darkclaw look what they did to me outside the tent killconey and fangburn exchanged uneasy glances you dug the tunnel so you go in first no fear im only a ferret youre a naturally superior rat youd better go first shall we go in together then better not it looks like the chiefs asleep he might not thank us for waking him up out of a nice dream aye thats true lets leave it untij later asmodeuss eyes glared through the narrow hole in front of him there were two creatures standing together in the big cavern a shrew and a mouse he hissed in anger the mouse was holding his sword his own beautiful sword the adder bunched his sinewy coils and shot through the skinhung opening he bared his evil poisoned fangs no mouse was going to steal the sword of the serpent matthias seized the frightened guerrilla shrew by his paw pulling him along at a swift run asmodeus must know were here by now come on logalog lets get out of this place quick they hurried down the nearest opening immediately spinning around and racing back asmodeus was in the passage sliding towards them they paused momentarily in the big cavern with the shrew on one paw and the sword in the other matthias looked wildly about over there logalog move skirting the edges of the shimmering pool the two friends dashed into a smallish tunnel at the other side behind them in the cavern the giant adder settled down to a leisurely slither his tongue flickered wickedly asmodeussssssss no hurry now they are not going anywhere with a cry of dismay the fleeing pair saw the blank wall ahead they had run into a culdesac logalog had stopped his teeth were beginning to chatter th th th theres no way out were trapped matthias continued running to the dead end he felt the surface of the wall and ran his paws up and down it we must do something he panted there must be some way to escape the snake get hold of yourself shrew think asmodeus poked his head into the entrance his sibilant voice called in to them stay where you are little ones i will come to you asmodeussss logalog had gone rigid with fright he stood petrified matthias had begun digging furiously at the wall with his sword point he gouged and thrusted muttering to himself at least weve got nothing to lose but a sword and our lives there might be something on the other side the sword struck a tree root he dug around it probing probing busily until the soft halfformed sandstone gave beneath the blade frantically matthias redoubled his efforts logalog gave a strangled sob hi the dim distance of the tnnnel asmodeus could be seen advancing slowly but surely towards them matthias felt the sword of martin break through the stone he looked back over his shoulder the giant adder was slithering closer with each passing second he hacked madly to widen the opening he had made sticking the sword in the ground he grabbed logalog and shook him soundly here shrew you are smaller than i am climb through then see if you can tug me backwards by my feet come on move yourself if you want to live logalog came out of his trance leaping quickly into the hole he scratched the damp sandy grit left and right ducking beneath the tree root he scrabbled awkwardly through into a tiny celllike space on the other side asmodeus was close to matthias now wielding the sword the young mouse backed off he felt the hole behind him and scrambled into it sideways still facing his enemy taking care not to let the swordpoint drop he shouted to his companion logalog can you see my feet grab hold of them pull me through matthias hung uncomfortably he tightened his paws on the swordhandle and moved it from side to side with the sway of the big vipers head suddenly he felt the shrew pulling on his feet wriggling his body matthias started to move backwards asmodeus bared his fangs he moved forward at the struggling mouse matthias swung the blade at the snakes open mouth it hissed and recoiled as matthias contorted himself to negotiate the tree root he poked the point of the blade at his enemys head stay back evil one or ill kill you he shouted asmodeus gave a low soothing hiss come to me little mouse let me wrap myself around you will give you the kiss of eternal sleep with a triumphant shout the young mouse disappeared completely into the hole he fell on top of logalog at the other side forcefully the snake launched his great body at the opening crumbling earth and rock as he pushed his coils through the aperture hes coming logalog screamed in terror matthias shoved his friend behind him planting his feet wide apart he hefted the great sword in both paws stay out of the way shrew theres no more retreating all ends here the gigantic spadelike head of the snake thrust itself through into the small space give me my sword mouse and i will make your dying easy he hissed matthias laughed in the face of the adder come and get it poisonteeth asmodeus tried forcing his body through with one swift thrust he found his bunched coils jammed firmly in the tree root relaxing he allowed his head to wave from side to side look at me my little friend i can see that you are a great warrior you are not afraid to gaze into my eyes look at me the eyes seemed to expand and dilate until they filled the whole of matthiass vision they dominated him he could not tear his gaze away asmodeus continued in a persuasive undertone see they are the twin pools of eternity sink into them and you will find darkness and rest logalog was completely hypnotized matthias too felt overcome by an immense lethargy the adders voice was a cold dark green velvet fog that threatened to envelop him he stared deep into the deadly eyes his lids began to droop heavily martin the warrior strode boldly up through the dark mist i am that is matthias why do you sleep there is a warriors work to be done here pick up your sword matthias the evil one shall not have it strike out for me now my brave young champion asmodeus was working his body free pushing forward matthiass eyes were shut his lips moved with one word strike suddenly the spell of the snake was broken the young mouses eyes snapped open clear and bright he swung the ancient sword high and struck at the giant adder he struck for redwall he struck against evil he struck for martin he struck for logalog and his shrews he struck for dead guosim he struck as methuselah would have wanted him to he struck against cluny the scourge and tyranny he struck out against captain snows ridicule he struck for the world of light and freedom he struck until his paws ached and the sword fell from them when logalog awoke from out of the trance he saw his friend matthias the warrior he stood shaking his chest heaved with exertion his paws hung limp at his sides the great sword lay against the warriors bloodflecked habit its long deadly blade crimsoned in victory and the head of asmodeus poisonteeth the giant adder lay severed upon the ground its eyes dulled in death never again to hypnotize another living creature it was the afternoon of the following day matthias marched into the farmyard at the head of all the guerrilla union of shrews in mossflower he halted the entire regiment outside the barn and turned to logalog wait here my friend theres someone have to see the young mouse stood in the gloom of the barn knowing he was being watched without turning or looking around he addressed the cat julian it is matthias i have returned the marmalade cat loomed up out of the halflight so i see welcome little friend is that the sword you told me of matthias proffered the blade for inspection it is indeed asmodeus the snake lies dead i slew him with this very weapon it is the great sword of martin the warrior squire julian gingivere handled the sword with care he laid it on a hay bale sitting next to it he folded his paws under him and half shut his eyes matthias let me give you some good advice i am much older than you and have seen far more of life there are not many illusions left to me and i do not want to shatter your ireams or blight your ambitions my friend but i must say vhat i have to we squires of gingivere are an ancient line in the past iave seen many such tokens as this weapon my grandsires owned a vast armory full of magnificent and valued battle equipment no doubt your sword is indeed a beautiful thing it is a tribute to whoever forged it in bygone ages there are very few such swords as this one left in the world but remember it is only a sword matthias it contains no secret spell nor holds within its blade any magical power this sword is made for only one purpose to kill it will only be as good or evil as the one who wields it i know that you intend to use it only for the good of your abbey matthias do so but never allow yourself to be tempted into using it in a careless or idle way it would inevitably cost you your life or that of your dear ones martin the warrior used the sword only for right and good this is why it has become a symbol of power to redwall knowledge is gained through wisdom my friend use the sword wisely matthias picked up his weapon he was surprised at julians words they were an echo of something that his old companion methuselah had once said to him thank you julian he said i will remember your lesson well now i must ask a favor of you would you come with me i want you to be present when i speak to captain snow the cat sniffed disdainfully you ask quite a lot i wouldnt do this for anyone else you know reluctantly julian stalked out into the sunlight with matthias there was an immediate spate of loud frightened chatter from the regiment of guerrilla shrews squire julian gingivere merely nodded and addressed them in a regal but distant manner good afternoon very clement weather for the time of year dont you think for the first time since the formation of their union the shrews stood in slackjawed silence completely lost for an answer as they strolled along julian protested to his companion really matthias i think you are asking a bit much of one does one have to stand around listening to that befeathered regimental bore giving air to his hidebound militaristic views oh its too much matthias stroked the sulky cats forepaw come on julian i think youll be pleasantly surprised the marmalade cat stifled a yawn you dont say has another tree fallen upon the pompous old fool captain snow paced around the base of his nest tree he glared at the cat then at the mouse holding the sword he snorted hunching his neck into ruffles and folding his wings behind him listen mouse i dont want to hear how you did it probably wouldnt believe you anyhow but here you are and i suppose thats that matthias hid a smile he tapped his foot in mock impatience im waiting capn snow sir remember your promises on oath the owls eyes bulged with ill temper he flung basils medal at the young mouses feet there take your medal back you insolent little pup im not saying another word while that saladeating cat is within hearing range matthias traced patterns in the dust with the swordpoint and spoke civilly to the owl well capn snow sir i never took you for a bad sport besides ive got an entire regiment of shrews hidden all about theyre waiting to hear you honor your wager the owl spread his wide snowy wings and happed upwards to perch on the edge of his den folding the wings and shutting his eyes tightly he shouted out with bad grace i promise never to kill or eat another mouse or shrew of any type as long as i live so there he hooted and vanished swiftly into his den instantly the shrews broke cover dancing and whooping with delight captain snow popped his head out of the nest go away begone i cant stand it all those little dinners dancing around its too much i tell you excuse my mentioning it sir matthias shouted over the hubbub but what about your promise regarding our friend the squire the owl emerged grumpy and ruffled thoroughly humiliated he called out to his former friend the cat it was all my fault i apologize to you squire julian he was completely taken aback by the cats reply not at all my dear friend it is i that must apologize to you the whole incident was entirely due to my priggishness and lack of manners captain snow swooped down and perched near the cat dyou really think so oh come on julian old chap i must share the blame it was my barrackroom feeding habits that started the whole thing you mustnt blame yourself old friend a rare smile covered the features of the normally laconic julian he purred comfortingly no no i insist that we share the blame fiftyfifty besides the question wont arise now that youve sworn off shrews and mice i say have you ever tried a fresh trout salad with mustard and cress why dont you come over to the bam im sure therell be enough for two i mean trouts not exactly a vegetable is it wing in paw the reunited comrades strolled off to the barn chatting amiably as if there had never been a cross word between them julian was last to enter the barn he gave matthias a broad wink who knows my friend maybe the sword does possess some magic personally think its the warrior who wields it for the first time in many days matthias laughed heartily he felt so good within himself after all the action and mental strain travel and grief he felt suddenly reborn larger than life and brimming with newfound selfconfidence certainly there were great difficulties and hard tasks ahead of him when the time came he would handle them for the present he was satisfied with this feeling of immense happiness holding the sword lightly he balanced its point against the earth and laughed freely it was infectious logalog joined in then one guerilla shrew then another and still yet more until the whole regiment and their warrior mouse friend set the countryside ringing from river to woods to farm and field with the happy sounds of their honest joy the cluny that emerged from the ragged tent in the meadow was far from being sick in the head the members of the horde watched the way he strode purposefully about the old glint was back in his single eye his orders were crisp and concise even the long tail had a fresh crack about it the chief seemed sharper than he had been before in the aftermath of the tunnel disaster cluny had called off the attack for a full day withdrawing all his followers well back across the meadow the warlord gave his horde time to recuperate from the fiasco a whole days leisure with no recriminations and hardly any orders the captains of red wall wasted no time in making use of the temporary respite repairs were started upon the gatehouse door teams of woodland carpenters abbey smiths and laborers plus any creatures that felt the need to help were lowered down to the road in large wickerwork baskets should the enemy in the meadow decide to make any sudden move the workmen could be speedily hauled back up to the ramparts all that day the rope gangs were kept busy sending down wood spikes cordage tools and repair materials cluny sat and watched them from the distance as he talked aloud to himself good work mice strengthen my gates wouldnt want to rule a fortress with broken doors fangburn was passing he overheard cluny conversing with himself not sure whether the remarks were addressed to him he stopped er are you feeling all right chief never better cluny replied he pointed at the repair crews see that fangbum honest industrious work and what for eh fangburn hazarded a guess to keep us out chief no to stop us getting in cluny chuckled get some soldiers and light a fire down in the ditch make it a proper blaze good and hot fangburn knew better than to question the reason for his chiefs order no matter how strange it sounded a big fire right you are chief ill get them going right away fangburn hurried off aware that cluny was watching him shortly after there was a huge fire burning in the ditch the horde gathered close by to see what cluny was up to the crackling flames gave off waves of heat causing everyone to step back above the ditch the air shimmered and danced cluny stood in the ditch claws on hips he cracked his tail scumnose mangefiir bring up those dormice prisoners the twenty dormice were dragged forward in a pitiable condition they cowered on the ground in front of the warlord half starved and dulleyed cluny pointed you leader mouse whats your name again plumpen sir the bedraggled mouse replied cluny grabbed plumpen roughly dragging him away from his fellow captives on the ground what are these other miserable creatures to you plumpen he snapped the dormouse explained in a shaky voice my family sir my mother father brothers sisters and my wife and two little ones oh please sir spare them i beg you cluny laughed cruelly his eye was devoid of pity he leaned close to plumpen and whispered harshly what would you do to save them the dormouse watched clunys eye rove lazily from his family to the blazing inferno anything anything you say what do you want of me he screamed in his fear and anxiety cluny cracked his tail triumphantly pulling plumpen forward until their noses touched the big rats voice was as foul and evil as his breath listen carefully you are going to open the abbey door for me my friend if you fail your precious little family will pay the penalty now here is what you must do constance hauled upon her rope it was no hard task for a fullygrown badger on the other ropes there were creatures that could not compare with her for strength but they hauled and pulled with an equally good will cornflower and silent sam kept busy supplying cool drinks and sweat cloths the repair work went ahead at a steady pace no one noticed that there was an extra mouse laboring among the workers in the roadway plumpen cluny had supplied him with a habit taken from the body of one who had fallen slain from the ramparts plumpen had concealed himself in the ditch and traveled under cover until he was level with the gatehouse at the appropriate moment he slipped out with a plank upon his shoulder and joined the work force they toiled away industriously until jess squirrel who was acting as overseer decided that the work was completed as indeed it was the old gatehouse door looked as good as new all the tools and spare timber were gathered up and the roadway was swept satisfied with a job well done the work crews stacked up their materials and were hauled up to the ramparts in the large grain baskets plumpen sat between brother alf and brother rufus across the meadow he could see cluny watching always watching plumpen cursed the fate that had put him and his family in the hands of the rats what a happy friendly lot the redwatt creatures were he was served afternoon tea sitting on the grass in the cloisters the dormouse felt the good food turn to ashes in his mouth at the thought of his betrayal of fellow mice but there was no alternative if he wanted to save his family after tea he wandered off on the pretense of carrying out some fictitious task when there was nobody about he hid himself in the old gatehouse den which had once been methuselahs study locking the door plumpen lay down lonely and miserable to await nightfall inside cavern hole the father abbot addressed a moraleboosting speech to his captains friends it will avail cluny little to put the abbey under state of siege as you know redwall is virtually selfsupporting all we require to sustain life and comfort is here within these walls therefore i suggest we carry on as normally as possible however the walls must always be guarded i leave it to you my captains stay ever vigilant against cluny and his horde i know that with your counsel and good judgment we will soon see the day when the enemy are forced to go elsewhere and leave redwall in peace there was loud applause for the abbots heartening words but constance was not convinced she whispered her thoughts to basil and jess never cluny wont leave us alone until either we are dead or he is basil stag hare nodded in agreement i know old scout but the abbots such a decent old buffer that he believes theres good in everyone even cluny what and so do i jess muttered i believe cluny will be good someday good and dead gradually the day drew to a close lights dimmed as redwall prepared for a welldeserved nights rest the meadowland and woods grew quiet and peaceful on top of the walls sentries leaned on the parapet listening to the evening birdsongs across the meadows the enemy campfires burned low into the soft june night plumpen waited another hour as cluny had instructed then it was time to make his move stealing quietly out of the gatehouse study the dormouse headed north staying well within the deep shadow of the wall at the small north wall gate plumpen drew a scarlet doth from his habit smearing the bolts with grease from the cloth he silently worked them loose killconey lay watching the gate from behind a sycamorein the woods near to every other entrance one of clunys most trusted soldiers was concealed awaiting the signal it was the ferret who was rewarded by the sight of the scarlet cloth being shoved through the doorjamb he hurried away to tell cluny it was dead of night when clunys horde moved out of the meadow around the embers of each campfire bundles of grass and twigs had been wrapped in blankets to the unsuspecting sentries on the wall the bundles looked like sleeping forms they sensed nothing amiss the horde circled northwards through the meadowlands until cluny judged they were far enough from redwall to escape detection he crossed the road at the head of his army they filtered back through the leafy cover of nighttime mossflower towards the abbey now that his goal was in sight cluny used all the stealth of a stalking hunter waiting until the entire horde was in position each soldier crouching quietly among the ferns and bushes knew the penalty for making any sound that would betray their presence not death from the defenders but death at the claws of their own chieftain cluny could wait he gave it another halfhour until he could actually see some of the guards on top of the wall nodding off at their posts what was thirty minutes after he had waited so long for this moment with practiced skill he slid from his hiding place and crossed to the wall door one gentle push and the small iron door swung slowly open on its greased hinges cluny stood in the doorway as his soldiers filed past him on their way to the abbey building there was little need to worry about the wall guards those who were awake would be watching the road or the enemy camp their backs turned on the secret invaders plumpen stood by anxiously watching the warlord at least his family would be safe now the dormouse had faithfully carried out his part in the dreadful scheme cluny must surely keep to his word he did not see the look that passed between cluny and fangburn fangburn swung the heavy dub and brought it crashing down on the back of plumpens head from behind the unlucky dormouse crumpled to the ground without a sound cluny the scourge bared his fangs grinning wickedly into the dark he had finally brought his horde into redwall ii the last rays of the sinking sun streamed through the open barn doorway lighting up formerly darkened corners matthias lay on the hay amid the remnants of an epic celebration feast the guerrilla union of shrews in mossflower had really outdone themselves laying out this spread he picked up a truffle and tossed it away with a sigh of satisfaction fearing he might burst if he forced another bite into his mouth on one side of the young mouse the gifts from squire julian gingivere captain snow and the shrews were piled high on the other was his sword reflecting the rays of the afternoon sun the guerrilla shrew regiment had chosen to sleep off the effects of the party outside in the sun they lay about the farmyard too full even to argue logalog snuffled lazily in and flopped down beside his mouse friend greetings oh mighty warrior he giggled savior of the shrews slayer of poisonteeth he who speaks with cats friendmaker of owls and uniter of oh shut up you noisy little devil matthias chuckled as he kicked logalog off the hay into the dust dyou know much about birds logalog said what about sparrows matthias yawned well what about sparrows ive had some dealings with em what do you need to know nothing really the shrew murmured sleepily but theres been one reported over at the edge of the woods of course no one can understand a single word that the savage heathen is saying shes screeching away back there hopping and dancing about working herself up into a right old tizzwozz or so ive been told matthias sprang up grabbing his sword come on logalog i speak the sparra language wed best get over there and find out whats upsetting her with a score of guerrilla shrews in their wake the two companions set off for mossflower on the double above die long grass in front of the woods the sparra warrior could be seen she fluttered up and down creating a raucous din logalog and the shrews were taken aback when matthias ran ahead of them shouting at the top of his voice warbeafc sparra thatta you old worm warrior joyfully the two friends reunited they rolled about in the grass like a pair of mad creatures pounding each other on the back matthias mouse old wormfiriend big fat warrior now how are you the shrews were completely baffled they sat about scratching their heads at the strange behavior of the sparrow and die mouse matthias chattered to warbeak in the rapid sparra tongue telling of all that had happened since they last parted warbeak for her part told matthias of her fortunes to date upon the death of king bull sparra warbeak had been crowned queen dunwing her mother had wished it to be so the tribe was happy under die wise rule of its youngestever queen no more would sparrows have to live under the daw of an unpredictable maniac after warbeak had related her story she became grave matthias redwall have big trouble we watch see from roof ratworm make lotta plans mice brave warriors alia time fight back beat ratworms plenty but warbeak watch ratworm king he badworse than king bull him make bad plan catch abbey ratworm soon be inside redwall matthias mouse come quick bring sword an icy claw of fear gripped matthiass stomach he sat down hard in the grass logalog shook his friend whats she saying matthias you look as if youve seen the ghost of poisonteeth for goodness sake whats going on its my home redwall matthias said in a hollow voice cluny the scourge is about to capture it logalog spoke urgently to the shrews quick get the regiment ready as fast as you can were off to the abbey at redwall tell them to catch us up i want no argument or votes tell every shrew to be fully armed we must march night and day if we are to save matthiass friends matthias picked up the sword of martin by thunder logalog youre right i fought hard for this sword in order to save redwall come on shrewmouse help you how many warrior him got warbeak chimed a fiill complement logalog answered about five hundred shrews warbeak spread her wings i bring alia tribe sparra warrior we come help matthias shook warbeaks claw warmly thank you queen warbeak my friend now we must go a strategy can be worked out on the way to the abbey lets hurry theres no time to lose its do or die now the mouse the shrew and the sparrow plunged off into the green wooded world of mossflower together one thing matthias was certain of as he strode swiftly through the trees it would be he and he alone who faced cluny the scourge at the bitter end the father abbot was awakened by a swordpoint at his throat he was completely surrounded by snarling rats jess basil winifred and foremole all found themselves in similar situations the iron claw of clunys discipline was strongly evident throughout the maneuver complete silence had been observed only those held captive were aware of the hordes presence the main danger to the attackers was constance as always she slept out upon the grass in the abbey grounds more than two score of rodents carrying a strong rope net between them had stolen up on the sleeping badger they threw the net over constance fixing it into the ground with long stakes and bludgeoning her senseless before she was properly awake cluny watched the proceedings with grim satisfaction redwall was his small creatures rubbing sleep from their eyes in confusion were dragged out into the abbey grounds woodland infants wept fitfully as they clung to their parents bullying rats pushed and harried everyone out into the open where they made them sit on the grass abbot mortimer in his homespun nightshirt was kept to one side with his captains their paws were cruelly bound behind them they stood in stolid silence as sniggering rats referred to them as the ringleaders cluny the scourge stood in great hall surveying the marvelous tapestry he did not need to steal scraps of it now it belonged solely to him fangburn frogblood scumnose mangefur and killconey came marching smartly up they saluted him the abbey is yours now chief weve got all hands outside chief any further orders chief cluny ran his tail reflectively through his long claws yes bring the abbots chair out of the place they call cavern hole have it set up for me on a platform by the gatehouse ive got some judgments to deliver the horde captains swaggered off jauntily cluny addressed the picture of martin upon the tapestry well warrior mouse what do you think of your brave redwall defenders now huh not much i imagine im going to let you stay up there and witness some drastic changes cluny jabbed a claw at martin his voice laden with menace no more will you haunt my dreams a voice inside me spoke as i waited in the woods tonight outside your precious redwall it said that before sunset this day i would be free of my nightmares forever what do you think of that martin continued to smile fearlessly down upon cluny the warlord cracked his tail shattering the silence of great hall he seemed driven to great anger by the apparent unconcern of the warrior henceforth this place shall be known as hall of the scourge he shouted insanely no more will the abbey be known as redwall it shall be called clunys castle everything will change the warlord went off into a berserk rage stamping about the hall slashing and whipping at the shadows with his tail as he invented new titles screaming them out as the echoesbounced back off the walls at him the great rodent wall the lake of drowning the field of dead mice ferret gate stoat orchard weasel bell hahahahahahaha outside upon the grass the woodland captives heard clunys crazed laughter ringing from the abbey they shivered at the s thought of their inevitable fate he was making them wait drawing out the tension reveling in their misery savoring his evil victory abbot mortimer looked up at the sky it will soon be dawn he said sadly a rat pushed him heavily to the ground shut your doddering mouth old one he snarled nastily jess squirrel knocked the rat flat with both her feet she sank her teeth into the bullys back a pack of rats leaped upon jess they dragged her off their screaming companion and beat at her with their spear butts and cutlass handles leave her alone you cowards mr squirrel shouted as he struggled to hold back silent sam youre very brave in a gang but you wouldnt face my jess if her paws were free you scum not if there were twice as many of you father abbot struggled to his knees please i beg of you do not fight on my account they have the advantage youll only get hurt aye sensible words yer honor killconey said as he made way for the abbots chair to be carried through take my dp and sit quiet until the chief comes out dont make it harder on yourselves than its going to be thats what me ould mother always used to say good grief shouldnt think a blaggard like you ever had a mother basil sniffed disdainfully killconey cackled and slapped his thigh well now arent you the big comical rabbit let me tell you my fine gentleman bucko you wont be hah so funny when the scourge is done with you no sir the prisoners slumped dejectedly upon the abbey grass awaiting the break of dawn and the coming of cluny the scourge warbeak and logalog had to force matthias to take a rest the young mouse had set a scorching pace marching through the night from the far borders of mossflower wood the guerrilla shrew had trouble keeping up he was smaller than matthias and did not have the advantage of flight like the sparrow always several yards behind he panted for breath as he stumbled gamely on even warbeak was beginning to feel the effects of prolonged low nighttime fluttering through the woodlands around trees over bushes it was not the same as a clear clean flight through the upper atmosphere only matthias kept going at a dogged headlong dash he stopped for nothing the heavy sword hanging from his shoulders by a length of cord thumped against him as he urged his legs forward the breath rose ragged in his throat his companions realized the urgency of the situation but they saw that if matthias continued to drive himself at this rate he would soon collapse the matter was solved when matthias tripped upon a tree root and went sprawling flat his two friends pinned him down and held on while they tried to talk sense to him finally convinced matthias sat among the ferns with his allies it was not wasted time they held a council of war you carry on to redwall matthias logalog said i will wait here for my band well force march most of the way dont worry the guerrilla shrews wont be far ft behind you well make good time in this cool night air the young mouse was assailed by gnawing doubts thats all very well but how are we going to scale the wall into the abbey grounds if cluny has captured redwall hes bound to have sentries posted upon the ramparts what for ratworm want sentry warbeak shrugged her wings him catch abbey not know we come to catch back warbeak youre right but it still doesnt solve the problem of how we get in matthias replied the young sparra queen winked cheekily is easy me get sparras to open little wormdoors in wall east south north you see they do good warbeak go now see friend matthias mouse at redwall the sparra queen shot off into the air like an arrow from a bow matthias arose to continue his journey logalog stayed behind and waited for his warriors to catch up beside the north wall gate plumpen stirred he groaned and rolled over there was a bad wound on the back of his head but he was still very much alive the first sight that greeted the dormouses hazy vision was three sparrows standing over him they were dunwing battlehawk and windplume silently they slid plumpen out of the open door into the woods dunwing gave orders to the two sparra warriors take red rag and grease bring many sparra fly quiet grease other little wormdoors wait til queen warbeak come no let ratworms see warriors go now throughout the night hours many sparrows worked secretly on the locks bolts and hinges of the small wallgates somewhere in mossfiower matthias was still pressing on to redwall logalog and the regiment of guerrilla shrews were hot on his trail a thousand sparra warriors perched in the branches of trees all around the abbey waiting the light of dawn began to appear in the sky the suns rays tinged the sandstone walls to a dull pink and clouded red dew was upon the late rose despite the blessing of a glorious summer day the whole of mossflower was doomladen with an awful tension that threatened to burst upon the captives seated on the grass horde captains came stamping out of the abbey they prodded the prisoners with cutlass points and slapped out with flat blades at the helpless defenders come on you lot on your feet stand up straight you mice step aside there make way for cluny the scourge reluctantly the redwall contingent complied they turned all eyes were on the door of great hall the silence was broken as the door slammed back upon its hinges cluny strode out behind him bearing the horde standard and a lighted torch came fangburn and killconey the victorious horde soldiers cheered wildly cluny was the picture of barbaric power geared for war from his poison tail tip to the frightening battle helmet he looked every inch the conqueror regally he swept through the ranks of both sides looking neither to right nor left mounting the dais which had been set up for his use he swirled the sinister cloak about him and sat down in the abbots chair all that could be heard was the crackle of the torch and the unhappy whimper of one of the infant captives he sat impassively claws gripping the chair arms visor lowered slowly lifting the visor cluny allowed his single eye to rove around it came to rest on the abbey leader you abbot mouse come here with two rats flanking him the father abbot stepped forward in a slow dignified manner even clad in his nightwear he radiated calm and fortitude cluny sat back sneering openly ha so this is your leader a little fat mouse in his nightshirt what a fearsome warrior he looks well what now mouse are you going to go down on your knees and beg for your life old one abbot mortimer stared calmly into clunys savage eye i will never bend my knee on my own behalf however if i thought i could save the life of one of my friends i would gladly fall down on both knees but i know you cluny better than you know yourself there is not a scrap of pity or mercy in your heart only a burning desire for vengeance therefore i will not kneel to one who is consumed by evil cluny sprang to his feet trembling with rage kneel to me mouse kneel or i will kill you he stormed angry growls and the rending of grass from beneath the net on the ground heralded constances awakening she began to heave and push the net started to work loose she called out to cluny in a gruff insulting voice hey you you scruffy oneeyed vermin remove this net and face me alone well see who ends up on their knees at a signal from the warlord a gang of rats leaped upon constance and beat her back into unconsciousness with their weapons they drove the securing stakes deeper around the net basil stag hare kicked out at them when he had driven the rats off he faced cluny boldly you sir are not fit to command any creature you are a coward and an evil maniac even if my paws were not tied i would think twice before soiling them upon the likes of you tcha you are beneath contempt you you rat a stinging blow from a weasels club sent basil limping and tripping to the ground the weasel struck him again and again upon the legs he doubled up in pain as the horde jeered and laughed cluny pointed at the hare remember your tricks on the common behind the church before this day is done youll never run and dodge again his eyes blazing with madness cluny flung his claws wide all of you defenders of redwall listen to me when i first came to the abbey i gave you a choice surrender or die you chose to fight me me cluny the scourge i lost battles lost skirmishes i lost soldiers but i have won the war you are the losers now you must pay with your lives as the warlord spoke something seemed to snap deep within the abbot he rushed forward and tried to grasp cluny no no you dare not harm these creatures he cried h would be murder cluny grabbed the father abbot and threw him to the ground lashing the frail figure with his poisonbarbed tail he shouted who are you to tell me what to do there is only one law my word there is none to stop me not badgers or hares or otters or mice will kill you all kill kill kill suddenly a thunderous voice was heard cluny die scourge i have come to settle with you a gasp arose from the crowd clunys tail fell from his grasp as both victors and vanquished turned towards die abbey whence the voice had issued there in the open doorway of great hall stood the warriot mouse it was as if he had stepped out of the tapestry upon die wall on his arm was a burnished shield at his waist was a sword belt of black leather and silver from the scabbard at his side he drew forth a mighty sword clunys voice shook as he addressed the nightmare visitor who are you the warrior stepped forward into the daylight sunravt glinted diamondlike off his sword i am that is unable to take his eyes from the warrior cluny stumbled backwards he cowered behind the abbots chair his mouth working convulsively you are something out of my dreams go away im not asleep the warrior mouse strode out into the crowd he pointed his blade at the quivering warlord i am that is martin matthias call me what you will it was long ago written that you and i would meet rat seize him cluny screamed frogblood sprang forward brandishing a spear before he could raise it the ancient sword flashed in the warriors grip and hewed him lifeless to the ground i will slay any invader that moves matthias shouted cluny this is between you and me your army will not interfere suddenly the joseph bell began tolling sparra warriors appeared in swarms that almost obscured the sky above the abbey they landed in droves around the parapet edges the grounds came to life with teeming swarms of guerrilla shrews armed to the teeth with rapiers cudgels and slings matthias whirled the sword above his head as he roared out his battle cry redwall redwall strike for redwall the final conflict had begun shrews struck down the enemy guards as sparra braves released the prisoners bonds with short slashes of their sharp beaks the freed defenders grabbed up anything that would serve as weapons they hurled themselves upon the enemy sparrows and shrews siding them against their larger adversaries rats ferrets weasels and stoats fought with the ferocity bom of desperation their very lives depended on the outcome cluny plucked the blazing torch from killconeys grasp he flung it at the face of the oncoming warrior matthias deflected it with his shield in a cascade of sparks and went after the horde leader to gain a brief respite cluny pushed killconey into matthias the ferret grappled vainly but was cloven in two with one swift stroke matthias stepped over the slain ferret whirling his sword expertly as he pursued cluny ignoring his unprotected back matthias failed to see fangburn stealing up behind him the rat raised his cutlass in both claws but before he could strike constance had hurled the net over him fangbura struggled like a landed fish as the big badger picked up the net and swung it several times against the gatehouse wall dropping the lifeless thing constance plunged with a terrifying roar into a pack of weasels the thick tail of the warlord flicked out venomously at matthiass face he covered swiftly with his shield as the poisoned metal barb clanged harmlessly off it cluny tried again this time whipping the tail speedily at the young mouses unprotected legs matthias leaped nimbly to one side and swung the sword in a flashing arc cluny roared with pain as it severed the tip of his tail the bloodied stub lay on the grass with the barb still attached hurling the abbots chair at his adversary the rat seized an iron spike metal clashed on metal as the warrior mouse parried clunys thrusts they battled across the green abbey lawns right through the center of the maelstrom of warring creatures oblivious to the fighting around them they sought to destroy each other hacking stabbing lunging and swinging in mortal combat meanwhile teams of sparra warriors were jointly lifting struggling rats and flying high to drop them into the middle of the abbey pond ferrets had cornered a band of shrews and were threatening to massacre them when a column of otters sprang to the rescue keeping heavy pebbles locked in their slings they battered continuously at the ferrets besieged by fierce sparrows rat sentries leaped in panic from the top of the ramparts those who stayed were dealt with by jess squirrel who swung a heavy iron chain around like a deadly flail down below ambrose spike was rolling about like a whirling ball of needles silent sam acted as his eyes propelling him into each fresh bunch of rats with a long stick matthias and cluny continued battling savagely iron smashed upon steel as cluny called up reserves from his vast strength and cunning to defeat his opponent twice he had hurled clawfuls of soil at matthiass eyes but each rime the shield rose swiftly and deflected them the warrior mouse hacked away stoically he was beginning to feel his paws numbed by the jarring blows of the hefty iron railing against the sword blade cluny too felt the vibrations each time the sword clanged upon his weapon the pain shot right through him down to the tip of his injured tail along the ramparts they fought blinded by sweat panting and blowing neither asking nor giving quarter down the stairs and across the grass once more they slashed and struck at each other right up co the entrance of great hall cluny dodged behind the halfopen abbey door and hit out at his attacker matthiass swordpoint lodged deep in the wood seizing his chance the rat dodged nimbly into the open and battered madly at matthiass upheld shield until he was forced to drop it clunys iron spike drove cruelly into the mouses unguarded paw matthias cried out and instinctively kicked the shield upwards at his adversary it struck cluny squarely under the chin the sharp metal edge causing a long slash as the rat reeled away clutching at his throat matthias freed the sword from the door ignoring their wounds they immediately clashed again going at it hammer and tongs cluny lashed out with his bleeding tail and tripped matthias as the warrior mouse lay upon the ground the rat roared and stabbed downwards with the spiked railing matthias rolled to one side the point sank deep into the earth he straggled to his feet striking out and scoring cluny heavily down the side but the long tail whipped out lashing the warrior mouse several times across the face cluny staggered into the entrance to the bell tower where friar hugo had been tolling the joseph bell at the sight of the rat warlord he released the rope and scuttled underneath the stairs where he hid trembling matthias came thundering in cluny dodged around him and slammed the door locking them in together if only he could get the mouse at close quarters and stop him from using the sword cluny thought then he could win with his superior strength they locked in combat again cluny barred the railing across the sword blade pushing with both claws he drove matthias backwards now he could see victory in sight if only he could pin the warrior mouse against the wall he would be able to throttle him with the edge of the railing cluny braced his feet and strained he could feel the breath laboring raggedly within his chest he must win the voices had told him he would never again see the warrior after the sun set upon this day the prophecy had to be fulfilled once and for all remorselessly he used his greater strength to drive the young mouse backwards they were only inches from the wall now matthias realized what cluny was doing he would be finished once he was pinned against the wall there was only one thing to do matthias suddenly swerved aside and collapsed on his back kicking his legs out rigid he sent cluny crashing into the wall matthias leaped over cluny and bounded up the spiral stairs into the darkness of the belfry cluny lay against the wall panting heavily he managed an evil wheezing laugh theres no way out up there mouse he called im coming up after you youre as good as dead now matthias didnt reply he sat exhausted up in the dark belfry with his legs dangling over the stout timber bell axle down below cluny squatted against the wall glad of the chance to take a breather beneath the dusty stairs friar hugo sneezed laughing triumphantly cluny seized the little fat friar by his tail and dragged him from his hiding place look mouse he called see ive got your little fat friend ha i wont have to climb those stairs after all throw the sword down or ill spike him like a lollipop from his vantage point matthias looked down far below him on the floor he could see cluny holding the spike under friar hugos chin cluny gave the point a light jab hugo gurgled unhappily you see all it takes is a little harder push and hes dead now throw down your sword and get down here yourself quick matthias peered over the rim of the joseph bell all right rat you win but how do i know youll keep your word first let the friar go then i promise on my honor as a warrior that ill come down cluny grinned wickedly there it was again that stupid thing called honor the code of the warrior but it was not his code he had won get out of my sight you sniveling little wretch he grated thrusting friar hugo away from him the frightened mouse dived back underneath the stairs cluny stood in the center of the room his one eye straining to catch sight of matthias in the belfry blood dripped from the dozen wounds die mouse warrior had inflicted upon him during the course of their battle but now he knew he had won the voices had been right he would soon see the last of the mouse warrior come on down mouse cluny the scourge is waiting for you he cried matthias stood up on the wooden beam with one mighty blow from the blade of the ancient battlescarred sword he severed the rope holding the joseph bell it appeared to hang in space for a second then it dropped like a massive stone cluny remained riveted to the spot his eye staring upwards before he had time to think it was too late clang the joseph bell tolled its last huge knell the colossal weight of metal smashed cluny the scourge flat upon the stone floor of the bell tower wearily matthias the warrior descended the spiral stairs sword in hand he led the sobbing little friar out of his hiding place together they stood and stared at the joseph bell where it lay cracked clean through the center from beneath it there protruded a bloodied claw and a smashed tail matthias spoke i kept my promise to you cluny i came down hush now friar hugo its all over now wipe your eyes together the friends opened the door and walked out into the sunlight of a summer morning redwall had won the final battle the bodies of both armies lay scattered thick upon the grass and stones where they had fallen many were sparrows shrews and woodland defenders but they were far outnumbered by the slain rats ferrets weasels and stoats nowhere was there one of clunys infamous horde left alive constance ambled up her big flanks heaving covered in wounds she pointed to the bell tower and uttered a single word cluny dead matthias replied were all the horde slain did we take no prisoners at all the badger shrugged wearily a lot of them tried to escape we didnt really stop them they managed to unbar the main gate and ran out into the road there were a big ginger cat and a white owl waiting for them hells whiskers ive never seen anything like it basil stag hare limped up and threw matthias a wobbly salute squire julian and capn snow you can talk to them later on young feller right now youre needed over in the cloisters its the abbot better hurry as fast as their tired limbs would allow them matthias constance and hugo went together abbot mortimer lay in the cloister gardens surrounded by his mice and woodland friends everyone was there from queen warbeak and logalog to cornflower and silent sam down to the humblest mouse the poison barb on clunys tail had done its deadly work the father abbot was dying respectfully the ranks opened to allow matthias and his companions through constance knelt to cradle her old friends head and matthias gently clasped the wrinkled careworn paw the abbot smiled fondly at his young mouse matthias my son i see you have restored the sword of martin to our abbey is your mission completed then matthias rested his forehead against his abbots paw yes father cluny the scourge is dead i have done my task the abbot nodded slowly so have i my son so have i father abbot you must live said constance in a gruff choking voice the abbots old face broke into a weak smile my old friend i am not like the seasons i cannot go on forever it has to finish sometime the tears rolled down matthiass cheeks he could not stop them the abbot patted his paw kindly ah matthias matthias the brave one wipe away your tears my son death is only part of life tell me can you see the late rose matthias dried his eyes on the abbots wide sleeve yes father it is in full bloom now and are all the little roses as red as blood said the abbot they are father matthias answered the abbot sighed it is as it was meant to be is brother alf nearby brother alf knelt before the abbot ah brother alf my old and valued companion when i am gone to my rest you will take my place as abbot you are a wise and compassionate mouse i know you will look after my creatures for me abbot mortimer closed his eyes for a moment before carrying on with his final instructions what a great pity that it took so much bloodshed to unite us all henceforth the sparrows may come and go as they wish they must share our food and use our abbey not only die roof but all of it these good guerrilla shrews also no longer will they be as gypsies roaming the woods they will have a proper home here at redwall as long as they wish and now matthias my son i must tell you my decision regarding you it is my wish that you do not enter our order as a brother a gasp of surprise arose from all those within hearing range matthias bowed his head he was stunned by his father abbots words the abbot continued no my son your heart is far too brave this abbey needs you but not as a brother therefore i name you matthias the warrior mouse of redwall champion of our order from this day you will defend this abbey and all of its creatures from evil and wrong your sword shall be known far and wide as ratdeath now cornflower where is httle cornflower the young fieldmouse came she stood by the abbot waiting upon his word there you are dear cornflower the abbot smiled a warrior needs a good wife you are the beauty that will grace redwall and rule the heart of our matthias the old gatehouse will be extended into a proper home it belongs to you both guard our threshold wisely and well there were no words to express the feelings of matthias and cornflower they could feel the joy and pride singing from their hearts the abbot looked up at constance and you my oldest friend do me one last service lift my head a little and i will tell you what my failing eyes can see before i leave you obediently the badger raised the abbots head ah yes i see the most beautiful summer morning of my life the friends i know and love are all about me redwall our home is safe the sun shines warmly upon us nature is ready to yield her bounty again in plenty this autumn i have seen it all before many times and yet never cease to wonder life is good my friends i leave it to you do not be sad for mine is a peaceful rest thus did mortimer the father abbot of redwall die one year later the following is an extract from the annals of redwall by john churchmouse it was he who took over as recorder from methuselah here is part of his written record is the summer of the talking squirrel only yesterday the young one known as silent sam was heard to speak he was heard conversing with the son of matthias and cornflower the young squirrel suddenly began to relate the saga of the late rose summer wars to the baby mouse i fear that we will not be able to stop him from talking or his parents from laughing with delight the son of our warrior is a strong chubby little fellow everyone calls him matttmeo because matthias methuselah mortimer is too big a mouthful but that was what his parents wished his name to be even now he tries long and often to lift the great sword ratdeath i think one day he is sure to succeed his father as abbey champion our abbot mordalfus has declared that his first anniversary shall be marked by a huge feast we are all invited constance has been pulling her cart around the woodland and meadows far and wide bringing in guests the guerrilla shrews are out collecting honey from the bee folk they have struck up a great friendship with the bees even learning their language so that they can argue with them the sparra queen warbeak has appointed herself deputy to friar hugo she shows a great interest in the culinary arts though i fear she will grow quite fat before too long lady cornflower is out in the meadows with mrs churchmouse my wife and dunwing the sparra queen mother they are gathering jlowers for the tables all about me the june sunshine is like liquid gold basil stag hare has gone off on a journey to bring hisfriends captain snow and squire julian gingivere back to the abbey with him basil is ignoring the fact that it is the abbots anniversary he constantly refers to it as a regimental reunion dinner winifred the otter and the beaver in company with that reprobate ambrose spike are testing the quality of the october nutbrown ale it must be particularly frne this year judging from the sound of many rowdy ballads issuing from the wine cellars plumpen and his family of dormice are helping foremole and his crew dig a roasting pit early this morning our father abbot went outfrshing with matthias the warrior they consider it no less than their bounden duty to bring back a larger ftsh than last year the joseph bell which was broken has been recast into two smaller bells i can hear them now they are named matthias and methuselah my twin churchmice tim and tess are grown quite sturdy over the past year they are our abbey bellringers and a splendid job they make of it too the crops are growing well the fruit trees and bushes in the orchard show much promise the old gatehouse is now a beautiful rambling cottage the grass is green the sky is blue and the honey sweeter than ever before i willfrnish my writing now and go to prepare myself for tonights festivities which will be held in their usual place at cavern hole in redwall abbey please be sure to visit us if ever you are passing john
