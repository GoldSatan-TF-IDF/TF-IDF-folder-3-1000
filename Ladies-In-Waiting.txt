miss tommy bye bye tomsie dont stay away too long these sentiments were being called from the hoboken dock to the deck of an ocean steamer while a young lady buried in bouquets and bonbons leaned over the rail sparkling inciting compelling responding take care of yourself tommy i dont see but that i must nobody else to do it she responded saucily you wouldnt let em if they tried this from a rosycheeked youngster who was as close to the waters edge as safety permitted say did you guess what my floral offering was to be when you trimmed your hat i am flattered sorry the hat was trimmed

reproachfully you know shes got nobody and nothing to come back to shes given up her room shes quarreled with her beastly uncle at last all her belongings are in the hold of the steamer and shes made up her mind all ashore thats going ashore the clarion tones of the steward rang through the air for the third time and the loud beating of the ships gong showed that the last moment had come the gangplank was removed and the great liner pushed off and slowly wended her way downriver some of the more faithful ones in the crowd waving handkerchiefs until she was a blur in the distance well theres no truer way of showing loyalty than by going to hoboken to see a friend off said the eyeglassed chap as he walked beside jessie macleod to the ferry i wouldnt do it for anybody but tommy nor i exclaimed the rosy youth good old tommy i wonder whether shell sing and have a career or fall in love over there she might do both i should think at least it has been done though not perhaps with conspicuous success was carls reply whatever she does weve lost her sighed the girl and our little set will be so dull without tommy fergus appleton had leaned over the deck rail for a few moments before the ship started on her voyage leaned there idly and indifferently as he did most things smoking his cigarette with an air of complete detachment from the world he was going to no one and leaving no one behind he had money enough to live on but life had always been something of a bore to him and he could not have endured it without regular occupation his occasional essays on subjects connected with architecture his critical articles in similar fields his travels in search of wider information the book on which he was working at the moment these kept him busy and gave him a sense of being tolerably useful in his generation the particular group of juveniles shouting more or less intimate remarks to a girl passenger on board the steamer attracted his attention for a moment they are very young he thought or they would realize that they are all revealing themselves with considerable frankness although nobody seems to be listening but me he would not have listened as a matter of fact had it not been for the voice of the girl they called tommy it was not loud but it had the quality of a golden bell and fergus was susceptible to a beautiful voice one other thing the slightest possible thing enlisted his notice she wore a great bunch of mignonette stuck in the waistband of her green cloth dress and her small hat had a flat wreath of the same flower mignonette was perhaps the only growing thing of which fergus appleton ever took note and its perfume was the only one that particularly appealed to his rather dull sense of smell the reason being that in the old garden of the house in which he was born there was always a huge straggling patch of mignonette his mother used to sit there on summer mornings and read to him and when he lay on his back in the sunshine he used to watch the butterflies and hummingbirds and trees and sniff the fragrance that filled the air when his mother died he wandered into the garden sought the familiar corner and flung himself on the bed of mignonette to cry his heart out the lonely heart of an eightyearold boy that was five and twenty years ago but he never passed a florists open door in summertime without remembering that despairing hour and the fragrance of the flowers bruised with his weight and moist with his tears the girl vanished the moment the steamer was out of sight of the dock and fergus did not give her another thought for a day or two he had liked her green cloth dress and the hat that framed her young laughing plucky face he had thought her name suited her and wondered what dignified appellation had been edited cut and metamorphosed to make tommy deciding after a look at the passenger list that it was thomasina and that the girl must be miss thomasina tucker an alliterative combination which did not appeal to his literary taste the voyage was a rough one and he saw her only now and then always alone and generally standing on the end of the ship her green cape blowing in a gale of wind and showing a scarlet lining her mignonette hat exchanged for a soft green thing with an upstanding scarlet quill she was the only companionable person on board but he did not know her and sat nowhere near her at table an assemblage of facts that seemed to settle the matter considering the sort of man he was and the sort of girl she was shes too pretty and too young to be gallivanting about on her own he said to himself one morning when tommy stood on the upper deck looking out to sea and as far as he could judge singing though there was such a gale blowing that he could not hear her voice but all the girls are the same nowadays and he puffed his pipe disconsolately all the same brisk selfsupporting good fellows if i ever met a nice unsuccessfulbutnotdepressed sort of girl soft but not silly mild but not tame flexible but not docile spirited but not domineering i think i should capitulate but theyre all dead the type has changed and i havent changed with it fergus appleton did not make acquaintances easily no man does who has had a lonely neglected boyhood his only companion a father who seldom remembered his existence and when he did apparently regretted it he had known girls but he was a shy silent ugly boy and appealed as little to them as they to him he did not live through the twenties without discovering that a fine crop of sentiment was growing in his heart he also discovered that he didnt know in the least what to do with it george meredith speaking of romance says the young who avoid that region escape the title of fool at the cost of a celestial crown fergus appleton wouldnt have minded being called a fool if only he could have contrived to deserve the title and the glimmer of the crown celestial had been in his imagination more than once until he turned thirty and decided it was not for his head guileless schoolgirls did not appeal to him and elderly sirens certainly had no power to charm he was even widowproof so he became a thoroughfare for sisterly affection girls suffocated him with friendliness which was not the stuff of which his dreams were made however he had nothing to complain of for he got as good as he gave and it occurred to him that he could not expect to start a disastrous conflagration in any maiden bosom so long as he had no brimstone nor any substitute for it on his own premises anyway he reflected though perhaps not oftener than once a year if i havent a tie in the world i have complete freedom to do as i like and if the said freedom palled upon him occasionally nobody was the wiser for fergus appleton did not wear his heart on his sleeve as for tommy there had been several thomas tuckers in genealogical line and the father of thomasina was already thomas tucker the third mr and mrs tucker the parents of the first thomas must have been somewhat lacking in humor and somewhat ignorant of the classics for although they could not perhaps help being tuckers they neednt have saddled their offspring with a christian name which would suggest mother goose to every properly educated person however the first thomas grew into a great man healthy wealthy and wise and his descendants could hardly do less than keep his name alive thomas the third was disappointed not to say mortified when his only child born in his old age turned out to be a girl but he bravely did the best he could and named her thomasina mrs tucker did not like the name but she died before the baby was three days old the baby hated it herself when she reached years of discretion and when she found that she possessed a voice and had a possible career before her she saw plainly that something more mellifluous must be substituted if programmes should ever be in question meantime she was tommy to her friends and the gay little name suited her to a t the gay little rhyme suited her too for like the tommy tucker in mother goose she had to sing for her supper for her breakfast and her dinner and her tea also for that matter if any were to be eaten her only relation a disagreeable bachelor uncle had given her a home during her orphaned girlhood and her first idea on growing up was to get out of it this she did promptly when she secured a place in a brooklyn choir the salary was modest but it provided a room and at least one meal a day not of course a roman banquet but something to satisfy a youthful appetite it seemed to the intrepid possessor of a charming voice an equally charming face and a positive gift for playing accompaniments that the other two meals and a few clothes and sundries might be forthcoming as a matter of fact they were although the uncle said that tommy would starve and he almost hoped that she would just to break the back of her obstinate independence ii tommy had none too much to eat and according to her own жsthetic ambitions nothing at all to wear but she was busy all day long and absurdly happy her income was uncertain but that was amusing and thrilling rather than pitiful or tragic she had two or three steadies among singers who gave her engagements as accompanist at small drawingroom recitals or charitable entertainments there was a stout prima donna whose arias for dramatic soprano kept her practicing until midnight and a rich young lady amateur who needed a very friendly and careful accompaniment because she sang flat and always lost her breath before the end of a long phrase the manner in which tommy concealed these defects was thoroughly ingenious and sympathetic when miss guggenheim paused for breath tommy filled the gap with instrumental arabesques when she was about to flat tommy gave her the note suggestively if she was too dreadfully below pitch and had breath enough to hang on to the note so long that the audience always composed of invited guests writhed obviously tommy would sometimes drop a sheet of music on the floor and create a diversion always apologizing profusely for her clumsiness the third patron was a young baritone who liked miss tuckers appearance on the platform and had her whenever he didnt sing schuberts erl kцnig which tommy couldnt play this was her most profitable engagement but it continued alas for only three months for the baritone wanted to marry her and she didnt like him because he was bald and his neck was too fat also she was afraid she would have to learn to play the erl kцnig properly all this time tommy was longing to sing in public herself and trying to save money enough to take more lessons by way of preparation when she lost the baritone who was really peevish at being rejected after suiting his programmes to her capacities for a whole season tommy conceived a new idea she influenced jessie macleod who had a fine contralto and two other girls with welltrained voices to form a quartette we cant get anything to do separately perhaps we can make a pittance together she said well do good simple things our voices blend well and if we practice enough theres no reason why we shouldnt sing beautifully singing beautifully is one thing and getting engagements is another sighed jessie macleod as if i didnt know that we cant hope to be superior to other quartettes so we must be different unusual unique i cant think just how at the moment but i will before we make our dйbut and she did for tommy was nothing if not fertile in ideas every hour that the girls could spare in the month of october was given to rehearsal till the four fresh young voices were like one they had decided to give nothing but english songs to sing entirely from memory and to make a specialty of good words well spoken all the selections but one or two were to be without accompaniment and in these tommy would sit at the piano surrounded by the other three in a little group miss guggenheim was to give them their first appearance invite fifty or sixty people and serve tea she kindly offered to sing some solos herself but tommy shuddering inwardly said she thought it was better that the quartette should test its own strength unaided miss guggenheim couldnt sing but she could dress and she had an inspiration a week before the concert what are you going to wear girls she asked anything we have is the general idea said tommy mine is black mines blue white pink came from the other three but must you wear those particular dresses cant you each compromise a little so as to look better together so hard to compromise when each of us has one dress hanging on one nail one neck and sleeves filled up for afternoons and ripped out for evenings i should get four simple dresses just alike said miss guggenheim who had a dozen what if they should hang in our closets unworn and unpaid for asked jessie macleod were sure to get at least one engagement some time or other nothing ventured nothing have we ought to earn enough to pay for the dresses if we do nothing more and tommys vote settled it miss guggenheim knew people if she did sing flat and her drawingroom was full on the occasion of the dйbut carl bothwick a friend of tommys was in a publishing office and nobly presented programmes for the occasion the quartette had not thought of naming itself but carl had grouped the songs under the heading the singing girls and luckily they liked the idea at four oclock the hum of conversation ceased at the sound of singing voices in the distance a sort of processional effect had been tommys suggestion and the quartette formed in the dressingroom and sang its way to the audience hark hark the lark at heavens gate sings and phoebus gins to rise the voices rang high and clear coming nearer and nearer all the words could be heard and understood the hall portiиres divided and the girls entered all in soft gray crкpe gardenias at the belt little brimmed hats of black velvet with a single gardenia on the side the flowers being the offering of the dramatic soprano who loved tommy they were young they were pretty they sang delightfully in tune and with quite bewitching effect several ladies fell in love with them at first sight and hoped that they would sing for nothing a few times just to get themselves known they had done nothing else for two years so that tommy said they must be acquainted with the entire state of new york though nothing ever came of it it was a joyous surprise then when an old gentleman in the company who was seen to wipe tears away when the girls sang darby and joan engaged them to sing at his golden wedding the next night that was the beginning of a season of modest prosperity tommys baritone had married his new accompanist he seemed determined to have a pianoplaying wife and wishing to show miss tucker that his heart was not broken by her rejection he gave a handsome party and engaged the quartette paying for their services in real coin of the realm other appearances followed in and out of town and tommy paid for her gray dress spent a goodly sum for an attack of tonsillitis the result of overwork and still saved two hundred dollars the season was over she was fagged but not disheartened who is at twentytwo but it was late april and drawingroom entertainments were no more the two hundred dollars when augmented by the church salary would barely take her through till october it is very annoying thought tommy when you have to eat drink sleep and dress twelve months in the year that the income by which you do these things should cease abruptly for four months still furriers cant sell furs in hot weather and summer boarders cant board in winter so i suppose other people have to make enough money in eight months to spend in twelve hark hark the lark at heavens gate sings and phoebus gins to rise she caroled splashing about in her morning tub as she finished making these reflections the tub being an excellent place for trills and scales proceeding from tub to her sittingroom to make things ready for toilet and breakfast her mind ran on her little problems i want to learn more see more hear more she thought i have one of those nasty unserviceable betwixtandbetween talents voice not high enough for robert toi que jaime nor low enough for stдndchen not flexible enough for caro nome nor big enough for ocean thou mighty monster poor french accent worse german awfully good english but that doesnt count can sing old ballads folksongs and nice forgotten things that make dear old gentlemen and ladies cry but not pay if i were billed at all it ought to be first appearance in publicvsmallcaps ofvsmallcaps behindthetimes tommyvsmallcaps this appellation so tickled her fancy that she nearly upset the coffeepot and she continued to laugh at her own wit until a fat letter was pushed under her door from the hall outside she picked it up it had an english postmark helena markham she cried joyously dear tommy the letter read dont you want to come over to london for the season you never make any money at home from june to october and if by chance you have a penny in the bank i dont know why i say if when none of us ever had such a thing i think i can put enough in your way to pay part of your expenses i am really beginning to get on three engagements in the provincial towns all arranged my accompanist plays lots better than you do but i dont sing half so well with him as i used to with you you somehow infuse the spirit into me that i lack i incline to be lumpy and heavy they may not notice it in the provinces for i dare say they are lumpy and heavy there too however though i shall have to have somebody well known over here for concerts of any great pretensions i could work you into smaller ones and coach with you too since i must have somebody and you are so goodlooking tommy dear and have such a winning profile i am plainer than ever but no plainer than madame titiens so the papers say i never saw or heard her of course but the critics say i have the same large massive style of voice and person my present accompanist would take first prize for ugliness in any competition he is more like a syndicate of plainness than one single exemplification of it i must have a noble nature to think more of my audiences than of myself but i should like to give them something to please their eyes i flatter myself i can take care of their ears oh do come tommy say you will helena tommy pirouetted about the room like an intoxicated bird waving the letter and trilling and running joyful chromatic scales for the most part badly done will i go to london she warbled in a sort of improvised recitative will i take two or two and a half lessons of georg henschel will i grace platforms in the english provinces will i take my two hundred dollars out of the bank and risk it royally perhaps the bystanders will glance in at my windows and observe me giving the landlady notice and packing my trunk both of which delightful tasks i shall be engaged in before the hour strikes iii fergus appleton thought he saw the singing girl of his voyage from new york one may day in wells where he went to study the cathedral he noticed a hansom with a pinkclad figure in the opening looking like a rosebud of a new and odd sort on wheels at least it looked like a rosebud at the moment the doors rolled back like the leaves of a calyx and the flower issued triumphant and beautiful she was greeted by a tall stout young lady who climbed into the hansom and the two settled themselves quickly and drove off appletons hansom followed on its own course which chanced to be in the same direction and he saw the slim and the stout disappear up a hilly street at the top of which was a famous old house he walked that way in the afternoon having nothing better to do but could observe no dwelling at which the two ladies might be staying there was a pretty cottage with a long graveled pathway leading to it and a little sign on the locked gate reading spring cleaning please do not knock or ring farther along was a more pretentious house so attractive that he was sorry he had never noticed it before for the sign apartments to let was in one of the front windows he heard a piano in the rear somewhere but on reaching the front door another sign confronted him the parlor maid is slightly deaf if doorbell is not answered at once please step inside and ring the dinner bell on the hall table this somehow required more courage than appleton possessed though he determined to look at the rooms on his next visit so he stole down the path and went about his business wondering why in the world he had done such a besotted thing as to take a walk among the furnished lodgings of the cathedral town of wells the summer waxed he had nearly finished his book and feeling the need of some peaceful retreat where he could do the last chapters and work up his sketches he took the advice of an english friend and went down to devonshire intending to go from place to place until he found a hotel and surroundings to his mind the very first one pleased his exacting taste and he felt that the bexley sands inn would be the very spot in which to write comfortable within a trifle too large perhaps and at weekends too full of people but clean wellkept and sunny it was a friday evening and the number of guests who arrived on the last train from torquay was rather disturbing the diningroom service was not interfered with but appleton made up his mind to smoke his pipe in his own sittingroom and go down to the lounge later to read the papers when the crowd might have dispersed at nine oclock accordingly he descended and was preparing to settle himself with the last spectator when the young lady in the office observed theres a very good concert going on in the drawingroom sir if you enjoy music no admittance you know just a plate at the door as you leave quite optional appleton bowed his thanks filled his pipe and taking up his newspaper with a sensation of comfortable idleness was beginning an article on the situation in the balkans when a voice floated out from the distant drawingroom down the long corridor through the writingroom into the lounge it was not a little voice nor a big voice it seemed to have no extraordinarily high notes and no low ones it did not arrest attention by the agility of its use but it was as fresh and young as a birds and sweeter than honey in the comb it began by caroling my loves an arbutus went on to the little red lark and the lowbacked car so that appleton his head thrown back in the easychair the smoke wreaths from his pipe circling in the air the balkans forgotten decided that the singer was irish a pretty voice sir remarked the goddess of the hotel office im sorry so many of our guests are playing bowls this evening and theres a bridge party of three tables in our firstfloor private sittingroom or the young lady would have had an audience she seems a nice little thing quite a stranger with no experience if the singer had even a small group of hearers they were apparently delighted with the lowbacked car for with only a seconds pause she gave the minstrel boy a certain individual quality of tone and spirit managed to bridge the distance between the drawingroom and lounge or perhaps it was the piano accompaniment so beautifully played that one could almost imagine it a harp or was it that the words were so familiar to appleton that every syllable was understood so that the passion and fire of the old song suffered no loss the minstrel fell but the foemans chain could not bring that proud soul under the harp he loved neer spoke again for he tore its chords asunder its a pity her programme is so oldfashioned said the young lady of the office passing his chair to give an order to the page its true only the elderly people went in but our weekenders are very uptodate in everything theres a lot of londoners here and those from torquay are frightfully musical if they dont get debewssy it seems they think nothing of the programme well i confess that debussy seems a trifle alien to this time and place said appleton and these old ballads suit my taste much better i think ill take a nearer view he shoved his pipe into its case and strolled down the corridor pausing behind the heavy velvet portiиres that shut off the drawingroom there was no buzz of conversation going on because there was not a sufficient number of persons to buzz a very quiet stodgy audience it was with no friendly grouping just a few old gentlemen here and a few old ladies there sometimes with their prematurely aged and chastened paid companions by their sides there were some girls of fifteen or sixteen too scattered about a few of them accompanied by prim governesses appleton heard the entrance of some one from the anteroom beyond the grand piano then a few chords struck by hands that loved the ivory keys and evoked a reciprocal tenderness every time they touched them then near woodstock town in oxfordshire as i walked forth to take the air to view the fields and meadows round methought i heard a mournful sound so the chronicle ran on until the crisis came the lady round the meadow ran and gathered flowers as they sprang of every sort she there did pull until she got her apron full the history of the distracted ladys unhappy passion persevered the green ground served her as a bed the flowers a pillow for her head she laid her down and nothing spoke alas for love her heart was broke appleton was at first too enchanted with the mischievous yet sympathetic rendition of this tragedy to do anything but listen the voice the speech were so full of color and personality he forgot for the moment that there would be a face behind them but there was an irresistible something in the line until she got her apron full that forced him to peep behind the curtain just in time to catch the singers smile as this is not a story of plot suspense or mystery there is no earthly use in denying that the lady in question was miss thomasina tucker nor any sense in affirming that her appearance in fergus appletons hotel was in the nature of a dramatic coincidence since americans crossing the atlantic on the same steamer are continually meeting in the british isles and on the continent appleton was pleased to see the girl again because he had always liked her face and he was delighted to find that her voice not only harmonized with it but increased its charm a hundredfold miss tommy had several rather uncommon qualities in her equipment one was that when she sang a high note she did it without exposing any of the avenues which led to her singing apparatus she achieved her effects without pain to herself or to the observer just flinging them off as gayly and irresponsibly as a bird on a bough without showing any modus operandi she had tenderness also and fire and a sense of humor which while she never essayed a comic song served her in good stead in certain old ballads with an irresistibly quaint twist in them she made it perfectly clear that she was sorry for the poor lady who was running around the meadow preparing her flowery bier but the conviction crept over you that she was secretly amused at the same time appleton heard the smile in her voice before he pulled aside the curtain and saw its counterpart on her face heard and responded for when tommy tossed a smile at you you caught it gratefully and tossed it back in the hope of getting a second and a third another arrow in tommys modest quiver was the establishment of an instantaneous intimacy between herself and her audience the singing of her songs was precisely like the narration of so many stories told so simply and directly that the most hardened critic would have his sting removed without being aware of it he would know that tommy hadnt a remarkable voice but he would forget to mention it because space was limited sometimes he would say that she was an interpreter rather than a singer and tommy for her part was glad to be called anything and grateful when she wasnt brutally arraigned for the microscopic size of her talent it was tommys captivating friendliness and the quality of her smile that did for the shyest and stiffest of men for by the time she had finished her programme the thunderbolt the classic the eternal thunderbolt had fallen and fergus appleton was in love tommy began her unconscious depredations with near woodstock town and phillida flouts me added fuel to the flames with my hearts in the highlands and charlie is my darling and reduced his heart to ashes with allan water and has sorrow thy young days shaded the smile began it but it was tears that worked the final miracle though moisture very rarely has this effect on fires of any sort tommy was tired and a bit disheartened appleton the only responsive person in the audience was seated in a far corner of the room completely hidden behind a lady of formidable width and thickness so the singer could not be expected to feel the tidal waves of appreciation he was sending toward her although they ran so high at one moment that he could have risen to his feet and begged her to elope with him the rest of her hearers sat heavily stodgily in their seats without moving a muscle mental emotional or physical they had no private sittingrooms and they might as well be where they were as anywhere else that was the idea they conveyed in every feature of their expressionless faces an old gentleman in the front row left the room during the last song on the programme and appleton was beset by and resisted a vulgar temptation to put out his foot and trip him up in the doorway when tommy sang has hope like the bird in the story that flitted from tree to tree with the talismans glittring glory has hope been that bird to thee on branch after branch alighting the gem did she still display and when nearest and most inviting then waft the fair gem away yes yes a thousand times yes answered fergus appletons heart for the first time in his life conscious of loneliness lack of purpose lack of anchorage lack of responsibilities lack of everything he had never wanted before but wanted desperately all at once and quite independent of logic he slipped out of the door and let the scattered units in the audience assemble pass him and drift down the corridor toward the office and lounge to his astonishment and anger they dropped shillings on the plate and the young people sixpences and great heavens even pennies one halfcrown the tacit apology of the old gentleman who had left early was the only respectable offering appleton took out a sovereign and then was afraid to put it in the collection for fear of exciting the singers curiosity so he rummaged his pockets for halfcrowns and twoshilling pieces finding only two or three he changed his mind and put back the goldpiece just in time to avoid the eye of the page who came to take the offering back to miss tucker appleton twisted his mustache nervously and walked slowly toward the anteroom with no definite idea in mind save perhaps that she might issue from her retreat and recognize him as she passed as a matter of fact she had never once noticed him on the steamer but the poor wretch was unconscious of that misfortune the page came out putting something in his pocket and left the door half open behind him appleton wheeled swiftly feeling like a spy but not until he had seen miss thomasina tucker take a large copper coin from the plate fling it across the room bury the plate of silver upside down in a sofa cushion and precipitate herself upon it with a little quivering wail of shame or disappointment or rage he could hardly determine which appleton followed the unfeeling unmusical penurious old ladies and gentlemen back into the lounge glaring at them as belligerently and offensively as a gentleman could and maintain his selfrespect then he went into the waitingroom and embarked upon a positive orgy of letterwriting looking up from the last of his pile a halfhour later he observed the young lady who was unconsciously preventing a proper flow of epistolary inspiration on his part seated at a desk in the opposite corner a pen was in her right hand and in her left she held a tiny embroidered handkerchief rather creased sometimes she bit the corner of it sometimes she leaned her cheek upon it sometimes she tapped the blottingpad with the penhandle very much as if she had no particular interest in what she was doing or else she was very doubtful about the wisdom of it presently she took some pennies from a small purse and rising took her letters with her with the evident intention of posting them appleton rose too lifting his pile of correspondence and followed close at her heels she went to the office laid down threepence with her letters turned saw fergus appleton with the physical eye but looked directly through him as if he were a man of glass and poor quality of glass at that and sauntered upstairs as if she were greatly bored with life however the top letter of her three was addressed very plainly to the bishop of bath and wells and fergus appleton had known the bishop and the bishops wife for several years accordingly the postbag that night held two letters addressed to the bishops palace and there was every prospect of an immediate answer to one of them iv as for the country roundabout the bexley sands inn it is one of the loveliest in devonshire it does not waste a moment but realizing the brevity of weekend visits and the anxiety of tourists to see the greatest amount of scenery in the shortest space it begins its duty at the very door of the inn and goes straight on from one stretch of loveliness to another if you have been there you remember that if you turn to the right and go over the stone bridge that crosses the sleepy river you are in the very heart of beauty you pick your way daintily along the edge of the road for it is carpeted so thickly with seapinks and yellow and crimson crowsfoot that you scarcely know where to step seapoppies there are too groves of them growing in the sandy stretches that lie close to and border the wide shingly beach in summer the long low narrow stone bridge crosses no water but just here is an acre or two of tall green rushes you walk down the bank a few steps and sit under the shadow of a wall the green garden of rushes stretches in front of you with a still shallow pool between you and it a pool floating with blossoming waterweeds on the edge of the rushes grow tall yellow irises in great profusion the cuckoos note sounds in the distance the sun the warmth the intoxication of color make you drowsy and you lean back among the green things close your eyes and then begin listening to the wonderful music of the rushes a million million reeds stirred by the breeze bend to and fro making a faint silken sound like that of a summer wave lapping the shore but far more ethereal thomasina tucker went down the road laden with books soon after breakfast monday morning appleton waited until after the post came in and having received muchdesired letters and observed with joy the weekenders setting forth hither and thither on their return journeys followed what he supposed to be miss tuckers route at least it was her route on saturday and sunday and he could not suppose her to harbor caprice or any other feminine weakness yes there she was in the very loveliest nook the stone wall at her back and in front nice sandy levels for books and papers and writingpad miss tucker may i invade your solitude for a moment our mutual friend the bishop of bath and wells has written asking me to look you up as a fellow countryman and see if i can be of any service to you so far away from home tommy looked up observed a goodlooking american holding a letter in one hand and lifting a hat with the other and bade him welcome how kind of the bishop but he is always doing kind things his wife too i have seen much of them since i came to england my name is appleton fergus appleton at your service wont you take a stone or make yourself a hollow in the sand asked tommy hospitably i came out here to read and study and get rid of the weekenders isnt bexley sands a lovely spot and do you ever get tired of the bacon and the kippered herring and the fruit tarts with devonshire cream i cant bear to begin an acquaintance with a lady by differing on such vital points but i do get tired of these bexley delicacies perhaps you have been here too long or have you just come this morning appleton swallowed his disappointment and hurt vanity and remarked no i came on friday he laid some emphasis on friday the evening train is so incorrigibly slow i only reached the hotel at ten oclock when i arrived on thursday night miss tucker shot a rapid glance at the young man as she made this remark i came by the morning express and arrived here at three on friday said appleton miss tucker with a slight display of perhaps legitimate temper turned suddenly upon him there i have been trying for two minutes to find out when you came and now i know you were at my beastly concert on friday evening i certainly was and very grateful i am too i suppose all through my life people will be turning up who were in that room said miss tucker ungraciously i must tell somebody what i feel about that concert i should prefer some one who wasnt a stranger but you are a great deal better than nobody do you mind appleton laughed like a boy and flung his hat a little distance into a patch of seapinks not a bit use me or abuse me as you like so long as you dont send me away for this was my favorite spot before you chose it for yours i live in new york and i came abroad early in the summer began tommy i know that already interrupted appleton oh i suppose the bishop told you no i came with you that is i was your fellow passenger did you why i never saw you on the boat my charms are not so dazzling that i expect them to be noted and remembered laughed appleton it is true i was very tired and excited and full of anxieties said tommy meekly dont apologize if you tried for an hour you couldnt guess just why i noticed and remembered you i conclude then it was not for my dazzling charms tommy answered saucily it was because you wore the only flower i ever notice one that is associated with my earliest childhood i never knew a woman to wear a bunch of mignonette before some one sent it to me i remember and it had some hideous scarlet pinks in the middle i put the pinks in my room and pinned on the mignonette because it matched my dress i am very fond of green my mother loved mignonette we always had beds of it in our garden and pots of it growing in the house in winter i can smell it whenever i close my eyes tommy glanced at him she felt something in his voice that she liked something that attracted her and wakened an instantaneous response but go on he said i only know as yet that you sailed from new york in the early summer as i did well i went to london to join a great friend a singer helena markham have you heard of her no is she an american yes a western girl from montana with oh such a magnificent voice and such a big talent the outward sweep of tommys hands took in the universe weve had some heavenly weeks together i play accompaniments and i know you do i forgot for the moment how much too much you know i went with her to birmingham and manchester and leeds and liverpool i wasnt really grand enough for her but the audiences didnt notice me helena was so superb in between i took some lessons of henschel he told me i hadnt much voice but very nice brains i am always called intelligent and no one can imagine how i hate the word it is offensive but not so bad as some others i for example have been called a conscientious writer oh are you a writer of a sort yes but as you were saying as i was saying everything was going so beautifully until ten days ago when helenas people cabled her to come home her mother is seriously ill and cannot live more than a few months she went at once but i couldnt go with her not very well in midsummer and so here i am all alone high and dry she leaned her chin in the cup of her hand and looking absentmindedly at the shimmering rushes fell into a spell of silence that took no account of appleton to tell the truth he didnt mind looking at her unobserved for a moment or two he had almost complete control of his senses and he didnt believe she could be as pretty as he thought she was there was no reason to think that she was better to look at than an outandout beauty her nose wasnt greek it was just a trifle faulty but it was piquant and full of mischief there was nothing to be said against her mouth or her eyelashes which were beyond criticism and he particularly liked the way her darkbrown hair grew round her temples and her ears but the quality in her face that appealed most to appleton was a soft and touching youthfulness suddenly she remembered herself and began again miss markham and i had twice gone to large seaside hotels with great success but of course she had a manager and a reputation i thought i would try the same thing alone in some very quiet retreat and see if it would do oh wasnt it funny here she broke into a perfectly childlike fit of laughter it was such a wellbehaved solemn little audience that never gave me an inkling of its liking or its loathing oh yes it did remonstrated appleton they loved your scotch songs silently cried tommy i had dozens and dozens of other things upstairs to sing to them but i thought i was suiting my programme to the place and the people i looked at them during luncheon and made my selections you are flattering the weekenders i believe you are musical she ventured looking up at him as she played with a tuft of seapinks i am passionately fond of singing so i seldom go to concerts he answered somewhat enigmatically your programme was an enchanting one to me it was good of its kind if the audience would have helped me and tommys lip trembled a little but perhaps i could have borne that if it hadnt been for the plate not a pleasant custom and a new one to me said appleton and to me here she made a little grimace of disgust i knew beforehand i had to face the plate but the contents where did you sit i was forced to stay a trifle in the background i entered so late it was your minstrel boy that dragged me out of my armchair in the lounge then perhaps you saw the plate i know by your face that you did you saw the sixpences which i shall never forget and the pennies which i will never forgive i thirst for the blood of those who put in pennies they would all have been sitting in boiling oil since friday if i had had my way responded appleton tommy laughed delightedly i know now who put in the sovereign i knew every face in that audience that wasnt difficult in so small a one and i tried and tried to fix the sovereign on any one of them and couldnt at last i determined that it was the old gentleman who went out in the middle of allan water feeling that he would rather pay anything than stay any longer confess it was you appleton felt very sheepish as he met tommys dancing eyes and heightened color i couldnt bear to let you see those pennies he stammered but i couldnt get them out before the page came to take the plate perhaps you were pound foolish and the others were penny wise but it was awfully nice of you if i can pay my bill here without spending that sovereign i believe ill keep it for a lucky piece i shall be very rich by saturday night anyway a legacy due goodness no i havent a relation in the world except one who disapproves of me not so much as i disapprove of him however no albert spalding and donald tovey have engaged me for a concert in torquay i have some business in torquay which will keep me there for a few days on my way back to wells said appleton nonchalantly the bishops letter had been a pure and undefiled source of information on all points why how funny i hope youll be there on saturday therell be no plate tickets two and six to seven and six but you shall be my guest my sovereign guest i am going to wells myself to stay till till i make up my mind about a few things america next inquired appleton keeping his voice as colorless as possible i dont know helena made me resign my church position in brooklyn and for the moment my career is undecided she laughed but her eyes denied the mirth that her lips affirmed and appleton had such a sudden illogical desire to meddle with her career to help or hinder it to have a hand in it at any rate that he could hardly hold his tongue the torquay concert will be charming i hope you know what spaldings violinplaying is and donald tovey is a young genius at pianoplaying and composing he is going to accompany me in some of his own songs and he wants me to sing a group of american ones macdowell chadwick nevin mrs beach and margaret lang i hope youll accompany yourself in some of your own ballads no the occasion is too grand unless they should happen to like me very much then i could play for myself and sing allan water or believe me or early one morning or barbara allen appleton wondered if a claque of sizable trustworthy boys could be secured in torquay and under his intelligent and inspired leadership carry miss thomasina tucker like a cork on the wave of success wouldnt it be lunchtime asked miss tucker after a slight pause it is always time for something when im particularly enjoying myself grumbled appleton looking at his watch its not quite one oclock must we go in oh yes weve ten minutes walk and tommy scrambled up and began to brush sand from her skirts couldnt i sit at your table under the chaperonage of the bishop of bath and wells and appleton got on his feet and collected tommys books the girls laugh was fullhearted this time certainly not she said what does bexley sands know of the bishop and his interest in us but if you can find the drawingroom utterly deserted at any time ill sing for you how about a teabasket and a walk to gray rocks at four oclock asked appleton as they strolled toward the hotel charming and i love singing out of doors without accompaniment im determined to earn that sovereign in course of time are you from new england yes and you oh im from new york i was born in a row of brownstone fronts in a numbered street twentyfive or thirty houses to a block all exactly alike i wonder how ive outlived my start and you in the country bless it in the eastern part of massachusetts we had a garden and my mother and i lived in it during all the months of my life that matter thats where the mignonette grew and he planted a garden eastward in eden quoted tommy half to herself its the only eden i ever knew do you like it over here miss tucker or are you homesick now that your friend is in america oh im never homesick for the reason that i have never had any home since i was ten years old when i was left an orphan i havent any deep roots in new york its like the ocean too big to love i respect and admire the ocean but i love a little river you know the madeover aphorism the home is where the hat is for hat read trunk and you have my case precisely thats because you are absurdly riotously young it wont suit you forever does anything suit one forever asked tommy frivolously not cynically but making appleton a trifle uncomfortable nevertheless anything except singing i mean perhaps you feel the same way about writing you havent told me anything about your work and ive confided my past history present prospects and future aspirations to you theres not so much to say it is good work and it is growing better i studied architecture at the beauxarts i do artcriticism and i write about buildings chiefly that would seem rather dull to a warbler like you not a bit doesnt somebody say that architecture is frozen music i dont get as immediate response to my work as you do to yours no but you never had sixpences and pennies put into your plate now give me my books please ill go in at the upper gate alone and run upstairs to my room you enter by the lower one and go through the lounge where the guests chiefly congregate waiting for the opening of the diningroom au revoir when tommy opened her bedroom door she elevated her pretty impertinent little nose and sniffed the air it was laden with a delicate perfume that came from a huge bunch of mignonette on the table it was longstemmed fresh and moist loosely bound together and every one of its tiny brown blossoms was sending out fragrance into the room it did not need fergus appletons card to identify the giver but there it was what a nice kind understanding person he is and how cheerful it makes life to have somebody from your own country taking an interest in you and liking your singing and hating those beastly pennies and tommy quickly merging artist in woman slipped on a coatee of dullgreen crкpe over her old black taffeta and taking down her hat with the garland of mignonette from the shelf in her closet tucked some of the green sprays in her belt and went down to luncheon she didnt know where fergus appletons table was but she would make her seat face his then she could smile thanks at him over the mulligatawny soup or the filet of sole or the boiled mutton or the apple tart even the bishop of bath and wells couldnt object to that v their friendship grew perceptibly during the next two days though constantly under the espionage of the permanent guests of the bexley sands inn but on wednesday night miss tucker left for torquay according to schedule fergus appleton remained behind partly to make up arrears in his literary work and partly as a sop to decency and common sense he did not deem it either proper or dignified to escort the young lady on her journey particularly as he had not been asked to do so so he pined in solitary confinement at bexley until saturday morning when he followed her to the scene of her labors after due reflection he gave up the idea of the claque and rested tommys case on the knees of the gods where it transpired that it was much safer for torquay liked tommy and the concert went off with enormous йclat from the moment that miss thomasina tucker appeared on the platform the audience looked pleased she wore a quaint dress of white flounced chiffon with a girdle of green and a broad white hat with her old mignonette garland made into two little nosegays perched on either side of the transparent brim she could not wear the mignonette that appleton had sent to her dressingroom because she would have been obscured by the size of the offering but she carried as much of it as her strength permitted and laid the fragrant bouquet on the piano as she passed it a poem had come with it but tommy did not dare read it until the ordeal was over for no one had ever written her a poem before it had three long verses and was signed fa that was all she had time to note a longhaired gentleman sitting beside appleton remarked to his neighbor the girl looks like a flower its a pity she has such a heathenish name why didnt they call her hope or flora or egeria or cecilia when the audience found that miss tuckers singing did not belie her charming appearance they cast discretion to the winds and loved her appleton himself marveled at the beauty of her performance as it budded and bloomed under the inspiration of her fellow artists and the favor of the audience and the more he admired the more depressed he became she may be on the threshold of a modest career of a sort after all he thought and she will never give it up for me would she be willing to combine me with the career and how would it work i shouldnt be churl enough to mind her singing now and then but it seems to me i couldnt stand tours besides hers is such a childlike winsome fragrant little gift it ought not to be exploited like a great booming talent the audience went wild over donald toveys songs he played and tommy sang them from memory and it seemed as if they had been written then and there struck off at white heat as if the composer happened to be at the piano and the singer chanced with his help to be interpreting those particular verses for that particular moment his setting of jock ohazeldean proved irresistible they sought her baith by bower an ha the ladie was not seen and then with a swirl and a torrent of sound a clangor of sword and a clatter of hoofs shes oer the border and awa wi jock o hazeldean appleton didnt see any valid reason why tovey should kiss tommys hand in responding to the third recall but supposed it must be a composers privilege and wished that he were one then the crowd made its way into the brilliant torquay sunshine and appleton lingered in the streets until the time came for the teaparty arranged for the artists at the hotel it was a gay little gathering assisted by a charming lady of the town who always knew the celebrated people who flock there in all seasons spalding and tovey were the lions but miss thomasina tucker did not lack for compliments her cheeks glowed and her eyes sparkled under the white tulle brim of her hat her neck looked deliciously white and young rising from its transparent chiffons and her bunch of mignonette gave a note of delicate distinction the longhaired gentleman was present and turned out to be a local poet he told miss tucker that she ought never to wear or to carry another flower not at all events till you pass thirty he said you belong together you your songs and the mignonette at which she flung a shy upward glance at appleton saying it is this american friend who has really established the connection though i have always worn green and white and always loved the flower you sent me some verses mr appleton she said as the poet moved away i have them safe and she touched her bodice but i havent had a quiet moment to read them just a little tribute appleton answered carelessly are you leaving if so ill get your flowers into a cab and drive you on no i am going quite unexpectedly to exeter tonight let us sit down in this corner a moment and ill tell you mr tovey has asked me to substitute for a singer who is ill the performance is on monday and i chance to know the cantata i shall not be paid but it will be a fine audience and it may lead to something after all its not out of my way in going to wells arent you overtired to travel any more tonight no i am treading air i have no sense of being in the body at all mrs cholmondeley that darkhaired lady you were talking with a moment ago lives in exeter and will take me to her house and how nice that i dont have to say goodbye for you still mean to go to wells oh yes i havent nearly finished with the cathedral i shall be there before you can i look up lodgings or do anything for you oh no thank you i shall go to the old place where miss markham and i lived before the bishop and mrs kennion sent us there because there is a piano and the old ladies being deaf dont mind musical lodgers didnt the concert go off beautifully such artists those two men so easy to do ones best in such company it was a triumph doesnt it completely efface the memory of the plate and the pennies yes tommy answered i bear no illwill to any living creature the only flaw is my horrid name cant you think of another for me ive just had an anonymous note hear it taking it from her glove dear madam the name of thomasina tucker is one of those bizarre americanisms that pain us so frequently in england i fancy you must have assumed it for public use and if so i beg you will change it now before you become too famous the grotesque name of thomasina tucker belittles your exquisite art very truly yours a well wisher what do you think of that appleton laughed heartily and scanned the note it is from some doddering old woman he said the name given you by your sponsors in baptism to be condemned as a bizarre americanism i cannot think why the loyalty of my dear mother and father to tucker and to thomas should have made them saddle me with such a handicap they might have known i was going to sing for i bawled incessantly from birth to the age of twelve months i shall have to change my name and you must help me to choose au revoir and she darted away with a handshake and a friendly backward glance from the door can i think of another name for her apostrophized appleton to himself can feminine unconsciousness and cruelty go farther than that another name for her shrieks from the very housetops and i agree with well wisher that she ought to take it before she becomes too famous before it would be necessary for instance to describe her as madame tuckerappleton vi these are the verses to miss tommy tucker with a bunch of mignonette a garden and a yellow wedge of sunshine slipping through and there beside a bit of hedge forgetmenots so blue bright fouroclocks and spicy pinks and sweet oldfashioned roses with daffodils and crocuses and other fragrant posies and in a corner neath the shade by flowering apple branches made grew mignonette i do not know i cannot say why when i hear you sing those bygone days come back to me and in their long train bring to mind that dear old garden with its hovering honeybees and liquidthroated songsters on the blossomladen trees nor why a fragrance fresh and rare should on a sudden fill the air of mignonette your memry seems a garden fair of oldtime flowers of song there annie laurie lives and loves and mary morison and blackeyed susan alice grey phillida with her frown and barbara allen false and fair from famous scarlet town what marvel such a garland rare should breathe sweet odors on the air like mignonette f a vii there was never such a summer of enchanting weather as that particular summer in wells the whole population of somersetshire save those who had crops requiring rain were in a heaven of delight from morning till night miss tommy tucker was very busy with some girl pupils and as accompanist for oratorio practice but there were blissful hours when she studied the cathedral with fergus appleton watching him sketch the stately central tower or the lady chapel or the chain gate there were afternoon walks to tor hill winding up almost daily with tea at the palace for the bishop and his wife were miracles of hospitality to the two americans fergus appleton had declared the state of his mind and heart to mrs kennion a few days after his arrival though after his confidence had been received she said that it was quite unnecessary as she had guessed the entire situation the moment she saw them together if you do it is more than miss tucker does said appleton for i cant flatter myself that she suspects in the least what i am about you havent said anything yet my dear mrs kennion ive known her less than a fortnight its bad enough for a man to fall in love in that absurd length of time but i wouldnt ask a girl to marry me on two weeks acquaintance it would simply be courting refusal i am glad you feel that way about it for we have grown greatly attached to miss tucker said the bishops wife she is so simple and unaffected so lovable and such good company so alone in the world yet so courageous and independent i hope it will come out all right for your dear mothers son she added affectionately with a squeeze of her kind hand miss tucker is dining here tomorrow and you must come too for she has offered to sing for our friends everybody agreed that mrs kennions party for the young american singer was a delightful and memorable occasion she gave them song after song accompanying herself on the erard grand piano at which she always made such a pretty picture it drifted into a request programme and tommy whose memory was inexhaustible seemed always to have the wishedfor song at the tip of her tongue were it english scotch irish or welsh there was general laughter and surprise when madame eriksson a norwegian lady who was among the guests asked her for a certain song of halfdan kjerulfs i only know it in its english translation tommy said and i havent sung it for a year but i think i remember it forgive me if i halt in the words i hardly know my darling what mostly took my heart unless perhaps your singing has done the greater part ive thrilled to many voices the passionate the strong but i forgot the singer and i forgot the song but theres one song my darling that i can neer forget i listened and i trembled and felt my cheek was wet it seemed my heart within me gave answer clear and low when first i heard you sing dear then first i loved you so tommy had sung the song hundreds of times in earlier years and she had not the slightest selfconsciousness when she began it but just as she reached the last four lines her eyes met fergus appletons he was seated in a far corner of the room leaning eagerly forward with one arm on the back of a chair in front of him she was singing the words to the company but if ever a man was uttering and confirming them it was fergus appleton at that moment the blindest woman could see the deafest could hear the avowal tommy caught her breath quickly looked away braced her memory and finished to the keen delight of old madame eriksson who rose and kissed her on both cheeks tommy was glad that her part of the evening was over and to cover her confusion offered to sing something of her own composing the mother goose rhyme of little tommy tucker sings for his supper arranged as an operatic recitative and aria the humor of this performance penetrated even to the remotest fastnesses of the staid cathedral circle and the palace party ended in something that positively resembled merriment a consummation not always to be reached in gatherings exclusively clerical in character the bishops coachman always drove miss tucker home and appleton always walked to his lodgings which were in the opposite direction so nothing could be done that night but he determined that another sun should not go down before he put his fate to the touch how could he foresee what the morning post would bring and deposit like an unwelcome bomb upon his breakfast tray his london publishers wanted to see him at once not only on a multitude of details concerning his forthcoming book but on a subject as they hoped of great interest and importance to him thinking it a matter of a day or so appleton scribbled notes to mrs kennion and miss tucker with whom he was to go on an excursion and departed forthwith to london everything happened in london the american publishers wanted a different title for the book and four more chapters to lengthen it to a size selling at a profit for two dollars and a half the english publishers thought he had dealt rather slightingly with a certain very interesting period and he remembered guiltily that he had been at bexley sands when he wrote the chapters in question it would take three days labor to fill up these gaps he calculated and how fortunate that miss thomasina tucker was safely entrenched in the heart of an ecclesiastical stronghold for the next month or two a town where he had not so far as he knew a single formidable rival he wrote her regarding his unexpected engagements adding with legitimate pride that one of englands foremost critics had offered to write a preface for his book then he settled to his desk and slaved at his task until it was accomplished when he departed with a beating heart for the town and county that held miss thomasina tucker in their keeping alighting at the familiar railway station he took a hansom intending to drop his portmanteau at his lodgings and go on to the palace for news but as he was driving by the deanery on the north side of cathedral green he encountered mrs kennion in her victoria she signaled him with her hand and spoke to her coachman who drew up his horses alighting from his hansom he strode forward to take her welcoming hand his face radiating the pleasure of a homecoming traveler if youll let the cabman take your luggage id like to drive you home myself i have something to tell you said mrs kennion making room for him by her side nothing has happened i hope he asked anxiously miss tucker is leaving for america tomorrow morning going away appletons tone was one of positive dismay yes it is all very sudden and unexpected sailing tomorrow exclaimed appleton taking out his watch from where how can i get there not sailing tomorrow leaving wells tomorrow on an early train and sailing saturday from southampton oh the world is not lost entirely then and appleton leaned back and wiped his forehead what has happened i ought never to have gone to london she had a cable yesterday from her brooklyn church offering her a better position in the choir but saying that they could hold it only ten days by post on the same day she received a letter from a new york friend was it a carl bothwick no a miss macleod who said that a much better position was in the market in a church where miss tucker had influential friends she was sure that if miss tucker returned immediately to sing for the committee she could secure a thousanddollar salary we could do nothing but advise her to make the effort you see did she seem determined to go no she appeared a little undecided and timid however she said frankly that though she had earned enough in england to pay her steamer passage to america and a months expenses afterward she could not be certain of continuing to do so much through a london winter if i only had a little more time to think it out she kept saying but i havent so i must go where is she now at her lodgings the bishop is detained in bath and i am dining with friends in his stead i thought you might go and take her to dinner at the swan so that she shouldnt be alone and then bring her to the palace afterward if if all is well if i have any luck two churches will be lamenting her loss tomorrow morning said fergus gloomily but she wouldnt have consented to go if she cared anything about me nonsense my dear boy you were away no selfrespecting girl would wire you to come back she was helpless even if she did care here we are shall i send a hansom back in half an hour twentyfive minutes will do it appleton answered briskly you are an angel dear lady keep your blarney i hope youll need it all for somebody else tonight good fortune dear boy viii appleton flung the contents of his portmanteau into his closet rid himself of the dust of travel made a quick change and in less than forty minutes was at the door of miss tuckers lodgings she had a little sittingroom on the first floor and his loud ratatat brought her to the door instead of the parlormaid at the unexpected sight of him she turned pale why why i thought it was the luggageman where did you come from she stammered from london an hour ago i met mrs kennion on my way from the station oh then she told you i am going home yes she told me how could you go to america without saying goodbye miss tommy she flushed and looked perilously near tears i wrote to you this morning as soon as i had decided she said i dont like to dart off in this way you can imagine but its a question of must he did not argue this with her that was a bridge to be crossed when a better understanding had been reached so as if taking the journey as an inexorable fact he said come out and dine with me somewhere and let us have a good talk im afraid i cant im eating now on a tray in my sittingroom and she waved a table napkin she was holding in her hand i am rather tired and miss scattergood gave me some bacon and an egg from the nest give the bacon to the cat and put back the egg in the nest he said coaxingly mrs kennion said dont let her eat her last dinner alone take her to the swan oh i am only in my travelingclothes and the swan is full of strangers tonight the green dragon then near the cathedral you look dressed for buckingham palace she hesitated a moment and then melted at the eagerness of his wish well then if youll wait five minutes of course ill go along to the corner and whistle a hansom from the stand dont hurry the mental processes of miss thomasina tucker had been very confused during the excitement of the last twentyfour hours that she loved fergus appleton she was well aware since the arrival of the cablegram calling her back to america up to that time she had fenced with her love parried it pricked it thrust it off drawn it back telling herself that she had plenty of time to meet the issue if it came that fergus appleton loved her she was also fairly well convinced but that fact did not always mean everything she told herself with a pitiful little attempt at worldly wisdom perhaps he preferred his liberty to any woman perhaps he did not want to settle down perhaps he was engaged to some one whom he didnt care for now but would have to marry perhaps he hadnt money enough to share with a wife perhaps he was a flirt no she would not admit that for an instant anyway she was alone in the world and the guardian of her own dignity if she could have allowed matters to drift along in the heavenly uncertainty of these last days there would have been no problem but when she was forced to wake from her delicious dream and fly from everything that held her close and warm fly during fergus appletons absence without his knowledge or consent that indeed was heartbreaking and still her pride showed her but the one course she was alone in the world and without means save those earned by her own exertions a living income was offered her in america and she must take it or leave it on the instant she could not telegraph fergus appleton in london and acquaint him with her plans as if they depended on him for solution she could only write him a warm and friendly goodbye if he loved her as much as a man ought who loved at all he had time to follow her to southampton before her ship sailed if business kept him from such a hurried journey he could ask her to marry him in a sixpenny wire reply paid if he neither came nor wired but sent a box of mignonette to the steamer with his card and bon voyage written on it she would bury something unspeakably dear and precious that had only just been born bury it and plant mignonette over it and she could always sing thank heaven for the gift of song this was tommys mood when she was packing her belongings after hearing the bishop say that appleton could not return till noon next day it had changed a trifle by the time that fergus had gone to the corner to whistle for a hansom her gray frieze jacket and skirt were right enough when she hastily slipped on a better blouse with a deep embroidered collar pinned with helena markhams parting gift of an emerald cloverleaf her gray straw hat had a becoming band of flat green leaves and she had a tinge of color nothing better for roses in the cheeks than hurrying to be ready for the right man anyway such beauty as tommy had was always there and when she came to the door she smote appletons eyes as if she were the first beam from the springing east once in the hansom they talked gayly they dared not stop indeed for when they kept on whipping the stream they forgot the depth of the waters underneath meantime the green dragon competitor of the swan had great need of their lavish and interesting patronage the swiss head waiter who was new to wells was a man of waxed mustaches and sleepless ambitions the other hotels had most of the tourists but he intended to retrieve the fortunes of his employer and bring prosperity back to the side streets he adored his vocation and would have shed his hearts blood on the altar of any diningroom of which he had charge there were nine tables placed about the large room though not more than three had been occupied in his tenure of office but all were beautifully set with flowers and bright silver and napkins in complicated foldings pasteboard cards with large black numbers from one to eight stood erect on eight of the tables and on the ninth an imposing placard bore the sign engaged in letters two inches high giving the idea that a hungry crowd was waiting to surge in and take the seats the second man trained within an inch of his life had been already kindled by the enthusiasm of his superior and shared his vigils this very evening there had been hopes deferred and sickened hearts over the indifference of the public to a menu fit for a king were there not consommй royale filet of sole maоtre dhфtel poulet en casserole pommes de terres sautйs haricots verts and a wonderful camembert a savory could be inserted in an instant and a sweet arranged in the twinkling of an eye a carriage walter prepare both flew silently to the window two ladies ah they are not alighting they wish to know if there is evening service in the cathedral a gentleman walter in a fourwheeler no he dines not he has come to request his umbrella of the porter a hansom walter ah they alight she is of an elegance unmistakable they are young married ones and will dine well hasten walter and order both sweet and savory fergus and tommy looked about the cozy room with pleasure as they entered receiving the salute of gustave and the english bow of walter as tributes to their deep unspoken hopes where will you sit miss tucker asked appleton and as he spoke his quick eye observed the engaged placard and with lightning dexterity he steered his guest toward that table there was an opening if you like not quick enough for tommy though for she had seen it and dropped into a seat several feet away declaring its position was perfect gustave put menus before his distinguished clients with a flourish and indicated the wine card as conspicuously as was consistent with good form then he paused and made mental notes of the situation ah very good very good murmured appleton you might move the flowers please they rather hide the view and bring the soup please very young married ones thought gustave summoning his slave and retiring to a point where he could watch the wine card walter brought the consommй and then busied himself at the other tables they would never be occupied but it was just as well to pretend so he set hideous colored wineglasses red green and amber at the various places and polished them ostentatiously with a clean napkin in the hope that the gentleman would experience a desire for liquid refreshment this is very jolly and very unexpected said appleton it is indeed i hope you dont miss the nestegg you mustnt call it a nestegg thats a stale thing or a china one that they leave in i dont know why for an example or a pattern or a suggestion said tommy laughing an egg from the nest is miss scattergoods phrase and it means a newlaid one oh i see well do you regret it certainly not with this sumptuous repast just beginning you always give me an appetite exclaimed appleton its a humble function but not one to be despised tommy answered mischievously fencing fencing every minute with her heart beating against her ribs like a sledgehammer walter brought the fish and solicitously freed the wine card that had somehow crept under a cover of knives and forks i beg ten thousand pardons what will you drink miss tucker we must have a drop of something to cheer us at a farewell dinner here is a vintage champagne a good honest wine that will hearten us up and leave no headache in its train i couldnt tonight mr appleton i really couldnt then i refuse to be exhilarated alone said fergus gallantly and you always have the effect of champagne on me anyway i decline to say goodbye i cant even believe it is au revoir between us we had such delightful days ahead and so many plans yes it isnt nice to make up your mind so suddenly that it turns everything topsyturvy sighed tommy i wont have any meat thank you walter looked distinctly grieved i can recommend the pulleyongcazzerole miss and theres potatoes sortey with it tommys appetite kindled at the sound of his accent and she relented yes ill have a small portion please after all when friends are together the world seems very small and when they are separated it becomes a space too vast for human comprehension i think ive heard that before but its true said appleton yes tommy answered for lack of anything better to say it seems as if we had known each other for years and it is less than three weeks was tommys contribution to the lagging conversation the bishop offered me a letter of introduction to you when he wrote me at the bexley sands inn you remember but he added in a postscript that in case of accident he was not to be held responsible rather cryptic i thought at the time a little commonburg sir asked walter it is a very fine ripe one and we have some fresh watercress commonburg miss tucker no then bring the coffee please a desperate silence fell between them they who had talked unendingly for days and evenings when walter brought the tray with the coffeepot and the two little cups appleton suddenly pushed his chair back saying let us take our coffee over by the window shall we and perhaps i may have a cigarette later dont light the gas waiter we want to see the hills and the afterglow there was no avoiding it appleton and the waiter conveyed tommy helplessly over to a table commanding the view and the sunset and it was the one on which the huge engaged placard reared itself persuasively and suggestively we shall need nothing more waiter you may go i think this will cover the bill and scorning the chair opposite tommy appleton seated himself beside her you have turned your back to the afterglow she said as she reached forward to move engaged to a position a trifle less obvious i dont care tuppence about the afterglow and appleton covered her hand with his own make it come true dear dear tommy make it come true what she asked between a smile and a tear the placard dear the placard if you should travel the world over you couldnt find a man who loves you as i do what would be the use in my traveling about to find another man when i am so satisfied with this one whispered tommy oh remember they may come back at any moment i will i will if only i may have the comfort of holding your hand after all my miserable doubts i never knew what companionship meant before i met you i never really cared about life until now i have always cared about it but never like this confessed tommy you see i have always been alone ever since i grew up and i how wonderful of fate to bring us together and will you let me cable to the churches that you cannot come home just yet you think id better not go so soon without me never you shall go anywhere you like any time you like so long as you take me with you well settle all those things tomorrow the blessedest day that ever dawned thats what tomorrow will be couldnt you marry me tomorrow tommy certainly not at any rate not in the morning said tommy mischievously withdrawing her hand and moving out of the danger zone and you must remember that your talent is your own to use as you like appleton continued after a wellfilled pause your voice is a unique and precious gift ill try not to be selfish with it or jealous of it though if it had half the effect on other men that it has upon me the floor would be strewn with broken hearts every time you sing and he hummed under his breath i hardly know my darling what mostly took my heart unless perhaps your singing has done the greater part oh you dear absurdity said tommy twinkling and sparkling enchantingly i wish the waiter wouldnt come in every time i want to say something especially private confound his politics frustrate his knavish tricks but we shall soon be out of his reach spinning along to the palace are we going there oh i shall be afraid to tell the bishop and mrs kennion you neednt be i told mrs kennion this afternoon that i loved you to distraction if the bishop is back from bath shell have passed on the information by now i was just going to say when the waiter came so near that it isnt the public i love its the singing just to sing and sing thats what i long to do and what you shall do so help me you know you wanted me to find a new name for you wasnt i clever to think of appleton very and youre kindly freeing me of half of my bizarre americanism as my torquay correspondent called it how shall we deal with thomasina well call her tommy a darling kissable little name tommy no im not going to do anything you dont think its cowardly of me to marry you cowardly yes when i havent actually proved that i can earn my living at least i havent done it long enough or well enough yet i think its brave of you to marry me brave to turn your back on a possible career its not the careering that i love though it will seem very strange when tommy tucker doesnt have to sing for her supper shall we go the waiter is coming in again i believe he thinks we are going to run off with the spoons so we are at least when we go the spoons will go i know its a poor joke but i am too happy to be brilliant call the head waiter please this to walter who despaired of ever getting rid of his guests and was agreeably disappointed that a gentleman who had not ordered wine should ask for gustave appleton took the engaged placard off the table and used it nonchalantly as a fan in crossing the room then as he drew near the men he slipped two gold pieces into tommys hand may i carry away this placard waiter he asked as if it were quite a sane request ive taken a fancy to it as a souvenir of a most delightful and memorable dinner assuredly assuredly murmured gustave he knew that there was romance in the air although he did not perceive the exact point of appletons request the young lady will reward you for your courtesy no ill help with her jacket thank you tommy overcome with laughter and confusion and blushes pressed the gold pieces into the hands of the astonished waiters who bowed almost to the floor you are always giving me sovereigns dear fergus she whispered with a laugh and something like a sob as they drove along in the delicious nearness provided by the hansom never mind said fergus you will be giving me one when you marry me the turningpoint not far from the village of bonny eagle on the west bank of the saco stood two little lowroofed farmhouses the only two that had survived among others of the same kind that once dotted the green brink of the river long years before in or thereabouts there had been a cluster of log houses on this very spot known then as the dalton right settlement and these in turn had been succeeded at a later date by the more comfortable frameroof farmhouses of the period in the old days before the sound of the axe for the first time disturbed the stillness of the forest the otter swam in the shadowy coves near the shore and the beaver built his huts near by the red deer came down to dip his antlers and cool his flanks in the still shallows the speckled grouse sat on her nest in the low pine boughs while her mate perched on the mossy logs by the riverside unmolested the sokokis built their bark wigwams here and there on the bank paddling their birch canoes over the rivers smooth surface or threading the foamy torrents farther down its course here was the wonderful spring that fed and still feeds aunt judys brook the most turbulent little stream in the county many a moccasin track has been made in the soft earth around the neverfailing fountain and many the wooden bucket lowered into its crystal depths by the dalton righters when in their turn they possessed the land the day of the indian was over now and the day of the farmer who succeeded him was over too the crash of the loom and the whir of the spinningwheel were heard no longer but amanda dalton spinster descendant of the original tristram dalton to whom the claim belonged sat on alone in her house and not far away sat caleb kimball sole living heir of the original caleb himself a dalton righter and contemporary of tristram dalton neither of these personages took any interest in pedigree or genealogy they knew that their ancestors had lived and died on the same acres now possessed by them but the acres had dwindled sadly and the ancestors had seemingly left little for which to be grateful indeed in calebs case they had been a distinct disadvantage since the local sense of humor proverbially strong in york county had always preserved a set of kimball stories among its most cherished possessions some of them might have been forgotten in the century and a half that had elapsed if the caleb of our story had not been the inheritor of certain family traits famous in their day and generation caleb the first had been the cuss of his fellow farmers because in coming from scarboro to join the dalton righters he had brought whiteweed with the bundle of hay for his cattle when he was clearing the land the soil of this particular region must have been especially greedy for and adapted to this obnoxious grasskiller for it flourished as in no other part of the county flourishes yet indeed though if one can forget that its presence means poor feed for cattle where might be a crop of juicy hay the blossoming fields of the old dalton settlement look in early june the loveliest most ethereal in new england there a million million feathery daisies sway and dance in the breeze lifting their snowy wheels to the blue june sky there they grow and thrive the slender green stalks tossing their pearly disks among sister groves of buttercups till the eye is fairly dazzled with the symphony of white and gold the backaching farmers of the original dalton settlement had indeed tried to root out the lovely pests but little did our caleb care if he had ever trod his ancestral acres either for pleasure or profit he might in time have stomped out the whiteweed so the neighbors said for he had the family foot the size of an anvil but he much preferred a sedentary life and the whiteweed went on seeding itself from year to year caleb was tall loosejointed and black as a thundercloud the swarthy skin like the big foot having been bequeathed to him by the original caleb whose longlegged shaggyhaired sons had been known as calebs colts tall and black all of them the colts so black that the village wits said the kimball children must have eaten smut and soot and drunk cinder tea during the years their parents were clearing the land tall and black also were all the kimball daughters so tall it was their boast to be able to look out over the tops of the window curtains and proud enough of their height to cry with rage when any rival amazon came into the neighborhood whatever else they were or were not however the kimballs had always been industrious and frugal it had remained for the last scion of the old stock to furnish a byword for slackness in a village where stories of outlandish ungodly or supernatural laziness were sacredly preserved from year to year caleb kimballs indolence easily took the palm his hay commonly went to seed in the field his cow yielded her mornings milk about noon and her evening mess was taken from her when she was lucky by the light of a lantern he was a bachelor of fortyfive dwelt alone had no visitors and made his living such as it was off the farm with the help of a rackobones horse he had fifty acres of timberland and when his easygoing methods of farming found him without money he simply sold a few trees the house and barn were gradually falling into ruins the farm implements stood in the yard all winter and the sleigh all summer the gate flapped on its hinges the fences were broken down and the stone walls were full of gaps his pipe and a snarling roughhaired dog were his only companions hour after hour he sat on the side steps looking across the sloping meadows that separated his place from amanda daltons hour after hour he puffed his pipe and gazed on the distant hills and the sparkling river gazed and gazed whether he saw anything or thought anything remembered anything or even dreamed anything nobody could guess not even amanda dalton who was good at guessing having very few other mental recreations to keep her motherwit alive caleb kimball as seen on his doorstep from amanda daltons sink window was but a speck to be sure but he was her nearest neighbor if a person whose threshold you never cross and who never crosses yours can be called a neighbor there were seldom or never meetings or greetings between the two yet each unconsciously was very much alive to the existence of the other in days or evenings of solitude one can make neighbors of very curious things the smoke of amandas morning fire cried shame to calebs when it issued languidly from his kitchen chimney an hour later amandas smoke was like herself and betokened the brisk fire she would be likely to build calebs showed wet wood poor draught a fallen brick in the chimney later on in the morning calebs dog would sometimes saunter down the road and have a brief conversation with amandas cat they were neither friends nor enemies but merely enlivened a deadly dull existence with a few casual remarks on current topics once caleb had possessed a flock of hens but in the course of a few years they had dwindled to one lonely rooster who stalked gloomily through the wilderness of misplaced objects in the kimball yard and wondered why he had been born amanda pitied him and flung him a surreptitious handful of corn from her apron pocket when she met him walking dejectedly in the road halfway between the two houses so encouraged he extended his rambles and one afternoon amanda looking out of her window saw him stop at her gate and hold a tкteаtкte with one of her plymouth rock hens the interview was brief but effective in a twinkling he had told her of his miserable life and his abject need of sympathy there are times he said when i give you my word i would rather be stewed for dinner than lead my present existence it is weak for me to trouble you with my difficulties but you have always understood me from the first say no more she replied i am a woman and pity is akin to love the fowls of amanda daltons flock do not need me as you do eleven eggs a day are laid here regularly and i will go where my egg will be a daily source of pleasure and profit the coop is draughty and the corn scarce confessed the rooster doing his best to be noble i am of the sex created especially to supply companionship returned the hen therefore i will accompany you regardless of personal inconvenience amanda saw the departure of the eloping couple and pursued them not land sakes she exclaimed if any male thing hereabouts has sprawl enough to go courtin im willin to encourage em shell miss her clean house and good food i guess but i aint sure shes womenfolks after all and i shouldnt wonder a mite but shed take real comfort in makin things pleasanter up there for that pindlin godforsaken old rooster shell have her hands full but there i know what tis to get along with empty ones there were not many such romances or comedies as these to enliven amandas mornings then afternoon would slip into twilight darkness would creep over the landscape and amandas light clear steady bright serene would gleam from its place on the sink shelf through the kitchen window over the meadow up to kimballs it was such a light as would stream from a welltrimmed lamp with a crystal clean chimney but it met with small response from its neighbors light during many months of the year in late autumn and winter there would be a fugitive candle gleam upstairs in the kimball house and on stormy evenings a dull smoky light in the livingroom from the illumination in the dalton sink window caleb thought amanda sat in the kitchen evenings but she didnt she said she kept the second light there because she could afford it and because the cat liked it the cat enjoyed the black haircloth sofa in the sittingroom afternoons but she greatly preferred the kitchen for evening use it made a change and the highbacked cushioned rocker was then vacant amanda had nobody to consider but the cat so she naturally deferred to her in every possible way it was bad for the cats character but at least it kept amanda from committing suicide so what would you here was a woman of insistent unflagging unending activity amanda dalton had energy enough to attend to a husband and six children cook wash iron churn sew nurse and she lived alone with a cat the village was a mile and her nearest female neighbor the widow thatcher a halfmile away she had buried her only sister in lewiston years before and she had not a relation in the world all her irrepressible zeal went into the conduct of her house and plot of ground day after day week after week year after year the established routine was carried through first the washing of the breakfast dishes and the putting to rights of the kitchen which was radiantly clean before she began upon it next her bedroom the stirringup of the cornhusk mattress the shaking of the bed of live geese feathers the replacing of cotton sheets homespun blankets and blueandwhite counterpane next came the sittingroom with its tall red flagbottomed chairs its twoleaved table its light stand that held the bible and workbasket and lamp the chest of drawers and tall clock were piously dusted and the frames of the family register napoleon crossing the alps and maidens welcoming washington in the streets of alexandria were carefully wiped off once a week the parlor was cleaned the tarlatan was lifted from the two plaster samuels on the mantelpiece their kneeling forms were cleaned with a damp cloth the tarlatan replaced and the parlor closed again reverently there was kindling to chop wood to bring in the modest cooking washing ironing and sewing to do the flowerbeds to weed and the little vegetable garden to keep in order but amanda had a quick foot a neat hand a light touch and a peculiar faculty of turning off work so that it simply would not last through the day why did she never think of going to the nearest city and linking her powers with those of some one who would put them to larger uses simply because no one ever did that sort of thing in bonny eagle in those days girls crowded out of home by poverty sought employment here and there but that a woman of forty with a good home and ten acres of land to say nothing of coupon bonds that yielded a hundred dollars a year in cash that such a one should seek a larger field in a strange place would have been thought flying in the face of providence as well as custom outside bonny eagle in the roar and din and clamor of cities were all sorts of wrongs that needed righting wounds that cried out to be healed there were motherless children there were helpless sufferers moaning for the sight of a green field but the superfluous females of amanda daltons day had not awakened to any sense of responsibility with regard to their unknown brothers and sisters amanda was a largehearted woman she would have shared her soda biscuit her bean soup her dandelion greens her hogshead cheese her boiled dinner her custard pie with any hungry mortal but no one in bonny eagle needed bite nor sup therefore she featherstitched her dishtowels piled her kindling in a wheel pattern in the shed named her hens and made friends of them put fourteen tucks in her unbleached cotton petticoats and fried a pancake every saturday for her cat its either that or blow your brains out if youve got a busy mind she said grimly to susan benson her best friend who was passing a saturday afternoon with her it was chilly and they liked the cheerful warmth of the saturday fire that was baking the beans and steaming the brown bread susan unrolled her patchwork and giving a flip to the cat with her thimble finger settled herself comfortably in the kitchen rocker the cat leaped down and stalked into the next room with an air of offended majesty as much as to say of all the manners i ever saw that woman has the worst she contrives to pass by three empty chairs and choose the one i chance to be occupying you wouldnt be so lonesome if you could see a bit of life from your house mandy said mrs benson william an i were sayin last night youd ought to move into the village winters though nothin could be handsomer than the view from your sink window this minute daisies daisies everywhere how do you manage to keep em out o your place mandy when theyre so thick on caleb kimballs i just root an root an keep on rootin amanda responded cheerfully though i dont take a mite o pride out of it for the better my place looks the worse his does by comparison it is a sight said mrs benson standing for a moment by the sink and looking up to kimballs i went up there one night after dark when i knew caleb d gone to hixam an i patched up some o the holes in his stone wall thinkin his whiteweed seeds wouldnt blow through quite so thick and amanda joined mrs benson at the window id a done a days work on his side o the wall as lief as not only i knew folks would talk if they saw me land no they wouldnt mandy everybody knows you wouldnt take him if he was the last man on earth an as for caleb i guess he wouldnt marry any woman above ground not if she was a seraphim i used to think hed spunk up some time or other when he got over his mothers death but its too late now im afraid caleb set great store by his mother thats one good thing about him said amanda he did for certain agreed mrs benson if that girl he was engaged to hadnt a spoken disrespectful to her in his hearin thered a been a wife an children up there now an the place would a looked diffrent not so very diffrent he didnt lose much in eliza johnson i guess he knows that by now remarked amanda serenely though i spose t was quarrelin with her that set him runnin down hill all the same i never thought he cared anything about eliza she was determined to have him an he was too lazy to say no but you see in the end she only got her labor for her pains the kimball boys never had any luck with their love affairs when caleb an his mother was left alone she was terrible anxious for him to marry she was allers findin girls for him but part of em wouldnt look at him and he wouldnt make up to any of em i was livin in lewiston those years said amanda i remember you was well when old mrs kimball broke her arm charles the youngest son that was a stagedriver determined hed get somebody for caleb for his own wife wouldnt lift her finger to help bout the house he saw a girl up to steep falls that he kind o liked the looks of an he offered her a ride down to his mothers to spend the day thinkin if the family liked her she might do for caleb however her eyes was weak an she didnt know how to milk so they thought shed better go home by train that would a been fair enough for both parties but when charles drove her to the station he charged her fifteen cents an it made an awful sight o talk she had a hot temper an she kind o resented it i dare say t want so commented amanda but everybodys dead that could deny it except caleb and he wouldnt take the trouble its one of the days when hes real drove aint it asked susan sarcastically as she looked across the field to the woodpile where a grayshirted figure sat motionless if ever a man needed a wife to patch the seat of his pants its caleb kimball i guess its the only part of his clothes he ever wears out he want like that before his mother died the wheels seemed to stop in him then an there he was queer an strange an shy but i never used to think hed develop into a reglar hermit shed turn in her grave mis kimball would to see him look as he does i dont spose he gets any proper nourishment the smartest man in the world wont take the trouble to make pie for himself yet hell eat it s long s he can stan up calebs mother was a great piebaker i can see her now shovelin em in an out o the oven saturdays with her three great black lanky boys standin roun waitin for em to cool off only one mother caleb used to say kind o wheedlinly while she laughed up at him leanin against the doorframe whats one bluebry pie amongst me he must a had some fun in him once smiled amanda they say womenfolks aint got no sense o humor remarked mrs benson with a twitch of her thread i notice the men that live without em dont seem to have any we may not amount to much but were somethin to laugh at why dont you bake him a pie now an then an send it up susan asked amanda well there i dont feel i hardly know him well enough though william does i dare say he wouldnt like it an hed never think to return the plate so far away besides there never is an extry pie in a house where theres a man an three boys which reminds me ive got to go home an make one for breakfast with nothin to make it out of i could lend you a handful o dried plums thank you ill take em an much obliged i declare it seems to me now the rhubarbs bout gone as if the apples on the trees never would fill out enough to drop off there does come a time in the early summer after youre sick of mince n squash n punkin n cranberry n rhubarb n custard n t aint time for currant or green apple or strawbry or raspbry or blackbry there does come a time when it seems as if providence might a had a little more ingenuity in plannin piefillin you might bake a pie for caleb now an then yourself mandy youre so near mrs thatcher lives half a mile away replied amanda but i couldnt carry caleb kimball a pie without her knowin it an makin remarks id bake one an willin if william d take it to him but there t would only make him want another hes made his bed an hes got to lie on it he lays on his bed sure enough an most o the time probably but do you believe he ever makes it amanda shuddered i dont know susan its one o the things that haunts me whether he makes it or whether he dont do you ever see any wash hung out mrs bensons needle stopped in midair while she waited for amandas answer yees now an then what kind sheets once a gray blanket underclothes but naturally i dont look when theyre hung out he generally puts em on the grass anyway well its a sin for a man to live so in a christian country an the kindest thing to say about him is that hes crazy some o the men folks over to the store declare he is crazy but william declares he aint he says hes asleep william kind o likes him does he ever pass the time o day with you hardly ever i meet him once or twice a year maybe in the road he bows when i go past on an errand an holds on to his dog when he tries to run out an bite me thats real kind o gentlemanly observed susan i never thought of it that way said amanda absently but perhaps it is all i can say is caleb kimballs a regular thorn in my flesh i cant do anything for him an i cant forget him right under foot as he is his land joinin mine mornin noon an night for years ive wanted to get into that mans house an make it decent for him wanted to milk the cow the right time o day feed the horse weed the garden scrub the floor wash the windows black the stove how you do go on mandy exclaimed mrs benson what diffrence does it make to you how dirty he is so longs youre clean it does make a diffrence an it always will i hate to see the daisies growin so thick knowin how he needs hay i want to root em out sames i did mine after id been away three years in lewiston i hate to take my pot o beans out o the oven saturday nights an know he aint had gumption enough to get himself a christian meal livin alone s i do susan things bulk up in my mind biggern theyd ought to they do so agreed susan an you mustnt let em you must come over to our house oftener you know william loves to have you an so do the boys the bible may insinuate we are our brothers keeper but we cant none of us help it if he wont be kept there i must be gettin home ive had considerable many reminders the last halfhour that its about time its none o my business mandy but you do spoil that cat an the times not far off when he wont be a mite o comfort to you of course im too intimate here to take offense but if the minister should happen to set in this chair when he calls an see that cat promenade round an round the rockers an then rustle off into the settinroom as mad as cuffy hed certainly take notice an think he want a welcome visitor like mistress like cat sighed amanda tristram an i get awful set in our ways kind o queer mandy namin a cat for your grandfather mrs benson observed anxiously as she opened the door william an me dont want you to get queer i aint got anything better n a cat to name for grandfather said poor amanda in a tone that set her friend susan thinking as she walked homeward the summer wore along and there came a certain tuesday different from all the other tuesdays in that year or in all the forty years that had gone before a tuesday when the kimball side door was not opened in the morning no smoke issued from the chimney all day the rooster and his kidnapped hen flew up from the steps and pecked at the door panels vigorously seven oclock in the evening came then eight and no light to be seen anywhere the dog howled the horse neighed the cow lowed ominously in the closed barn at nine oclock amanda took a lantern and sped across the field found a pail in the shed slipped into the barn milked the cow gave the beasts hay and water and leaving the pail of milk on the steps went quietly home again anxious lest she had done too much anxious also lest she had not done enough next morning she stationed herself at her kitchen window and took account of her signs the milkpail was overturned on the steps the rooster and hen perching on the rim but there was no smoke coming from the chimney she thought quickly as she did everything else she waited long enough to make a cup of coffee then she slipped out of her door and up to kimballs her apron was full of kindling and on her arm she carried a basket with a package of herbs a tiny bottle of brandy one of cologne some arrowroot and matches a cake of hard soap and a clean towel bones for the dog and corn for the hen calebs door was unlocked the dog came out of the shed evincing no desire to bark or bite the kitchen was empty and she thanked the lord silently as she gave a hasty glance about not as dreadful as she had anticipated untidy beyond words bare dreary cheerless but not repulsively dirty she stole softly through the lower part of the house and then with a beating heart went up the uncarpeted stairs at the head was an open door that showed her all she expected and feared to find the sun streamed in at the dusty uncurtained window over the motionless body of caleb kimball who lay in a strange deep sleep unconscious on the bed his hair was raven black against the pillow and the lashes on his cheeks looked more n a yard long amanda told susan benson she afterward confessed that this was a slight exaggeration due to extreme excitement she spoke his name three times but he did not stir she must get the doctor and send for william benson that was clear but first she must try her hand at improving the immediate situation stealing downstairs she tied on her apron and lighted a fire in the kitchen stove with the view of making things respectable before gossipy neighbors came in her sister used to say that the minute amanda tied on her apron things began to move and take a turn for the better and it was so now she poured a few drops of cologne into a basin of water and putting the towel over her arm went upstairs to calebs bedside ive done him wrong she thought remorsefully as she noted his decent nightclothing and bedding he aint lost his selfrespect in all these years and every soul in bonny eagle thought he was living like an animal she bathed his face and throat and hands then moistened and smoothed his hair without provoking a movement or a sound he seemed in a profound stupor but there was no stertorous breathing straightening the bedclothes and giving a hasty wipe to the tops of the pine bureau and table she opened the window and closed the blinds at this moment she spied one of the thatcher boys going along the road and ran down to the gate to ask him to send william benson and the doctor as soon as possible tell them miss dalton says please to come quick caleb kimballs very sick she said dont you need mother too asked the boy shes wanted to git into his house for years and shed do most anything for the chance no thank you said amanda pitilessly i can do everything for the present and mr benson will probably want his wife if anybody all right said the boy as he started off on a dogtrot news was rare in bonny eagle and caleb kimball was a distinguished and interesting figure in village gossip amanda dalton had never had to hurry in her life that was one of her crosses for there probably never was a woman who could do more in less time it was an hour and a half before william benson came and in those ninety minutes she had swept the kitchen and poured a pail or two of hot soapsuds over the floor that may have felt a mop but certainly had not known a scrubbingbrush for years she tore down the flyspecked tattered buff shades and washed the three windows blackened the stove fed the dog and horse milked the cow strained the milk and carried it down cellar making three trips upstairs in the meantime to find no change in the patient his lids stayed down as though they were weighted with lead his long arms lay motionless on the counterpane amandas blood coursed through her veins like lightning here was work to her hand blessed healing work for days perhaps weeks to come in these first moments of emotional excitement i fear she hoped it would be a long case of helpless invalidism during which it would be her christian duty to clean the lower part of the house and perhaps make some impression on the shed but this tempting thought was quickly banished as she reflected that caleb kimball was a bachelor and the widow thatcher the person marked out by a just but unsympathetic providence for sicknurse and housekeeper she shant come thought amanda passionately ill make the doctor ask me to take charge william benson shall stay here nights an susan will run in now an then daytimes or ill get little abby thatcher to do the rough work an keep me company then her mother wont make talk i dont know exactly whats the matter with the man confessed the doctor when he came theres a mark and a swelling on the back of his head as if he might have fallen somewhere he hasnt got any pulse and hes all skin and bone hes starved out i guess and his machinery has just stopped he wants nursing and feeding and all the things a woman can do for him the lord never intended menfolks to live alone if they aint got wit enough to find that out for themselves it aint likely any womanll take the trouble to tell em exclaimed amanda with some spirit dont get stuffy amanda just be a good christian and take hold here for a few days till we see whether weve got to have a nurse from portland mans extremity is gods opportunity maybe calebll come to his senses before he gets over this sickness i wonder if he ever had any senses said amanda plenty the doctor answered as he prepared the medicines but he hasnt used them for twenty years ill come back in an hour and fetch bill benson with me then ill stay till i can bring caleb back to consciousness we shall have to get him downstairs as soon as he can be moved it will be much easier to take care of him there the details of caleb kimballs illness would be such as fill a nurses bedside record book the mainspring of life had been snapped and the machinery refused to move for a long time when he recovered consciousness his solemn black eyes followed amanda daltons movements as if fascinated but he spoke no word save a faltering phrase or two at night to william benson meantime much had been happening belowstairs where amanda dalton reigned supreme with susan benson and abby thatcher taking turns in housework or nursing william benson was a painter by trade and amandas ingenious idea was to persuade him to paint and paper the kimball kitchen before caleb was moved downstairs this struck william as a most extraordinary and unnecessary performance israel in egypt he exclaimed whats the matter with you women i never heard o such goinson in my life i might lay abed a thousand years an nobodyd paint my premises let caleb git his strength back an then use a little elbow grease on his own house you cant teach an old dog new tricks susan pends on how old the dog is an what kind o tricks you want to teach him susan replied itd be a queer dog that wouldnt take to a clean kennel or three good meals a day stead o starvation vittles amanda says it may be a kind of a turninpoint in calebs life an she thinks wed ought to encourage him a little aint i encouragin him by sleepin on his settinroom lounge every night an givin him medicine every two hours by the alarm clock ive got my own days work to do when would i paint his kitchen id like to know we thought probably youd like to do it nights suggested his wife timidly saul in tarsus dont that beat the devil ejaculated william caleb kimball aint done a good days work for years an im to set up nights paintin his kitchen nevertheless the magnificent impertinence of the idea so paralyzed his will that he ended by putting on twelve single rolls of fawncolored paper and painting the woodwork yellow to harmonize working from eight to twelve several nights and swearing freely at his own foolishness by this time amanda had made the downstairs chamber all tidy and comfortable for the patient she had contributed a window shade and dimity curtains susan a braided rug and a chair cushion the chamber the one in which calebs mother had died opened from the kitchen and commanded an enticing view of the fresh yellow walls and shining cookstove on the day before calebs removal amanda sat on the foot of the bed and looked through the doorway with silent joy going to and fro to move a bright tin dipper into plainer view or retire a drying dishcloth to greater privacy even abby thatcher was by this time a trifle exhilarated she did not understand the situation very well being of a sternly practical nature herself but she caught the enthusiasm of the two women and scrubbed the kitchen floor faithfully every morning in order to remove the stains of years of neglect you wouldnt think your old hen d be such a fool miss dalton she said but i kind o surmised the reason shes been missin an i found her today in a corner o the haymow sittin on five eggs now wouldnt you spose at her age shed know better than to try an raise chickens in october im afraid theyll die if it should be a cold fall with nobody to look after em but maybe i can take em home to my shed an lend mr kimball another hen amandas tone was motherly i never like to break up a hens nest somehow it seems as if they must have feelins like other folks id take her off quickern scat an keep takin her off till she got some sense said abby with the chinese cruelty of sixteen well you let her be till mr kimball gets well enough to ask an i think abby you might clean up the dooryard just a little mite this mornin suggested amanda if you could straighten up the fence an find a couple of old hinges to hang the gate with it would kind o put new heart into mr kimball when hes sittin up an lookin out the window why didnt he put heart into hisself by hangin his own gate before he took sick grumbled abby reducing amanda to momentary silence by her pitiless logic why didnt he indeed echoed her heart gloomily receiving nothing in the way of answer from her limited experience of men caleb had spoken more frequently the last few days when by the combined exertions of the bensons and the doctor he had been brought down into his mothers old room amanda closed the kitchen door thinking one experience at a time was enough for a man in his weak and exhausted condition william benson couldnt see any sense in this precaution but he never did see much sense in what womenfolks did he wanted to show caleb the new paint and paper immediately and remark casually that he had done all the work while he was nightnursin the next morning amanda had seized a good opportunity to open the door between the two rooms straightway retiring to the side entry to await developments in a few moments she heard caleb moving and going in found him half sitting up in bed leaning on his elbow whats the matter with the kitchen he asked feebly staring with wideopen eyes at the unaccustomed prospect only fresh paint an paper thats williams work o god i aint worth it i aint worth it he groaned as he hid his face in the pillow have you been here all the time he asked amanda when she brought him his gruel later in the day yes off an on when i could get away from my own work who found me i did i knew by the looks somethin was wrong up here somethin wrong sure enough an always was amanda heard him mutter as he turned his face to the wall the next day he opened his eyes suddenly as she was passing through the room did you make that pie william benson brought me last month what made you think i did oh i dont know it looked an it tasted like one o yours he said closing his eyes again if you know a woman you can tell her pie somehow when had caleb kimball ever tasted any of her cooking a mysterious remark but everything he said sounded a trifle lightheaded his questions came back to her when she was waiting for william benson at twilight that same day caleb had been sleeping quietly for an hour or more amanda was standing at the stove stirring his arrowroot gruel the kitchen was still a smothered miaow and the scratching of claws on wood arrested her attention and she went hurriedly to the door tristram dalton what are you up here for away from your own home she exclaimed tristram vouchsafed no explanation of his appearance but his demeanor spoke louder than words to amandas guilty conscience as he walked in no shelter for me but the shed these days he seemed to say instead of wellserved meals a cup of milk set here or there he made the circuit of the kitchen discontentedly and finding nothing to his taste went into the adjoining room and after walking over the full length of calebs prostrate form curled himself up in a hollow at the foot of the bed ive neglected him thought amanda but his turnll come again soon enough and she bent her eyes on the gruel the blue bowl sat in the pan of hot water on the stove and she stirred and stirred slowly regularly continuously in order that the arrowroot should be of a velvety smoothness the days were drawing in and the october sun was setting very yellow sending a flood of light over her head and shoulders she wore her afternoon dress of alpaca with a worked muslin collar and cuffs and a white apron tied round her trim waist she was one of your wholesome shining women and her bright brown hair glistened like satin calebs black eyes looked yearningly at her as she stood there all unconscious doing one of her innumerable neighborly kindnesses for him she made a picture of sweet strong steady womanliness although she did not know it caleb knew something extraordinary was going on inside of him but under what impulse he was too puzzled and inexperienced to say amanda amanda turned sharply at the sound of his voice as she was lifting the steaming arrowroot out of the water whose cat is this mine come off that bed tristram dont disturb him i like to have him there wheres abby thatcher shes gone home on an errand shell be back in fifteen minutes now wheres william its only five oclock he dont come till six what can i get for you have you had a good sleep she set the gruel on the back of the stove and went in to his bedside i dont sleep much i just lie an think amanda now theyre all away if i get over this spell an take a year to straighten up an get hold o things like other folks do you think youd risk marryin me there was a moments dead silence then amanda said turning pale are you in your right mind caleb kimball i am but i dont wonder at your askin said the man humbly ive kind o fancied you for years but youve always been way down there across the fields out o reach im too amazed to think it out faltered amanda dont you think it out for gods sake or youll never do it he caught at her hand as if it had been a lifeline her kind smooth hand the helpful hand with the bit of white cambric bound round a finger burned in his service it was the kitchen that put the courage into me he went on feverishly i laid here an thought if she can make a house look so different in a week what could she do with a man i aint afraid but i could stammered amanda if the man would help not hinder just try me amanda i wouldnt need a year honest i wouldnt i could show you in three months calebs strength was waning now his head dropped forward and amanda caught it on her breast she put one arm round his shoulders to keep him from falling back while her other hand supported his head his cheek was wet and as she felt the tears on her palm mutely calling to her strength all the woman in her gathered itself together and rushed to meet the mans need if only you could take me now right off he faltered before anything happens to prevent id be good to you till the day i die i aint afraid to risk it caleb said amanda ill take you now when you need me the most well just put our two forlorn houses together an see if we can make em into a home caleb gave one choking sob of content and gratitude his hand relaxed its clasp of amandas his head dropped and he fainted william benson came in just then whats the matter he cried coming quickly toward the bed has he had a spell he was so much better last night i expected to see him settin up hell come to in a minute said amanda give me the palmleaf fan were goin to be married in a day or so an he got kind of excited talkin it over moses in the bulrushes ejaculated william benson sitting down heavily in the nearest chair william benson was not a sentimental or imaginative person and he confessed he couldnt make head nor tail out o the affair said it was the queerest an beatinest weddin that ever took place in bonny eagle didnt know when they fixed it up nor how nor why if you come to that amanda dalton had never had a beau but she was the likeliest woman in the village spite o that an caleb kimball was the onlikeliest man amanda was the smartest woman an caleb the laziest man he kind o thought amanda d married caleb so t she could clean house for him but it seemed an awful high price to pay for a job he guessed she couldnt bear to have his everlastin whiteweed seedin itself into her hayfield an the only way she could stop it was to marry him an weed it out he thought too that caleb had kind o got int the habit o watchin mandy flyin about down to her place theres nothin so fascinatin as to set still an see other folks work the critter was so busy an so diffrent from him mebbe it kind o tantalized him the widow thatcher was convinced that mandy must have gone for caleb hammer n tongs when he was too weak to hold out against her no woman in her sober senses would paper a mans kitchen for him unless she intended to get some use out of it herself we dont know what the disciples would a done she said nor the apostles nor the saints nor the archangels we only know what womenfolks would a done and there aint one above ground that would a cleaned caleb kimballs house without she expected to live in it susan benson had a vague instinct with regard to the real facts of the case but even she mustered up courage to ask amanda once how the wonderful matter came about amanda looked at mrs benson with some embarrassment for she was not good at confidences susan you an ive been brought up together gone to school together experienced religion an joined the church together an i stood up with you an william when you was married so t id speak out freer to you than i would to most i hope so im sure though i wouldnt want you to repeat anything susan taint likely i would mandy well id no sooner got caleb into a clean bed an a clean room an begun to feed him good food than i begun to like him theres things in human hearts that i aint wise enough to explain susan an i aint goin to try caleb kimball seemed to me like a man that was drownin all because there want anybody near to put a hand under his chin an keep his head out o water i didnt suspicion hed let me do it i thought hed just lie there an drown but it didnt turn out that way well it does kind o seem as if youd gone through the woods o life to pick up a crooked stick at last sighed susan though i will say now ive been under caleb kimballs roof hes an awful sight nicer man close to than he is fur off so take it all in all life an menfolks bein so uncertain an old age acreepin on first thing you know perhaps its for the best an i do hope youll make out to be happy mandy there was a quiver of real feeling in susan bensons voice though she made no movement to touch her friends hand im goin to be happy said amanda cheerfully i always did like plenty to do an now ive got it for the rest o my life i only hope you can stan his ways amandy and susans voice was still doubtful thats all im afraid of that youre so diffrent you cant never stan his ways he wont have so many ways when weve been married a spell said amanda huldah the prophetess and they went unto huldah the prophetess and communed with her huldah rumford leaned from her bedroom window as she finished plaiting her hair the crowing of the white brahma rooster had interrupted her toilet and she craned her neck impatiently until she discovered that he had come from the henyard in the rear and established himself on the doorsteps from which dominating position he was announcing his message that means company coming and i hope its true she said to herself as she looked absentmindedly in the oldfashioned looking glass with its picture of washington crossing the delaware her thoughts were evidently wandering for she took her petticoat from a hook in the closet and pulling it over her head found when she searched for the buttons in the waistband that she had it on wrongside out i dont care she exclaimed giving the unoffending garment an angry twitch but it does seem as if i was possessed i cant keep my mind on my clothes long enough to get them on straight i turned my petticoat yesterday in spite of knowing it brings bad luck but today i just wont take the chance the pink calico morning dress went on without adventure then she carefully emptied the water from the washbowl into the jar wiped it neatly and hung the towel to dry straightened the photograph of her deceased father in its blackwalnut frame shook the feather bed and tightened a sagging cord under the cornhusk mattress took the candlestick from the lightstand by her bedside and tripped down the attic stairs two at a time huldah was seventeen which is a good thing she was bewitchingly pretty which is a better thing and she was in love which is probably the best thing of all making due allowance of course for the occasions in which it is the worst possible thing that can happen to anybody mrs rumford was in the kitchen frying doughnuts for breakfast she was a comfortable figure as she stood over the brimming spider with her threepronged fork poised in the air she turned the yellow rings in the hissing fat until they were nutbrown then dropped them for a moment into a bowl of powdered sugar from which they issued the most delicious conspirators against the human stomach that can be found in the catalogue of new england cookery the table was neatly laid near the screen door that opened from the kitchen into the appleorchard a pan of buttermilk biscuits was sitting on the back of the stove and half a custard pie left from the previous nights supper held the position of honor in front of mrs rumfords seat if the pie had been cereal the doughnuts omelette and the saleratus biscuits leavened bread the plot and the course of this tale might have been different but that is neither here nor there did you hear the brahma rooster crowing on the doorstep mother asked huldah no but i aint surprised for i cant seem to keep my dishcloth in my hand this morning if ive dropped it once ive dropped it a dozen times theres company coming sure that rooster was crowin on the fence last time i seen him and hes up there agin now said little jimmy rumford with the most offensive skepticism what if he is asked his sister sharply that means fair weather and dont interfere with the sign of company coming it makes it all the more certain i bet he aint crowin about pitt packard retorted jimmy with a large joy illuminating his sunburnt face pitt aint comin home from moderation this week hes gone to work on the covered bridge up there huldahs face fell id ought to have known better than to turn my white skirt yesterday she sighed i never knew it to fail bringing bad luck i vow ill never do it again thats one o the signs i havent got so much confidence in said mrs rumford skimming the cream from a pan of milk into the churn and putting the skimmed milk on the table it dont come true with me more n three times out o five but theres others that never fails you jest hold on huldy the dishcloth and the rooster knows as much bout whats goin to happen as your white petticoat does jest about as much interpolated jimmy with his utterance somewhat choked by hot doughnut huldah sat down at the table and made a pretense of eating something but her heart was heavy within her what are you churning for on friday mother she asked why i told you i am looking for strangers it aint pitt packard only that i expect yesterday mornin i swept a black mark on the floor in the afternoon i found two o the settinroom chairs standin back to back and my right hand kep itchin all day sot i knew i was goin to shake hands with somebody you told me t was the left hand said jimmy i never told you no such thing jimmy rumford eat your breakfast and dont contradict your mother or ill send you to bed quick s you finish eatin dont you tell me what i said nor what i didnt say for i wont have it do you hear me you did responded jimmy obstinately preparing to dodge under the table in case of sudden necessity you said your left hand itched and it meant money comin and you hoped rube hobson was goin to pay you for the turkey he bought a year ago last thanksgivintime so there so i did said the widow reflectively come to think of it so i did it must a been a wednesday my right hand kep itchin so and compny didnt come a wednesday neither persevered jimmy jimmy rumford if you dont behave yourself and speak when youre spoken to and not before youll git a trouncin that youll remember considable of a spell afterwards im ready for it replied the youngster darting into the shed and peeping back into the kitchen with a malignant smile i dreamt o baldwin apples last night dream fruit out o season thats anger without reason i knew when i got up youd get mad with me the first thing this morning and im all prepared when you ketch me both women gave a sigh of relief when the boys flying figure disappeared around the corner of the barn he was morally certain to be in mischief wherever he was but if he was out of sight there was one point gained at least why do you care so dreadfully whether pitt comes or not asked mrs rumford now that quiet was restored if he dont come today then hell come a sunday and if he dont come this sunday then hell come the next one so whats the odds you and him didnt have a fallin out last time he was home did you yes if you must know it we did havent you got any common sense huldy sakes alive i thought when i married daniel rumford if i could stand his temper it was nobodys business but my own i didnt foresee that he had so much he could keep plenty for his own use and then have a lot left to hand down to his children so t i should have to live in the house with it to the day of my death seems to me if i was a girl and lived in a village where menfolks is as scarce as they be here id be turrible careful to keep holt of a beau after id got him what in the name o goodness did you quarrel about huldah got up from the table and carried her plate and cup to the sink she looked out of the window to conceal her embarrassment and busied herself with preparations for the dishwashing so that she could talk with greater freedom weve had words before this plenty of times but they didnt amount to anything pitts good and hes handsome and hes smart but hes awful dictatorial and faultfinding and i just aint goin to eat too much humblepie before im married for fear i wont have anything else to eat afterwards and it aint very fattening for a steady diet and if there ever was a hateful old woman in the world its his stepmother ive heard of her saying mean things about our family every once in a while but i wouldnt tell you for fear youd flare up and say pitt couldnt come to see me shes tried to set him against me ever since we began to keep company together shes never quite managed to do it but shes succeeded well enough to keep me in continual trouble whats she got to say inquired mrs rumford hotly she never had a silk dress in the world till eben packard married her and everybody knows her father was a horsedoctor and mine was a reglar one she didnt say anything about fathers but she did tell almira berry that no member of the church in good standing could believe in signs as you did and have hope of salvation she said i was a chip off the old block and had been raised like a heathen it seems when i was over there on sunday i refused to stand up and have my height measured against the wall and i told em if you measured heights on sunday youd like as not die before the year was out i didnt know then she had such a prejudice against signs but since that time ive dragged em in every chance i got just to spite her more fool you said her mother beginning to move the dasher of the churn up and down with a steady motion you might have waited until she was your motherinlaw before you began to spite her the first thing you know you wont get any motherinlaw thats the only thing that would console me for losing pitt exclaimed huldah if i cant marry him i dont have to live with her thats one comfort the last thing she did was to tell aunt hitty tarbox shed as lief have pitt bring one of the original salem witches into the house as one of the daniel rumford tribe the land sakes ejaculated the widow giving a desperate and impassioned plunge to the churndasher now i know why i dreamt of snakes and muddy water the night before she come here to the ladies aid club well shes seventy and she cant live forever she cant take eben packards money into the next world with her either and i guess if she could t would melt as soon as it got there huldah persevered with her confession dropping an occasional tear in the dishwater last time pitt came here he said he should have three or four days vacation the th of august and he thought wed better get married then if t was agreeable to me i was kind of shy and the almanac was hanging alongside of the table so i took it up and looked to see what day of the week the th fell on oh pitt i said we cant be married on friday its dreadful unlucky he began to scold then and said i didnt care anything about him if i wouldnt marry him when it was most convenient and i said i would if t was any day but friday and he said that was all moonshine and nobody but foolish old women believed in such nonsense and i said there wasnt a girl in town that would marry him on a friday and he said there was and i asked him to come right out and tell who he meant and he said he didnt mean anybody in particular and i said he did and he said well jennie perkins would on friday or sunday or washday or any other day and i said if i was a man i vow i wouldnt take a girl that was so anxious as all that and he said hed rather take one that was a little too anxious than one that wasnt anxious enough and so we had it back and forth till i got so mad i couldnt see the almanac then just to show him i had more good reasons than one i said besides if we should be married on a friday wed have to go away on a saturday and ten to one t would rain on our weddingtrip why would it rain saturday more than any other day said he and then i mistrusted i was getting into fresh trouble but i was too mad to back out and said i they say it rains more saturdays in the year than any other day and he got red in the face and said whered you get that silly notion then i said it wasnt any silly notion it was gospel truth and anybody that took notice of anything knew it was so and he said he never heard of it in his life and i said there was considerable many things that hed never heard of that hed be all the better for knowing and he said he was like josh billings hed rather know a few things well than know so many things that want so you might have told him how we compared notes about rainy days at the aid club said her mother you remember hannah sophia palmer hadnt noticed it but the minute you mentioned it she remembered how when she was a child she was always worryin for fear she couldnt wear her new hat a sunday and it must have been because it was threatening weather a saturday and she was afraid it would keep up for sunday and the widow buzzell said she always picked up her apples for piebaking on friday it was so apt to be dull or wet on a saturday i told him all of that continued huldah and how old mrs bascom said they had a literary society over to edgewood that used to meet twice a month on saturday afternoons and it rained or snowed so often they had to change their meetings to a wednesday then the first thing i knew pitt stood up so straight he looked more than ten feet tall and says he if you dont marry me a friday huldah rumford you dont marry me at all youre nothing but a mass of superstition and if youre so scared for fear it will rain on your weddingbonnet a saturday you can stay home under cover the rest of your life for all i care ill wash the top buggy put the umbrella under the seat and take jennie perkins she wont be afraid of a wetting so long as she gets it in good company youre right i said she wont especially if the companys a man for shell be so dumfounded at getting one of em to sit beside her she wont notice if it rains pitchforks and so far as im concerned shes welcome to my leavings then he went out and slammed the kitchen door after him but not so quick that i didnt get a good slam on the sittingroom door first hell come back churned mrs rumford philosophically jennie perkins has got a pug nose and a goodsized mole on one side of it a mole on the nose is a sure sign of bad luck in loveaffairs particularly if its well to one side hell come back but as a matter of fact the days went by the mapletrees turned red and pitt packard did not come back to the rumford farm his comings and his goings were all known to huldah she knew that he took jennie perkins to the sundayschool picnic and escorted her home from evening meetings she knew that old mrs packard had given her a garnet pin a glass handkerchiefbox and a wreath of hair flowers made from the intertwined tresses of the packards and the doolittles if these symptoms could by any possibility be misinterpreted there were various other details of an alarmingly corroborative character culminating in the marriage of pitt to jennie on a certain friday evening at eight oclock he not only married her on a friday but he drove her to portland on a saturday morning and the fates who are never above taking a little extra trouble when they are dealing out misery decreed that it should be one of the freshest brightest most golden mornings of the early autumn pitt thought portland preferable to biddeford or saco as a place to pass the brief honeymoon if for no other reason than because the road thither lay past the rumford house but the rumfords blinds were tightly closed on the eventful saturday and an unnecessarily large placard hung ostentatiously on the front gate announcing to passersby that the family had gone to old orchard beach and would be home at sundown this was a bitter blow to the bridegroom for he had put down the back of the buggy with the intention of kissing the bride within full view of the rumford windows when he found it was of no use he abandoned the idea as the operation never afforded him any especial pleasure he asked mrs pitt if she preferred to go to the beach for her trip but she decidedly favored the gayeties of a metropolis the excitement of passing the rumford house having faded jennies nose became so oppressive to pitt that he finally changed places with her explaining that he generally drove on the left side he was more tranquil then for her left profile was more pleasing though for the life of him he could not help remembering huldahs sweet outlines the dimple in her chin her kissable mouth her delicate ear why oh why had she inherited her fathers temper and her mothers gift of prophecy to say nothing of her grandfathers obstinacy and her grandmothers nimble tongue all at once it dawned upon him that he might have jilted huldah without marrying jennie it would it is true have been only a half revenge but his appetite for revenge was so dulled by satisfaction he thought he could have been perfectly comfortable with half the quantity even if huldah were not quite so uncomfortable as he wished her to be he dismissed these base and disloyal sentiments however as bravely as he could and kissed jennie twice in a little stretch of wood road that fell in opportunely with his mood of silent penitence about two oclock clouds began to gather in the sky and there was a muttering of thunder pitt endured all the signs of a shower with such fortitude as he could command and did not put up the buggytop or unstrap the boot until the rain came down in good earnest whod have suspicioned this kind of weather he growled as he got the last strap into place and shook the water from his new straw hat i was afraid of it but i didnt like to speak out said jennie primly they say it genally does rain saturdays meanwhile huldah lay in the spare room at the back of the house and sobbed quietly mrs rumford and the skeptical jimmy had gone to old orchard and huldah had slipped out of the front door tacked the obtrusive placard on the gatepost and closed all the blinds in honor of the buried hopes that lay like a dead weight at the bottom of her heart she was a silly little thing a vain little thing and a spitfire to boot but that did not prevent her suffering an appreciable amount all that her nature would allow and if it was not as much as a larger nature would have suffered neither had she much philosophy or strength to bear it the burden is fitted to the back as often as the back to the burden she frequently declared to herself afterwards that she should have had a fit of sickness if it had not been for the thunderstorm that came up on that nevertobeforgotten saturday afternoon she had waked that morning with a dull pain in her heart a dull pain that had grown keener when she looked from her attic window and saw the sun shining clear in the sky not a cloud sullied the surface of that fair blue canopy on this day of the faithless pitts weddingjourney a sweet wind blew the tail feathers of the golden cock on the squires barn till he stared the west directly in the eye what a day to drive to portland she would have worn tancolored low shoes and brown openwork stockings what ugly feet jennie perkins had a buff challie dress with little brown autumn leaves on it a belt and sash of brown watered ribbon jennie had a waist like a flourbarrel and a sailor hat with a bunch of yellow roses on one side or would two brown quills standing up coquettishly have been more attractive then she would have taken a brown cloth shouldercape trimmed with rows upon rows of creamcolored lace and a brown parasol with an acorn of polished wood on the handle oh what was the use of living when she could wear none of this bridal apparel but must put on her old pink calico and go down to meet jimmys brotherly sneers was there ever such a cruelly sunshiny morning a spot of flickering light danced and quivered on her blue wallpaper until she could bear it no longer and pinned a towel over it she sat down by the open window and leaned dejectedly on the sill the prettiest picture of spiteful unnecessary misery that the eye of mortal man ever rested upon with her bright hair tumbling over her unbleached nightgown and her little bare feet curled about the chairrounds like those of a disconsolate child nobody could have approved of or even sympathized with so trivial a creature but plenty of people would have been so sorry for her that they would have taken sensible conscientious unattractive jennie perkins out of pitt packards buggy and substituted the heedless little huldah just for the pleasure of seeing her smile and blush there was however no guardian imp to look after her ruined fortunes and she went downstairs as usual to help about the breakfast wondering to herself if there were any tragedies in life too terrible to be coexistent with three meals a day and the dishes washed after each one of them an infant hope stirred in her heart when she saw a red sparkle here and there on the sooty bottom of the teakettle and it grew a little when her mother remarked that the dishwater boiled away so fast and the cows lay down so much that she believed it would rain the next day when that same afternoon the welcome shower came with scarce ten minutes warning huldah could hardly believe her eyes and ears she jumped from her couch of anguish and remorse like an excited kitten darted out of the house unmindful of the lightning drove the jersey calf under cover chased the chickens into the coop bolstered up the tomatoes so that the wind and rain would not blow the fruit from the heavily laden plants opened the blinds and closed the windows it comes from the east she cried dancing up and down in a glow of childish glee it comes from the east and its blowing in on jennies side of the buggy she did not know that pitt had changed places with his bride and that his broad shoulder was shielding her from the angry airt then she flew into the kitchen and pinned up her blown hair in front of the cracked lookingglass thinking with sympathetic tenderness how pretty she looked with her crown of chestnut tendrils tightened by the dampness her round young cheeks crimsoned by the wind and her still tearful eyes brightened by unchristian joy she remembered with naughty satisfaction how rain invariably straightened jennie perkinss frizzes and was glad glad that it did her angry passions were so beautifying that the radiant vision in the glass almost dazzled her it made her very sorry for pitt too she hated to think that his illtemper and stubborn pride and obstinacy had lost him such a lovely creature as herself and had forced him to waste his charms on so unappreciative and plain a person as jennie perkins she remembered that pitt had asked her to marry him coming home from the fair in a rainstorm if he meant anything he said on that occasion he must be suffering pangs of regret today oh how good how sweet how kind of it to rain and support her in what she had prophesied of saturday weather all at once a healing thought popped into her head i shall not live many years she reflected not after losing pitt and having his mother crow over me and that hateful jennie perkins having the family hair wreath hanging over her sofa and my wedding ring on her hand but so long as i live i will keep account of rainy saturdays and find a way to send the record to pitt every new years day just to prove that i was right then i shall die young and perhaps he will plant something on my grave and water it with his tears and perhaps he will put up a marble gravestone over me unbeknownst to jennie and have an appropriate verse of scripture carved on it something like she openeth her mouth with wisdom and in her tongue is the law of kindness i can see it as plain as if it was written i hope they will make it come out even on the edges and that he will think to have a white marble dove perched on the top unless it costs too much the years went on huldah surprised everybody by going away from home to get an education she would have preferred marriage at that stage of her development but to her mind there was no one worth marrying in pleasant river save pitt packard and failing him study would fill up the time as well as anything else the education forced a good many helpful ideas into pretty huldahs somewhat empty pate though it by no means cured her of all her superstitions she continued to keep a record of saturday weather and it proved as interesting and harmless a hobby as the collecting of china or postagestamps in course of time pitt packard moved to goshen indiana where he made a comfortable fortune by the invention of an estimable pump after which he was known by his full name of w pitt fessenden packard in course of time the impish and incredulous jimmy rumford became james and espoused the daughter of a wealthy boston merchant his social advancement was no surprise to huldah and her mother for from the moment he had left home they had never dreamed of him save in conjunction with horned cattle which is well known to signify unexampled prosperity in course of time too old mrs rumford was gathered to her fathers after a long illness in which huldah nursed her dutifully and well her death was not entirely unexpected for hannah sophia palmer observed spots like iron rust on her fingers a dog howled every night under almira berrys window and huldah broke the kitchen lookingglass no invalid could hope for recovery under these sinister circumstances and mrs rumford would have been the last woman in the world to fly in the face of such unmistakable signs of death it is even rumored that when she heard the crash of glass in the kitchen she murmured piously now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace and expired within the hour nineteen summers and winters had passed since pitt packard drove her that was jennie perkins to portland on her weddingtrip he had been a good and loyal husband she had been a good and faithful wife and never once in the nineteen years had they so much as touched the hem of the garment of happiness huldah the prophetess lived on in the old house alone time would have gone slowly and drearily enough had it not been for her ruling passion if the first part of the week were fair she was hopeful that there was greater chance of rain or snow by saturday if it were rainy she hoped there would be a long storm she kept an elaborate table showing the weather on every day of the year fair saturdays were printed in red ink foul saturdays in jetblack the last days of december were generally spent in preparing a succinct statement from these daily entries then in the month of january a neat document presenting facts and figures but no word of personal comment or communication was addressed at first to mr w p packard and of late years to w pitt fessenden packard and sent to goshen indiana mr packard was a good and loyal husband as i have said but there was certainly no disloyalty in the annual perusal of statistical weather tables that these tables though made out by one of the weaker sex were accurate and authentic he had reason to believe because he kept a rigid account of the weather himself and compared huldahs yearly record with his own the weather in pleasant river did not it is true agree absolutely with the weather in goshen but the similarity between maine and indiana saturdays was remarkable the first five years of pitts married life huldah had the advantage and the perusal of her tables afforded pitt little satisfaction since it proved that her superstitions had some apparent basis of reason the next five years his turn came and the fair saturdays predominated he was not any happier however on the whole because although he had the pleasure of being right himself he lost the pleasure of believing huldah right so time went on until mrs pitt died and was buried under the handsomest granite monument that could be purchased by the sale of pumps not only were the funeral arrangements carried out with the liveliest consideration for the departed but mr packard abstained from all gay society and conducted himself with the greatest propriety nevertheless when his partner and only confidential friend extolled jennies virtues as wife housekeeper companion and church member he remarked absently she was all that jim but somehow i never liked her for two years after his bereavement huldah omitted sending her weather statistics to mr packard thinking with some truth that it might seem too marked an attention from an attractive maine spinster to a likely indiana widower matters were in this state when mr packard alighted at the edgewood station one bright day in august he declined the offer of a drive and soon found himself on the wellremembered road to pleasant river he had not trodden that dusty thoroughfare for many a year and every tree and shrub and rock had a message for him though he was a plain matteroffact maker of pumps there was no old home to revisit for his stepmother had died long ago and jennie had conscientiously removed the family wreath from the glass case and woven some of the departed ladys hair into the funereal garland he walked with the brisk step of a man who knew what he wanted but there was a kind of breathless suspense in his manner which showed that he was uncertain of getting it he passed the whippoorwill mill the bubbling spring the old mosscovered wateringtrough and then cut across the widow buzzells field straight to the rumford farm he kept rehearsing the subjectmatter of a certain speech he intended to make he knew it by heart having repeated it once a day for several months but nobody realized better than he that he would forget every word of it the moment he saw huldah at least if the huldah of today were anything like the huldah of the olden time the house came in sight it used to be painted white it was drab now and there was a baywindow in the sittingroom there was a new pump in the old place and happy omen he discovered it was one of his own manufacture he made his way by sheer force of habit past the kitchen windows to the side door that was where they had quarreled mostly he had a kind of sentiment about that side door he paused a moment to hide his travelingbag under the grapevine that shaded the porch and as he raised his hand to grasp the knocker the blood rushed to his face and his heart leaped into his throat huldah stood near the window winding the old clock in her right hand was a farmers almanac how well he knew the yellow cover and how like to the huldah of seventeen was the huldah of thirtysix it was incredible that the pangs of disappointed love could make so little inroad on a womans charms rosy cheeks plump figure clear eyes with a little more snap in them than was necessary for connubial comfort but not a whit too much for beauty brown hair curling round her ears and temples what an ornament to a certain house he knew in goshen indiana she closed the wooden door of the clock and turning took a generous bite from the side of a mellow august sweeting that lay on the table at this rather inauspicious moment her eye caught pitts the sight of her old lover drove all prudence and reserve from her mind and she came to the door with such an intoxicating smile and such welcoming hands that he would have kissed her then and there even if he had not come to pleasant river for that especial purpose of course he forgot the speech but his gestures were convincing and he mumbled a sufficient number of extracts from it to convince huldah that he was in a proper frame of mind this phrase meaning to a woman the one in which she can do anything she likes with a man they were too old doubtless to cry and laugh in each others arms and ask forgiveness for past follies and regret the wasted years and be thankful for present hope and life and love but that is what they did old as they were i wouldnt have any business to ask you to marry such a dictatorial fool as i used to be huldah said pitt but ive got over considerable of my foolishness and do say you will say too you wont make me wait any longer but marry me sunday or monday this is thursday and i must be back in goshen next week at this time will you huldah huldah blushed but shook her head she looked lovely when she blushed and she hadnt lost the trick of it even at thirtysix i know its soon but never mind getting ready if you wont say monday make it tuesday do she shook her head again wednesday then do say wednesday huldy dear the same smile of gentle negation he dropped her hand disconsolately then ill have to come back at christmastime i spose its just my busy season now or i would stay right here on this doorstep till you was ready for it seems to me as if id been waiting for you ever since i was born and couldnt get you too soon do you really want me to marry you so much pitt never wanted anything so bad in my life didnt you wonder i wasnt more surprised to see you today nothing surprises me in womenfolks well it was because ive dreamed of a funeral three nights running do you know what thats a sign of pitt never winked an eyelash he had learned his lesson with a sigh of relief that his respected stepmother was out of hearing he responded easily i spose its a sign somebodys dead or going to die no it isnt dreams go by contraries its a sign theres going to be a wedding im glad to know that much but i wish while you was about it youd have dreamt a little more and found out when the wedding was going to be i did and if you werent the stupidest man alive you could guess i know im slowwitted said pitt meekly for he was in a mood to endure anything but ive asked you to have me on every day there is except the one im afraid to name you know ive had plenty of offers unless all the menfolks are blind you must have had a thousand huldah huldah was distinctly pleased as a matter of fact she had had only five but five offers in the state of maine implies a superhuman power of attraction not to be measured by the casual reader are you sorry you called me a mass of superstition i wish id been horsewhipped where i stood very well then the first time you wouldnt marry me at all unless you could have me friday and of course i wouldnt take you friday under those circumstances now you say youre glad and willing to marry me any day in the week and so ill choose friday of my own accord ill marry you tomorrow pitt and here she darted a roguishly sibylline glance at the clouds i have a waterproof have you an umbrella for saturday pitt took her at her word you may be sure and married her the next day but i wish you could have seen it rain on saturday there never was such a storm in pleasant river the road to the edgewood station was a raging flood but though the bride and groom were drenched to the skin they didnt take cold they were too happy love within is a beautiful counterirritant huldah didnt mind waiting a little matter of nineteen years so long as her maiden flag sank in a sea of triumph at the end and it is but simple justice to an erring but attractive woman to remark that she never said i told you so to her husband two on a tour logbook of charlotte amalia clifford ss diana january on the way to the virgin islands i engrossed the above heading in my journal shortly after we left the dock in new york but from what has occurred in the past few days i think my occasional entries in the logbook are likely to be records of dorothea valentines loveaffairs as they occur to her day by day and as unluckily they are poured into my ear for lack of a better or more convenient vessel we are dear friends dolly and i her name is dorothea but apparently she will have to grow up to it for at present everybody calls her dolly dora dot or dodo according to his or her sex color or previous condition of servitude dolly is twenty and i am thirty indeed her mother is only forty so that i am rather her contemporary than dollys but friendship is more a matter of sympathy than relative age and mrs valentine and i are by no means twin souls as a matter of fact that lady would never have noticed me the private secretary of clive winthrop a government official in washington had it not been that through him and his sister i had access to a more interesting group in society than had mrs valentine a widow of large means but a stranger in the capital clive winthrop is a person of distinction and influence and miss ellen winthrop an old friend of my mothers is one of the most charming hostesses in washington while i am in reality nothing but a paid scribe the glad willing ardent but silent assistant of a man who is serving the administration with all his heart but neither he nor his sister will have it so considered i almost think that miss ellen winthrop still vivacious and vigorous at seventy is ready to give up to me her place as head of the household if i consent to say the word but i am not sure enough yet to say it and because of that uncertainty i cannot trust myself in the daily company of the two persons most deeply concerned in my decision a sea voyage is the best thing in the world to blow away doubts or difficulties it also clears the air so that one can see ones course whether it be toward the north of duty or the south of desire my work for a long time has been to report interviews take stenographic records and write hundreds of letters for mr winthrop during the somewhat protracted discussion that preceded the acquisition of the virgin islands by the united states it is odd that these tasks should have fallen to me who added below clive winthrops signature to many communications the typed initials c a c for i have a special interest in these new possessions of ours a very close and sentimental one since i was born on st thomas one of the virgin islands and christened charlotte amalia after the little redroofed town on the shore of the perfect harbor my birth in st thomas was entirely unpremeditated and i was taken away as soon as my mother was able to travel nevertheless i have always longed during the twelve years of my loneliness without father or mother to see the place where they were so happy in each other and so blissful in the prospect of my appearance i then have a right to this particular holiday and this opportunity to decide my future miss dorothea valentine on the contrary is a wholly unexpected i will not say an unwelcome companion although when i wish to be thinking of my own problems she generally desires to discuss hers which are trivial though interesting and unique everything about the girl piques interest her beauty her charm her childlike gayety and inconsequence which are but the upper current of a deeper sea of sincerity and common sense somebody says ladies vary in looks theyre like military flags for a funeral or a celebration one day furled next day streaming men are ships figureheads about the same in a storm or a calm and not too handsome thanks to the ocean the last phrases are peculiarly true of clive winthrop who is sometimes called the ugliest man in washington yet who commands attention in any room that he enters because of his fine physique his noble head and his distinction of bearing and speech rugged he is thanks to the ocean but he looks as if he could swim against the strongest current on the other hand it cannot be said that dolly valentine varies she is lovely at breakfast lovelier at luncheon and loveliest at dinner when the dazzling whiteness of her neck and shoulders is revealed only a tolerably generous woman would suffer herself to be in the almost daily companionship of such a charmer and that i am in that dangerous juxtaposition is her fault not mine you must take me with you on your sea voyage charlotte she said i must get away from washington and from mother no dont raise your eyebrows and begin to scold before you know what i mean i am not going to criticize my maternal parent but i am so under her thumb at the moment that i am a flabby mass of indecision i have no more mind than a jellyfish yet i have to decide a matter of vital importance within a month how can i make up a nonexistent mind answer me that your life is so fixed and serene and settled so full of absorbing work you are so flattered and appreciated that you are like a big ship anchored in a safe harbor and you cant think what its like to be a silly little yacht bobbing about on the open sea such is the uncomprehending viewpoint of twenty toward thirty the calm assumption that ladies of that mature age can have no loveaffairs of their own to perplex them there is no need of your being a silly little yacht dolly i answered if you want to make a real voyage you have the power to choose your craft mother always chooses for me she said with a pout she doesnt gag me and put me in irons and lead me up the gangplank by brute force but she dominates me i start out each morning like a nice fat pink balloon and by evening though i havent felt any violent pinpricks i am nothing but a little shrunken heap of shriveled rubber you know it charlotte you have seen me bouncing at breakfast and seen me flat at dinner it was impossible not to laugh at her dont be ridiculous i expostulated there is nothing between you and happiness but a little cloud so diaphanous that a breath of common sense would blow it away now read your magazine and let me write in my logbook it is intended to be an informal report to my chief of the islands we are to visit we shall be at st thomas tomorrow morning and in the four days we have been journeying from new york the only topic of conversation in which you have shown the slightest enthusiasm is whether you should or should not marry marmaduke hogg dont call him all of it charlotte and she shuddered mother is always doing it and i cant bear it whereupon she flounced about on her deckchair and hid her face in her steamerrug it was a foolish little lovestory that of dorothea valentine her mother was a mass of polite and unnecessary conventions a pretty sort of person with a clear profile like that of a cold old little bird her small sharp nose resembled a beak her eyes were like two black beads and her conversation was a lengthy series of twitterings charlotte clifford used to tell miss winthrop that if mrs valentine had been a canary people would have forever been putting a towel over her cage to secure silence she was always idle save for a bewildering succession of reconstruction periods apparently forestalling ruins that no one else could have prophesied she dieted and reduced her hips had violet rays applied to her scalp had her wrinkles ironed out by some mysterious process if you caught her before ten in the morning you would find her with crescentshaped bits of courtplaster beside her eyes in front of her ears and between her brows she was beautifully clothed shod gloved massaged manicured and marcelled she lived on the best sides of the streets and at the proper hotels she answered notes returned calls and gave wedding presents punctiliously she never used the telephone for invitations nor had anything but contempt for abbreviations carefully writing out philadelphia pennsylvania and minneapolis minnesota when she addressed her sisters in those cities a mass of the most glaring virtues was mrs reginald valentine impeccable and unassailable with views on all subjects as rigid as the laws of the medes and persians she had ordered her husbands life during their ten years of marriage he being a gentle and artistic soul and she had more or less directed his exercise amusements diet as well as his political and religious opinions she nursed him faithfully in his last illness but when he timidly begged to be cremated instead of buried she reminded him that it was a radical ultramodern idea that the valentine lot and monument were very beautiful that there never had been any cremations in the family connection and that she hoped he would not break a longestablished custom and leave behind him a positively irreligious request various stories of mr valentines docility had crept into circulation and it is said that on this occasion he turned his head meekly to the wall and sighed very well emma do just as you think best its your funeral just how dorothea blossomed on this stalk it is difficult to say a brighteyed sunshiny willful baby she had grown into an unaffected attractive breezy young woman outwardly obedient inwardly mutinous she was generally calm in her mothers presence never criticizing her openly and her merry heart kept her from being really unhappy in a relationship that many girls would have found intolerable beaux she had aplenty and lovers not a few as cream or honey to flies so was dorothea valentine to mankind in general but she took them on gayly and cast them off lightly little harm being done on either side by the brief experience of course the suits of some of the suitors had been hardpressed by mrs valentine you will go through the woods to find a crooked stick at last dorothea she would say you dont know a desirable parti when you see one you must have an extraordinary opinion of your own charms to think that you have only to pick and choose those charms will fade rather prematurely i fear and when your lookedfor ideal comes along it may be that he will not regard you as flawless i dont expect him to mother i only expect him to find my own flaws interesting there is no certainty of that my dear and mrs valentines tone was touched with cynicism i had an intimate friend once clara wyman a very nice girl she was who had been in love with my cousin roger benson for years he seemed much attached to her and when time went by and nothing happened i spoke to him plainly one night and asked him if he didnt intend to propose to her and if not what were his reasons what do you suppose they were mrs valentines tone implied that a shock was coming dolly sat erect on her mothers italian daybed as one prepared im sure i have no idea how could i have she asked roger said that he didnt like her wiping her nose through her veil dolly flung herself at length on the couch and buried her face in the cushions her whole body shaking convulsively with silent mirth you may laugh dorothea but this incident which i have told many times shows how fantastic erratic despotic and hypercritical men generally are you will come to your senses some time and realize that no one is likely to bear with your perversities more patiently than arthur wilde or lee wadsworth who have both wasted a winter dangling about you dolly raised her head patted her hair and wiped her streaming eyes i realize the dangerous obstacles between me and the altar as i never did before and the girls voice was full of laughter but i should have to lock arthur wilde in the basement whenever professors came to dinner i couldnt marry arthurs vocabulary mother i couldnt he is a wonderful son and a millionaire he has three houses four motors and a steam yacht sure but that dont enthuse me tremenjous as it sounds i am imitating mr wildes style of conversation and as for lee wadsworth he is bowlegged lees reputation is straight at any rate and his income all that could be desired responded mrs valentine loftily i wish i could convince you dorothea that there are no perfect husbands you are looking for the impossible indeed i have always found men singularly imperfect even as friends and companions and in a more intimate relation they leave still more to be desired you dismissed sir thomas scott because he was too dictatorial although you knew he intended to have the family diamonds reset for you hed have had them reset in sheffield or birmingham but anyhow one doesnt marry diamonds mother one might at least make the effort dorothea i notice that most of the people who disdain diamonds generally possess three garnets two amethysts and one mexican opal dolly laughed you know i did emulate the celebrated mrs dombey mother i know you made a very brief and feeble effort to be sensible and you might have conquered yourself had it not been for the sudden appearance of this young hogg on your horizon you shall not call him a young hogg cried dolly passionately it isnt fair i wont endure it i thought that was his name remarked mrs valentine placidly shifting a wrinkleplaster from one place to another you wouldnt object if i had alluded to young benham or young wadsworth you show by your very excitement how disagreeable his name is to your ears it isnt a question of argument marmaduke hogg is an outrageous offensive name if he had been charles or james it would have been more decent the marmaduke simply calls attention to the hogg if any one had asked to introduce a person named hogg to me i should have declined ive told you a dozen times mother that the wilmots houseparty was at breakfast when i arrived from the night train there was a perfect babel and everybody was calling him duke he looked like one and nobody said the other i didnt even hear his last name till evening and then it was too late too late really dorothea if you have no sense of propriety you may leave the room and mrs valentine applied the smellingbottle to her birdlike nose as a sign that her nerves were racked to the limit and she might at any moment succumb all i know is continued dorothea obstinately that he was the bestlooking the most interesting the cleverest the most companionable man in the houseparty or for that matter in the universe you dont ask the last name of orlando or benedick or marcus aurelius or albert of belgium it wouldnt be necessary here mrs valentine was quite imperturbable the valentines have never been required to associate with theatrical people or foreigners in some ways i dislike the name of marmaduke as much as hogg it is so bombastic that it seems somehow like an assumed name or as if the creature had been born on the stage when coupled with hogg it loses what little distinction it might have had by itself one almost wishes it had been marmalade marmalade hogg suggests a quite nauseating combination of food but there is a certain appropriateness about it dorotheas face was flaming you will never allow duke to explain himself mother nor hear me through when i attempt to make things clear to you you never acknowledge that you know but you do know that dukes people were english a long way back and marmaduke is an old family name the winthrops will tell you that dukes father and mother were named forrest and that they changed it to hogg to pacify an old bachelor uncle who wanted to leave duke six thousand dollars a year he had no voice in the matter he was only twelve years old it was a very shortsighted business proposition and your duke must have been very young for his age and mrs valentine took another deep sniff of lavender sixty thousand a year wouldnt induce me to be named hogg and i shall never consent to have one in my family dorothea burst into tears a most uncommon occurrence you have dwelt so long on this purely immaterial objection she sobbed that you have finally inoculated me with something of your own feeling and made me miserable and ashamed i dare say too i have hurt dukes pride by trying to give him a reason for your indifferent attitude yet never having courage for the real piffling explanation i am mortified at my despicable weakness and i will overcome it by realizing how unworthy i am to bear dukes honorable unstained name even if it is hogg you might as well give up mother if the dearest best most delightful man in the world loves me i shall marry him name and all i do not regard it as settled replied mrs valentine calmly the young man may not think you so desirable when he learns that my refusal to accept him as a soninlaw means that he must take you without any income your dear father must have foreseen some such tragedy when he left all his money in my care duke will take me without a penny cried dorothea hotly i would stake my life on that dont be melodramatic dorothea we shall see in time it is just possible that the young man may not be greedy and so belie his name this was mrs valentines last shaft as dorothea walked out of the room with her chin in the air ss diana january st thomas and charlotte amalia the little town for which i was named looked so lovely when we landed early this morning that i felt a positive thrill of pride this halfway house of the sea this gateway of the caribbean as it has been picturesquely called seemed as dolly and i climbed the hills and the stone stairways to materialize into a birthplace instead of a vague dream a year ago with the dannebrog the scarlet whitecrossed banner of denmark floating over the red danish fortress on the waterfront i might have felt an alien but the stars and stripes made me feel at home and i could only remember that my father and mother met and loved each other in this little paradise and that when i was born there they were the two happiest people under the sun if they could have seen their daughter saluting the american flag so near the very spot in which she first saw the light they would have been comforted i am sure instead of repining that they had both been taken away when she most needed their love and protection such a view from dianas deck as we crept into the wonderful harbor a background of towering green hills and a dazzling blue of velvet sky and crystal sea like that of algiers greeted our enchanted gaze like some of the coast towns of italy charlotte amalia is gay with color and its white redroofed villas nestle among their luxuriant gardens and tropical foliage standing out in a perfect riot of orange and yellow blue and red never save in venice have i seen such a gorgeous array of color in a landscape five hours we had in st thomas while the diana put off hundreds of barrels of cement but what with the gayly painted boats and their darkskinned crews the naked brown boys diving and swimming for pennies and dimes in the harbor a walk to bluebeards tower and blackbeards castle we were well amused particularly so was dorothea who disappeared from my side for a halfhour while i chatted with the captain rejoining me in the tiny palmbordered park near the landing she was glowing with happiness what do you think charlotte she exclaimed i have a letter from duke not written after we sailed of course for it couldnt have reached me he bearded mother in her fortress the morning we left washington she was out or said she was but sent a note saying that i had gone on a journey and would be absent for a month he went directly to the winthrops for news and they told him i was with you and that if he wrote at once by special delivery he could reach the ship before it left new york dock he sent the letter to the captain and asked him to give it to me at st thomas for a surprise the captain is such a nice man though a good deal of a tease mr winthrop was delighted to hear you were not alone poor miss winthrop has influenza and they both wish they had taken this trip it seems they are thinking of it just a little the winthrops coming on this voyage i exclaimed impossible they hadnt an idea of it mightnt he want to interview the governor and look at the island he hasnt time i chose this journey instead of another so that i could interview the governor and look at the islands myself well i dare say theres nothing in it duke didnt speak of it as anything settled and he may have misunderstood his mind being on me may i read you the letter i mean parts of it i shouldnt expect to hear all of it i replied dryly yet the bits i leave out are the ones that show him as he is she said looking off into the grove of palms duke is so conscientious that until we succeed in melting mother that would be a good title for a story melting mother and until she sanctions an engagement he wont let himself go even on paper so i get only a lovely sort of seepage that breaks through in spite of him skip the seepage i said unsympathetically and give the news she reread the first paragraphs to herself with a good deal of dimpling and with eyes that suffused with feeling now and then and turning the page began to read aloud knowing that you were on the high seas far away from me though safe with your charming miss clifford duke admires you extravagantly charlotte i concluded to burn my ships and have a straightforward talk with your mother although you have repeatedly warned me that this was not the best method of approach and that only patience would win my cause i sent up my card at the new willard and doubtless she would have refused to receive me but going from the office to one of the reception rooms to await her i found her seated there with your philadelphia aunt and another lady there had evidently been confidences so they scented trouble and took to their heels when i had been introduced to them somewhat informally as a friend of dorotheas my name not being mentioned i asked your mother when we were left alone if she had any objection to me other than my uneuphonious and suggestive surname she replied guardedly no or at least nothing in particular though she might say without conceit that dorothea might aspire to anybody even the highest i cordially agreed saying that if the male sex had any eye for beauty charm or loveliness of character dorothea might marry not only anybody but everybody she said she thought persiflage was out of taste when the happiness of a mothers whole life was in question i begged pardon but said it was necessary for me to whistle to keep my courage up for the happiness of my whole life was in question she said that was beside the point and her daughters happiness must also be considered i remarked that her daughter to my infinite surprise and gratitude assured me that her happiness lay in the same direction as my own she vouchsafed the information that dorothea was a romantic fool i denied it she dealt what she considered to be a bodyblow by affirming that your property would not be in your hands till you were twentyone i replied that i didnt care if it didnt reach you till you were a hundred and twentyone she said dont be silly and asked me if i had ever thought of changing my name back to forrest from hogg i inquired in return if she would mind the loss of six thousand dollars a year supposing that i should take such a step she reflected and said that she should but she would rather lose it than take the name and that we could rub along on dorotheas money she supposed if that was my idea of a pleasant life i hastened to say that i would relinquish the six thousand without a pang confident that i could make a living anyway but that it would be disloyal to my good old uncle whose bounty had given me a college course two years at oxford and three at harvard law school it had also permitted me to give my services to the united states shipping board without compensation she said she thought it was very selfish in a government to accept a mans whole time and give him no remuneration that the secretary of the treasury had only to say to the banks let there be money and there was money there would be plenty for everybody if only the engravers and laborers at the mint would not strike i reminded her that men were remunerated sufficiently in being allowed to serve their country in time of war she returned that she thought that point of view foolish and fantastic but if she found after a year that her daughters peace of mind was threatened would i then change my name and live on dorotheas income until i could establish myself in the practice of the law she said that i must acknowledge that this was a ridiculously generous proposition and one that neither my talents nor my station in life merited i replied that the proposition meant to me that i should simply be selling myself and buying her daughter and that i declined to accept it oh charlotte the girl interrupted with a catch in her throat dont you think that was splendid and clever too your mother said that she wished to take the matter into consideration during your absence so the letter ran on and just as we were rising the philadelphia aunt came in from one door and general x senator y and lord z from another they are at the moment three of the most significant figures in the moving picture of washington society and all women pursue them they beamed at me as if they had been commandeered for that special purpose and senator y said jovially how are you duke glad to see you are you free to dine with us i hastily turned to your mother saying i was just going to ask you and your sister if you would dine with me lord z who was at balliol with me you remember said then perhaps you will allow us to come to your table for coffee hogg your mother gazed at him astounded that his noble tongue could utter the name then she actually and gracefully fell for the dinner lured by the bait of the postprandial coffee with the distinguished trio and the philadelphia aunt kept things going serenely she is a delightful person and will be a perfect companion for your mother when you know when when she needs one and i no longer do there never was a man who said things like duke interpolated dolly ecstatically all would have gone swimmingly to the end had not a page suddenly entered the room bawling mr hogg wanted at the telephone mr hogg telephone message for mr hogg only capitals can give an idea of the volume of voice my eardrum grown painfully sensitive since i met your mother echoed and reлchoed with the tone as i threaded my way through the crowded room followed by every eye while i imagined people saying i wonder if hes called to the stockyard it is queer but i never felt this way in oxford for they still remember hogg the scottish poet and i hung myself to his revered coattails the telephone message was from my secretary and healed my wounded vanity for it came from the british embassy conveying the thanks of the foreign office for mr hoggs friendly and helpful action in conducting negotiations for the chartering of exenemy ships lying in south american ports you see what he is exclaimed dolly looking up from the letter with eyes full of unshed tears of course he has five or six superiors in office but i suppose really that dukes extraordinary talent keeps that whole shipping board going you mark my words charlotte when duke gives up his position and goes to plattsburg therell be an absolute slump in that office but just hear what follows it is so discouraging but when glowing with the delight that always comes to me when i have any little tribute to lay with my love at your charming numberthree feet when i returned to my table your mother had gone to her room and the philadelphia aunt remained to explain that she had been taken suddenly ill it will all come right mr my dear boy she said my sister has one weakness an abnormal sensitiveness to public opinion she thinks constantly what people will say of this that or the other trifling thing and in that way perpetually loses sight of the realities of life there is a great deal of good in her that you have never seen because for the moment she is absolutely obsessed by her objection to your name and her conviction that dorothea might and should marry a title my sister married reginald valentine more for the effect on her future visitingcard than anything else but dorotheas father bequeathed his good looks his sunny disposition his charm and his generous nature to his daughter you have chosen wisely my dear mr boy but not more wisely to my mind than dorothea has so it ended but i somehow hope that i may have converted your mother from an enemy alien to an armed neutral there is nothing more of of general interest said dolly tearfully as she slipped the letter in the envelope aunt maggie is a trump oh charlotte if only you had ever had a loveproblem like mine and could advise me duke always wondered that you never married dorothea ought to be cuffed for impertinence but she is too unconscious and too pretty and lovable for corporal punishment perhaps there may still be hope even at thirty i said stiffly oh i didnt mean that you might have anybody by lifting your finger we only wonder youve never lifted it but you could be happy only with a very learned and prominent man you are so clever im clever enough to prefer love to learning if i have to choose dolly my dear im so sorry you didnt get a letter charlotte said the girl snuggling sympathetically to my side on the bench this was more than flesh and blood or angel could bear i kissed her and shaking her off my shoulder vigorously i said as i straightened my hat as a matter of fact miss valentine i have had a letter every day since we left new york a letter delivered before breakfast by the steward you have had but one yet you are twenty and i am thirty charlotte dont add to your impudence by being too astonished darling i continued come lets go and pick bananas and pineapples and tamarinds and shaddocks and starapples and sapodillas i wont budge a step till you tell me all about it then youll grow to this green bench and have to be cut away by your faithful marmaduke is it a secret it doesnt exist at all for you you are not of age dolly im old enough to know the things one can learn by heart was dollys comment when the diana was leaving st thomas at sunset and we were well on our way to st croix dolly made a half confidence you are not my chaperon charlotte because in my hour of need i simply fastened myself to you like a limpet or an albatross or a barnacle or any other form of nautical vampire that you prefer still i might as well confess that i cabled to duke or wirelessed or did something awfully expensive of that sort at st thomas while you were having that interminable talk with the captain who by the way is married and devoted to his wife they say that was foolish and extravagant my child i answered i dont know what you said but i have the most absolute confidence in your indiscretion i hope you remembered that all messages are censored in wartime i did indeed she sighed i was never so hampered and handicapped in my life but i think i have outwitted the censors i wish i were as sure about mother ss diana january st croix was delightful with a motorride across the island from frederikstad to christianstad where we lunched dollys mind is not in a state especially favorable for instruction but i took a guidebook and sitting under a wonderful tamarind tree read her alexander hamiltons wellknown letter describing a west indian hurricane written from st croix in we were with a party of canadian acquaintances made on shipboard and greatly interested in our first visits to sugar plantations vast canefields of waving green stretched mile after mile on the right and on the left making it seem incredible that a food commissioner need beg the sweet tooth to deny itself in the midst of such riotous plenty there was a dazzling glare from the white buildings of the town and the coral roads but the moment we reached the outlying country all was verdant and restful the beautiful hard roads ran like white ribbons over velvet hills and through rich valleys tall windmills belonging to the earlier days of sugarmaking rose picturesquely from the magnificent palms and other shadetrees there were brilliant flowers and blossoming vines breaking through hedges here and there and acres of pineapples and orange groves truly our canadian companions might wish us luck in our new possessions later in the day we have left the virgin islands now and at dawn we neared st kitts of the leeward group anchoring a halfmile away from the landing and putting passengers ashore in the small boats that ranged themselves near the steamer there was a very bedlam of chatter argument and recrimination among the black boatmen mounting at times to furious invective in a patois we failed wholly to understand for though the majority of the natives speak english on all the islands whether dutch french or british they use a language of their own vintage on these undress occasions i could see dollys bright head and laughing eyes peeping through her porthole nodding goodmorning to me as i viewed the scene from my own little stateroom opposite hers the st kitts boatmaster was a superb personage in white linen uniform and cap he stood at the top of the steps lowered from our steamer to the ocean and from that serene height of power commanded his clamorous and refractory legions it was his voice that called me irresistibly from my berth and kept my ears as well as my eyes glued to the porthole of my cabin it was a deep rich barytone as full of color as his own native skies and sea the white cap set off his dark skin and a pair of eyes that shot lightnings of authority gleamed from under his vizor he ought to have been singing the pagliacci prologue at the metropolitan opera house but instead he was calling resonantly his private megaphone seemed to be located in his own throat dont crowd edward push in victoria get away george come nearer come nearer mary show your number albert or meet me in court tomorrow at eleven as a matter of fact these were the names painted on the boats crowding and jamming their way to the most favorable places for securing passengers or freight but the quality of his voice made it seem as if in calling victoria edward george mary and albert he were summoning a corporeal bevy of kings and queens to do his instant bidding the excitement reached its climax when an aged bishop descended the stairway which was under some circumstances as perilous as a ladder the bishops quaint hat and gown and hood of various colors made him seem like a benign figure in comic opera and perhaps because of his dignity or his multiplicity of luggage all the boats ardently desired him as a passenger two green boxes carrying much information painted in white on the sides gave us all details of his rank ancestry and place of residence these were projected down the stairway and then followed an imposing procession of servitors bearing potted plants packages done up in linen cloth baskets of eggs limes lemons grapefruit a canary in a cage some white mice and a persian cat the last three it is needless to say being in separate crates majestic being that st kitts boatmaster never more impressive than when he successfully landed a bishop of the isles dolly and i recalled the admirable crichton in barries whimsical play who as butler in a titled english family was wrecked with the entire household on a desert island it needed only the emergencies of twentyfour hours to establish him as the dominant intellectual force and the practical governor of the sadly inefficient earls countesses ladies and honorables and before long he assumed the authority properly belonging to him that the earls daughter finally fell in love with him seemed not so much dramatic license as a tribute to his obvious superiority in london the lady would have been criticized as marrying beneath her on the desert island it actually appeared as if she were doing particularly well for herself indeed dolly confessed that though she would prefer marrying marmaduke hogg she would rather be wrecked in the company of the st kitts boatmaster ss diana sunday january after breakfast on our way to anchor at antigua for the night we saw in the distance the towering cone of nevis the gorgeous isle of alexander hamiltons birth and the famous scene of lord nelsons marriage it has fallen from its proud estate of former years into poverty and neglect but it is still marvelously beautiful to the eye we sat on deck reading or at least glancing drowsily over the pages of our books to the sapphire sea and the emerald forests of the island shores with a neverceasing delight there were three roman catholic priests on board also four protestant missionaries one of them with a wife and a family of charming children samuel naomi esther daniel piously they were named and never once did they bring contempt on the holy scriptures from below in a far end of the boat we could hear echoes of gospel hymns in some little cabin where a sundaymorning service was being held dorothea gave a deep sigh it is all so peaceful charlotte one day just like another and all beautiful and tranquil we havent seen anybody hurry since we left new york do you remember rudyard kipling saying when he came back there after a long absence that he was afraid to step slowly lest the man behind him should walk up his back nobody ever seems nervous in these islands the natives can be ragged and hungry without being much concerned work never appears to be a delight to them for its own sake but only as a means to get food i feel slip slip slipping into a heavenly state of coma does anything ever stir the tropics except hurricanes and earthquakes i wonder how can women fight for suffrage in this climate how can a man be awakened to great ambitions alexander hamilton was born on nevis and passed all his boyhood and youthful days on what is now our own st croix i said yes but he wasnt washingtons aidedecamp nor secretary of the treasury in the tropics true nevertheless when he was nicholas crugers bookkeeper at the age of twelve he wrote to an american friend i contemn the groveling condition of a clerk to which my fortunes condemn me and i would willingly risk my life though not my character to exalt my station my youth excludes me from any hope of immediate preferment but i mean to prepare the way for futurity you see the yeast was stirring even in the tropics dolly well i feel no yeast stirring in me she said languidly all the morning i have been trying to recapture a certain ode to a cow written by a man of action in a country hotel where mother and i were sojourning last summer i could have echoed it when i first regarded the inhabitants of these islands and now anybody might say it of me for i grow more and more cowlike with every passing day it runs this way ode to a cudchewing cow why cow art thou so satisfied so well content with all things here below so meek so lazy and so awful slow dost thou not know that mens affairs are mixed that grievously the world needs to be fixed that nothing we can do has any worth that life is care and trouble and untowardness prit cow this is no time for idleness the cud thou chewest is not what it seems get up and moo tear round and quit thy dreams by this time dorothea was asleep her book slid to the floor i shaded her face with my green umbrella pulled down her muslin frock over her pretty ankles and gave myself up to vagrant thoughts of her probable future sunday on shipboard is a good day for reflections and heartsearchings my own problem after all is not so baffling as dollys she is as loyal as a charming and sensible girl can be to a mother like mrs valentine whose soul if the truth were told is about the size of a mustardseed a frivolous useless birdminded woman is dollys mother a woman pecking at life as a canary pecks at its cuttlefish simply to sharpen its bill how the girl can respect her i cannot imagine i suppose flesh calls to flesh and she loves her without too much analysis but they seem to have come to the parting of the ways it is dollys highest self that is in love with marmaduke hogg and i dont believe she will sacrifice it to a maternal whim and call it filial obedience perhaps the absence that makes the heart grow fonder is working like a philter in this journey planned by mrs valentine with a far different purpose let her go with you charlotte she begged me with tears in her eyes i must get her away from this attractive but undesirable young man that absurd uncle who didnt want his name to die out must have been a lunatic or an imbecile why shouldnt such a vulgar name become extinct and to think that my exquisite dorothea whose figure and eyelashes have been remarked by royalty to think that she should be expected to graft herself on to that family tree of all others to think that she may take that name herself and for aught we know add half a dozen more to the list all boys probably who would marry in course of time and produce others piling hoggs on hoggs as it were it is like one of those horrible endless chains that are condemned by the government i gave way to peals of laughter at this impassioned speech evidently annoying mrs valentine who expected sympathy i tried to placate her with reference to the poet of the name which had none but delightful associations in scotland then if they choose to defy me and marry each other let them go and live in scotland she snapped would you have minded dollys marrying lord bacon i asked this gave her food for thought no she said reflectively for of course he was a lord which is something but how about the associations i cant explain but somehow they are not as repulsive to me she insisted i always think of bacon cooked not raw and the other is alive as for my own difficulty it is after all a conventional one i cannot bear the idea of marrying my employer a man known by sight and reputation to everybody in washington while i am a relatively unknown person without fortune kith or kin the thought brings to mind sensational headlines in cheap newspapers regarding the wedding of some aged millionaire with his youthful stenographer and the consequent alarms of his household or the alliance of some scion of a wealthy house with a trained nurse of obscure lineage and vaulting ambition i am all alone in the world and though my father who died when he was only five and twenty left me but the barest support i have gloried in my independence and rejoiced in my modest successes my people on both sides were of good stock even the winthrops could climb my family tree and find no bad fruit on it but the world will say what a splendid match for charlotte clifford i wonder how ellen winthrop will take it i shouldnt have thought clive winthrop would marry his secretary somehow though theres nothing against her but he could look higher the world would be quite right it is a splendid marriage for charlotte clifford and clive winthrop could look higher he is my superior and that is the reason i love him that he loves me proves that there is something in me that will rise to his level all the same i wrote him when i came away that i could never cross the bridge between us there is a bridge although he does not see it until i was no longer his secretary and until i was sure his sister would welcome me into the household that has been so harmonious and delightful to every human being that has ever crossed its threshold nobody could equal ellen winthrop as a hostess with her fine spirited face lovely even at seventy her gift of repartee her stately manner her simple trailing dress always of black or gray and always reaching the floor when most of the feminine world looks in its best clothes as if mounted on stilts with a skimpy semidetached tail wriggling its silly length behind i could never scale the heights on which the splendid ellen perpetually dwells but i could sit at the foot of them and admire with all my heart and perhaps that attitude if fully understood might win her affection ss diana january at antigua we anchored and took a steam launch to see the town where we visited a very fine sugarcane factory watching the whole process from the canefield to the market we did not land at guadeloupe the hour not being favorable and the stay being too brief to compensate for the effort involved but this morning at eight we approached dominica the largest of the leeward group the loftiest of the lesser antilles and the loveliest if one could or ought to make comparison the loveliest of the west indian isles the guidebook calls it the caribbean wonderland and dolly and i were not disposed to quarrel with the phrase after hanging over the deckrail for an hour before breakfast and marveling at the beauty of the view mountains shimmered in the distance like visions seen in dreams mountains like towering emeralds springing from a sapphire sea we passed tiny hamlets halfhidden in lime orchards and cocoagroves with yellow patches of cane gleaming here and there against a background of forest as we drew nearer we could see white torrents dashing tempestuously down through green valleys for dominica has a too plenteous watersupply since in some districts three hundred inches a year is the average rainfall it rained seven times in the three hours that we passed on shore but the showers were gentle ones and we found generous shelter in the wonderful botanical garden where we spent most of our time nature is sometimes a kindly mother often she wears a tragic mask and now and then she indulges in melodrama but i never conceived the possibility of her having a sense of humor until we witnessed her freakish mood in the dominica garden there were the usual varieties of magnificent palms and brilliant flowering shrubs but the joy of joys was the sausagetree around which we walked in helpless mirth at the incredible veracity of the imitation it reached a goodly height and had a splendid girth and circumference of shade but no factory in bologna or frankfort or any other possible birthplace of the real article could rival this amazing this funny tree in fertility its product was just a trifle large save for the omnivorous lover of sausage but in other respects it was a faithful copy of the original unless indeed the first sausagemaker borrowed the idea from the tree instead of the other way about these vegetable sausages hung in hundreds of strings and festoons and clusters from the topmost to the lowest branches because of the way they hung the way they were strung their shape and color and the very manner in which the skin was neatly drawn over each one and fastened no one possessing a sense of the ridiculous but would sit down under the tree and laugh at the joke oddly enough we could find no pictorial postcard of this phenomenon to bring home for the enlivening of winter evenings though we bought a capital one of the cannonball tree just as unique in its way but not so absurd dorothea was enchanted with dominica and kept exclaiming every few minutes oh if only great britain would sell us this island i think id choose to live in dominica because if i had a sausagetree in my garden i should laugh every day and the children wouldnt need any playthings ss diana february we have had a glimpse of france through a day at martinique the principal feature of our visit was a wild motordrive up an eighteenhundredfoot mountain it was a steady climb from glory to glory with tropical forests on every side our method of progress was not quite serene for there was not a sufficient number of cars to satisfy the demand after a long wait dolly and i took a small mongrel sort of motor that had been refused by all the dianas passengers the creole driver handsome debonair persuasive and fluent though unintelligible assured us that he had ascended and descended the mountain hundreds of times a fact only too obvious to one who examined his means of transportation none of the tires matched and two of them looked like wounded soldiers just home from the front displaying patches of adhesive plaster and bandages of cotton and woolen rags of every color with an occasional inset of an alien material into the rubber one could catch a glimpse of a tin tomatocan neatly introduced in the place of some vital bit of machinery a waterbury alarmclock figured in an unexpected position apparently adding its power to the engine and there were stout ropes here and there which i never observed before in the rigging of any motor i hesitated to enter for the future though not absolutely certain looked full of hope and promise but dolly was firm and reckless i am ten years her senior but still young to be called a fraid cat with impunity so i finally mounted the vehicle the driver gave a gay insouciant tap to a front tire as much as to say courage mon enfant cest la derniиre fois then flung himself into his seat and blowing a horn started his basehospital up the mountain at a breakneck pace the motors own horn was out of commission but there was a substitute by the drivers side it was easy for him to blow it because he had no particular use for either of his hands his steering being left largely to chance repeated expostulations in boardingschool french only elicited a reply that sounded like soyez tranquilles mesdames you speak american bien leezy est parfaitement docile this conveyed no idea to me although his broad grin convinced me that in his own opinion it was a subtle witticism at length however it burst upon dolly who went off into irrepressible gales of laughter you have lived so continuously in a rarefied winthrop atmosphere charlotte that you havent any modern vocabulary he is telling you the pet name of his car to give you confidence nobody ever dies in a tin lizzie not only is the machine indestructible but the people that ride in it isnt the driver a witty reckless darling he was indeed and incredible as it may seem lizzie ascended and descended the mountain in safety though only because a kind providence watched over us then when we had paid the reckless dangerproof darling twice the sum he should have demanded we sat on a bench in the savanna where we could be quietly grateful that we were alive and watch the coming and going of the fortdefrance townspeople so unmistakably french with the bright costumes of the women the pose of their turbans or hats their sparkle and chatter and vivacious gestures here in the savanna travelers always gather to look at the marble statue of the empress josephine which is called the greatest work of art in the west indies that is not fatuous praise perhaps but the figure needed the hand of no master sculptor to hold the eye and captivate the imagination it is mounted on a huge pedestal and is of heroic size the white glitter of its marble enhanced by its truly magnificent setting a circle of towering royal palms there she stands the lovely creole woman of martinique forever looking at trois islets as if she were remembering her birth in an overseers shack and her girlhood passed in a sugarmill straightway the crowds of native men and women chaffering in the marketplace the mothers holding up their crowing babies to the statue the nursemaids and groups of playing children all vanished and we relived in spirit poor josephines past thrilling anew at the remembrance of her romance her triumph and her bitter sorrow the creole girl who crossed the sea to become empress of france and share a throne with napoleon but who sailed back to her island home a brokenhearted woman goodbye martinique land of josephine and land of st pierre the scene of one of the greatest tragedies of modern times when the fury of mont pelйe engulfed the growth of centuries and buried forty thousand human creatures in its scalding lava st lucia of the windward group tomorrow and then barbados from whence the diana goes on to demerara and returns a week or so later so that we are able to rejoin her taking up our former comfortable cabins and our muchliked captain ss diana between barbados and new york february here we are again on our homeward trip making fewer landings and briefer stops principally to take on passengers and thousands of barrels of limes barbados with its charming hotel at hastings was an unalloyed delight and dorothea who had determined to live in each of the islands as it came along would finally have transferred her allegiance for good and all had it not seemed more loyal for an american to choose one of our own possessions and grow up with the country we found ourselves in the midst of pleasant even distinguished society british officials exgovernors and judgeadvocates of the various islands english and canadian soldiers on sickleave and officers commanding the uboat chasers in nearby waters dorothea danced nightly and held court daily on the broad piazzas reminding me of rudyard kiplings fascinating heroine in an indian army post who whenever she appeared caused the horizon to become black with majors her head and heart remained true to the absent marmaduke i am not so sure about her dancing feet now that that experience is over with the many others we are at sea and quiet again with one tranquil day just like the other what a honeymoon journey it would make charlotte said dolly one moonlight evening on deck it is so difficult to grow in knowledge of people in new york or washington one doesnt even know ones self all journeys must be good for honeymooners dont you think yes in a way but some places are created for lovers and newlyweds who are after all only explorers charlotte forever discovering new lands and annexing new territories yes and sometimes falling into the hands of savages and cannibals i suppose yes that must be terrible the awakening to find that one has been mistaken in a man sighed dolly i dare say we ought to worry lest men be mistaken in us it might happen you know your mind is so logical charlotte however this voyage wouldnt have to be idealized to meet the needs of honeymooners in a vermont village where i sometimes stay i remember a girl who had to be married on sunday because she could not give up her position as telegraphoperator till saturday night that was dull enough in all conscience but she was married in her highschool graduating dress and went to her grandmothers house ten miles away for her weddingjourney i think it required considerable inward felicity to exalt that situation i sat upright in my steamer chair dorothea i said sharply you have been manufacturing conversation for the last five minutes just killing time for fear that i should ask you questions is there anything on your mind you have been absentminded and nervous for days your imagination is working overtime charlotte she answered we are nearing home that is all and life presses closer i could not gainsay her for every mile of ocean crossed makes my heart beat faster i seem to be living just now in a sort of pause between my different lives there is the heaven of my childhood in the vague background then the building of my career if so modest a thing can be called by so shining a name then the steady halfconscious growth of a love that illumines my labors yet makes them difficult and perplexing and now there is a sense of suspended activity of waiting with a glimmering aircastle rising like an iridescent bubble out of the hazy future sometimes there are two welcoming faces at a window and sometimes the indistinct figure of a woman stretching out a forbidding hand my chiefs sister who may not want a third person in the family ss diana february dolly went on the bridge this afternoon and stayed a halfhour with the captain giving no reason save that she liked to talk with him which seemed plausible but did not satisfy me at bedtime i discovered her unpacking and laying out in her upper berth a dazzling toilet for our landing at st thomas tomorrow she blushed when i looked in upon her do dress up to me charlotte she coaxed i dont want to be conspicuous wear your gray georgette and the broad hat with the roses why this sudden display of vanity and good clothes hasnt your letter of introduction to governor oliver brought us an invitation to luncheon at government house yes but i dont suppose it is a banquet charlotte i must confide in you i should think it was about time what do you mean i have known for days that you were concealing something i didnt want to be secretive but i thought it was only fair to you to keep my own counsel now you can report to mother that you knew nothing and that therefore you couldnt interfere but what have you done you cant be secretly married with your chosen man in washington and you on the vasty deep no but im next door to it what do you mean by next door have you a groom and a minister waiting on the new york dock no mother will be there but i fear she wont bring a minister im so glad you imagined something far far worse than i ever intended it shows that you are more audacious than i though nobody would believe it i dont like your tone but go on ive been communicating rather frequently with duke so i fancied from your changing money at every stop and doing continual sums on paper it has made me a pauper this telegraphing in wartime the messages go by jamaica or porto rico or trinidad or bermuda and lots of other islands and i think some of the messages must be personally conducted straight to new york by powerful swimmers judging by the cost go on dont temporize i neednt repeat all of them and in fact i havent copies duke after he had my first telegram from st thomas wired back to st croix you are willing to take my name why after all shouldnt i refuse your sacrifice and make one of my own by taking yours wasnt that noble it would have softened the heart of a suffragette or a feminist what did you reply i said never in the world never would have been enough you wasted three words at a dollar or so apiece i wanted to be strong i said never in the world i am not going to have you criticized and nagged and made unhappy as if your name were a crime then he wired but it would remove objections and cost only six thousand a year i had to wait two whole days and nights before i could cable objector will surely meet me in new york she will probably forgive if we are both firm my mind is made up i would rather be a youknowwhat than remain a valentine that was strong enough i meant it to be he has been scurrilously treated and somebody must stand by him now tomorrow february th is his birthday i remember it because we met on st valentines day and it wasnt many hours afterward that i guessed how he felt about me dorothea do you mean to tell me that a man spoke to you of his feelings within twentyfour hours of the time you met no i do not you certainly intimated as much if it wasnt many hours after you met on the th it must have been on the th no you are wrong charlotte it was the evening of the same day we met in the early morning it sounds like a childrens party with an exchange of those snappingmottoes duke is nearly twentyeight you know charlotte so it is simply nonsense to jeer at him you ought to be able to imagine what sort of things would be said between two persons mutually attracted to each other when you remember that he was born on february th and my name is valentine the coincidence simply put ideas into our heads but i wont go on if you dont sympathize i dont actually disapprove not at heart now what has his birthday got to do with tomorrow and st thomas why i cabled him as soon as we arrived at barbados what would you like for a birthday present from the west indies i knew that he would remember we met on st valentines day and an answer could reach me at st thomas couldnt you buy him a souvenir without inquiring at great expense what hed prefer yees but i thought it was a nice affectionate question well well he cabled one word charlotte i guessed that the moment you quoted your message when you asked what shall i bring you from the west indies duke promptly answered yourself charlotte you are positively uncanny how did you manage to hit upon it it doesnt take as much intellect as you fancy you are as transparent as a plate of glass well when he said yourself how did you answer him its the only thing i dont like to tell you but i must i reflected a full halfhour at barbados it was one of those heavenly moonlight nights not suitable for reflection then i wrote a message and sent it to the office by one of the colored waiters so that the hotel people shouldnt read it it said and here she turned her face away from me deliveries from the west indies are uncertain and expensive come and get me do you think that was forward i laughed irresistibly and a long time it certainly was not backward but it was delicious i said at length wiping the tears from my eyes however he seems as impetuous and tempestuous as you so perhaps it doesnt matter you see charlotte i knew that probably he couldnt meet this boat to save his life so i was willing to say come and get me just for fun i hadnt the slightest clue as to when he would receive my message or the sailing dates of steamers from new york everything is so changed in wartimes i know only that the time is slipping away and duke may leave the shipping board at any moment for the trainingcamp i intend to have one brief straightforward talk with mother and declare my purpose we are going to get your mr winthrop to intercede for us too i shall be of age in march and i dont intend to let a mere name stand between me and happiness i think you are right and that your mother will finally agree with you but i still dont see the need of an unusual toilet for tomorrow its for the governor said dolly and one never knows what may happen if a bromidic remark may also be cryptic dorothea you have achieved the combination now i must ask you a direct question for although i am not your keeper but your friend i am not disposed to let you do anything reckless why did you put that idea into dukes head the idea of meeting you in st thomas i wanted to talk things over before seeing mother i knew i could trust him he has some elderly cousins and a sisterinlaw surely between them he could find somebody to bring along with him and i have you safest and wisest of charlottes duke is one of the legal advisers of the shipping board why shouldnt he have business in these islands besides it is a practical impossibility that he should be able to reach st thomas on a given date then why did you suggest it i think charlotte it must have been emptymindedness i regard it as a pure lack of selfcontrol ive practiced selfcontrol for one whole endless year you have practiced filial obedience i grant that but what good do you expect to achieve if duke does surmount the insurmountable and meet you tomorrow what good dolly almost shrieked the question what good do you ask you callous coldhearted charlotte why four heavenly days spent in his society to be sure with you and his chaperon having a lovely time together somewhere not too near and you havent any sneaking idea of marrying him in st thomas because i wont allow it no such luck he wouldnt let me unless mothers attitude has been miraculously changed well i can only say that you have made me very nervous and uncomfortable dolly and i prepared to leave her cabin and cross the narrow space that divided it from mine darling charlotte here she drew me back if you are nervous and uncomfortable it seems that you think theres a bare chance that duke will be in st thomas i know nothing about the possibilities i replied he might persuade the shipping board that he could be of use in this vicinity and of course he would have advantages not possessed by ordinary tourists if you had had any experience with shipping boards charlotte you would know that they can only be moved by chloroform or dynamite besides duke would never do anything underhanded he is too patriotic though of course he is inventive of course and inventiveness is only one of his gifts while his virtues are those of sir galahad king arthur marcus aurelius abraham lincoln and a few others charlotte i dont want to seem harsh but i hope some time you will get a faint inkling of what love really is your heart reminds me of the rock of gibraltar one doesnt wear the rock of gibraltar on ones sleeve at all events i remarked do you mean that if you ever did have a loveaffair you wouldnt confide in me when i adore you so charlotte i mean something of the sort my child at which she made a feint of beating me with her little silver hairbrush but ended in kissing my cheek and whispering goodnight you are a darling even if you have no sentiment morning came we anchored outside st croix at five oclock went through medical inspection at six and if there was anything the matter with dollys heart or mine the physician did not offer any comment then about ten we approached st thomas for the second time if the virgin islands looked beautiful when we first saw them they had grown in beauty during our brief absence and my birthplace in the shining distance was a very dream of loveliness we saw its outline rising above a rim of azure sea with the mountains of porto rico standing out to the westward the great palm groves on the shore led the eye upward to the green hills and the clouds topping the higher peaks gayly painted boats began to come near the diana and naked diving boys slender shapes of brown mahogany plunged into the sea to catch our pennies then we saw the red roofs of charlotte amalia the little park near the landing and the pink toylike fortress with the stars and stripes floating over it dorothea and i stood near the deckrail her hand in mine in her white dress her broad hat wreathed with cornflowers and a scarlet sunshade she looked a youthful columbia so radiant and bewitching that for the first time i secretly hoped marmaduke hogg might triumph over the obstacles in the way and come to meet his ladylove although i saw many embarrassing and awkward situations arising from such a meeting i could not be jealous of so bright and joyous a creature and anyway my own happiness was only a few days distant if i chose to put out my arms and take it there seemed to be a crowd on the dock which was made most unattractive by a colossal mountain of coal that concealed everything behind it the diana made a slow approach but we finally passed the coalheap and came within thirty feet of the shore i could feel dollys heart beat through her pulse that lay under my hand then suddenly her quick eyes searched the outer edge of the crowd and found the shape they were looking for i think i see him i think i am going to faint for i didnt really expect him yes i know it is he though he is wearing summer clothes that i never saw before look charlotte away back near that grove of cocoanuttrees hes with other people i knew he would find somebody give me the glasses theres an elderly man in a panama hat and two ladies and why charlotte take the glasses yourself it cant be but it looks like your winthrop my hand trembled so that i could hardly hold the glass i could scarcely believe dollys eyes or my own but the diana crept nearer and it was true inch by inch the picture grew clearer and then a pathetic surprise met my gaze i could see clive plainly now and felt that he was searching the line of passengers on the dianas deck to find me my heart gave a furious leap to think that a man like my chief would look for only one womans face in that crowd and regard it with all its blemishes as a precious thing duke had separated himself from the little group and was swinging his hat to dorothea but i could not explain why the two men were not standing nearer together and what was the meaning of the wheeled chair with the nurses head rising above the back the identity of the person in the chair was hidden by a tiny black frilled parasol with a handle bent in the middle so that it could be used for a shield did i know that little oldfashioned sunshade i did it was the property of some one whose belongings had a certain air of difference from those of other people she lifted it at last as we came close to the dock and i met ellen winthrops affectionate welcoming glance her eyes swam in unshed tears and mine were so wet i could see only dimly that her beautiful hair was a shade whiter her face paler and thinner that she had aged mysteriously in a month and the hand that was holding the parasol trembled like a leaf she had been very ill there was no doubt of that she had been ordered a voyage and i felt that she had chosen this one because she knew clives wish that meant she was willing to welcome me into the heart of the family perhaps even that she wished to help me fit myself to take her own unique place in her brothers life oh what joy to feel that i could not only take freely all that my chief wanted to give me but that i could be of real service to her down the precipitous landingsteps we went dolly as usual well in the front clive and duke were at the foot awaiting us and as we felt a sense of safety in the midst of strangers dolly flung herself at once into dukes arms while all the male watchers on deck or dock gazed at him with envy finding myself unobserved in this spectacular tableau i could give clive my own greeting as my heart dictated while i told him that his sisters presence answered my last doubt when dolly withdrew from the embrace of her adoring swain rosy joyous unabashed she adjusted her hat from its perilous position on one side of her head and gazed upon clive and me with unflattering astonishment mixed with awe you too perfidious charlotte you neednt deny it i saw you both just finishing not at all miss valentine laughed clive putting out his hand to shake hers we were in fact only just beginning and to think i never suspected when i might have known that you are the only man in the world learned enough and good enough for charlotte you were too absorbed in your own affairs to think about mine missy i said now will you be modest and grateful for the rest of your life since you see that my mr winthrop has brought your young man to st thomas in a discreet manner that you never could have achieved by yourself take me to your sister clive i want her to know without a moments delay how i appreciate her coming with you she has been terribly ill charlotte for ten days after you left it was almost hopeless but at length she rallied and since the doctor insisted on a change of climate her whole heart was bent on coming here she has long suspected our feeling for each other and you will be such a joy to her as well as to me my dear it makes me so happy so happy i faltered my eyes swimming with tears i was so unwilling to take all and give so little now it will be more dont go off by yourselves said dolly be dignified and indifferent like us take mr winthrops arm and ill take dukes here she suited the action to the word theres the governor expecting us to luncheon and not knowing us by sight he wont suspect what has happened but after saluting him and asking him to put some more plates on the table well all walk up to miss winthrops chair and you and i will say goodmorning dear lady let us introduce to you our new possessions our spoils of travel our souvenirs of a seavoyage then duke and mr winthrop will make a profound obeisance and all will be over and so it turned out everybody laughed and chatted dorothea kissed ellen winthrops hand prettily coquetted with clive and began to lay siege to the nurses heart while she riveted the chains by which she held marmaduke hogg in bondage she was in high spirits but she was distinctly nervous and whenever she introduced her fiancй to one of her fellow voyagers she showed a heightened color as she slid quickly over his surname presently clive withdrew a little distance to talk with the governors secretary and dorothea caught the captain on his way from the ship and entangled him in a merry conversation with miss winthrop this gave marmaduke an opportunity to take me aside i suspected that he wanted to confide in me that mrs valentine had made one last determined refusal to receive him as a soninlaw and that after the next few days of seavoyaging we should meet an irate parent at the landing in new york and that there would be metaphorical wigs on the green i confess in that moment as i envisaged the recalcitrant dolly locked in her room and fed upon bread and water that i wished mr marmaduke hogg had remained in washington which is the scene of so many battles that one more or less would not be obvious on the horizon on the contrary his first words were a surprise miss clifford he said no one knows what dolly and i owe to you but what have i done i inquired laughingly oh a thousand things taken my part gently and kindly with mrs valentine and above all allowed dolly to come on this journey with you when she was so utterly confused by her mothers objections to our marriage that she did not know which way to turn its rather a big job for a girl to decide whether shell break her mothers heart or her lovers mrs valentine has no heart save in the physiological sense i interrupted well i have cut the gordian knot continued marmaduke i dont want dolly to know just at first but i have set plans in motion for changing my name back to forrest but you lose six thousand dollars a year i exclaimed it doesnt matter i am offered a new york partnership when the war is over and it wont be very long before i make it up and what about your dear old uncle that hurts me i confess but i think if departed spirits know nothing of our doings it doesnt matter and if they know everything uncle must have kept an eye on mrs valentine and will understand i never thought of leaving the whole matter to uncle i observed im not shifting the responsibility im simply counting on him i always counted on him and he always trusted me if i could get him on a spiritual longdistance telephone he would see that i cannot part an only daughter from her only mother yes ive often thought only children were a mistake they bulk too heavily in the foreground where there are six each one cannot take up so much room exactly you see weve got to go to her mothers to dinner every other sunday when our cooks out ive learned that much about matrimony in advance perhaps you wont be invited well that would be even worse besides she has given up her apartment and leased a charming house does she think that you and dolly are to live with her if she does she is mistaken but to do her justice i dont believe thats her idea at all however she is all settled and awaiting dorothea the house is going to be a surprise dolly will like it the apartment didnt suit her taste a pompous butler is installed i discovered all this when i went to call and conscientiously told her i was going to st thomas with the winthrops he is elderly of course as all the middleaged and young butlers are in khaki and wonderful to relate there is also an aged but wellpreserved footman he dwells on the lower floor and communicates with the butler on the floor above where the drawingand diningrooms are by means of a speakingtube the moment the footman approached me with his what name sir and bawled mr hogg through the tube the butler repeating it resonantly to the boudoir where mrs valentine was sitting at that moment i knew why she had taken the house it was for the speakingtubes i have never before seen a small house in washington with these annunciators the butler and footman were engaged for the same purpose that of bawling mr hogg whenever i called upon dolly after my interview with mrs valentine which was placid for she thanked me coldly for telling her of my proposed journey and said she should go herself but imagined that the steamers were small and uncomfortable and the food villainous however we would talk the whole matter over in new york and come to some decision she then went to the speakingtube and called brown ask jenkins to show mr hogg out please i left the lady and went at once to clive winthrop for advice and began the process of amputating my surname perhaps i shall not call at the x street house till the wedding is over and when the footman asks what name sir i shall say my bachelor name as you may remember was hogg but i am now married and it is forrest philippas nervous prostration a study in nobleness stanwood sanitarium mapleton pennsylvania june first week monday the door has just closed behind one of the most eminent physicians in the state and i am no longer philippa armstrong but a case of neurasthenia an inmate of room number which has a yellow placard over its entrance a placard announcing that no callers are allowed within save with the special permission of dr levi stanwood at present the placard is the only thing i enjoy about the institution that at least promises peace at all events such peace as can be found outside of ones own soul i am counseled to have complete rest cheerful surroundings abstinence from newspapers and letters sound sleep careful and nourishing diet freedom from anxiety gentle tonics with electrical and other treatments underlined upon a printed list the head physician who is a genius in the way of diagnosis seeing through the human system as if it were plate glass has made a careful study of my symptoms and written my cousin sarah that all i need is six or eight weeks of his care to be quite myself again how little they understand us women after all poor blind unsuspicious doctors my heartbeats my color my temperature my pulse my blood pressure even my tongue all these have told no tales to the scientific eye and as it was literally impossible for dr stanwood to discern my malady it was equally beyond him to suggest a remedy as a matter of fact all i need to make and keep me well is large and constant doses of richard morton esq of baltimore but who would confess that to a doctor cousin sarah does not suspect the state of things the gentleman himself is i trust quite ignorant and the doctor will waste upon me all the wealth of curative agencies at his command without effecting the least change in my condition richard morton is an orphan so am i he is young strong goodlooking clever and poor i am the first second and fifth as to ones own beauty and cleverness it is difficult to speak impartially i have thought for nearly six months and indeed i am still inclined to think that richard morton loves me and i was equally certain until a few weeks ago that he was only awaiting a suitable opportunity to declare his love and ask me to marry him i had made up my mind whenever he should put the important question to answer him frankly and joyously in the affirmative not because he is the handsomest or most brilliant or most desirable person in the world but because for sheer lovableness and husbandliness he is unsurpassed and unsurpassable in march cousin sarah made a visit to germantown and met there a mrs taunton richard mortons widowed aunt when the intimacy had progressed sufficiently mrs taunton told cousin sarah one day that she hoped her nephew would eventually marry a certain amy darling a near neighbor of hers that miss darlings father and richards had been friends from boyhood and that they had always planned a marriage between the two young people each an only child of course mr darling who died only this winter did not indulge in any such melodramatic or bookish nonsense as setting down commands or desires in his will nor were any of his bequests dependent upon them he did talk with his daughter however during his last illness and he did leave richard morton a letter expressing his regard and confidence and saying that as his daughter was entirely without relatives he should have felt much happier had he seen her married before his death if he had stopped there all would have been well but he went on he knew he said that amy was one of the sweetest and most attractive girls in the world and if a mutual affection should grow out of her acquaintance with richard he would be glad to know that the fortune he had made by his own energy might be a basis for the future prosperity and business success of his old friends son cousin sarah came home from germantown quite excited by this romance and discussed it with me daily in exasperating unconsciousness that i could feel the least distaste for the subject it seems almost providential philippa she said over her knitting providential for which of them i asked stabbing my sheet of music paper with the pen while i tried in vain to think how many eighth notes would fill a measure for both though i was really thinking of mr morton his business is one that peculiarly requires capital then again he has many interests in philadelphia and there is that beautiful place in germantown with house stable horses and gardens all ready for him and the girl too dont forget her i responded though some men dont care for these readytowear wives they prefer to look about and to choose he would have to look a long distance before he found any one to compare with miss darling either in beauty or suitableness said cousin sarah thereby injecting the first drop of poison in my blood and starting me on the downward path toward nervous prostration miss darling is a mans woman she continued unconsciously giving me another push the type with which neither you nor i have anything in common but which we know to be irresistible now cousin sarah is fiftyfive thin angular erect uncompromising i love and respect her but do not care to be lumped with her in affairs of the heart at least not for thirty years to come and although i think it is disgusting to be labeled a mans woman it is insufferable to be told that one is not i can see amy darling in my minds eye i ventured blonde dimply fluffy as to head willowy as to figure so as to cling the better blue eyes swimming in unshed tears and a manner so exquisitely feminine that she makes all the other women in her vicinity appear independent and mannish but not all men care for pets cousin sarah some of them prefer companions a pet is a companion remarked cousin sarah casually as she left the room giving me thereby an entirely new and most unpleasant thought i have known richard morton for many months and although i have met him very often at other places he has been a constant visitor at our house if he has had any resemblance to a possible suitor why hasnt cousin sarah discovered it is she deaf and blind or have my ears and eyes played me false am i so undesirable that it would never cross her mind that a man might fall in love with me hardly for she is well aware that several men have expressed their willingness to annex my povertystricken charms as i look back upon the weeks that followed the interview with cousin sarah i see that richard was never the same after he received mr darlings letter i felt a nameless difference it was not only that i saw him less frequently but that he gave me less of himself when i did see him i too was on guard and never succeeded in being quite natural i am not so foolish as to give up to another girl a man who loves me simply because she is rich the thought that worries me night and day is this if at the moment he only feels for me friendship ought i to let it grow into love when there is another woman who could give him with herself everything he needs to assure his career with philippa armstrong for a wife he will have to work unceasingly and unless fortune is particularly kind he may not achieve a large success for many years if he marries amy darling soft silly spineless little name he has house lands and money all the influence of her fathers former business associates and has besides carried out his own fathers wishes this is considerable quite enough to make a man reflect and vacillate unless he is so deeply in love already that no temptation is strong enough to assail him richard morton i know likes to dance with me sing with me golf with me talk with me consult with me about his affairs write letters to me and more than that he doesnt like to have other men usurp these privileges but i am not prepared to say that he would pine away if circumstances removed me altogether from his path at any rate these perplexities have been too much for my peace of mind and when richard morton announced that he had business which would keep him in philadelphia for a month i began to feel physically ill and unable to bear cousin sarahs sympathy her curiosity even at last her proximity when the doctor advised my coming here to this quiet restful place i eagerly embraced the opportunity simply because i could be alone and because i need not meet richard until he had enjoyed a full month of amy darlings society either succumbing to its fascination or resisting it as the case might be would it be nobler of me to give him up before he is really mine knowing that in this way i am advancing his worldly interests this is the question that i hope solitude will help me to answer but its complications and sideissues are so many that i feel dazed by their number and their difficulty i went to sleep last night echoing the old negros prayer thou knowest whats about right lord now do it tuesday am nurse gives me an alcohol bath she takes my pulse and temperature and enters them in the bedside record book afterwards reading me my dietlist it seems i do not belong to the favored class which to be cured is stuffed with pleasant things to eat my symptoms demand a simple unexciting bill of fare oclock breakfast fruit in season this is its only name but everybody knows it by sight poweretta grits with cream graham muffins wheatoata process coffee hot fomentations drop of blood extracted from ear and subjected to examination glass of certified milk visit from physician dinner barley broth lamb chop hominy or rice breadandbutter pudding custard sauce to silent hour static electricity weight taken cold pack cup of predigested maltese milk visit from head nurse supper cornetta mush poached egg on wholewheat toast sterilized stewed apples zephyrettes cup of somnolina a beverage from which everything pleasant and harmful has been extracted by a beneficent process miss blossom the nurse insists on reading to me it is not a good performance but it doesnt matter i know that dick and amy darling are just starting for the theater tepid sponge bath massage glass of peptonized water temperature and pulse taken lights out never in all my twentyfive years of life have i passed a busier or more exhausting day wednesday precisely like tuesday save for some new experiences in diet there was a mild processdrink called cocoatina teaette also made its appearance there were dolls mattresses of shredded excelsior moistened with milk nut salad and grahamata mush i could never have supposed so many new cereals could be invented there is mush in the evening mush in the morning mush when its looked for and mush without warning it is rather like the immortal charge of the light brigade oats to the right of them corn to the left of them wheat to the north of them grits to the south of them into the valley of mush rode the two hundred thursday i was allowed to sit on my balcony for an hour this morning this would have been a pleasant change had i not heartily disliked at first sight my nextdoor neighbor who was sitting on the adjoining balcony at noon she sent me a bunch of pansies and her card mrs grosvenor chittendenffollette among fifty or sixty attendants there are always a few who gossip in spite of repeated warnings from the authorities sometimes it is a young nurse sometimes a masseuse a manicure or a shampooer but there are always those who retail the news mostly innocent news of an institution like this coldpacking or rubbing or spraying or electrifying or brushing or polishing all these operations open the floodgates of speech and no damming process is effectual miss phoebe blossom is the herald who proclaims tidings of various kinds in my room and there is also a neophyte in the electricity department who is always full of information and quite unable to retain it it would be almost more than human to ask them to be silent when they are the only links with the world outside a system reduced to nothingness by a supper of wheatoata coffee crackerdust croquettes cosmos with milk and a choice of cerealina nuttetta proteinetta or glucosa is in no fit state to resist gossip it seems that mrs chittendenffollette is more than a mere woman she is a remarkable case and has proved a worldwide advertisement for this sanitarium dr stanwood has almost effected a cure her disease has had to be named and her symptoms have been written up in all the medical journals i dont know what sort of person she was before she became a case but she is now a greater tyrant than caligula or catherine of russia as to her disease she has those things that she ought not to have and she has not those things that she ought to have and there is no health in her or at least there was not until she came here a year ago now she is strong enough to perambulate in the corridor a little while each morning or be wheeled along the boardwalk in the afternoon and when she hears that some of the other patients are suffering she sneers at their modest uninteresting ailments and glances in at their doors with halfdisguised contempt you know the expression of the prize dog who is borne from the show hung with medals and ribbons how he gazes on the little mongrel curs that gather with the crowd in the streets her name chittendenffollette is of as vital importance as her medicaljournal malady when the third floor is in dire confusion when mrs parks has hysterics and miss simmons is crying for her mother and mrs bells hotwater bottle has burst in the bed and miss phipps has discovered that the undergraduate has bandaged the wrong ankle miss blossom sometimes becomes flustered and hurried and calls her patient mrs follett whereupon she says chittendenffollette if you please if by any chance she sees the chittendenffollette without the hyphen in the nurses bedside record book or scribbled on the morning paper she doesnt need any stimulant the rest of the day the omission of the hyphen sends up her pulse and temperature to the required point for several hours though there is always a reaction afterward ive told dr levi that i should name one of her complaints hyphenitis the occasional operation performed on the hyphen by miss blossom or the young lady at the stationery counter might be called hyphenotomy everybody detests mrs chittendenffollette but as the banner patient of the sanitarium she must be treated with respectful consideration all americas most skillful physicians have struggled with her organism they have tried to get her symptoms into line so to speak so as to deduce some theory from the grand array of phenomena but the symptoms courteously decline to point in any one direction when the doctors get seven eighths of them in satisfactory relation there are always two or three that stay out and sulk refusing to collaborate in any sort of harmony they act precisely like an obstinate jury in that they calmly refuse to agree and then mrs chittendenffollette appeals to a higher court where flaws in the testimony are always found judgment is reversed and a new trial ordered the greatest surgeons in europe have left the bedsides of crowned heads to ponder over her inscrutable mysteries and have returned to their sovereigns crushed and humbled all this attention would have upset a stronger character than hers and now that she is in a fair way to recover her pride will have its inevitable fall though much more agreeable and docile than when she entered she is in uniformly low spirits the truth is she liked being an unsolved mystery and she is a good deal nettled at being found at last both soluble and curable obliged to live like an expresident on the glories of the past friday buckle in his history of civilization claims that men and women are divided into three classes the first and lowest talks of persons the second of things and the third and highest of ideas i should divide the human race into four instead of three classes and name as the lowest those persons who discuss their symptoms the patients here are counseled not to do it so the vice is reduced to a minimum being practiced say not more than three out of the fourteen waking hours swinging in a hammock in a shady nook this afternoon the conversation that floated to me under my distant tree was somewhat after this fashion mrs a once i had neurasthenia for three months i couldnt be moved in bed and for nine weeks i couldnt turn my head on the pillow mrs b mercy mrs c oh mrs a mrs d good gracious mrs e cerebrospinal meningitis is worse than neurasthenia i had it four years ago and the doctor said hed never seen a woman live that was as ill as i was one night my temperature was mrs c goodness mrs b thats pretty high mrs a are you sure mrs e yes im perfectly sure or at least i think i am i am seldom wrong on figures mrs a i asked because ive noticed here that the thermometers register only and i wondered how they measured the temperature when it rose above that point mrs e huffily probably they have extra long thermometers for extreme cases mrs f i am glad that in this sanitarium they take the temperature by tucking the barometerthing under the arm my doctor at home always puts it under the tongue and it is a perfect nuisance he never gets it well placed but that i think of something i want to say then of course i have to keep still for three minutes which seem three hundred and by that time i have either forgotten it or changed my mind so there i am mrs g just after my youngest child was three years old mrs f interrupting i was going to say when mrs e spoke about the barometer that after i was engaged to mr f i had a dreadful attack of brain fever i was ill in bed three months and they couldnt touch a brush to my hair for nine days mrs d horrors mrs e dreadful mrs c heavens mrs g bravely just after my youngest child was three mrs x a man patient was brought on to our floor this morning mrs s our floor i wish they would have separate corridors for male patients mrs x this gentleman is an old friend of dr levis his wife has been here four weeks and now hes been taken ill so theyve put him next her on the first floor mrs s i dont care i hate to have him near us mrs b why hes perfectly harmless he is too ill to move mrs c im sure i wish he could anything to relieve this hideous dullness whats the matter with him i wonder mrs d ill ask miss oaks when i have my hot fomentations this afternoon she knows everything and shes as generous as a prince with her knowledge mrs g patiently just after my youngest child was a nurse passes through the grove bearing a sterilized tray with peptonized preparations on it mrs y calling her nurse whats the matter with the new manpatient on our floor nurse discreetly i dont know mrs y mrs x as the nurse vanishes she does but shes a stiff thing anyway i heard the attendants whispering about him in the corridor before breakfast something i think its an organ is floating about in him all floating what kind of an organ horrors mrs x i couldnt understand exactly you know people always roar if they have nothing particular to say but if it is interesting they whisper i distinctly heard the word floating i dont know whether its one of his regular organs or something he swallowed accidentally mrs c plaintively doctors are never satisfied if anything floats they want to get it stationary and if its stationary they want to cut it loose mrs g just after my youngest child mrs b they say mrs h is going to leave tomorrow she doesnt like the food or the service mrs e goodness she has all the service there is on our floor nobody else gets a chance she spends her whole silent hour pushing the electric button mrs d yes miss oaks declares she lays on it she says that the head nurse told mrs h she must ring less frequently or the bell would be removed miss oaks says the patients that pay the smallest rates always ring the bells most it isnt fair that a thirtydollar patient should annoy a whole row of eightydollar ones and prevent their bells from being answered mrs x theres nothing made out of mrs h at thirty dollars a week she was as contented as possible last night but this morning she wanted her bed in the other corner awnings put on the windows and the bureau changed for a chiffonier come we must all go in for treatment it wants five minutes of four mrs g in despair as she sees the occupants of the hammocks dispersing almost shrieks just after my youngest but the ladies for some reason or other do not care to hear anything about mrs gs youngest and she is obliged to seek another audience saturday the doctor found me overtreated this morning and advised a day of quiet with a couple of hours on the roofgarden or under the trees i have heard at various times sighs of weariness or discontent or pain issuing from the room opposite mine and this afternoon when miss blossom had gone into number to sit with the haughty mrs chittendenffollette i stole across the corridor and glanced in at the halfopen door of number the quaintest girl raised herself from a mound of sofapillows and exclaimed why you beautiful thing are you number i didnt know you looked like that its very kind of you i answered blushing at this outspoken greeting but i am not beautiful in the least it is because you do not expect much from a person who has just crept out of bed i dont look any better when i am dressed for a party you dont need to she said now get on my bed and cuddle under the afghan and well talk till miss blossom comes back wont she beat you for being out of your room why are you here you havent the least resemblance to a rest cure what is the matter with you backache sideache shoulderache headache sensation of handcuffs on wrists balls and chains on ankles lack of appetite and insomnia is that all havent you any disease i believe not i answered humbly but the effect is the same as if i had why are you here i asked in return as i looked admiringly at her shining brown hair plump rosy cheeks and dancing eyes i came here so to speak in response to an ideal not my ideal i never have any but laura simondss she is my dearest friend and one of the noblest girls you ever knew she said the separation from the world would do us both good and so it might if she could have stayed to keep me company now she has the world and i have the separation she isnt here then no worse luck she is always working and planning for the good of others but she is constantly meeting with ingratitude and misunderstanding she had just brought me here when she was telegraphed for to turn about and go home you see she had sent two ailing slum children to be taken care of at her house and it proved to be scarlet fever and of course her stepmother took it the first thing shes a hateful person and takes everything she can get and then the cook followed suit now they blame laura and she has to find trained nurses and settle everything before she comes back to me then youre not an invalid i thought you were in pain and couldnt reach the bell thats the reason i looked in oh dear no i was only yawning i came for what laura calls the healing influence of solitude but laura thought as the place was so expensive and treatment was included wed better take turkish baths massage and electricity theyre so good for the complexion i have a little table to myself in the convalescents diningroom and havent made any acquaintances i cant stand their sweetbread complexions and their double chins the patients are all so fat they might sing isaac watts hymn in unison much of my time has run to waist it is not an inspiring assemblage i agreed though i havent seen them all together as you have and they think of nothing but themselves which is exactly what i want to think about myself i mean theres one charming girl on this floor somethings the matter with her solar plexus and they wont allow her to talk so we have had some nice conversations in the silent hour theyve told me now i mustnt call again it seems that i was too exciting tell me something about yourself vashti i am sure thats your name or semiramis or zenobia or judith and if it isnt one or another of those i dont want to hear what it is for you wouldnt look like it just here a page brought in a letter which she glanced through with an excuse me please oh dear now laura cant come tomorrow she is certainly the most unfortunate being in the universe she became very much interested in a deaf man that she met in her settlement work and so as to give the poor thing employment she appointed him superintendent of the working boys club now the working boys refuse to play with him and the directors have had a meeting asking laura to remove him at once i do think they might have endured him one season when i gave him a twentydollar eartrumpet but some people are utterly unreasonable and here i am in need of advice every moment and laura kept in the city havent you any family not a soul have you no one but a cousin i believe nobody nice and interesting has a family nowadays laura has no one but an uncongenial stepmother and that is the reason we are so intimate i am so giddy and frivolous and laura is so noble and selfsacrificing that i try to form myself on her now and then when im not too busy you live with her do you oh no i dont live anywhere in particular of course i have a house and a lady housekeeper but she doesnt count ive been staying mostly with a mrs beckett an old friend of my mothers she is the dearest and loveliest woman in the world and i cant bear to be away from her why cant she join forces with you if you are so alone in the world because theres a son is he too young or too old to join forces no hes just right and hed be only too glad to join forces or anything else that had me in it but he mustnt and thats the reason laura made me come here and with this she punched the sofapillows rebelliously looking more like an enraged angora kitten than anything else its your hour for cold spray said jimmy the pageboy peeping in at the crack of the door ill come she responded unwillingly now do steal in again she whispered turning to me for i must talk to somebody and if laura could see you i know she would think you safer than anybody here that afternoon as i swung in my hammock in the grove below the sanitarium i looked up at its three stories of height and its rows upon rows of windows and wondered how many cases of neurasthenia under its roof were traceable to a conflict between love and conscience i begin to have an interest in that chatterbox neighbor of mine i thought drowsily and that after vowing not to make an acquaintance in this place love will be a side dish not the roast in her bill of fare if i am any judge of character and why does her laura attempt to stem the natural tide of events it is almost wicked of the fates to give such a featherhead any problems to solve she ought to have her whatshisname beckett if she wants him particularly if he wants her as for the noble laura i long to make her acquaintance i can almost hear the uncongenial stepmother the feverish cook and the infuriated directors clamoring for a providence to remove her from their field of vision and substitute some thoroughly practical and ignoble person in her stead sunday i was very happy all the morning so happy that i forgot my tonics massage and sedative tablets but the doctor called at noon and spoke of the wonderful way in which my system responded to his remedies so i said nothing cousin sarah forwarded me a letter from richard morton who is superintending some surveying near a small town in pennsylvania he knows that i am not well and away from home on a visit to the country but of course he is not aware of my exact whereabouts it was just one of his gay friendly letters with an undertone of something warmer in it among other things he said how weak a thing is man now that you are so far away and i am exiled in a village where there is but one post a day i suffer pangs of hunger for a word from you so far the one daily mail would have been all too ample for your desires since you have not written a word as yet but there is always the hope i have been speculating tonight upon the frightful risks and dangers surrounding the man who is waiting for a letter it seems to me the very best postal service is inadequate to take care of a letter from you to me think of the uncertainties and perils to which it is exposed in transit you give it to a maid to drop in a pillar postbox but she may forget and leave it in her pocket or she may lose it or say she drops it in it must be removed from the box by an ordinary human being who has no conception of the issues involved in the rigid performance of this particular duty the letter is then taken to the branch office of your section then to the general post and then to the railway where new dangers menace its precious existence the train may be robbed and if a single letter is stolen it will be yours to me no man alive could resist a letter of yours after he had once read one is there not a note of tenderness here a note that has crept in only during the last few months but what if there is it occurred to me after dinner that the question of his feeling for me is not the only nor even the principal one to be considered the point under advisement is shall i allow him to love me when there is something better in store for him miss blossom had scarcely left my room this evening when i heard a pattering step and a hurried tap on my door on my saying come my opposite neighbor slipped in and turned the key in the lock it was an unconventional and amusing performance but i didnt mind somehow one couldnt mind anything with such a spoiled baby goodevening zuleika she said no you neednt smile and raise your finger at me as if you were dying to tell me your name is abigail miss blossom has gone for the night hasnt she i thought so you know its the nurses ball this evening and theres only one attendant on duty in each corridor from now to halfpast nine may i have this big chair by the window i am so bored with this place that it excites me even to think how stupid it is i almost wish i had a symptom or two just by way of sensation did you have somnolina for supper i did and some time i shall make a scene in the diningroom when i watch the hundred and fifty dyspeptics simultaneously lifting cups of teaette or somnolina to their parched lips you ought to be ashamed i chided when you know almost every one who is here needs to be put upon a diet you wouldnt expect champagne terrapin and canvasback ducks i know it dont scold it makes you look like cassandra isnt the moonlight enchanting and if this werent a health resort wouldnt it be a heaven upon earth the broad unscreened windows were wide open and vines of woodbine or honeysuckle framed them on every side a lake shone like a silver mirror in the distant landscape and the elms and maples and chestnuts swayed in the summer breeze little groups chatted on the broad piazzas and here and there on a rustic bench in the moonlight sat a man and a woman two minds with but a single thought and that thought his or her own solar plexus it was an hour for confidences and i remember that my troubled heart cried out for a strong tried friendship on which to draw for counsel and sympathy what wonder then that the angora kitten deprived of her laura emptied her silky little head of some of its worries divining that i was older and graver and perhaps would find her lost ball and give it to her to play with again theres no telling when laura will be here she exclaimed despairingly when there is any duty within a thousand miles she stays to perform it mrs beckett has poisoned herself with mercury and laura thinks she ought to go and nurse her for a day or two as if mrs beckett hadnt six maids and twenty thousand a year to spend in nurses laura cant bear tom his incurable levity gets on her nerves and why she wants to martyr herself by staying in the house with him when id be only too glad to go passes my comprehension i cant explain it but at this juncture i seemed to have visions of laura flirting with the beckett during the kittens absence sometimes she continued rippling along as if natural speech had been denied her for hours sometimes i wish i hadnt selected such a superior being for a bosom friend and then again i despise myself for harboring such a mean feeling im forever trying to climb and laura is continually trying to drag me to her level but i suppose i dont belong there and thats the reason i keep slipping off and sliding down at this minute if shed let me be the groveling little earthworm i am by nature i could marry tom beckett and be as happy as the day is long what is the matter i asked sympathetically though rather ashamed to drop a plummet into so shallow a brook if you love his mother so dearly and love him too and are sure of his affection why dont you marry him isnt he suitable oh yes hes almost too suitable thats one of the lions in the way his family is good he is as handsome as apollo and he has a much larger income than mine but you see theres another man another man you didnt mention him yesterday didnt i how funny but after all it was our very first interview and even silly i have my reserves do you love them both equally i asked trying to keep the note of sarcasm out of my voice certainly not i care nothing about anybody but tom beckett but laura says that such a marriage will simply mean a life of selfindulgent luxury idleness and pleasure she says marriage is something loftier and nobler than pleasing ones self that it ought to mean growth and development both to the man and the woman she says that i should have no influence on tom and that i need somebody strong and serious to steady me she says tom and i would only frisk through life and leave the world no better or wiser than we found it she even says and here she turned her face to the honeysuckles i dont like to repeat it but laura is so advanced she makes my embarrassment seem simply idiotic she even says that the children of such a union would be incurably lightminded and trivial and oh zuleika if one isnt a bit advanced in any way doesnt it seem hard to keep from marrying somebody you love just for the good of a few frivolous children youve never seen in your life it was neither the place the hour nor the subject for laughter but i forgot my neurasthenia and gave way to a burst of wholehearted mirth every second of time seemed to increase the unconscious humor of her point of view and only fear of the nurse on duty in the corridor enabled me to control myself at all have i been funny she asked delightedly as she drew her head in the window i never can see my own jokes but im glad to have amused you only i did hope for a little sympathy everybody cant be zenobias and vashtis and lauras superior to common weaknesses i do i do sympathize i said wiping the tears of merriment from my eyes and i agree with you much more than with laura now the other man is i suppose all that is grave and reverend a complete contrast to the too trivial thomas yes and hes as good as good can be trustworthy talented honorable everything you know the kind i never get on with them does he love you laura thinks he does but ive no reason to suppose so weve always been friends while tom beckett and i squabble and make up twice a week but anyway even if he doesnt adore me in toms silly way laura says i ought not to mind she says it would be noble of me to help him to a splendid and prosperous career and thinks i ought to remember how much my father wanted him for a soninlaw you see he is awfully poor at this coupling of fathers and poverty a sudden light blazed in upon my consciousness and i sat bolt upright among the sofapillows how could i have guessed that the loveaffairs of this rosycheeked dumpling the casual acquaintance of a restcure could have any connection with my own if she hadnt been the sort of person who confides at first sight we should have learned each others names at the beginning and been on guard the truth is i had thought of no one but tom beckett in her confessions the personality of the other man had stolen into the chronicle so late in the day that i had taken no interest in him are you amy darling i asked her plump yes but how mean of you to pump blossom i wanted to go on thinking of you as zuleika and have you call me something imaginary and romantic i am philippa armstrong did you ever hear the name no but its all right it looks like you and its nearly as pretty as zenobia now if tom beckett had only chosen you and i could have obliged laura by falling in love with dont mention the other mans name i cried hastily it just comes to me that i may have met him met dick morton it was true then here was the girl whom richard ought for his worldly good to marry and she was not a woman at all only an angora kitten and moreover a kitten in love with tom beckett yes i have met him but i only this moment suspected it have you known him long less than a year that settles it she cried leaping to her feet excitedly if dick morton has known you for a year he wont want me and i can marry tom goody goody goody stuff and nonsense i said quickly richard morton is only a very dear friend stuff and nonsense yourself no man with an eye in his head could be a dear friend to you and dick morton is the hero sort who doesnt care for dottie dimples but worships vashtis and zuleikazenobias have you any money not a penny oh dear i might have known you wouldnt have with that hair and those eyes never mind im certain that dick would rather have a pauper goddess than a rich little earthworm you mustnt talk any more about the matter i said with as much dignity as i could muster in the midst of her laughterprovoking nonsense which made the most sacred subjects seem a natural matter of discussion i know through mrs taunton all about the circumstances your fathers wishes and his letter to richard if you can possibly love him you must accept him advance his fortunes and do your duty by your father i am determined to be as noble as laura simonds in this matter and i refuse to be a stumblingblock the girl fell limply into the loungingchair oh she said despondently if you are going to be noble too theres no use discussing the matter what an example we shall be for the heathen nations you will be noble and give up dick morton i shall be noble and marry him and be noble at the same time in giving up tom tom will be noble in suffering me to marry anybody but himself dick will be noble in obliging my father and marrying me instead of you laura is always noble we could use up a whole order of nobility among us and it is all so silly do you suppose my dear father would want four of us to be unhappy his own daughter among them its really only laura who matters and if you had any ingenuity you could pacify her and persuade her that it is my duty for once to follow my ignoble inclinations i am afraid of her but you neednt be you could blaze and flash and tower if you only would and save us all you seem to forget i urged that mr morton has never asked me to marry him thats nothing he has probably been thinking how he could get me nicely disposed of or how he could earn a roof under which he could ask you to step in wet weather hes been too stupid and moody and dull this last winter for any use and now i understand him has he ever seen you like this with your rebeccaatthewell hair down certainly not i thought so or hed have forgotten the necessary roof come in goodness its your room and i locked the door do excuse me ill open it a telegram for you wait outside for an answer jimmy i tore open the envelope confidently expecting that cousin sarah had been struck with paralysis instead of which i read archville pennsylvania june have this moment secured a large and important contract assuring two years lucrative work may i come to see you immediately name earliest day r m i handed the message to the kitten who read it and exclaimed i knew he was only waiting for the roof you see he doesnt worry about my prospects selfish pig answer it and say thursday you can get well by thursday cant you for i want to send for tom on the same day theres a polo game at home on saturday and tom has a new motor car tell dick the best hotel in the town is the brooks house i must wire to laura too i shall
