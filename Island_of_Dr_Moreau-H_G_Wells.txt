chapter one lost and found i was one of the few lucky passengers on the lady vain when the ship went down in the pacific in february i found myself in a small boat with another passenger helmar and a sailor i never knew the sailors name a fourth man jumped from the ship trying to reach us but his head hit the side of the ship he went down under the water and never came up again we had only a little bread and a small container of water on board on the first day the sea was very rough and we were almost thrown out of the boat but then the sea became calmer and that danger passed we spoke little most of the time we did not move we lay under the hot sun looking out across the ocean on the fourth day we had no more water to drink we became very thirsty then on the sixth day helmar finally spoke of the idea that was already in all our minds we need to kill someone then the other two can drink his blood helmar had two longer sticks and one shorter one the person with the short stick had to die but the sailor chose the short stick and he did not accept the result the love of life was too strong in him he attacked helmar and the two men fought i tried to help helmar but as i was going towards them the boat moved suddenly helmar and the sailor fell straight over the side together and went down like stones in my weak state i lay in the boat laughing quietly i did not know why i was laughing but for many minutes i could not stop after that i did nothing i thought about drinking sea water that way i could die more quickly but i was too weak even for this on the eighth day i saw a sail far away across the sea i remember thinking how strange a ship is coming but too late because im already dead hour after hour i lay with my head on the side of the boat and the sail came closer and closer i did nothing to call the ship to me but still it came i remember seeing the side of the ship next to my boat and then nothing i woke in a small untidy room on board the ship a young man was sitting by my bed holding my wrist he had fair hair a thick moustache and grey watery eyes the man started speaking suddenly from above us came the sound of metal against metal and then the low angry growl of an animal the man showed no surprise but repeated his question how do you feel now i tried to speak but no sound came from my mouth luckily the man saw the question in my eyes you were found in a small boat you had no food or drink i looked at my hand terribly thin with the skin hanging off it suddenly i remembered my long days lost at sea have some of this said the man offering me a red drink it tasted like blood but i drank it all i soon felt a bit stronger you are lucky that i know about medicine said the man what ship is this i asked slowly and painfully these were my first words for many days the ipecacuanha oh and im montgomery the noise above us began again youll be ok now continued montgomery youve been asleep for almost thirty hours you know i heard a number of dogs up above can i eat i asked of course the cook is already preparing a meal for you that sounds wonderful i replied but tell me what happened to you why were you alone in that boat damn that noise he stood up suddenly and left the room he shouted at someone for a minute then returned well you were starting to tell me your story he said i told him my name edward prendick i was i said travelling in the pacific because of my interest in natural history he was excited by this and told me about his own days as a biology student in london he asked me many questions about his favourite places in the city the university the shops and most of all the clubs they were happy days he said sadly but then i did something ally and it all ended suddenly ten years ago now ill just go and ask the cook about your food the growls above us started again even louder and angrier whats that i called after him but the door was already closing montgomery came back a minute later with some food and in my excitement at the wonderful smell i forgot about the animal noises chapter two the ipecacuanha i spent the day either eating or sleeping the next morning i felt a stronger and got out of bed montgomery lent me some clothes they were too big montgomery was a tall man but since my own clothes were destroyed i was very grateful to him as i dressed he told me about the ipecacuanhas captain davis hes drunk most of the time but i dont have to worry about him for much longer im getting off the ship soon where i asked surprised were we not still in the middle of the pacific ocean at the island where i live i dont think it has a name he gave me a hard look no more questions his eyes seemed to say then i followed him out of the room for a walk around the ship on the ladder to the top part of the ship there was a man in our way i could only see the mans back but even from this view he seemed strange he was very short and wide with a hairy neck and a head that was in front of not above his shoulders he wore dark blue work clothes and had long thick black hair the man heard our steps and looked round with the speed of an animal his face was even stranger than his body he had black skin and dark eyes with almost no white in them his mouth was shaped more like a bears or a dogs than a mans with the largest teeth that you can imagine the ugliness of this man hit me like a wave and in my weak state i almost fell but montgomery held my arm and helped me towards the ladder get out of our way mling he shouted at the man you shouldnt be here your place is at the front of the ship with the sailors they dont want me with them replied the man called mling they dont want you with them dont be so stupid go i say mling moved away slowly and i followed montgomery up the ladder at the top i discovered where all the animal noises were coming from there were lots of dogs tied up in one corner in another corner was a puma in a cage that was too small for it rabbits also in cages filled the rest of the space there were bits of animal food everywhere and the smell was terrible suddenly there was a cry from the front of the ship and someone shouted angrily the strange man with the black face mling ran towards us followed by a man with red hair and a white hat when the dogs saw mling they became even noisier than before he stopped near them for a second the other man reached him and hit him hard between the shoulders mling fell down next to the dogs crying out in pain the dogs growled angrily and jumped on him some sailors came to watch with interest they did not try to help stop that shouted montgomery hurrying towards them mling finally pushed the dogs away and stood up he held on to the side of the ship clearly afraid of the redhaired mans next move montgomery reached them this must stop captain he said angrily holding on to the redhaired mans arm i stood behind montgomery the captain turned and looked at us rudely his body moved from side to side as he stood there he was clearly drunk what must stop he laughed mling is your passenger keep your hands off him or damn you montgomery this is my ship and i make the rules mling works for me dont hurt him again do you hear the captain looked at montgomery sleepily for about a minute damn scientists he finally said in reply montgomery was getting very angry hes drunk montgomery i said to him he wont listen when lies like this hes always drunk montgomery answered does that give him permission to hit his passengers my ship the captain said waving his hand at the cages was a clean ship look at it now you agreed to take the animals shouted montgomery and why do you want animals like these on your damn island hey and that man of yours hes not a man hes a monster you leave him alone i say continued montgomery ill cut out his insides if he comes to the front of the ship again sailors only at the front cut out his damn insides i will damn you and damn your crazy island the captain continued to shout at montgomery for some time montgomery took a step towards him i did not want a fight on board so i stopped him hes drunk i said just leave him the captain started shouting rudely again thats enough i shouted back at him if was not sensible to shout at the captain of course i was alive only as a result of his help and i had no money to pay for my journey on his ship for some time he shouted angrily about his kindness to me but there was no fight between montgomery and the captain and for that i was grateful chapter three montgomerys island late that evening we saw land far out to sea and the ship turned towards it we were nearing montgomerys island after supper montgomery and i stood outside talking under the stars i was interested to know more about his animals and his island home but he seemed uncomfortable with my questions so i soon changed the subject we spoke about london and about science but as we talked my questions grew stronger in my mind why was a man of science living on an unknown island in the middle of the pacific why was he taking the puma rabbits and dogs there and who was that strange man who worked for him i heard a noise behind me and turned montgomerys dark assistant was standing a few steps from us he looked quickly towards me for a second or two his eyes shone red in the lights of the ship it frightened me terribly i thought of the stories that i read as a child of monsters and strange animals of the night then the man looked away and montgomery was saying im going to bed now therell be lots to do in the morning i followed him down the ladder and went to my room i slept little that night i was woken many times both by the noises of the dogs and by my terrible dreams early the next morning i woke to a new sound someone above me was pushing the animal cages across the ship i climbed the ladder at the top six men were carrying the puma in his cage to the side of the ship a large man with white hair was now on board talking to montgomery next to them was a ladder down to a small boat that was waiting below the captain davis was there too well soon have a clean ship again he was shouting it was clear that he was still drunk when the captain saw me his rudeness from the night before began again this was no surprise to me but i never for a second imagined his next move pointing to the ladder down the side of the ship davis shouted that way that way mr nomoney i dont understand i said what do you mean i mean that were cleaning out the ship no room for mr nomoney its time for you to go that way i say that way i looked at the captain in surprise it was clear from his face that this was not a joke but i was not too worried the idea of a journey across the ocean with the drunk captain and his unfriendly sailors was not much fun and i wanted to find out more about montgomery and his mysterious island i turned to montgomery but the whitehaired man next to him said quickly we cant have you you cant have me i asked very worried now well captain i began he stopped me that way now mr nomoney if they dont want you well put you back in your boat the boat from the lady vain you cant stay with us go i say but montgomery i cried he shook his head and looked quickly at the man with white hair hes the boss i cant help you he seemed to say i looked from the captain to montgomery to the man with white hair i cried to each man to help me but none of them listened when all of montgomerys things were in his masters boat it moved away from our ship towards a beach on the island with montgomery his master and mling on board the sailors then threw me roughly into the little boat where my troubles began twelve days before it was half full of water and had no food or drink on board they pushed the boat out to sea i lay in the water at the bottom of it crying like a baby luckily montgomerys master saw me in my boat and changed his mind he turned his boat round to help me i stopped crying but my need was urgent with so much water on board my boat was going down fast they had no space for me there were three men from the island in their boat with montgomery his master mling and all the animals and boxes from the ipecacuanha but i used a cup from their boat to get out the water in the bottom of mine then we tied the two boats together and they pulled me slowly to land as we travelled in this way i looked more carefully at the people in the boat i now saw that montgomerys master the whitehaired man was quite old sixty or more i remembered from the ipecacuanha that he was a very tall man but as he sat next to the other three men from the island his head only reached their shoulders were the men of this island the tallest in the world their height was not the only unusual thing about them they had long straight black hair like the hair on a horses neck and they were covered from head to foot in dirty white cotton under the cotton i could see dark strangelyshaped faces with bright eyes and big teeth as i looked at them i started to feel ill i quickly looked away we were nearing the island there was a beach of grey sand with tall trees behind it between the trees was a simple house circled by a big stone wall soon we landed on the beach the three men in white cotton helped montgomery to carry the boxes onto the sand i realised then that they were not very tall but their bodies were unusually long and the top part of their legs very short their knees moved in a very strange way when they walked as the whitehaired man passed them with the dogs the dogs growled angrily at them i smiled gratefully as montgomerys master came towards me montgomery says that youre a man of science he said were scientists here too you know biologists youll probably be with us for twelve months or more ships dont pass this island very often chapter four dr moreau the whitehaired man turned and walked quickly towards the house up the hill i went to talk to montgomery youve saved me again i said gratefully well this islands not exactly london he replied i cant promise that youll enjoy yourself here youll have to be careful with he stopped suddenly can you help me with these rabbits he carried a cage of rabbits from the boat to the beach opened the cage door and threw the rabbits onto the sand go and have lots of babies he said as they ran towards the trees there isnt much meat to eat on the island he explained to me were hoping that the rabbits will make good food i helped montgomery with the rabbits until the whitehaired man returned then the three of us walked together to the stone wall that circled the house well montgomery what are we going to do with him the whitehaired man asked he cant come into the house but he cant stay out here either we dont have time to build him a new house he should have my room answered montgomery he can use the outside door the whitehaired man opened an outside door with a heavy key and we all went inside there was another door on the far side of the room into the garden behind the stone wall the door was half open montgomery quickly crossed the room and locked the door keep that door closed at all times his master said to me we dont want any accidents he gave montgomery a strange look and we must get you some food he continued we didnt invite you here of course but youre our guest now well try to make you comfortable then he walked out of the room by the outside door the room was small but pleasant there was a little bed a table and chair and some books about medicine we usually have our meals in here said montgomery then he followed his master outside moreau he shouted moreau moreau i thought where have i heard that name before montgomerys assistant mling came into the room bringing home coffee a plate of vegetables and a bottle of whisky as he put the loud on the table his long hair fell in front of his face i saw one of his ears it had a sharp point at the top and was covered in thick hair your breakfast mr prendick he said as he left the room i started to eat the food gratefully but i left the whisky i have never been a drinker suddenly i remembered moreau he was in all the papers eight maybe ten years before an important biologist a very successful man but then a newspaper sent someone to work as his assistant there were terrible stories about the animals that he used in his experiments a dog escaped from his laboratory without any skin on its body other animals were found there in terrible pain the newspapers attacked moreau and his work and no one in the scientific world defended him he had to close his laboratory i was sure that this was the same man perhaps it was too hard for moreau to stop his work perhaps he chose to continue it on an island far from home this idea explained the puma and the other animals from the ipecacuanha but why were moreau and montgomery trying to keep everything secret from me laboratory work on animals was not very pleasant but to a man of science like me it was not so terrible was there something more something about mling and those other strange men on the island my mind filled with possible explanations each one more terrible than the last at about one oclock montgomery came into the room mling was following him carrying our lunch some bread a bowl of salad a bottle of whisky and some water moreau isnt stopping for lunch today said montgomery hes too busy with his work moreau i said i know that name damn do you well youll understand something about the mysteries in the laboratory then whisky no thanks i replied i dont drink very sensible it was drink that brought me here i drank too much and did something silly moreau offered his help and how stupid i was montgomery i said suddenly why has mling got strangely shaped ears er mling but er his hair covers his ears how do you know about his ears ive seen them montgomery theyve got a sharp point at the top and his eyes shine in the dark well er i dont know prendick ive never seen his ears maybe he keeps his hair long to hide them from the laboratory we heard a loud cry of pain it sounded like the puma the noise continued for about a minute and it clearly troubled montgomery damn damn damn he was saying quietly to himself he drank a big glass of whisky then left the room chapter five an evening walk through the afternoon it seemed that the pumas pain got worse the screams grew louder and louder i put my fingers in my ears but still the screams filled my head finally i had to escape from the room i went outside but the noise from the laboratory was even louder there i walked quickly away from the house and into the forest until i could not hear the puma any more at last i felt calmer i came to a stream it was a pleasant place protected from hot afternoon sun by the tall trees above i sat down to rest suddenly i saw something moving in the shadows on the other side of the stream it came closer what was it it moved towards the stream it was an animal coming for a drink it drank thirstily with its head down at the water i looked more carefully it was not an animal it was a man dressed in blur clothes but this man was using his hands as feet and he was drinking like a cat i moved to see him better he heard me and looked up our eyes met he stood up quickly and dried his mouth with his hand his legs were much shorter than his body he looked at me for a minute then walked slowly away i too started walking i did not feel comfortable by the stream now i crossed it and went uphill i was surprised by a bright red piece of ground in the middle of the green of the plants i looked closer there was a dead rabbit there half eaten and still warm i thought about its killer a dangerous animal or that strange man by the stream i realised that i knew nothing about the dangers of the animals or people in the forest it was a bad idea to walk alone in a strange place like this i decided to go back to the house i started running i almost ran straight out into an open space but stopped myself just in time in this space between the trees i saw three strange people one was clearly female the other two male they had rough pink skin and small bits of red clothes tied around their bodies their faces were heavy and shapeless and they had almost no hair on their heads their legs were unusually short and their feet were very small with no toes they talked quietly together or were they singing they moved their bodies from side to side in a kind of dance and repeated the same words again and again memories of sundays in church came back to me were these strange people practising their religion i continued to watch them there was something animal about these people at first this idea was not clear in my mind but then one of the men fell to the ground for a few seconds he was using his arms as legs and suddenly i realised with their rough pink skin and heavy faces these people were like pigs i moved away from them as quietly as possible and walked towards the beach suddenly thirty metres in front of me i saw the man who was drinking at the stream earlier his eyes shone green as he looked at me then he disappeared between the trees i did not move i could still feel his eyes on me who are you i shouted but there was no answer and i could see nothing in the shadows of the forest i realised now that it was getting dark i needed to reach the house quickly the idea of a night alone in the middle of the forest was too terrible to think about i started walking again i felt that someone was following me but each time i looked back i saw nothing for a long time i could not find the beach i went one way then another losing hope but finally i heard the sea i followed the sound and after a few minutes the forest opened onto the beach gratefully i started walking along the sand when i stopped for a rest a shadow behind me stopped too whos there i asked shakily the thing did not reply as i stepped hack my foot hit a stone with my eyes still on the shadow i slowly picked it up seeing my movement the thing moved away crazy with fear i now ran i heard feet behind me and i ran faster the yellow light from the house was in front of me but still far away too far the thing behind me was getting closer and closer it jumped at me and i turned towards it with the stone in my hand the stone hit its head and it fell down onto the sand chapter six moreaus laboratory shaking i ran towards the house i heard montgomerys voice prendick he was shouting prendick when i reached him i fell weakly into his arms where have you been he asked we were working all afternoon and we forgot about you we only started looking half an hour ago he helped me into the house and i sat down i was still shaking terribly a walk in the dark alone what were you thinking prendick i was afraid that please i said quickly please lock that door he looked at me carefully so youve met some of our people he locked the door and gave me some whisky for the first time in my life i drank it i described the attack on the beach and the strange people in the forest what does it all mean montgomery i asked its nothing too terrible i promise you he replied but youve had enough for one day you should get some sleep but what was that thing on the beach was it an animal or was it a man listen prendick youve had a terrible few days and you havent had enough sleep drink this medicine so you can sleep through the noise of that damn puma well talk in the morning he was right i was too tired to talk now i drank his medicine he helped me into bed like a child and soon i was asleep when i woke it was late morning there was some breakfast on the table and i ate hungrily montgomery opened the inside door the door into the garden for a quick hello were very busy in here im afraid no time to talk he closed the door again but i discovered later that he did not lock it i returned to my breakfast suddenly there was a cry of pain from the laboratory but this time it was not the puma it sounded exactly like the cry of a man i did not move my ears waited for the sound again but there was nothing perhaps it was my imagination i thought then it came again this time there could be no mistake a man in the laboratory was screaming and crying with pain i ran straight to the door to the garden threw it open and went outside montgomery was near the door prendick stop he shouted through an open door on the far side of the garden i saw something pink tied to a table it was covered in blood and bits of white cloth then moreau was in front of me he picked me up and threw me back into my room i heard the key in the lock and moreau saying im not going to stop the work of a lifetime because of him but he doesnt understand said montgomery i could not hear the rest as i stood up shakily my mind was lull of the most terrible ideas what were they doing to the man in there i thought again about those strange people in the forest were they the results of moreaus terrible experiments on ordinary men and women it seemed the most believable explanation and what about me did they plan to use me in their experiments too it was clear to me that my life was in very great danger luckily the outside door was still open i picked up a walking stick to defend myself against these crazy scientists then i ran to the door i heard someone outside it was montgomery was he planning to lock me in my room i ran at him with my stick and he stepped back prendick he cried out in surprise dont be stupid man i ran north along the beach montgomery was behind me shouting i could not hear his words i turned into the forest and ran for a kilometre or two then i stopped and listened i heard a dog then montgomerys voice but they were getting further and further away no one was following me i found a good place to hide in the shadows of the trees there i sat for many hours too afraid to move i tried to make a plan but how could i live alone on the island i did not know how to catch rabbits or fish without the right equipment i did not know what forest fruits and vegetables to eat could i ask the strange animalmen of the island for help how dangerous were they my hiding place was getting uncomfortable so i lay on the ground for a minute suddenly high above me in the trees i saw a pair of eyes a black face the face moved closer i held my stick tightly as an apelike person dropped from the trees you you you he said chapter seven meeting the animalmen you he said again in the boat yes i answered i came in the boat from the ship oh he said his eyes travelled over me my legs my body my face my hands the stick that i was carrying his eyes returned to my hands he held out his own hand and counted his fingers one two three four five eh i guessed that he was counting his fingers as a way to greet me i did the same one two three four five eh i said he gave me a wide smile then disappeared into the trees i tried to follow i found him hanging on to a tree by one arm excuse me i said he dropped to the ground standing up straight his arms hung below his knees do you know where to find food i continued food he said eat mans food now at the huts but where are the huts i asked im new here you see together we walked through the forest i wanted to find out as much as possible from him how long have you been here i asked how long he repeated when i asked my question again he held up three fingers did he mean three months three years i was not sure i tried some other questions his answers were difficult to understand some were on a completely different subject after moreaus experiments on him this man was unable to have a sensible conversation after a long walk we came to a rocky place near the sea i followed the apeman along a narrow path between two rocks it went downhill steeply getting darker and darker at the bottom in complete darkness the apeman stopped and said home the place had a terrible smell and there were strange noises all around me slowly my eyes started to see i was standing next to a line of huts that used the steep rock face for their back walls and bits of tree for their front walls and roofs there was old fruit everywhere and some simple cups made of wood strange people large and small and of different shapes were hiding in the shadows my apeman went into one of the huts i held on tightly to my slick and followed him inside in the far corner of the hut sat a big shapeless thing the hut was too dark to see the things face the apeman started talking to it look its a man a man a man like me its a man agreed the thing in the corner is he going to live with us yes i said then he must learn the law other people were coming into the hut now there was quite a crowd say the words said the thing in the corner dont go on four legs that is the law are we not men i did not know what to do say the words said the apeman say the words said the rest of the crowd angrily at last i understood them and repeated the words the others repeated them after me and soon we were all moving from side to side in the strangest way this was clearly their religion i was not in a position to question it dont go on four legs that is the law are we not men we repeated dont drink without cups that is the law are we not men dont eat meat or fish that is the law are we not men dont fight with heads or teeth that is the law are we not men dont run after other people that is the law are we not men then the words changed his house is the house of pain his hands are the hands that hurt his hands are the hands that make his hands are the hands that mend he is master of the stars in the sky he is master of the sun and moon he is master of the deep salt sea he is our master at last the strange words ended my eyes were now seeing better in the dark the speaker in the corner was about the height and weight of an ordinary man but was covered from head to foot in grey hair like a big grey dog what was he what were they all hes a fiveman a fiveman like me said the apeman the thing in the corner moved to the light of the huts entrance and took my hand in his his hand was hard with three very short thick fingers five fingers five thin fingers thats good many have problems with their fingers he dropped my hand and looked into my eyes i am the sayer of the law he said new people come to me to learn the law do not break the law no one escapes no one escapes repeated the animalpeople no one no one said the apeman once i did a little thing a wrong thing and look he burned my hand there you can see the burn the master is great the master is good different parts of the law are difficult for different people explained the sayer of the law some like to bite and drink blood others like to fight with their heads or their hands others like to move the earth with their noses in the ground these things are bad no one escapes said the men at the door punishment is quick and terrible continued the sayer of the law so learn the law say the words he began again from the start dont go on four legs that is the law are we not men we were all making a lot of noise as we repeated the strange words because of this i did not notice the growls of the dogs outside but suddenly one of the pigmen put his head round the door and spoke urgently to the others everyone hurried out of the hut and i was left alone too late i heard the dogs as i reached the huts entrance moreau montgomery and the dogs were coming down the steep path between the rocks montgomery was pointing his gun at me chapter eight on the beach i held my stick tightly and looked around there was a narrow space between the rocks i ran towards it hold him shouted moreau the animalpeople moved towards me i pushed into one mans shoulder and he fell against one of his friends i used my stick on a third as he tried to catch my legs then i ran as fast as i could up between the rocks and into the forest i could hear cries of catch him hold him behind me but luckily the animalman nearest me was too wide for the narrow space between the rocks and the others could not get past him for a minute or two i went deeper into the forest cutting my legs on the plants soon they were following me crying like hungry and excited animals i ran and ran they were getting closer finally shaking with fear i turned sharply to the right the noises of my followers grew quieter as they continued straight on for a short time i was safe but i knew now that the animalpeople were as dangerous as moreau and montgomery i could not ask them for protection i decided to go back to the house maybe i could find a gun or knife there it was my only hope i walked along the beach leaving behind me a thin line of blood from my leg suddenly far in front of me moreau montgomery and the dogs came out of the trees with the animalpeople close behind them as they came towards me i had no more hope of life but i could still choose something better than the pain of moreaus laboratory i walked straight into the sea when i was thirty metres out the water was still only at my waist from the beach montgomery shouted what are you doing man im going to kill myself i said montgomery looked at moreau why moreau asked because its better to be dead than one of your experiments i told you montgomery said to moreau why do you think that youll be one of my experiments asked moreau i saw him in your laboratory and those animalpeople they stop said moreau the animalmen were listening to us from the treeline i wont stop i cried those poor people they were men but youve changed them youve turned them into animals monsters montgomery looked very worried stop that prendick please man stop the animalpeople looked at me strangely they moved closer to hear me better listen to me for a minute said moreau but in latin i hope you learnt it at school he started speaking to me in latin my latin was not very good but his meaning was clear these animal people were not men he explained they were ordinary animals until he changed them in his laboratory i dont believe you i replied in english they talk they build houses they use tools animals cant do these things come back to the house and ill explain he called no im staying here the sea here is full of dangerous fish theyll eat you if you go much further thats fine i answered better than your laboratory wait a minute he said he took a gun out of his pocket and put it down on the sand montgomery will do the same he said well go up to the top of the beach then you can get the guns i wont i answered youve probably got a third gun somewhere think sensibly prendick we didnt want to have you on this island why not if we needed you for our experiments why did you tell the animalpeople to catch me i asked this island is dangerous we wanted to bring you back to the house its safer there i was silent thinking was it possible that his words were true but i saw i said in the laboratory that was the puma cried montgomery listen prendick this is crazy come out of the water pick up the guns and talk i was still afraid of moreau but montgomery seemed an ordinary honest kind of man i decided to believe their story go up the beach with your hands above your heads i said we cant do that said montgomery moving his eyes towards the animalpeople they mustnt see their masters in a position of weakness well ok but go back as far as the trees when moreau and montgomery were at the treeline i picked up the guns and joined them under the trees thats better said moreau in an unfriendly voice ive lost a days work because of you without another word he and montgomery turned and walked back towards the house the animalpeople watched me silently were they ordinary animals in the past perhaps but in that minute they had the look of small children small children who were trying to think chapter nine moreaus work you really are an impossible guest said moreau after supper if you try to kill yourself again i wont stop you he sat at the table smoking i sat as far away from him as possible with the two guns still in my hands montgomery was not there i did not feel comfortable yet with both of them in this small room with me so prendick said moreau ive shown you the puma in the laboratory do you agree that its a puma not a man yes its a puma but youve done terrible things to it i hope i never see an animal hurt like that again you stop prendick stop montgomery spoke like that when he was first here its really very boring right you agree that its the puma now be quiet so i can give you a lesson in biology its surprising that no one has done my kind of work before doctors have been able to change peoples bodies and faces for many years of course they can rebuild a destroyed nose with skin from above the eyes they can take teeth from one person and use them in the mouth of another and they can even use bits of an animals body to mend the body of a man but until now no one has tried to change one type of animal into another type of animal the people on this island were built in my laboratory their animal bodies were cut and pushed into new shapes but the changes to the body were only the start i shaped their minds too i changed their blood they feel differently think differently they have even learnt to talk but why i said why do you turn them into people not into sheep or horses or it seemed a dangerous idea to choose the shape of man some things should be the business of religion not science oh i havent only made people once or twice ive he was silent for a minute perhaps how quickly the years pass but what is the purpose of your experiments you hurt these animals terribly but your science has no useful result pain is just a little thing prendick while you worry about pain you are no better than an animal each of my experiments gives the answer to a question a big question but it also asks a new question there is always more to find out i came here with montgomery eleven years ago we had three boys with us from another pacific island they built the house for montgomery and me for themselves they built the huts where the animalpeople now live my first experiments here were on sheep but they werent very successful sheep are too fearful too stupid then i tried an ape when my work was finished this ape looked like a real man he had no memory of his earlier life i became his teacher and after three or four months he could speak quite good english he wasnt very clever but ive known stupider men i introduced him to the three boys at first they were very afraid of him but they soon started to like him more he lived with them and copied their way of life he built a hut like theirs they even taught him to read i was very pleased with my first apeman i planned to write a description of the experiment for a science magazine but one day i visited him and he was making ape noises from the top of a tree and he was never quite the same after that the animal in him grew stronger and stronger i decided to make a more successful animalperson before i told the scientific world about my work for the last ten years i have made more and more successful animalpeople the hands and feet are difficult and none of them can smile but the main problem is that the animal in them has always grown back i havent told the world about these small successes yet because i can do better i will do better this puma he stopped himself suddenly and thats the end of the story the three boys are all dead now there are a lot of accidents on this island but montgomery is still with me and he stopped i sat in silence watching his face how many are there i asked him finally more than sixty i think ive made about one hundred and twenty in total but many have died there are a few women and they sometimes have children but the children always die and when youve made these monsters you send them to the huts i said they choose to go there he explained most of them stay away from this place a weak memory of their pain here i think and they follow the rules that the boys taught them they call it the law so what do you think of me now he continued are you still afraid of me to answer his question i gave him back the guns keep them he said he stood up and smiled im glad everythings clear now but youve had two busy days you should get some rest goodnight chapter ten the taste of blood when i woke the next morning moreau was already busy in the laboratory montgomery and i escaped the pumas cries and went for a walk around the island we soon met the apeman and one of the pigmen we greet you otherwithagun they said to montgomery theres a thirdwithagun now montgomery said so dont do anything stupid the pigman looked at me the thirdwithagun the walkerwithtearsinthesea has a thin white face he said he has a thin black gun too said montgomery yesterday he was crying and losing blood you and the master never cry you never lose blood said the apeman youll cry and lose blood soon if youre not careful montgomery replied come on prendick he took my arm and we walked away the pigman and apeman stood watching us men speak but this one says nothing said the pigman yesterday he asked me about things to eat said his friend he didnt know i did not hear the rest of their conversation but they were laughing later we saw a dead rabbit half eaten and without its head damn said montgomery what can this mean he looked carefully at the rabbits body i saw something like it on my first day here i said really on your first day he asked yes and i think i know the killer too i cant be sure but just before i found the rabbit i saw one of your monsters by a stream it was drinking like an animal without its hands dont drink without cups that is the law are we not men said montgomery with a worried laugh as soon as theyre alone they forget about the law and its worst in the evening theyre most like animals when its getting dark he stopped to think but thats interesting he continued meateaters always like a drink after a kill its the taste of blood you see salty well the thing at the stream was the same monster that ran after me later on the beach will you know him if you see him again asked montgomery he looked around us and checked his gun i didnt see him very well but i hit him hard with a stone hell probably still have some blood on his head im sure it was the leopardman said montgomery or perhaps one of the other big cats but how can we prove that he killed the rabbit too damn rabbits it was a big mistake to bring them here i started to walk back to the house montgomery did not move lets go i called finally he joined me this is serious prendick he said they mustnt learn to enjoy meat if they do well were all in trouble back at the house moreau agreed that the problem was very serious that afternoon the three of us and mling walked across the island to an open space near the animalpeoples huts moreau took a little pipe from his pocket and put it to his mouth it made a surprisingly loud noise soon the animalpeople started to arrive two of the pigmen first then a big horseperson and a terrible bearwoman when they saw moreau they dropped to the ground his hands are the hands that hurt his hands are the hands that make his hands are the hands that mend they said throwing earth on their heads more and more animalpeople were coming out of the trees singly or in pairs to join them in this strange activity sixtytwo sixtythree counted moreau there are four more i cant see my attacker i said moreau made the noise with his pipe again finally at the back of the crowd i saw my attacker join the rest there was a dark line of blood on his head the leopardman montgomery said quietly in my ear stop said moreau in a loud strong voice the animalpeople sat on the ground and stopped talking where is the sayer of the law asked moreau and the hairy grey monster stood up say the words said moreau the grey monster and the others began the words of the law when they reached dont eat meat or fish that is the law moreau held up his hand stop he cried the crowd was suddenly silent they looked nervously at their neighbours waiting for moreaus next words someone has broken that law he said no one escapes said the sayer of the law no one escapes repeated the rest of the crowd who was it asked moreau looking from face to face the leopardman looked worried and some of the other big cats too moreau stood in front of the leopardman who was it he asked again in a terrible voice if you break the law he said turning to the crowd you go back to the house of pain the crowd continued the house of pain the house of pain cried the apeman in excitement suddenly the leopardman jumped at moreau moreau fell back the leopardman ran away and the crowd followed i followed with them behind mling and moreau i found myself next to the bearwoman no one escapes she laughed excitedly as we hurried through the trees we ran in the heat of the day for thirty minutes or more finally the leopardman was in a corner of the island and could not escape us but he was hiding we walked slowly towards the sea in a long line careful cried montgomery hell move suddenly when we find him back to the house of pain the house of pain the house of pain sang the apeman suddenly i saw a pair of green eyes shining out from under the plants it was the leopardman i will never forget the fear in those eyes he already knew the pain that waited for him in moreaus laboratory it was kinder to kill him quickly i got out my gun and shot him between the eyes he fell to the ground dead in the same second two of the other big cats jumped at him and bit deeply into his neck other faces came towards us dont kill him cried moreau then he saw that it was too late damn it prendick he said i wanted him in the laboratory we pulled the meateaters away from the body then i walked away from the crowd i watched them take the body into the sea all the animalpeople still seemed very excited i suddenly felt sick as i thought about the sad lives of these monsters the problem was not only their pain in moreaus laboratory they then spent every day of their lives fighting against the animal in them it was an impossible fight in secret they all broke the law in their different ways and the fear of the house of pain never left them chapter eleven the puma escapes for the next two months i lived quietly on the island my dislike of moreau and his work grew stronger but soon the strange animalpeople did not seem unusual to me i watched montgomery and mling together with interest mling was probably the most successful of moreaus experiments he was made from a bear but he had bits of dog and horse in him too he was not as clever as the apeman but he followed orders much better and looked more like a man he lived in a small hut at the back of our house not with the other animalpeople in their huts he followed montgomery like a dog and most of the time montgomery enjoyed his company when montgomery spoke kindly to him he jumped around happily like an excited child but after a few whiskies montgomery sometimes kicked him or threw stones at him even then mling was happy to be at his masters side montgomery and i did not become close friends after his long time away from ordinary people he was too strange he seemed more comfortable with the animalpeople than with me and i stayed away from the animalpeople as much as possible i dreamed day and night of ways to escape the island i spent many hours on the beach looking for ships but they never came and then something terrible happened that changed everything i woke at six one morning had breakfast and went outside moreau walked past me and said a quick hello then he opened the door to his laboratory and went in after many weeks on the island i almost did not notice as the cries of the poor puma began for another day then i heard a crash inside the laboratory suddenly something was running towards me not a man not an animal but a monster it had no skin no face but terrible yellow eyes and drops of blood were coming from all over its body it jumped at me i held up my arm to protect myself the monster crashed into me and i fell to the ground as it ran towards the forest i tried to get up but there was a terrible pain in my arm and i could not move i saw moreau with blood on his face and a gun in his hand he looked at me for a second then followed the monster into the trees finally i stood up montgomery arrived the puma i cried i was standing near the door and i was silenced by the pain in my arm montgomery had a look at it well its broken he said and theres a lot of blood but it isnt too serious youll live now what were you saying about the puma he cleaned my arm as i told him my story well theres no sign of them now he said i should go and help moreau that puma was strong he gave me a gun and walked into the forest still in great pain i went inside i kept the door open and held the gun in my good hand the morning was as calm as death there was no wind the sea was like a mirror i kept my eyes on the place where i last saw moreau and montgomery where were they now i once heard montgomery shouting moreau moreau then nothing after many hours i heard a gun shot far away in the forest a long silence then another shot a shout closer this time then silence again suddenly a shot very near i looked round the corner and montgomery was there there were bits of grass in his hair and there were holes in the knees of his trousers he looked hot and tired and very worried behind him stood mling with a strange brown colour around his mouth was that blood has he come cried montgomery moreau i asked no go back inside he continued theyre all crazy crazy whats happening to them i need some whisky we went inside leaving mling by the door after a glass of whisky montgomery told me about his morning weve seen no sign of moreau or the puma but the animalpeople have gone crazy we met two of the pigmen and they had blood on their mouths one of them attacked me i dont understand it no ones ever done that before not even the meateaters well i shot one of the pigmen in the head and mling got the other with a bite in the neck mlings damn teeth probably saved my life today we met a meateater too one of the big cats with blood on its mouth and a broken foot i shot it well its better to be safe what does it all mean i asked montgomery shook his head and picked up the whisky bottle i left him with his drink for some time but he was clearly getting drunk and that was dangerous on a day like this listen montgomery somethings happened to moreau i said hes been out for too long we need to find him montgomery did not want to go but in the end he agreed we had a quick lunch then stepped out into the heat of the day chapter twelve the search for moreau mling went in front montgomery followed with his head down and his hands in his pockets he could not walk in a straight line because of the whisky my left arm was tied up and painful but luckily my right arm was fine i carried our only gun we took a narrow path through the trees suddenly mling stopped listening we listened too some animalpeople were coming towards us hes dead said one voice he isnt dead he isnt dead said another we saw we saw said some others there was a few seconds silence then some crashes in the trees finally we saw six faces the apeman the hairy grey sayer of the law and four horsemen what did you say asked montgomery angrily wheres the master they all looked at their friends no one spoke finally the hairy sayer of the law said hes dead they saw where is he continued montgomery the hairy grey thing pointed away to our left is there a law now asked the apeman is it still dont do this and dont do that is he really dead is there a law repeated his friends is there a law otherwithagun he is dead said the sayer of the law they all stood watching us montgomerys eyes were still swimming in whisky prendick he said hes clearly dead so i thought quickly and stepped towards the animalmen children of the law i said loudly he is not dead mling turned his sharp eyes on me but i continued he has changed his shape he has changed his body for some time you wont see him he is there i pointed up to the sky you cant see him but he can see you fear the law they looked unsure he is great he is good said the apeman finally looking fearfully up at the sky and the other thing i asked them the thingwithbloodandscreams is dead too said the sayer of the law good said montgomery to himself the otherwiththegun began the sayer of the law yes i said he says the master is dead montgomery was not too drunk to understand my purpose in all this hes not dead he said now hes no more dead than i am some have broken the law i continued they will die some have died already show us the masters old body it is this way walkerwithtearsinthesea said the sayer of the law we were following him through the trees when suddenly a rabbit crossed our path behind it came a great bearman too fast to stop the sayer of the law stepped out of this monsters way mling jumped at it but was pushed off montgomery turned to run quickly i pulled out my gun and shot straight into the monsters ugly face its face was destroyed but still it came towards us it caught montgomery in its arms as it fell to the ground dead slowly montgomery shook himself out of the monsters lifeless arms the sayer of the law came nervously to look you see i said to him the law is alive this man is dead because of the law no one escapes no one escapes he repeated his friends joined him to look at the dead bearman finally we continued our walk at the west corner of the island we found the dead puma it was shot in the shoulder and halfeaten too then a few metres away we found another body it lay face down its white hair covered in blood with the animalmens help we carried moreaus body slowly back to the house it was getting dark we heard many strange noises through the trees but we were not attacked again mling went off with the other animalmen montgomery and i could finally talk we have to plan our escape from the island i said montgomery was not drunk now but his mind was very troubled life on the island without moreau was impossible for him to imagine no one wants me in the real world he said its ok for you prendick but this place is the only home that i have and what about the animalpeople the good ones they need our protection what will happen to them if we go i asked the meateaters will eat the others they all change back to animals in the end he reached for the bottle of whisky and drank a large glass of it he offered some to me but i refused another glass disappeared down his neck then another as he talked about the animalpeople mling is the only person in the world who has really loved me he said drunkenly wheres mling where is he i want to have a drink with him mling mling i tried to stop him you cant give him drink hell get out of my way shouted montgomery suddenly his gun was pointing at me i stepped back everythings gone wrong he cried tomorrow ill probably kill myself but tonight im going to have some fun im going to have a party chapter thirteen montgomerys party montgomery turned and went out into the moonlight mling mling old friend he shouted he found three animalmen on the beach and gave them all a drink mling soon joined them drink and sing montgomery was shouting lets have a party the noise of this strange party was loud at first it got slowly quieter as it moved along the beach finally there was silence i stood in the moonlight for a few minutes at the door to my room then i started to prepare for my escape the next day i made a pile in the garden of everything that i needed for the boat food clothes some sheets for sails containers for water and much more a few hours before morning montgomerys group returned they were singing noisily on the beach and breaking wood for some reason but i was busy working by the light of my oil lamp i soon stopped noticing their noise when it was getting light montgomerys group finally stopped singing there was a shout of more more some angry words followed then a loud scream the scream worried me i stood and listened there were more shouts then suddenly a gun shot sounded i picked up my own gun and hurried towards the noise as i ran i kicked some of the things in my pile there was a crash of broken glass but i did not stop who had the gun and why were they shooting i opened the door and saw a small fire on the beach around it was a pile of bodies fighting montgomery was calling my name i ran towards the fire i shouted as loudly as possible and shot into the air with my gun someone cried the master the master the group stopped fighting a number of animalpeople ran away in fear and disappeared into the trees i then turned to the bodies still by the fire montgomery lay on his back with the hairy grey sayer of the law on top of him the hairy monster was dead but still held montgomerys neck in its sharp teeth mling lay next to them with a big bite in his neck and a broken whisky bottle in his hand two other bodies lay near the fire one did not move the other was crying in pain it sometimes lifted its head slowly then dropped it again i pulled the sayer of the law off montgomery not an easy job with my broken arm montgomery looked terrible but still alive i put a few drops of seawater on his face took off his jacket and rested his head on it mling and the person next to him were dead the last ones body was badly burnt in the fire and after a few minutes he was dead too i knew very little about medicine what could i do to help montgomery before i could do anything i heard a strange noise behind me i looked around fire and clouds of black smoke were coming from the house i thought back the crash the broken glass i knew immediately the reason for the fire the broken glass was my oil lamp the fire was already burning strongly it was impossible to save any of the things inside my mind turned to my plan of escape and i looked for the two boats on the beach they were not there slowly i understood montgomerys fire used wood the wood of the two boats the two boats that were my only hope of escape from this island i was so angry that i almost killed montgomery with my gun then his hand moved and he looked so weak i could not hurt him he shook with pain and opened his eyes for a minute i lifted his head up a little his eyes met mine im sorry he said the boats ive been so stupid his eyes closed and his head fell to one side montgomery i said montgomery i felt his heart he was dead i sat alone on the beach for about an hour doing nothing ideas raced through my head but no sensible plan came to me then three animalmen came out of the trees slowly they walked towards me the smell of the dead bodies pulled them closer and closer alone i faced them with the gun in my one good hand get down on your knees i said loudly they stopped and looked at me i repeated my words and moved towards them one went down on his knees then the other two i walked past the dead bodies keeping my eyes on the three on their knees they broke the law i said putting my foot on the sayer of the law and now they are dead even the sayer of the law even the otherwiththegun the law is great no one escapes said one of the men on the ground no one escapes i repeated you must follow my orders now stand up they stood i took montgomerys gun from him then said take him carry him out to the sea they were afraid to touch montgomery but they were more afraid of my gun finally they lifted up his body and walked into the sea with it they did the same with the other bodies then i sent them away i needed some time to think how could i live on the island now how could i escape the house was destroyed so i could not even sleep without fear of attack the animalpeoples fear of my gun was my only hope i needed to become their master a new dr moreau after a short rest i started walking towards their huts when i got there i was hungry thirsty and very tired as bravely as i could i walked towards a small group of the animalpeople they did not get down on their knees i was too weak to order it i just asked politely for food and drink and they pointed towards one of the huts i was stupid in that minute i lost my position as their master they were never afraid of me as they were of moreau in an empty hut i ate some fruit then with my gun in my hand i fell into a troubled sleep when i woke up it was dark outside my arm was hurting at first i could not remember where i was then the terrible memories of the last two days came back to me i heard something in the hut i saw a dark shadow near my legs it was slowly moving who or what was it i waited suddenly something soft warm and wet passed over my hand chapter fourteen alone with the animalmen i almost screamed whos that i asked i master said the shadow who are you they say that there is no master now but i know i know i carried the bodies into the waves for you walkerwithtearsinthesea i carried the bodies of the people that you killed i am yours master i remembered him on the beach a dogman he seemed safe good thats good i said his tongue passed over my hand again but where are the others they are saying bad things they are saying the master is dead the otherwithagun is dead the walkerwithtearsinthesea is like us we love the law and we will keep it but we have no master now no house of pain they say these things but they are wrong i know in the darkness i reached for the dogmans head and touched it lightly soon you will kill them all he continued if they break the law i will come for them master always knows best said my new friend we left the hut and found a crowd of animalmen around a fire he is dead the master is dead said the apeman there is no house of pain he is not dead i said in a loud voice even now he is watching us the house of pain has gone but it will come again and the master too will come again every minute of every day he is watching you and listening there will be pain and death for anyone who breaks the law true true said the dogman they were very surprised by my words animals can be clever and dangerous but only a real man can lie the walkerwithtearsinthesea says a strange thing said one of them can it be true said another for an hour we talked and by the end many believed me finally they went to their beds and i went with them i was safer with a group of them than with one alone this was the first night of ten months alone with the animal men in the first month i spent a lot of time with them i even started to like some of them the dogman and a few others but as the months passed the animalpeople began to change it became difficult for them to walk on two legs their hands became useless their bodies grew more and more hairy and they stopped wearing clothes their language skills suffered too their words became difficult to understand then they stopped using words completely after about six months the law was almost completely forgotten they still ate only fruit but for the meateaters this could surely not last long every day i watched the sea for ships three times i saw a sail and lit a fire but no ship came close to the island after many months i decided to build my own boat but stupidly i built it in the forest far from the sea it was destroyed as i pulled it over rough ground to the beach then life got worse as i was walking in the forest i saw something red a dead body the body of my friendly dogman the meateaters were back no one was living in the huts now most of the animalpeople were sleeping by day some in trees some in holes following their natural ways at night they were awake and their growls and screams filled the darkness the dogmans was the first of many dead bodies that i found around the island i too started to sleep by day that way i could defend myself more easily from a night attack i also started to build another boat this time on the beach when it was finished it was stronger than the last one but i had one problem that i could not solve i needed fresh water for the journey that i was planning but i had no container i walked around the island again and again looking for a possible container but i found nothing then a happy day arrived there was a little sail out at sea and it was coming closer i lit a fire and fed it all day the sail came towards the island slowly slowly when night fell it was still a long way from land all night i kept my fire bright in the light of the fire i saw many eyes watching me but the animalmen could not make their own fires now and were afraid of mine in the morning the sail was much nearer i could see two men in a little boat they were sitting low down in it one at each end when they were very close i started shouting i waved my jacket but the men did not notice me suddenly a great white bird flew up out of the boat again the men did not move a cold fear took hold of me finally the boat reached the beach the men long dead fell to pieces when i pulled them out of the boat one had bright red hair the other had a hat with the word ipecacuanha on it three of the meateaters were soon by my side interested in the smell of the bodies i was too weak to keep them away but i could not watch their terrible meal i pulled the boat into the water and sailed it along the beach that night i slept in the boat in the morning i filled its water container at the stream then i shot and cooked three rabbits and picked a large amount of fruit i put the food and drink into the boat and sailed away from the island the wind took me slowly southwest and soon the blue of the ocean was all around me after the last few months it felt good to be completely alone three days later i was picked up by a ship i seemed crazy to the sailors of course i was wearing almost nothing it was many months since my last conversation with a real person and my description of the island and its strange population was difficult to believe for thirty years i have kept quiet about my adventures on the island perhaps even now no one will believe me but what does it matter i am an old man i will soon be dead i have lived a quiet life since my return from the pacific people do not feel comfortable in my company they see something strange in me perhaps i became a little like the animalpeople who i lived with for all those months and i do not feel comfortable in the company of others either i fear that secretly they are animalpeople i fear that the animal in them will soon grow stronger i fear that one day they will attack it is a fear that never completely leaves me the end
