chapter one a strange message otto lidenbrock is the famous professor of geology at the university of hamburg in germany he is also my uncle he is sixtyfive years old not very tall with grey hair he wears small round gold glasses that make him look very serious im axel im only nineteen and the professors personal assistant i watch my uncle very carefully when he works thats why i know so much about our planet earth my uncle the professor is a hard worker he spends most of his day in his laboratory at the university so he never comes home before two oclock for lunch but yesterday he came home very early this surprised martha our cook the poor old girl did not have the lunch ready and she was a little upset professor youre early never mind martha i dont want lunch today but professor you must eat the professor looked excited martha food is not important then he turned to me axel come with me he took me into his library it was a big room with lots of bookcases against the walls and heavy velvet curtains in front of the windows in the middle of the room there was a desk where my uncle spent most of his evenings he took an old book out of his coat pocket he looked at me axel look at this look at this i took it from his hand its cover was hard and it looked very old why what is it professor i found it today in an old bookshop its seven hundred years old whats it about its about the old princes from norway who came to live in iceland why is that so special he smiled and said because it is written in a language that no one uses anymore i opened the book and saw strange letters from a strange alphabet i did not understand any of it i turned its yellow pages and a piece of paper fell out of the book onto the floor the professor jumped on it whats this it was an old yellow piece of paper with the same strange letters on it the professor knew many languages but he could not read this old language from iceland he took a thick book from one of the shelves it was a dictionary for all the old languages in the world which people do not speak today then he gave me a piece of paper and a pencil axel write down these letters as i read them to you the professor read each letter to me and i wrote them down when we finished this is what they said go into the volcano at sneffells yokul before the first of july the sun will show you the way to the centre of the earth make this journey it is fantastic the name under this strange message was arne saknussemm arne saknussemm i dont believe it whos she he was a famous scientist he wrote many strange things about the earth but no one believed him they said he was crazy this must be the answer to the things he said he left this piece of paper in the old book for someone to find do you understand axel how lucky we are then he turned to the library door martha i couldnt understand any of the things my uncle said what do you mean we martha opened the door to the library did you want me sir yes martha i want you to buy us two train tickets to denmark master axel and i are going to iceland this was the biggest surprise of my life what uncle i cant go the professor looked at me calmly you can and you will chapter two grauben there is a seventeenyearold girl living in our town i think she is the most beautiful girl in germany shes got long blonde hair and bright blue eyes her name is grauben and we are in love we want to get married thats why i didnt want to go with my uncle on his mysterious trip but he couldnt understand that are you in love with grauben yes and you want to marry her yes the professor was silent he was a good man but he could not understand love because his only interest was science he forgot what i said and began to talk about our journey today is the th of may we have one month to get to sneffells were going to take the train to denmark and then well take a boat to iceland the whole trip is going to take twelve days then we have to walk to the volcano i could not listen to him anymore my heart felt heavy the professor needed an assistant and he did not want anyone else to know about this secret but how could i leave my grauben i went for a walk through the beautiful city of hamburg i walked along the elbe river thinking of grauben i stopped for a moment to look at a fishing boat sailing on the calm water then i turned and like magic she was there grauben my grauben stood twenty feet away looking at the river grauben she looked like an angel we ran into each others arms and kissed oh axel im so excited she sounded very happy but i couldnt understand why excited why are you excited my love i was at your house i heard about your journey isnt it wonderful for a moment i felt sad so grauben wanted me to go away from her but grauben we want to get married i dont know when im coming back she looked at me lovingly and held my hand it doesnt matter ill still wait for you dont you understand this is the kind of journey all great men must make when you come back youre going to be famous like your uncle then our life will be perfect together do you really mean that she touched my face and smiled of course i do oh grauben you are the most wonderful girl in the world back at my uncles house i felt excited then i thought of something maybe this adventure was too dangerous maybe we wouldnt come back i ran into the library where my uncle was uncle is it possible that we wont come back from this journey his answer didnt make me feel any better theres only one way to find out axel chapter three iceland it was very early in the morning when the boat got to iceland we could see the round body of the sneffells yokul volcano going up into the sky through the clouds it had snow near the top and it looked like an angry monster waiting for someone to try and climb it the boat stopped at reykjavik it was a small town with small brick houses mr fridriksson a professor from the university there met us at the boat he looked very friendly and smiled when he saw us you must be professor lidenbrock and you must be professor fridriksson this is my assistant axel we shook hands you got my letter then oh yes professor and everything is ready for you please come with me my uncle did not tell anyone the real reason for our journey he wanted the two of us to be the only ones to travel to the centre of the earth but we needed someone to go along with us as we didnt know the area and the ice and snow around the volcano was too dangerous so mr fridriksson found us a guide his name was hans and he looked perfect for the job he was tall and very strong he had small blue eyes and long red hair he almost never smiled or spoke mr fridriksson introduced us professor lidenbrock this is hans hans professor lidenbrock and his assistant axel hans moved his head just a little to say hello hans is a very quiet man like most icelanders but he is the strongest and best climber in reykjavik my uncle smiled at mr fridrikssons words hes just perfect mr fridriksson mr fridriksson let us stay at his house until we were ready to leave we needed many things for our adventure we took four horses to travel to the mountain the professor and i each rode one but hans walked the other two horses carried our bags we took a lot of things with us rope for climbing tools lights guns medicine and enough food for six months the only problem was we could only carry enough water for one week the professor believed there was water under the volcano but what if there wasnt we left reykjavik on the th of june early in the morning we travelled along the sea and it was a wonderful journey the land had a dark colour from the explosions of the volcano and the beautiful blue sea next to it made it look fantastic the journey to sneffels took us six days and each day we stopped in a different village for the night the villages were small and very pretty built at the foot of the volcano next to the sea the villagers were very nice but like hans they did not talk much when we got closer to the top of sneffels i thought of something uncle what happens if the volcano explodes again no thats impossible this volcano had its last explosion in i checked the ground its impossible but axel i am a scientist this is a fact there is nothing more to say it was now eleven oclock at night and we were at the top we stopped and found a small place inside the opening of the volcano where we could sleep that night i had a dream i saw that i was alone inside the volcano i was lost and very scared suddenly the volcano exploded and i was shot out of its top like a rock chapter four inside the volcano the mouth of the volcano was one mile wide we tied a rope around each other and began to climb down hans went first the inside of the volcano looked like the inside of an icecream cone its opening became smaller as we went down because of the rocks left there after explosions the bottom of the volcano was feet down when we got there i looked up and saw the opening at the top it was a perfect circle of clear blue sky there were three holes in the floor of the volcano each of them was about a hundred feet wide the explosion of rocks and hot lava once came through these holes and then out through the top now they looked like dark caves i looked at the holes and then turned to my uncle which one do we take i dont know arne saknussemm said the sun touches one of them at the end of june today is june th it is too late to see the sun today we must wait until tomorrow what if its cloudy tomorrow then we will wait again but we only have five more days in july the sun is too low it cannot reach the bottom of the volcano then we can go home axel dont say such things tomorrow will be sunny and we are going to the centre of the earth the next day it was cloudy the professor could not believe it four days we only have four days please please sun come out come out the professor looked up at the sky with his arms open the only thing he wanted now was to see the sun shine i thought of grauben and the danger waiting for my uncle and myself inside those holes i hoped for rain hans built a small house from the large rocks he found on the floor of the volcano he never said much but he always thought of something useful to do i checked the rock of the volcano walls to see how old they were drops of water from the ice and the snow outside ran down the wall and the sound they made inside was like music suddenly the professor called out my name axel axel come here i ran to him curious to see what was there what is it look at this there were two words on the wall of the volcano in the old icelandic language what does it say arne saknussemm he was here were in the right place the next day the sun came out and at in the afternoon it touched the hole in the centre of the floor thats it thats the hole to the centre of the earth lets go hans brought our bags but there was one problem we could not carry all of them and climb down the hole at the same time what must we do now the professor took off his glasses and cleaned them while he tried to think of a solution well well throw everything we dont need down the hole and well find it when we get to the bottom hans threw the bags down the hole in front of us we listened but we never heard them hit the bottom chapter five lost in the tunnels we put our rope through holes in the rocks on the sides of the walls then climbed down hans went first then my uncle then me every two hundred feet we found a flat rock to stop on we pulled the rope down from above us tied it to a new rock then started again we did this for almost ten hours we travelled feet down finally hans said something stop it was only one word but it was nice to finally hear his voice what happened were at the bottom the professor and i looked at him of what i dont know there was a turn in the hole there was an open area like a cave at the bottom of the hole which continued to the right our bags were there after ten hours of climbing down we were very tired we decided to spend the night there in the morning we continued our journey down the hole now opened and looked more like a tunnel we did not need to climb because we could walk down this tunnel we used our torches so we could see the rock on the walls clearly it looked like glass of different colours some of it was red some was brown and some was yellow my uncle saw me looking at it thats from the lava its beautiful so youre starting to enjoy our journey theres more to see come along we walked for two more days and we found other tunnels there were tunnels everywhere but we did not know which was the right one unluckily our water finished now what are we going to do were going to find a spring there are many but we have to go down further i could not move i was very tired and thirsty and thinking of grauben uncle i cant go on axel please we are going to find water water it was hans voice what did you say water there was a loud sound behind the wall next to us it sounded like the water of a river hans took a pickaxe and made a hole in the wall water came out onto the floor around us i told you axel water ow its hot dont touch it it needs air were too far underground the water was cold enough to drink after a few minutes and we all felt strong again we continued our journey but i made a serious mistake i was very excited about finding the water and i went first i walked too far in front of the others and i got lost i tried to go back but i could not find them i shouted their names uncle hans i could only hear my own voice in the tunnel i was afraid i ran then i fell i fell through the air down a long tunnel then i hit my head and everything went black around me chapter six an underground waterworld when i opened my eyes i heard the sound of the sea the sun was high in the sky but this was not possible we were under the ground my uncle stood over me hes ok hans i saw hans smile my head hurt i touched it and i felt a bandage on it i tried to speak but it was difficult where are we dont speak axel you had a terrible fall we heard you screaming we were in a tunnel next to yours luckily the two channels came out here on this beach my uncle sat down next to me and spoke with more excitement in his voice axel we found an underground sea there are trees here and the bones of animals that lived thousands of years ago when you get better we are sailing across this sea oh axel you cant imagine how happy i am i could not move much for two days i heard hans building a boat for us to sail in but i could not understand how there was light the professor explained this to me it is a mystery like so many things but it is something like electricity coming from the heat of these rocks we are inside something like a giant cave the top of it is a few miles high there are even clouds because of the water i looked up and saw the clouds i could not see the top of this cave but it was difficult to believe that all of this was under the earth when i felt strong again i took a walk along the beach there were shells there from a time before man walked on the earth i saw the bones of something which looked like a huge elephant i thought can things live under the earth are there any animals alive down here the boat was ready and we were ready to sail we left the beach and a strong wind pushed us quickly out to sea after a few hours on this strange sea hans tied the pickaxe to a rope and threw it into the water the professor wanted to know how deep the sea was it never touched the bottom when hans pulled it back into the boat its metal head looked different there were large marks on it whats that hans looked at it closely teeth teeth could something so big live in these waters the professor looked at his compass we are travelling south if i am right we left iceland when we went under the volcano we travelled under the atlantic ocean and now we are under scotland thats fantastic but were still not going down i want to go further down suddenly there were huge waves rocking the boat whats happening hans pointed to something dark about a mile away from us it came closer and i thought i saw a giant dolphin i was wrong it was an alligator it came closer and i saw that i was wrong again it was something with the body of a dolphin and the head of an alligator it was over one hundred feet long then i saw a huge snake with a shell on its back like a turtles we took the guns in our hands but the animals did not care about us they fought each other it was a horrible fight we heard the snake hissing and the dolphin screaming they both dove under the water everything was quiet then the snakes head came out of the water it hissed one more time before it died in the water but where was the monster dolphin chapter seven a terrible storm now our journey felt even more dangerous the professor was frightened but nothing could stop him from going to the centre of the earth hans continued to sail the boat but we did not see land we travelled for hours but we did not hear or see anything then there was a sound like fast running water we couldnt see it but we could hear it it got louder then we saw it look its water shooting up into the air and its coming from the body of a huge sea creature we tried to turn the boat but the waves pulled us near the creature for a moment i thought that this was the end of our journey the water went up feet high into the air an animal that could do this could kill us easily then we saw that the long black body we thought was an animal was an island it was like a small volcano shooting up water instead of lava thats where all this water is coming from axel check the temperature of the water here i took a thermometer out of my inside jacket pocket and i put it in the water for a few seconds degrees fahrenheit were close to the centre we cant go on uncle its too hot we must the electric light coming from the rocks over our heads began to make explosions the clouds were now near the water small lines of light that looked like snakes exploded all around us the waves were bigger now and pushed us away i was very scared whats happening the explosions were too loud for us to hear each other its an electrical storm hans hans tried to keep the boat from sinking the wind pushed us through the water like a race car suddenly a large ball of white electric light fell on the boat none of us could move it held our feet with its electric power we shouted to each other but none of us could hear anything the boat moved by itself and there was nothing we could do suddenly the ball of electricity exploded we all fell down and a huge wave threw us into the water hans had the professor in one arm and me in the other i dont know how he did it but he got us to land safely i began to think that all the energy he saved by not talking made him the strongest man on earth the storm stopped and we saw the boat still on the water a hundred feet away hans swam out to save our food and equipment the professor and i tried to understand where we were i think that sea is miles wide that means we went under europe the mediterranean sea is now over our heads lets wait for hans to bring back the compass when hans brought back the compass the professor and i could not believe what we saw it said we were north and not south that meant the wind took us back to the place where we started chapter eigth a lost world we were on the north side of the sea again but not on the same beach as before for this reason we began to look around to see what we could find the professor didnt want us to stay there for long he wanted to sail on the sea again professor its too dangerous you saw what happened i dont care axel i did not come all this way to turn back now weve got to see whats on the other side of that sea this beach was longer than the other one its rocks had more holes in them and i thought this was because of earthquakes there were many more bones and old shells on this beach look at all of this axel we can read the whole history of the world from these bones there were skeletons of animals that are not living today it was very exciting to see them out in the open and not in a museum axel look a human head there with all the other bones was the head of a man how did it get here did it fall down one of those holes like we did was that going to happen to us the professor was excited if other scientists could see me now this could be the oldest skeleton ever found we walked further down and the beach changed now there were large trees and small plants around us the further we went the more life we found suddenly i saw something move behind the trees my uncle and i hid it was a family of mammoths from thousands of years ago axel can you believe it there is another world under our earth but are there also people here yes look i couldnt believe it walking behind the mammoths was a giant man he was over twelve feet tall with long hair and a beard he had a piece of animal skin around his waist should we try to talk to him no he looks dangerous hans is not with us and we dont have our guns lets go back to the boat we ran away quietly so the prehistoric man did not see us when we stopped running we were back at the beach i saw an old knife on a rock lets clean this and keep it it could be useful axel dont you understand what this is yes its a knife but its made of metal it is only two or three hundred years old do you mean yes arne saknussemm the professor saw a cave nearby he ran to it axel its him on the rock next to the entrance of this cave there were two letters in old icelandic as the professor looked very excited this must be the entrance we are looking for chapter nine the last tunnel hans brought the boat to the end of the beach where the cave was we tied it to a rock in the water and took our bags to the cave are we going to use the boat again i dont know maybe if we come back this way but who knows where this new tunnel will take us we needed the boat sooner than we thought we walked about twelve feet inside the cave then we saw a huge rock blocking the tunnel we couldnt understand it how could arne saknussemm get around this rock the professor thought for a moment and then he looked at the rock maybe it fell after his journey in the last two hundred years probably after an earthquake or a terrible storm i wish there was another earthquake to move that rock from the entrance of the cave axel thats it we can use the gun powder to move this rock again do you think it will work theres only one way to find out we still had some extra gun powder with us for the guns hans made a hole in the rock with his pickaxe then we put the gun powder inside we used the rope to light it but we made it very long to give us time to move back and hide the three of us got into the boat and moved fifty feet out to sea we had no idea how big the explosion was going to be waiting for it made us very nervous maybe it wont work axel dont say those things we waited suddenly the rocks on the beach opened like two curtains the earth shook and everything fell into a huge hole we fell back in the boat and the final explosion made the sea rise in a huge wave which pushed us back to the beach we were in the air on top of the water and the hole was below us it looked big enough to take in all the world were going down into the hole thats what we want not this way we shouted because the noise of falling rocks was all around us and we couldnt hear each other the boat moved like a train through the tunnel then we crashed into a new river of fresh water the boat went under and came back up so fast that there was very little water in it i dont know how we stayed in it we held onto the sides of the boat with all of our strength professor where are we i dont know but the water is taking us somewhere we have no choice but to follow it its getting hot the temperature was high the walls had the red colour of lava are we under another volcano when i finished my sentence we heard a loud roar from behind us water and air pushed us forward faster the walls began to shake and rocks began to fall professor then it was clear we were inside a volcano and it was going to explode i could see the blue sky through the round hole at the top of the volcano there was one more terrible roar and we were flying up into the air chapter ten back home the volcano threw us into the sea hans saved us again with his amazing strength but where were we it looked like the surface of the earth there were small boats in the water and olive and fruit trees on the land behind us was the huge volcano we saw a little boy we tried to go near him but he was afraid of us after all our underground adventures we looked horrible the professor spoke to him in german french and english but he did not understand finally the boy spoke in italian what did he say he said were in stromboli italy you mean we went in one volcano in iceland and came out of another in italy yes and that one there is mount etna and that was how our journey ended the professor was not happy that he didnt get to the centre of the earth but when we got back to germany he felt better martha told everyone in hamburg about our journey and when we arrived there was a big celebration for us everyone in hamburg was at the train station when we arrived but the only person i looked for was my grauben and i saw her like a white light moving past the others until i could hold her oh axel im so glad youre back i thought of you every day and sometimes i was afraid but somehow i knew you were all right well i never felt that i was safe but i did want to come back to you every minute of every day there was a stage set up in the station and the journalists who were there asked the professor to talk about our journey uncle otto was tired but he agreed my nephew axel and i are now back from an incredible journey we saw things that scientists still do not know about there is life in the heart of this planet there is water and beaches and trees arne saknussemm a famous scientist from the sixteenth century was the first to travel under the earth we are the second i do not know if others will try this dangerous adventure in the future if they do they need someone like our guide hans with them or im afraid they will not survive for a moment i thought i saw a smile on hans face as the people clapped and cheered but as usual the quiet icelander didnt say a word the end
