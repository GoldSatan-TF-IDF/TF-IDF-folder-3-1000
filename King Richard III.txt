arms hung up for monuments our stern alarums changd to merry meetings our dreadful marches to delightful measures grimvisagd war hath smoothd his wrinkled front and now instead of mounting barbed steeds to fright the souls of fearful adversaries he capers nimbly in a ladys chamber to the lascivious pleasing of a lute but ithat am not shapd for sportive tricks nor made to court an amorous lookingglass ithat am rudely stampd and want loves majesty to strut before a wanton ambling nymph ithat am curtaild of this fair proportion cheated of feature by dissembling nature deformd unfinishd sent before my time into this breathing world scarce half made up and that so lamely and unfashionable that dogs bark at me as i halt by them why i in this weak piping time of peace have no delight to pass away the time unless to spy my shadow in the sun and descant on mine own deformity and therefore since i cannot prove a lover to entertain these fair wellspoken days i am determined to prove a villain and hate the idle pleasures of these days plots have i laid inductions dangerous by drunken prophecies libels and dreams to set my brother clarence and the king in deadly hate the one against the other and if king edward be as true and just as i am subtle false and treacherous this day should clarence closely be mewd up about a prophecy which says that g of edwards heirs the murderer shall

thence we lookd toward england and cited up a thousand heavy times during the wars of york and lancaster that had befalln us as we pacd along upon the giddy footing of the hatches methought that gloucester stumbled and in falling struck me that thought to stay him overboard into the tumbling billows of the main o lord methought what pain it was to drown what dreadful noise of waters in my ears what sights of ugly death within my eyes methoughts i saw a thousand fearful wrecks a thousand men that fishes gnawd upon wedges of gold great anchors heaps of pearl inestimable stones unvalued jewels all scattred in the bottom of the sea some lay in dead mens skulls and in the holes where eyes did once inhabit there were crept as twere in scorn of eyes reflecting gems that wood the slimy bottom of the deep and mockd the dead bones that lay scattred by keeper had you such leisure in the time of death to gaze upon these secrets of the deep clarence methought i had and often did i strive to yield the ghost but still the envious flood stoppd in my soul and would not let it forth to find the empty vast and wandring air but smotherd it within my panting bulk who almost burst to belch it in the sea keeper awakd you not in this sore agony clarence no no my dream was lengthend after life o then began the tempest to my soul i passd methought the melancholy flood with that sour ferryman which poets write of unto the kingdom of perpetual night the first that there did greet my stranger soul was my great fatherinlaw renowned warwick who spake aloud what scourge for perjury can this dark monarchy afford false clarence and so he vanishd then came wandring by a shadow like an angel with bright hair dabbled in blood and he shriekd out aloud clarence is comefalse fleeting perjurd clarence that stabbd me in the field by tewksbury seize on him furies take him unto torment with that methoughts a legion of foul fiends environd me and howled in mine ears such hideous cries that with the very noise i trembling wakd and for a season after could not believe but that i was in hell such terrible impression made my dream keeper no marvel lord though it affrighted you i am afraid methinks to hear you tell it clarence ah keeper keeper i have done these things that now give evidence against my soul for edwards sake and see how he requites me o god if my deep prayers cannot appease thee but thou wilt be avengd on my misdeeds yet execute thy wrath in me alone o spare my guiltless wife and my poor children keeper i prithee sit by me awhile my soul is heavy and i fain would sleep keeper i will my lord god give your grace good rest clarence sleeps enter brakenbury the lieutenant brakenbury sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours makes the night morning and the noontide

attempts i never lookd for better at his hands after he once fell in with mistress shore buckingham yet had we not determind he should die until your lordship came to see his end which now the loving haste of these our friends something against our meanings have prevented because my lord i would have had you heard the traitor speak and timorously confess the manner and the purpose of his treasons

appeared in his lineaments being nothing like the noble duke my father yet touch this sparingly as twere far off because my lord you know my mother lives buckingham doubt not my lord ill play the orator as if the golden fee for which i plead were for myself and so my lord adieu gloucester if you thrive well bring them to baynards castle where you shall find me well accompanied with reverend fathers and well learned bishops buckingham i go and towards three or four oclock look for the news that the guildhall affords exit gloucester go lovel with all speed to doctor shaw to catesby go thou

gloucester how now how now what say the citizens buckingham now by the holy mother of our lord the citizens are mum say not a word gloucester touchd you the bastardy of edwards children buckingham i did with his contract with lady lucy and his contract by deputy in france th insatiate greediness of his desire and his enforcement of the city wives his tyranny for trifles his own bastardy as being got your father then in france and his resemblance being not like the duke withal i did infer your lineaments being the right idea of your father both in your form and nobleness of mind laid open all your victories in scotland your discipline in war wisdom in peace your bounty virtue fair humility indeed left nothing fitting for your purpose untouchd or slightly handled in discourse and when mine oratory drew toward end i bid them that did love their countrys good cry god save richard englands royal king gloucester and did they so buckingham no so god help me they spake not a word but like dumb statues or breathing stones stard each on other and lookd deadly pale which when i saw i reprehended them and askd the mayor what meant this wilfull silence his answer was the people were not used to be spoke to but by the recorder then he was urgd to tell my tale again thus saith the duke thus hath the duke inferrd but nothing spoke in warrant from himself when he had done some followers of mine own at lower end of the hall hurld up their caps and some ten voices cried god save king richard and thus i took the vantage of those few thanks gentle citizens and friends quoth i this general applause and cheerful shout argues your wisdoms and your love to richard and even here brake off and came away gloucester what tongueless blocks were they would they not speak will not the mayor then and his brethren come buckingham the mayor is here at hand intend some fear be not you spoke with but by mighty suit and look you get a prayerbook in your hand and stand between two churchmen good my lord for on that ground ill make a holy descant and be not easily won to our requests play the maids part still answer nay and take it gloucester i go and if you plead as well for

to the gracious duke tell him myself the mayor and aldermen in deep designs in matter of great moment no less importing than our general good are come to have some conference with his grace catesby ill signify so much unto him straight exit buckingham ah ha my lord this prince is not an edward he is not lolling on a lewd lovebed but on his knees at meditation not dallying with a brace of courtezans but meditating with two deep divines not sleeping to engross his idle body but praying to enrich his watchful soul happy were england would this virtuous prince take on his grace the sovereignty thereof but sure i fear we shall not win him to it mayor marry god defend his grace should say us nay buckingham i fear he will here catesby comes again reenter catesby now catesby what says his grace catesby my lord he wonders to what end you have assembled such troops of citizens to come to him his grace not being warnd thereof before he fears my lord you mean no good to him buckingham sorry i am my noble cousin should suspect me that i mean no good to him by heaven we come to him in perfect love and so once more return and tell his grace exit catesby when holy and devout religious men are at their beads tis much to draw them thence so sweet is zealous contemplation enter gloucester aloft between two bishops catesby returns mayor see where his grace stands tween two clergymen buckingham two props of virtue for a christian prince to stay him from the fall of vanity and see a book of prayer in his hand true ornaments to know a holy man famous plantagenet most gracious prince lend favourable ear to our requests and pardon us the interruption of thy devotion and right christian zeal gloucester my lord there needs no such apology i do beseech your grace to pardon me who earnest in the service of my god deferrd the visitation of my friends but leaving this what is your graces pleasure buckingham even that i hope which pleaseth god above and all good men of this ungovernd isle gloucester i do suspect i have done some offence that seems disgracious in the citys eye and that you come to reprehend my ignorance buckingham you have my lord would it might please your grace on our entreaties to amend your fault gloucester else wherefore breathe i in a christian land buckingham know then it is your fault that you resign the supreme seat the throne majestical the sceptred office of your ancestors your state of fortune and your due of birth the lineal glory of your royal house to the corruption of a blemishd stock whiles in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts which here we waken to our countrys good the noble isle doth want her proper limbs her face defacd with scars of infamy her royal stock graft with ignoble plants and almost shouldred in the swallowing gulf of dark forgetfulness and deep oblivion which to recure we heartily solicit your gracious self to take on you the charge and kingly government of this your land not as protector steward substitute or lowly factor for anothers gain but as successively from blood to blood your right of birth your empery your own for this consorted with the citizens your very worshipful and loving friends and by their vehement instigation in this just cause come i to move your grace gloucester i cannot tell if to depart in silence or bitterly to speak in your reproof best fitteth my degree or your condition if not to answer you might haply think tonguetied ambition not replying yielded to bear the golden yoke of sovereignty which fondly you would here impose on me if to reprove you for this suit of yours so seasond with your faithful love to me then on the other side i checkd my friends thereforeto speak and to avoid the first and then in speaking not to incur the last definitively thus i answer you your love deserves my thanks but my desert unmeritable shuns your high request first if all obstacles were cut away and that my path were even to the crown as the ripe revenue and due of birth yet so much is my poverty of spirit so mighty and so many my defects that i would rather hide me from my greatness being a bark to brook no mighty sea than in my greatness covet to be hid and in the vapour of my glory smotherd but god be thankd there is no need of me and much i need to help you were there need the royal tree hath left us royal fruit which mellowd by the stealing hours of time will well become the seat of majesty and make no doubt us happy by his reign on him i lay that you would lay on me the right and fortune of his happy stars which god defend that i should wring from him buckingham my lord this argues conscience in your grace but the respects thereof are nice and trivial all circumstances well considered you say that edward is your brothers son so say we too but not by edwards wife for first was he contract to lady lucy your mother lives a witness to his vow and afterward by substitute betrothd to bona sister to the king of france these both put off a poor petitioner a carecrazd mother to a many sons a beautywaning and distressed widow even in the afternoon of her best days made prize and purchase of his wanton eye seducd the pitch and height of his degree to base declension and loathd bigamy by her in his unlawful bed he got this edward whom our manners call the prince more bitterly could i expostulate save that for reverence to some alive i give a sparing limit to my tongue then good my lord take to your royal self this profferd benefit of dignity if not to bless us and the land withal yet to draw forth your noble ancestry from the corruption of abusing times unto a lineal truederived course mayor do good my lord your citizens entreat you buckingham refuse not mighty lord this profferd love catesby o make them joyful grant their lawful suit gloucester alas why would you heap this care on me i am unfit for state and majesty i do beseech you take it not amiss i cannot nor i will not yield to you buckingham if you refuse itas in love and zeal loath to depose the child your brothers son as well we know your tenderness of heart and gentle kind effeminate remorse which we have noted in you to your kindred and egally indeed to all estates yet know wheer you accept our suit or no your brothers son shall never reign our king but we will plant some other in the throne to the disgrace and downfall of your house and in this resolution here we leave you come citizens zounds ill entreat no more gloucester o do not swear my lord of buckingham exeunt buckingham mayor and citizens catesby call him again sweet prince accept their suit if you deny them all the land will rue it gloucester will you enforce me to a world of cares call them again i am not made of stones but penetrable to your kind entreaties albeit against my conscience and my soul reenter buckingham and the rest cousin of buckingham and sage grave men since you will buckle fortune on my back to bear her burden wheer i will or no i must have patience to endure the load but if black scandal or foulfacd reproach attend the sequel of your imposition your mere enforcement shall acquittance me from all the impure blots and stains thereof for god doth know and you may partly see how far i am from the desire of this mayor god bless your grace we see it and will say it gloucester in saying so you shall but say the truth buckingham then i salute you with this royal title long live king richard englands worthy king all amen buckingham tomorrow may it please you to be crownd gloucester even when you please for you will have it so
