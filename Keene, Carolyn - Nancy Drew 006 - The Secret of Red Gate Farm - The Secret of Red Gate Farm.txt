chapter i a strange fragrance that orientallooking clerk in the perfume shop certainly acted mysterious bess marvin de clared as she and her two friends ended their shopping trip and hurried down the street to the railroad station yes nancy drew answered thoughtfully i wonder why she didnt want you to buy that bot tle of blue jade the price would have discouraged me spoke up besss cousin darkhaired george fayne her boyish name fitted her slim build and straight forward breezy manner twenty dollars an ounce blond pretty bess who had a love for femi nine luxuries laughed i was extravagant but i just couldnt resist such yummy perfume after all dad gave me money to buy something frivo lous so i did nancy by this time was some distance ahead hurry girls or well miss the next train to river heights in her active life the attractive titianhaired young sleuth had learned that being on time was important the three eighteenyearold girls continued their frantic pace until the railroad station finally came into view once at the station they set down their pack ages to rest their arms whew bess sighed looking at her watch i didnt think wed make it but we have two minutes to spare and this would be one of julys hottest days nancy was pensive still contemplating their encounter with the mysterious woman in the oriental perfume shop she had realized the blue jade was much too expensive and the un willingness of the young woman to part with it had stimulated her interest instinct had told nancy that there must be some special reason why the saleswoman had been so reluctant to sell the blue jade then another idea struck her you know she said aloud its possible that saleswoman de liberately raised the price of the perfume george frowned but why youd think shed be thrilled to make such a good sale yes nancy agreed thats what perplexes me theres something very strange about it and id certainly like to know what it is oh nancy teased george there you go again dreaming up another mystery nancys blue eyes sparkled as she thought of the prospect the young sleuth had already solved several mysteries some of them for her fa ther carson drew a famous criminal lawyer among the cases on which nancy had worked were the secret in the old clock and the secret of shadow ranch the girls heard the train approaching the sta tion as it came to a halt they quickly gathered up their packages and hurried aboard what a day bess exclaimed as she pushed on through the cars the train was crowded and the girls walked through several cars before they found any vacant seats george and bess began discussing their many purchases bess gloated in particular over the bot tle of exotic perfume even though the package was wrapped it gave off a slight fragrance which was very pleasant george took a quick inventory of their pur chases then laughed bess its a good thing we got you to leave that last department store or you wouldnt have had enough money left to buy your ticket home she stated bluntly you should practice selfcontrol the way i do selfcontrol bess retorted i suppose you call a new hat two dresses three pairs of stock ings and a handbag selfcontrol george mustered a smile and decided to drop the subject nancy leaned her head back against the cush ion and as she relaxed studied the faces of the nearby passengers she thought that the thin sweetlooking girl who occupied the seat just op posite looked very tired worried and even ill nancy judged the girl to be her own age why are you so quiet nancy bess de manded suddenly just resting nancy returned she did not tell her friends that she had be come interested in the nearby passenger tor george and bess often teased her about her habit of scrutinizing strange faces however it was nancys lively interest in people that was largely responsible for involving her in unusual adven tures and she was always on the alert for a new mystery bess eyed her perfume package longingly and finally ripped off the paper i cant stand it any longer she sighed i must try some of this de licioussmelling stuff she opened the bottle and dabbed a couple of drops behind each ear then she offered it to george try some its really lovelymakes me think im in the mystic orient george could not keep from making a face no thank you she replied firmly its not my type nancy and bess laughed then bess offered some to nancy who accepted willingly bess again took out the stopper and was leaning over to put some perfume on nancy when the train lurched and jogged her arm oh bess cried in horror the perfume sprayed over nancy as the bottle fell to the floor such a waste of money george muttered as she picked up the halfempty container what a shame nancy exclaimed its your perfume bess and now i have a lot of it on me bess groaned i shouldve waited till i was home to open the bottle im lucky theres some left carefully she placed the small vial in her handbag by now the concentrated odor of blue jade had permeated the car and passengers in nearby seats flung open the windows im glad were getting off at the next stop nancy giggled everyone is laughing at us nancy had become so engrossed with the spilled perfume that she had forgotten about the pale young woman who occupied the opposite seat now as nancy turned her head she was startled to see that the girl had slumped down in a dejected heap shes fainted nancy exclaimed moving quickly across the aisle she shook the girl gently but there was no re sponse from the frail figure bess ask if there is a doctor in the car nancy cried urgently by this time other passengers in the car were aware that something had happened and were crowding about asking unnecessary questions and getting in the way nancy politely asked them to move back there did not appear to be a doctor in the coach but as nancy rubbed the girls wrists she was relieved to see that she was showing signs of recovering consciousness george quickly raised the window so that the fresh air fanned the girls face leaning against the seat she looked deathly pale what can i do george asked stay here while i get some water nancy an swered shes coming around now i think shell be all right in a few minutes nancy hurried to the water cooler at the far end of the car as she was trying to fill the paper cup a man who had been standing near the door way came toward her he made a pretense of wait ing his turn to get a drink yet she realized by the intent look on his face that something had startled him he was deliberately studying her was it because of the perfume she fairly reeked with it nancy was not prepared however for what came next the man edged closer to her glanced quickly about to see that no one was close by and muttered in a guttural tone any word from the chief nancy was taken completely by surprise she knew she had never seen the man before for she would not have forgotten such a cruel face his steelgray eyes bored straight into her nancy was so bewildered she could think of nothing to say the stranger realized at once that he had made a mistake excuse me miss my error he mur mured starting for the car ahead but that per fume well never mind chapter ii mysterious numbers nancy stared after the stranger and wondered what he could have meant evidently he mistook me for somebody else she thought but even so his actions certainly were peculiar what message had he expected to receive from her who was the chief how strange that the man should speak of the perfume as though it had been the cause of his mistake if nancys mind had not been occupied with the frail girls condition she might have won dered more over the strange encounter she dismissed it for the moment quickly filling a cup with ice water she rushed back to george and bess who were giving first aid to the girl do you feel better now nancy asked here drink this thank you the girl murmured gratefully taking the cup i feel much better now she added quietly it was very kind of you to help me it must have been the perfume that made you faint george declared a little is all right but half a bottle is overpowering im sure it wasnt the perfume the girl re turned quickly i havent felt well since i first boarded the train early this morning what a shame bess said ill get you some more water she soon returned with a second cup by the way nancybess turned to her friendwho was that man who spoke to you at the water cooler you noticed him nancy asked surprised yes bess said but i didnt recognize him nor did i nancy remarked the whole thing was quite mysterious he simply ap proached me and said any word from the chief the chief bess and george chorused what chief i have no idea the young sleuth admitted but evidently it was this strange perfume that attracted his attention or so he said i wonder what the perfume could have to do with it bess looked perplexed by this time the train was slowing down as it approached the river heights station and nancy and her friends realized they must hurry or they would miss their stop im afraid that we must interrupt this conver sation and say goodby nancy told the girl re luctantly we get off at river heights river heights the girl glanced anxiously out the window i get off here tool i had no idea we were so close well help you nancy offered do you really feel well enough to walk yes im all right now george and bess collected the miscellaneous packages while nancy helped the stranger along the aisle the girl hesitated uncertainly as she stepped from the train im not very familiar with river heights she said to nancy which direction should i take to go to the center of town youre still too shaky to walk any distance george spoke up have you no friend here to meet you the girl shook her head then why dont you come home for a snack with us nancy suggested i left my car parked here by the station and i can drive you back the girl started to protest but nancy and the others urged her on and soon they were all set tled in nancys blue convertible i havent even told you my name the strange girl said leaning back wearily im jo anne byrd i live with my grandmother at red gate farm about ten miles from round val ley thats where i took the train nancy introduced herself and her friends as she started the car and headed it toward the drew residence in another section of the city how nice it must be to live on a farm bess remarked and red gate is such a pleasant sounding name red gate is a lovely place joanne said feel ingly ive lived there with my grandmother ever since i can remember we dont have the money though to keep up the farm thats why i left home todayto find work here do you have something in mind bess ques tioned i came in response to a particular advertise ment joanne replied but did not say what it was a faraway look came into her eyes we sim ply must raise enough money to pay the long standing interest due on the mortgage of our farm or gram will lose it surely no one would be mean enough to take over your farm bess murmured sympatheti cally a bank holds the mortgage it has no choice gram knows very little about money matters so she takes anyones advice years ago she was ad vised to buy another farm and sell it at a high price all at once values crashed and she couldnt meet the payments on her extra farm so it went back to the original owners then she had to put a heavy mortgage on red gate too and if she loses that shell be penniless as joanne finished her story nancy turned the car into the drews driveway come in everybody she invited perhaps we can think of a way to help joanne the three girls followed nancy into the house where they were greeted by the drews pleasant housekeeper hannah gruen had been like a motherto nancy ever since the death of mrs drew when nancy was a child nancy asked han nah to make some sandwiches for them all then led the girls to the living room you must be nearly starved nancy said to joanne a moment later i know i am i am rather hungry joanne confessed i havent had anything to eat since last night what the other girls chorused it was my own fault joanne said hastily i was too excited this morning to think about food its no wonder you fainted nancy said ill ask hannah to fix you something hot nancy returned from the kitchen with a tray of appetizing sandwiches and a bowl of soup joanne ate heartily nancy and her friends joined in for they had had only a light snack while on their shopping expedition i do feel better joanne announced when she had finished it was so good of you to bring me here not at all nancy said softly wed like to help you all we can thank you but i believe everything will work out all right if only i get this position jo anne glanced anxiously at the clock ill really have to go now or ill be too late to make the call this afternoon could you tell me how to get to this address she handed a folded scrap of newspaper to nancy this particular ad for an office girl caught my eye since it asks for someone who has had experience on a farm nancy found the advertisement to be rather conventional but it was the name at the bottom of the paragraph that held her attention why this ad says riverside heights she ex claimed you should have stayed on the train until the next stop i thought riverside heights and river heights were the same place joanne byrd cried in distressed surprise riverside heights is only a few miles away nancy explained and the names are confusing even to people who live near here so its a natu ral mistake oh dear i dont know what to do now jo anne said anxiously if i dont apply for that po sition this afternoon ill probably lose my chance of getting it nancy had taken a liking to the girl and wanted to help her not only was joanne half sick from lack of food but she had worked herself into a nervous state you must let me drive you to riverside heights nancy insisted itll only take fifteen minutes and youll have plenty of time to apply for the position joannes face brightened instantly but she was reluctant to accept the favor ive really troubled you enough nonsense well start right away nancy turned to bess and george want to come along bess and george both declined since they were expected home the cousins gathered up their packages and all the girls went to the car nancy dropped bess and george at their own homes then took the highway leading to the next city i do hope i get there in time joanne said worriedly the job will mean so much to gram and me youll get there nancy assured her have you ever applied for a job before no ive always helped gram run the farm until now joanne explained i felt i was more needed there than anywhere else we keep a farm hand but a great deal of the work still falls upon me the girls soon reached riverside heights and nancy had no trouble finding the address men tioned in the advertisement it was in a rundown section of the city but nancy did not mention this to her companion here we are nancy said cheerfully stop ping the car in front of a dingylooking office building joanne made no move to get out of the car but sat nervously pressing her hands together im a terrible coward she confessed i dont know what in the world to say when i go in i wish youd come with me ill be glad to said nancy as she turned off the ignition and locked the car they entered the building there was no elevator so the girls climbed the dimly lighted stairway to the third floor soon they came to room which had been mentioned in the advertisement theres no name on the door nancy ob served but this must be the right place as they stepped into the reception room nancy noted that it was dirty and drab the two girls glanced at each other exchanging expres sions of disappointment at that moment a man came from the inner of fice and surveyed the girls sharply he was tall and wiry with hostile penetrating eyes and harsh features his suit was bold in pattern and color and his necktie was gaudy well he demanded coldly joanne found sufficient courage to take the ad vertisement from her pocket ii saw this in the paper she stammered i came to apply for the position the man stared at joanne critically then at nancy you lookin for the job too he asked nancy shook her head no im here with my friend the man looked at joanne again and said with a shrug of his shoulders go on in the other room ill talk to you in a minute joanne cast nancy a doubtful glance and obediently stepped into the inner office look here the man addressed nancy wouldnt you like that job i could use a good lookin girl like you im not looking for work thank you nancy returned aloofly the man was about to make a retort when the telephone rang he scowled and went over to the table to answer it as he lifted the receiver he looked nervously back toward nancy hello he growled into the phone this is al shoot nancy listened to his end of the unbusiness like conversation and watched him reach for pa per and pencil and begin to scribble down a line of figures this in itself would not have seemed so peculiar except that he continued to eye nancy suspiciously he kept on copying figures all the while nancy watched him curiously ok hank he muttered just before he hung up you say youve found a girl fine we cant be too careful in this business all this time nancy was wondering what kind of transactions went on in this office there had been no indication on the door of what business the man was engaged in and nothing in the room gave her any clue she realized now that joannes chances of getting the position were slim and nancy was actually relieved she was very sus picious of the whole setup i was just taking down some stockmarket quo tations the man remarked lightly as he crossed the room toward nancy this isnt an investment house is it she asked no you wouldnt call it that exactly he an swered with a smirk we run a manufacturing business i see nancy murmured though she really did not understand at all what do you manu facture the man pretended not to hear and moved on to the inner office where joanne was waiting in haste to escape further questions he forgot to pick up the sheet of paper with the numbers on it nancy was curious about the telephone conver sation and could not resist the temptation to take a peek at the notation she stepped silently over to the telephone table and glanced at the sheet strung out across the top and bottom of the page were numbers the top row read stock quotations like fun nancy told her self why did he lie about it he must have been afraid id discover something as usual nancy was intrigued at any hint of a mystery she studied the row of odd figures suddenly it dawned on her that they might be a message in code nancy looked quickly toward the inner office the door was open but the man sat with his back toward her she did not dare pick up the paper if only there was enough time to copy the codel with one eye on the office nancy took a sheet of paper and frantically scribbled the numbers carefully keeping them in their right order she could hear joannes soft voice then her prospective employer talking loudly and realized the interview was coming to an end she had copied only the top row of numbers but dared not spend any more time at it she put the copy into her bag and slipped back into her chair just a moment before joanne and the man emerged from the inner room he glanced to ward the telephone gave a start and rushed across the room with a muttered exclamation he grabbed the paper and thrust it into his pocket nancys heart was beating madly as she forced herself to remain outwardly calm he stood with a cold look on his face his eyes fixed on nancy chapter iii work on a code had the man heard her rush from the telephone table nancy wondered was he suspicious of her actions during his absence if so what reason did he have and what business deal was he hiding in this dingy excuse for an office nancy pre tended not to notice his penetrating question ing eyes but she was ill at ease the hostile man spoke up you girls better get out of here he blurted i got no more time to waste and dont bother to come back i nancy and joanne looked hastily at each other and moved toward the door once outside the building nancy breathed a sigh of relief and turned toward joanne who was close to tears dont feel bad because you didnt get the job nancy said gently as they walked to the car you wouldnt have wanted it im sure that man was detestable joanne shud dered i had just given my name and address when he started to shout you must have heard him nancy nodded i think he had already found another girl to work for him she said at least i heard him say something like that over the phone i knew i wouldnt get the job joanne sighed dejectedly he told me i wasnt the type id count my blessings if i were you said nancy soberly theres something strange going on in that office and id like to know what it is why what do you mean joanne asked quiz zically well nancy began carefully im not sure my suspicions are just but i have a hunch theres something shady about the telephone message he got when you were in the inner office nancy ex plained about the series of numbers on the sheet of paper and how she suspected they might form some sort of code at any rate nancy went on we cant be sure of anything so this must remain confiden tial joanne nodded and fell silent many thoughts raced through nancys mind as she remembered the days encounters first there had been the perfume shop and its mysterious saleswoman then the curious man on the train who had been attracted by the strange fragrance and now this crude gruff man in room what should i do now joanne asked for lornly i cant go back to red gate farm and let gram down i simply must find work why not come home with me nancy sug gested as they paused beside her car ill be glad to have you as my guest for the night and in the morning youll feel better and can decide what to do then joanne shook her head proudly thank you but i wouldnt think of letting you go to any more trouble i have a little money i can find a board inghouse and ill keep on looking for work here nancy saw that joanne was disappointed and discouraged and hated to leave her on her own but finally conceded i guess youre right she admitted but at least let me help you hunt for a place to stay joanne accepted the offer grate fully even with the car it was difficult to locate a pleasant room joanne could not afford a high priced place and the cheaper ones were unsatis factory finally however they found a suitable room on a quiet street and nancy helped joanne get settled i may be driving over this way tomorrow she said if i do ill stop in to see what luck youve had i wish you would joanne invited shyly ill need someone to bolster my morale all right i will nancy promised after a few words of encouragement she said goodby then drove slowly toward river heights her mind again focused on the various events of the day i dont know what will happen to joanne if she doesnt find work nancy told herself it would be a shame if her grandmother loses red gate farm i wish i could do something but i dont know of any available jobs it was nearly dinnertime when nancy reached river heights as she passed the fayne home she saw george and her cousin bess on the front lawn and stopped to tell them about joannes un successful interview isnt that too bad bess murmured in disap pointment she seems such a sweet girl id like to know her better i promised id drive over to see her tomor row nancy told the girls why dont you come along lets george cried enthusiastically i love going places with you we always seem to find some sort of adventure nancys blue eyes became serious id say this has been a pretty full day i cant seem to tor get that mysterious saleswoman in the oriental perfume shop or the strange man on the train i wasnt going to say anything to you about this but something odd happened this afternoon in that office nancy then related the mysterious actions and behavior of the man named al you mean you think his telephone conversa tion was a little on the shady side bess asked wideeyed it seemed that way to me nancy answered i doubt very much that its a manufacturing business and those numbers i copied from his pad were anything but stockmarket quotations well here we go again never a dull moment with nancy around george laughed gaily dont be too impatient george nancy ad vised with a grin we dont have proof that any of todays incidents is really cause for suspicion at this moment a foreignmake car went by nancy glanced casually at the driver then gave a start he was the man who had spoken to her on the train he slowed down and stared at the three girls and at the fayne home nancy felt at once that he was memorizing the address he gave a selfsatis fied smile and drove on nancy noted his license number i almost feel as if ill hear from him again she told herself then revealed to the girls who had not noticed the cars driver that he was the man who had confronted her on the train hes still interested in you bess teased but george found nothing to laugh about i dont like this nancy she said seriously i re member he had a hard calculating face nancy too remained serious a disturbing thought had suddenly occurred to her why she told herself that man must have been trailing me but i wonder for what reason she determined for the moment at least not to mention her suspicions aloud and dropped the subject of the mysterious man presently she bade bess and george goodby climbed into her convertible and drove home i think ill ask dad what he thinks about that man als mysterious telephone message nancy decided as she hopped from the car she had often taken some of her puzzling prob lems to her father he in turn frequently dis cussed his law cases with his daughter and found nancys suggestions practical you look tired dear carson drew observed as she entered the living room and sank into a comfortable chair have a big day shopping i cant remember when so much ever hap pened to me in one day nancy smiled despite her fatigue i suppose ill be getting the bills in a few days her father remarked teasingly it wasnt just the shopping dad nancy re turned gravely nancy now plunged into the story of the ori ental shop and the dropped perfume bottle of her encounter with the stranger on the train and the strange fact of having seen him a short while ago in a foreignmake car what do you make of it she questioned mr drew shrugged what did he look like the man seemed very polite but he had a cruel look in his eyes nancy gave a brief de scription of him hm mr drew mused i cant say i like the sound of this i wouldnt wonder about it said nancy except that the girl in the shop seemed so re luctant to sell the perfume why do you suppose she cared whether someone bought it maybe she was instructed to save it for spe cial customers mr drew suggested dad you may have something there nancy exclaimed she told her father about joanne byrd and described the office which they had visited to gether she ended by showing him the figures which she had copied this was almost all of the message she ex plained i didnt have time to copy the rest can you figure it out carson drew studied the sheet of paper im not an expert on codes he said finally but i suspect this might be one since the man lied in saying these figures are market quotations can you decipher it nancy asked eagerly i wish i could but it looks like a complicated one it would probably take me days to figure out what these numbers stand for why dont you work on it yourself i dont know too much about codes nancy declared but perhaps i can learn i have a book you might use her father of fered it may not help much since every code is different still all codes have some features in common for instance in any language certain words are repeated more frequently than others if you can figure out a frequency table then look for certain numbers to appear more often than others you may get somewhere id like to try nancy said eagerly this will be a good test for your sleuthing mind her father said teasingly if you dont figure out the code you can always turn this pa per over to an expert not until ive had a fighting chance at it my self nancy answered with spirit id really like to help you with this mystery her father said but im so tied up with this clifton case i just cant tackle anything else right now immediately after dinner mr drew retired to his secondfloor study to work on his law case nancy went to her bedroom to read the book on codes when she finished the girl detective took out the sheet on which she had copied the num bers and studied the figures intently im sure the numbers stand for letters of the alphabet nancy told herself they must have been arranged in some pattern for over two hours nancy tried combination after combination and applied it to the code nothing showed up until she hit upon the plan of four letters of the alphabet in sequence by number the next four in reverse alternating in this manner and leaving two in the end bracket nancy scrutinized what she had worked out a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z ive hit it she thought excitedly chapter iv a switch in jobs c a l li ng m ee ti ng the numbers with the marks above or below them stymied nancy completely most of the oth ers fell neatly into place and spelled calling meeting nancy repeated but where and by whom she yawned weary from her long concentration my brains too fogged to figure out anything more she told herself ill tackle this another time the next morning nancy and her father en joyed a leisurely breakfast he praised her for hitting upon the key to the code but agreed that solving the rest of it would be difficult keep at it he advised smiling fondly at his daughter by the way i wont be home to lunch or dinner today because of this clifton case i thought id visit joanne and try to cheer her up nancy said do you by any chance know anyone whos looking for an office girl she added mr drew shook his head no im afraid i dont but if i hear of anything ill let you know i feel that joanne isnt the type to be in the hectic business world nancy remarked if it werent that she wants to help her grandmother i doubt that shed even try for a city position after carson drew had left for his office nancy busied herself around the house helping han nah when the housework was finally done nancy settled herself in an easy chair and delved into the code book once more but she found no new hints to help break her own set of numbers nancy bess and george had planned to start for riverside heights early in the afternoon so as soon as the luncheon dishes had been cleared away nancy was off to pick up the other girls by twothirty they had reached joannes rooming house the landlady answered nancys knock on the front door and informed her that joanne had left two hours before to see about a job she would be back at three oclock the woman invited the girls in but the living room looked so dark and dreary that they preferred to wait outside in the car its too bad joanne has to stay in a dismal place like that nancy remarked especially when shes accustomed to farm life i sure hope she finds something bess added maybe luck will be with her today within fifteen minutes the girls spotted jo anne at a distance she did not notice the car and unaware that she was being observed walked slowly toward the rooming house her head drooping dejectedly she didnt get the job george murmured i feel so sorry for her as joanne approached nancy called to her jo anne glanced up quickly and mustered a smile no luck today bess questioned none at all joanne answered with a sigh she came over to the car and stood leaning against the door i tried half a dozen places but i couldnt land a thing ill just have to try again tomorrow in the face of such spirit on joannes part the girls could do nothing but encourage her though secretly they feared she would have no better luck the next day how about coming for a short ride nancy invited id love it joanne accepted eagerly its so hot and stuffy in my room she hesitated then added of course i guess it is everywhere these days nancy took a road that led out of the city and soon they were driving past cultivated fields of corn and wheat gradually joanne became more cheerful its so good to be out in the country again she declared gazing wistfully toward a farmhouse nestled in the rolling hills that place looks something like red gate farm only not half so attractive i wish you all could visit me there sometime so do we nancy said enthusiastically wouldnt it be wonderful to hike over hills and breathe in the fresh clean air ive always wanted to spend a vacation on a farm bess declared longingly just imagine having cream an inch thick just what you need for reducing her cousin teased her you wouldnt have to worry about that jo anne smiled we keep only one cow when the girls later left joanne at the door of her boardinghouse they had the satisfaction of knowing she was in a more cheerful frame of mind well keep in touch with you joanne nancy promised as they said goodby i have a feeling well be seeing a lot more of each other joanne called after them so please do call me jo id much prefer it jo it is they agreed merrily goodby for now nancy and her friends had just started back to river heights when nancy checked her gas gauge and decided to stop at a filling station the girls were idly watching passersby when suddenly a young woman walking with mincing steps be cause oœ her extremely high heels attracted nancys attention nancy gasped in recognition there was no mistaking the distinctive orien tal features the clerk in the perfume shop nancy turned to her companions look at that girl who just crossed over isnt she the same one who sold you the perfume bess you mean the one who tried not to sell me the perfume dont you bess joked yes shes the same girl their eyes followed the girl up the street she had not glanced toward them but had passed the filling station and continued on now what can she be doing here nancy wondered she got out of the car and stood watch ing the girl who entered an office building a short distance farther up the street thats funny nancy said to her friends who were peering from the car windows i think thats the very place where jo applied for a po sition you dont suppose that perfume girl has two jobs do you george questioned id sure like to find out the young detective answered just then the attendant approached nancy paid him and stepped back into the car we must try to follow her she declared starting the motor they pulled up near the of fice building into which the young woman had disappeared you two wait here and keep watch nancysaid if im not back in a few minutes youd bet ter come and see whats going on aye aye sir george said mockingly were at your service but be careful nancy alighted hurried up the street and went into the building the halls were deserted evidently the girl had gone into one of the offices but which one as nancy stood uncertainly staring up and down she spotted a handyman coming down the corridor did you see a girl come into the building just a moment ago she inquired oriental the man demanded resting on his broom nancy nodded eagerly yes she looks rather oriental oh you mean yvonne wong do you know her nancy said thinking that with the name yvonne the girl was probably part french no but i heard that man she works for with the loud voice and the swell clothes call her by that name she works here nancy inquired in surprise guess so she must be a new girl came here yesterday i see nancy murmured thinking yvonne wong had managed a rather sudden change of jobs could you tell me in which office she works her questions evidently had begun to annoy the handyman in if youre so interested he said brusquely why dont you go in and ask her what you want to know thank you nancy responded with a po lite smile turning away i wont trouble you any further nancy had taken only a few steps when she thought of one more question and came back by the way she said in a casual tone what sort of office is the man regarded her suspiciously how should i know he demanded bluntly they dont pay me to go stickin my nose in other folks business i got my own work nancy could see that she was not going to leam any more from the man so she left the building and joined bess and george who were waiting anxiously at the door well what did you manage to find out bess queried as the three girls walked toward the car quite a bit nancy answered meditatively she was certain that she could not have been mis taken yvonne wong was the same girl who only yesterday had waited on them in the oriental shop why had she changed positions well george broke into her thoughts dont keep us in suspense nancy answered all their questions as she drove toward river heights explaining that the young womans name was yvonne wong and that she was a new girl in the officethe same office nancy and joanne had visited but what about yvonnes job at the oriental perfume shop asked george i dont know nancy admitted and the handyman wouldnt give me any indication as to the type of business it was i nancy recalled the strange telephone call which had been made while she and joanne were in the office she distinctly remembered that some mention had been made of a girl who had been found for the position and that the man who called himself al had said that one couldnt be too careful i wouldnt be so suspicious about yvonne nancy added except i have a feeling she didnt get that job by chance she must have been cho sen because she was especially suited to the situa tionwhatever that is theres something underhanded about the whole thing but we havent much to go on bess declared nancy agreed some clue may turn up any way we have jo to think about for the time be ing it was getting dark as nancy dropped off bess and then george at their homes it rained so hard the following day that nancy stayed indoors and tried to figure out the re maining symbols of the code using the same alphabetical key was m equaled h could be b and stood for r mhbr nancy pondered that doesnt make any sense perhaps those marks over and under the letters are a second code she reasoned if only i could decipher them i might know whos calling what meeting and where the next morning a bright sun shone while nancy was busy with chores around the house the phone rang and she went to answer it hello nancy said a quiet voice this is jo how are you oh jo im fine nancy replied eagerly did you find a job she asked hopefully not yet joanne answered sadly but i have some other news i hope its good nancy said i just talked with my grandmother on the phone i must go home right away she told me that soon after i left a man called and made an offer to buy red gate his price was so low she didnt accept he was very persistent though and gave her five days to think it over yes nancy prompted well the other girl went on in the mean time grandmother decided to try raising money by taking in boarders she placed an ad in the paper that same day good for her nancy exclaimed has she had any replies no joanne said worriedly even though the ad hasnt run very long grams discouraged im afraid she has changed her mind and intends to take that mans offer she said hes coming to red gate tomorrow at five oclock and bringing papers for her to sign there was a pause then joanne burst out nancy i just cant let gram go through with this and if im not there shell accept the mans offer she mustnt give up red gate farm yet thats why i must get home and persuade her not to sell by all means nancy agreed i suppose youll take the train to round valley in the morn ing thats the horrible part nancy joanne said dejectedly ill have only enough money for train fare half the way after i pay my room rent no need to do that jo nancy said eagerly you get your bag packed and be ready to leave at ten oclock tomorrow moming chapter v money money as nancy reflected on her plan another idea occurred to her she was sure that bess and george would love the chance to spend a vacation on a farm since they had both mentioned it the other day nancy did some mental arithmetic and came to the conclusion that three steady boarders who paid their bills regularly might help to lessen the amount of the mortgage in terest payments that threatened red gate and also keep mrs byrd from selling the place nancy thought i hope dad agrees to my making the trip that evening at dinner mr drew said ill be out of town for a week or so nancy do you think you can get some of your friends to stay with you i have an even better idea nancy replied and smiled she outlined her plan to help joanne byrd her father consented enthusiastically proud as always of nancys desire to assist others it was not so easy to convince bess and george when nancy telephoned them they both wanted to help joanne and agreed that a week or two in the country would be very pleasant but there were complications if george went it meant she would lose out on a camping trip bess had planned to visit an aunt in chicago but ad mitted that the trip could be postponed theres one thing about it george said laughingly as she finally agreed to give up the camping trip ive never been with you yet that we didnt run into an adventure or mystery maybe a trip to red gate will be exciting bess and george had no trouble in getting their parents consent it was decided that nancy would pick up joanne first then come back for the cousins since river heights was on the way to round valley nancy packed her clothes that night after tele phoning the plans to joanne as she was closing the suitcase her eyes fell upon the copy of the coded message which lay on the dressing table id better take it along and work on it when ever i have the chance she decided nancy got up early the next morning and had breakfast with her father after exchanging fond goodbys with him and hannah she hurried to her car it was close to ten oclock when nancy reached riverside heights she stopped at a downtown service station and had her convertible filled with gas and checked for oil then she drove to jo annes boardinghouse her passenger was waiting nancy was glad to find that joanne seemed to be in better spirits itll be such fun all of us going together jo anne said and i know gram will be happy to have you stay as long as you like only on the condition that we are paying guests nancy insisted well see about that later joanne said smiling they put her suitcase into the trunk of the car and soon were on their way back to river heights assured by joanne that they would be welcome at red gate the cousins brought out their suitcases and put them in the luggage com partment george took nancy aside and said excitedly a little while ago a man phoned here and asked for miss fayne when i answered he said listen miss tell that snoopy friend of yours to stop her snooping or shell be sorry then he hung up without giving his name nancy set her jaw then smiled whoever he is he has a guilty conscience so my suspicions were well founded who do you think he is george asked either the strange man on the train who fol lowed me here or some accomplice of his im glad for your sake were going away nancy stated george lets not say anything about this to jo nancy advised as she and george walked back to the car its a perfect day for our trip to the country joanne said excitedly george could see by the expression on jo annes face that a visit to red gate farm with her new friends was far more important to her than any other plans the girls might have had i agree one hundred per cent george an swered happily as she stepped into the car and ill be so glad to get out of this heat bess chimed in with a sigh i spent practically the whole night dreaming about the cool re freshing breezes in the country as nancy steered the convertible in the direc tion of round valley she said with an eager smile were off to rescue red gate farm nancy and her friends thoroughly enjoyed the scenic route to round valley they stopped for a quick lunch and then continued their drive the winding roads led through cool groves and skirted sparkling little lakes each hilltop brought a different and beautiful view gradually the worried expression completely left joannes eyes and color came into her thin face she began to laugh heartily at the antics of bess and george as they rode along she told the girls a great deal about her home youll like red gate im sure she said en thusiastically we havent any riding horses but there will be plenty of other things to do we can explore the cave for one thing cave bess questioned with interest how exciting what kind is it a home for bears or a pirates den joanne laughed theres a large cavern lo cated on the farm no one knows how it came to be there but we think it must have been made a long time ago by an underground river you must have explored it before this nancy exclaimed oh yes of course though ill admit i never did very thoroughly and i havent been near the cave for years as a child i was always afraid of the placeit looked so dark and gloomy lately ive been too busy working around the farm well have to put that at the top of our list george declared i love spooky things well im not so sure i do bess admitted nancy laughed we may even find hidden treasure in the walls i wish you could joanne sighed it cer tainly would come in handy the hours passed quickly as the travelers al ternately sang and chatted why its almost four oclock george announced in surprise weve made good time nancy remarked bess spoke up plaintively im halfstarved its been ages since lunch i could go for a gooey sundae the others laughed but agreed they were hungry too lets watch for a roadside stand nancy pro posed ill have to stop soon for gas anyway well come to one soon joanne spoke up were in round valley now a few minutes later she pointed out a com bination filling station and lunchroom which looked clean and inviting nancy turned the con vertible into the driveway and parked out of the way of other drivers who might want to stop for gasoline the group entered the lunchroom and took seats at one of the small white tables they all decided on chocolate nut sundaes topped with whipped cream here goes another pound bess sighed as she gave her order but id rather be pleasantly plump than give up sundaes though there were few customers in the room the woman in charge who also did the serving was extremely slow in filling the orders twice nancy glanced at her watch if youll excuse me she said ill step out side and get the gasoline it will save us a little time in getting started dont wait for me if our sundaes come she drove the car over to the pump and asked the attendant to fill the tank before he could do so however a large highpowered sedan pulled up to the other pump coming to an abrupt stop almost parallel to nancys car give me five and make it snappy a voice called out impatiently the attendant glanced inquiringly at nancy drew do you mind he asked wait on them first if you like she said gra ciously nancy observed the passengers with interest there were three rather coarselooking men ac companied by a woman nancy could not see the face of the driver for it was turned away from her but suddenly he opened the door of his car im goin inside and get a couple bottles of ginger ale she heard him grumble to his com panions as he stepped from the automobile and turned nancy saw his face he was the mysterious man who had spoken to her that day on the train in view of the telephone call george had re ceived nancy did not wish to be observed she turned her head quickly leaned down and pre tended to be studying a road map i hope he doesnt recognize me nancy thought or see my license plate to her relief the man walked in front of the convertible without a sideward glance at that moment the woman alighted and walked toward the lunchroom passing close to nancys car she was tall and slender with blond hair that was al most shoulder length nancys attention was sud denly arrested when she detected on the stranger a familiar scentblue jade perfume after the driver and the blond woman had en tered the lunchroom nancy gazed at the two men who remained in the automobile they were the sort carson drew would describe as tough customers the blond woman soon reappeared and got back into the sedan then the driver came out carrying the cold drinks without looking in nancys direction he addressed the attendant harshly say aint you finished yet he turned to one of the men in the car and handed him the bottles of ginger ale hold these will you hank i got to pay this bird nancy started that man in room called one of his friends hank over the telephone she said to herself could he be this person her attention was drawn back to the driver who was paying the attendant he took a thick roll of bills from his pocket and with a careless gesture peeled off a tendollar bill arent you afraid to carry such a wad around sir the attendant questioned gazing admiringly at the thick roll the driver laughed boisterously plenty more where this comes from eh hank you bet my roll makes his look like a flat tire just feast your eyes on this he flashed an even larger roll of bills in the amazed attendants face the fillingstation man shrugged ill have to go inside to get your change the moment he had disappeared the third man in the car muttered to his companions you fools do you want to make him suspicious pipe down he spoke in a low tone but the wind car ried his voice in nancys direction maurice is right the driver admitted the fellow is only a cornball but we cant be too careful the attendant returned with the change the driver pocketed it and drove off without another word nancy instinctively noted the license number of the car on impulse she went to a phone booth and dialed her friend chief mc ginnis of the river heights police department ill ask him to let me know who owns both the sedan and the foreignmake car that slowed down at georges house she determined then ill find out about the driver the woman wearing the blue jade the men named maurice and hank and maybe the man in room chapter vi a worrisome journey some class eh the attendant remarked to nancy as she came back to her car must be mil lionaires or racketeers nancy thought as soon as her gas tank was filled she paid the bill and hurried back into the lunchroom the girls already had been served what took you so long bess asked another car drove up and i had to wait nancy answered simply she sat down thought fully eating her sundae whats the matter with you george de manded presently youve hardly said a word since you sat down nancy looked around and saw that no one was seated near their table in whispers she told what had happened oh dear said bess maybe that man on the train found out where were going and is on his way there too dont be silly george chided her cousin if hes in some shady deal around river heights hed be glad to have our young sleuth out of the way joanne looked a bit worried but all she said was i think wed better be on our way i have to be there before that man comes to buy the farm i must talk gram out of it the girls finished the sundaes and picked up their checks but nancy insisted upon paying i want to break this twentydollar bill dad gave me she said ive spent most of my smaller bills the waitress changed the bill for her without comment and the girls left the lunchroom as they climbed into the car nancy glanced anx iously at the sky there was a dark overcast in the west it does look like rain over my way joanne observed and we leave the paved road and take a dirt one about five miles from the farm im afraid its going to be a race against time nancy warned starting the car a bad storm on a dirt road wont help matters at all the girls now noticed a change in the country side the hills had become steeper and the val leys deeper the farms dotting the landscape were very attractive nancy made fast time for she was bent on beating the storm the sky became gloomier and overcast soon the first raindrops appeared on the windshield were in for a downpour all right nancy declared grimly as she turned onto the dirt road soon there was thunder and lightning and the rain came down in torrents listen to that wind bess exclaimed its enough to blow us off the road the next minute everyone groaned in dismay and nancy braked the car across the road stood a wooden blockade on it was a sign detour bridge under repair george read it aloud in disgust an arrow on the sign indicated a narrow road to the right as nancy made the turn joanne gave a sigh oh dear she said this back way will take us much longer to reach red gate the detour led through a woodland of tall trees daylight had been blotted out entirely and even with the cars headlights on full nancy could barely see ahead again she was forced to slow down suddenly a jagged streak of lightning hit a big oak a short distance from the car it splintered the tree oh screamed bess this is terrible nancy pretended to be calm but she really was very much worried she decided it would be safer to get away from the dangerous line of trees any one of which might crash down on them how long is this stretch of woods she asked joanne oh perhaps five hundred feet well have to chance it nancy drove as quickly as she dared in the darkness the girls breathed sighs of relief when open country was reached but joannes fears were not yet over watch out she advised theres a sharp treacherous curve very soon just before we take the turnoff for the farm by now the brief storm had moved off to a dis tant sky and it was easier to see the boundaries of the slippery road nancy rounded a curve but as the car took the turn the wheels on the right side sank into the thick mud of a ditch bringing the car to a lurching halt the unexpected mishap stunned the girls for a moment finally bess found her voice now what nancy endeavored to drive the car out of the ditch but it was useless wellshe sighed we may as well jump out and examine the car keep your fingers crossed they found the convertible at a lopsided angle the right wheels however were firmly anchored by the mud the four girls attempted to push the car but without success ill look in the trunk nancy said to see if theres something to help us nancy found two pieces of heavy burlap bess and george put them in front of the two back wheels for traction then they gathered and broke up some brush to make a mat for each tire i hope this works joanne said taking her place to assist in pushing the car there prob ably wont be anyone else using this desolate road who could help us i im afraid we wont reach the farm in time nancy stepped into the car and started the motor easing the gas and slowly rocking the con vertible back and forth inch by inch the tires crept forward finally catching on the burlap and brush and rolling out of the ditch weve done it bess shouted proudly with a little outside help george panted with a grin the girls laughed from sheer relief they started off again more slowly than be fore but they had gone only a mile when a new storm seemed to be coming up in less than five minutes complete darkness descended again bringing another deluge of rain deafening thun derclaps instantly followed vivid forks of light ning of necessity nancy once more kept the auto mobile at a snails pace it was impossible to see more than a few feet ahead anxiously joanne kept glancing at her watch its fivefifteen she announced nervously nancy tried to assuage the worried girls fears this storm may have delayed your grand mothers caller the wind and rain continued unabated as the convertible climbed the brow of a hill there was a brilliant flash of lightning george who was seated in front with nancy screamed dont hit her nancy jammed on the brakes so quickly that the rear of the car skidded around sideways in the road who she demanded horrified the woman in the road didnt you see her maybe shes under the car heartsick nancy jumped out one door bess another they peered under the car alongside it in back of it they could see no one are you sure you saw a woman nancy in quired just then another streak of lightning illumi nated the sky and bess called out there goes someone running across that field nancy glanced quickly in that direction and saw the running figure of a woman at that same moment the woman looked back over her shoul der revealing a thin haggard face nancy judged her to be in her early fifties all four girls stared in mystification nancy and bess returned to the car and the journey was resumed why would any sane person be walking in such a storm bess spoke up finally shes headed in the direction of the cavern said joanne and explained that they were now nearing the farm maybe shes one of those strange people over there nancy and her friends were immediately curi ous before they could ask what joanne meant the car reached the crest of a steep hill and jo anne cried out theres red gate farm she pointed to the valley below them the storm had let up and the sun was coming out the river heights girls could clearly see the fortyacre farm with its groves of pine trees and a winding river which curled along the valley everything looked green and fresh after the heavy rain its beautiful exclaimed bess and cooland peaceful joanne added ex citedly dont count on much relaxation with nancy around george advised their new friend shell find some adventure to occupy every waking hour yes bess agreed adventure with mystery added nancy smiled she reflected on the two mys teries she had already encountered the unsolved case of the blue jade perfume and the strange code as the car descended into the valley the girls caught a better glimpse of the farm with its huge red barn and various adjoining sheds and the large rambling house partly covered with vines there were brightred geraniums in the window boxes and a freshly painted picket fence sur rounding the yard nancy stopped the car in front of the big red gate which opened into the garden oh i hope its not too late joanne cried as she sprang out to unlatch the gate chapter vii mature cult nancy drove in to red gate farm and parked she consulted her watch and noted with dismay it was quarter to six by now the farmhouse door had opened and a grayhaired woman in a crisp gingham dress and white apron came hurrying out to meet them her blue eyes were bright as she welcomed joanne warmly my granddaughter told me how kind you all were to her in the city she said to nancy and her friends i cant thank you enough gram joanne exclaimed i cant stand the suspense did you sell the farm to that man mrs byrd shook her head mercy i was so excited at your coming back i forgot to tell you he phoned a little while ago and said that be cause of the storm hed rather come here to morrowhe could wait one more day not only joanne but her visitors heaved sighs of relief further discussion of the subject was deferred when mrs byrd insisted the girls freshen up for supper they entered the large rambling house and a little later everyone sat down in the plainly fur nished but comfortable dining room mrs byrd appeared very happy as she bustled about serv ing the delicious meal of hot biscuits sizzling ham sweet potatoes and coffee the girls had not realized how hungry they were nothing like driving through a storm to work up an appetite george grinned it was not until dessertfreshly baked lemon meringue piethat joanne mentioned again what was uppermost in her mind gram she said gently please call up that man and tell him you dont want to sell our farm please well find a way to stay here somehow im sure therell be answers to your ads for boarders nancy quickly spoke up yes mrs byrd it certainly would be a shame to give up red gate and besides george bess and i would like to be paying guests for a whileif youd like us to stay that is of course i want you all here as long as pos sible but i really cant accept any money mrs byrd protested you have been so wonderful to jo if you wont let us pay our share well have to return home tomorrow nancy insisted mrs byrd finally relented and declared with a smile i believe i was just waiting to be dis suaded from taking that mr kents offer ill call him right now he gave me his telephone num ber the girls followed her into the kitchen and sat down while mrs byrd went to the phone there and put in the call mr kent ive decided not to sell red gate farmat any price no i no absolutely the woman winced and held the phone away from her ear nancy and her friends exchanged glances the man was evidently incensed and was speaking so loudly they could hear his voice easily finally mrs byrd put down the receiver well im glad that man isnt going to own red gate she declared he certainly was un pleasant he even said i might regret my de cision joannes face was radiant and she hugged her grandmother i feel so much better now she turned to her new friends somehow i know youre going to bring us luck nancy bess and george suddenly mrs byrd said goodness ive for gotten to look in our mailbox today ill go joanne hurried outside and was back in a minute several envelopes in her hand gram one of these is from the round valley gazette do you think excitedly she handed the mail to her grandmother the girls watched eagerly as mrs byrd tore open a long bulky envelope and took out a num ber of enclosed letters she looked at them quickly a smile spread over her face gram are they answers to the ad for board ers joanne asked excitedly mrs byrd nodded i can hardly believe it two people are arriving the day after tomorrow first a mrs salisbury then a mr abbott sev eral others will come later this month wonderful nancy said and immediately offered her assistance in getting rooms ready count bess and me in too said george joanne and her grandmother at first demurred but were outvoted very well mrs byrd smiled tomorrow afternoon will be time enough to get things ready later as the guests bid her good night mrs byrd said jo was right you three girls have brought us luck bless you george and bess were shown to the room in which they would sleep nancy was to share jo annes bedroom oh how sweet it smells in here joanne com mented as nancy unpacked thats some of the oriental perfume which splashed on my clothes in the train said nancy it certainly is strong and lasting when nancy awoke the next morning warm sunlight was streaming through the windows jo anne had already gone downstairs nancys first thought was to phone police chief mcginnis and find out about the owner or owners of the cars driven by the suspicious man after dressing hur riedly she went to the first floor and placed the call good morning nancy the officer said heres the information you wanted both cars were rented from driveyourself agencies by a man named philip smith a native of dallas texas theyve been returned nancy thanked the chief and hung up that clue wasnt any help she thought none of those suspicious men talked like a texan the name philip smith was probably phony and made up on the spur of the moment also a forged drivers license might have been used presently bess and george came down and the girls enjoyed a delicious breakfast of pancakes and sausages afterward joanne took the girls on a tour of the farm she showed them the lovely gardens a large chicken house and her pet goat chester a turkey took a dislike to bess and chased her to the farmhouse porch much to the amusement of the onlookers i joanne came to the rescue and chased the turkey away our farm isnt very well stocked she ad mitted as she led the way to the barn we keep only one cow and one work horse poor old michael should be retired on a pension but we cant afford to lose him yet joanne cheerfully hailed the hired man reu ben ames was about forty years old redhaired and rather quiet in manner he acknowledged each introduction with a mumbled pleased to meet you miss and extended a workworn hand for each girl to shake reuben shifted uncomfort ably and then returned to the barn reuben is as good as gold even if he is bash ful joanne told the girls i dont know what wed do without him wed better keep an eye on bess george teased shell be breaking another heart bess made a goodnatured retort as the girls started for the orchard george demonstrated her agility by climbing the nearest apple tree once back at the farmhouse nancy asked curiously jo please tell us more about the cave that you spoke about yesterday im bursting to know all about it well the cave is on a piece of land along the river which gram rents out oh then i suppose itll be impossible for us to visit the cavern nancy commented i dont see why we cant its still our land joanne frowned a queer lot of people are rent ing it though how do you mean nancy questioned re calling joannes remark of the previous day theyre some sort of secta nature cult i think and part of a large organization at least thats what it said in the letter gram received from their leader anyway this group calls itself the black snake colony pleasant name bess observed cynically im not sure what they do joanne admitted weve never even spoken to any members i suppose they believe in living an outdoor life you can live that way without joining a na ture cult george said dryly i suppose they dance when the dew is on the grass and such non sense believe it or not they do dance joanne laughed but only nights when the moon is out ive seen them from here in the moonlight its an eerie sight they wear white robes and flit around waving their arms they even wear masks masks nancy exclaimed why i cant imagine it all sounds senseless but the rent money is helpful do they live in this cavern george asked in amazement no they live in shacks and tents near the river ive never really had the nerve to visit the place of course it you girls went along when can we go nancy asked excitedly ill speak to gram joanne offered its odd youve never spoken to any of the colony members nancy remarked thoughtfully who pays the rent its sent by mail they even leased the land that way didnt it strike you as a peculiar way of doing business nancy asked yes joanne admitted but i suppose its part of their creed or whatever you call it they probably dont believe in mingling with people outside the cult thats often the case directly after lunch the girls helped the byrds straighten and clean the rooms for the expected boarders they hung curtains newly made by mrs byrd and put fresh flowers in each room at the end of the afternoon they were very pleased with the result all you girls have worked hard enough mrs byrd said you go rest while i fix supper she was insistent so joanne led her friends to the porch bess stretched out in the hammock and picked up the days newspaper the others chatted suddenly bess gave an exclamation of surprise nancy she asked tensely what was the name of that girl who sold me the perfume wong nancy answered in amazement yvonne wong why because theres an article in the paper that mentions her name bess thrust the newspaper into nancys hands indicating the paragraph wow this is something read it yourself chapter viii hillside ghosts nancy read aloud the hale syndicate which has been en gaged in the illegal importation of oriental arti cles has been dissolved by court order nancy looked up and said i dont see what that has to do with our perfume friend yvonne wong a great deal bess declared read on and youll find out oh nancy exclaimed a few seconds later yvonne was employed by the syndicate as a clerk in their shop she hasnt been indicted because of insufficient evidence and the top men have skipped bess nodded realizing the impact of her im portant discovery that perfume store we visited must have been owned by the syndicate how long ago was the fraud discovered george asked the article doesnt say nancy returned it has just now been made public it doesnt surprise me that the wong girl was mixed up in some underhanded affair george remarked i didnt like her attitude from the beginning nor did i bess added and i liked her less after nancy found out she had received the job jo wanted im certainly glad i didnt get that job jo anne smiled id much rather be here do you suppose yvonne knew the work of the syndicate was dishonest bess asked with concern im sure of it george answered flatly but it looks as if she and the others slipped out quickly when the federal authorities became aware of the racket all this time nancy had been staring into space it had occurred to her that yvonne wong might still be employed by the syndicate un doubtedly the name and offices had been changed to throw off the federal authorities was room now the syndicates headquarters nancy immediately thought of the coded mes sage she had brought with her the third num ber in it was the letter h she told herself then she reflected on the recent newspaper arti cle about the syndicate this h might stand for hale she thought excitedly and the line over it might mean that someone by this name is importantthe ring leader perhaps i must talk to chief mcginnis again i may have stumbled onto a clue to those missing hale syndicate men after supper she phoned the chief and pro pounded her theory well nancy he said it sounds as if you might have picked up a clue sure enough send me a copy of that code and ill get busy on it after nancy completed the call she and the other girls studied the code once more gazing at the and the nancy suddenly said mmwhy that could stand for maurice maybe that mans name is maurice hale now ill sleep better bess sighed the girls went to bed happy and excited the next day everyones attention was focused on a new boarder shortly after church services mrs alice salisbury and her daughter nona ar rived in an expensive sedan mrs salisbury walked with a cane and complained loudly of her arthritis as the girls helped her into the house nona waited only long enough to see that her mother was made comfortable then she an nounced that she must hurry back to the city nearby where she lived mother was born on a farm she told mrs byrd as she stepped into the car and she simply pines for the country i thought this arrangement might be ideal since shes never entirely happy with me in the city ill drive down to see her week ends i do hope shell be happier here at red gate farm joanne and her friends hoped so too but they were not at all certain for it became increasingly apparent that mrs salisbury could not be happy anywhere she found no fault with the immacu late farmhouse or the lovely view from her bed room window but she constantly complained of her various aches and pains she talked inces santly about her many operations she had a sharp tongue and delighted in using it she wouldnt be so bad if only shed stop talking operations george burst out makes me feel as though im ready for the hospital myself by the time the girls had adjusted themselves to mrs salisbury the second boarder arrived he was karl abbott a diamondintherough type of man in spite of his sixtythree years he boasted that he was as spry as his son karl jr who had brought him karl jr who worked in a nearby city was a personable young man the girls particularly bess were sorry he could not remain with his father the girls liked mr abbott very much but they were appalled by his tremendous appetite i wish we could turn him out in the yard to forage for himself joanne sighed several days later as she peeled her second heaping pan of potatoes its all i can do to keep one helping ahead of him at first mr abbott insisted upon remaining in the kitchen teasing the girls as they worked and sampling the food then he fell into the habit of sitting on the front porch with mrs salisbury and chatting with her for hours frequently they became involved in violent arguments about trivial matters just for diversion after one of their disagreements mrs salisbury would maintain a stony silence which was refresh ing but mr abbott would once again take refuge in the kitchen in spite of such slight annoyances the days at red gate farm passed very pleasantly nancy would go into town on various errands for the boarders and sometimes mrs byrd one day she had just returned to the farm from a shopping trip and on her way to the house stopped at the mailbox there might be a letter from dad she thought and drew out a stack of mail she took it all into the house where mrs byrd asked nancy to distribute the letters as she was sorting them out she came to one addressed to the black snake colony look nancy exclaimed this letter be longs to the nature cult the mailman must have put it in our box by mistake what will you do asked bess seriously drive over with it of course not growled mr abbott who had just entered the room you keep away from those outrageous people take it back to the post office nancy studied the postmark it was very blurred could it be riverside heights or was she mistaken her curiosity about the mysterious cult was now even more aroused perhaps she could deliver the letter in person but she got no further in her plan for just then a neighbor passed on his way to town mrs byrd handed him the letter to remail nancy felt disappointed but was determined to find out in some way what was going on over the hill if i can only be alone with bess and george a little later maybe we can come up with some plan she thought there had been a letter from mr drew in forming nancy that he had returned home at least dads making progress on his case she said to herself then nancy hurried off to the barn where the city slickers as reuben called them were to have a milking lesson its no trick at all bess insisted give me that pail and ill show you just how its done reuben handed over the bucket and bess marched determinedly up to the cow nice bossy she murmured giving the ani mal a timid pat on the neck the cow responded with a suspicious look and flirt of her tail as bess set down the milking stool the cow kicked it over bess sprang back in alarm you cant expect me to milk a vicious cow she exclaimed joanne and reuben exploded with laughter primrose is an extremely smart cow reuben drawled she wont stand being milked except from the side shes used to reluctantly bess picked up the overturned stool and went around to the left side the cow leisurely moved herself sideways i give up here you try it george oh no bess i wouldnt spoil your fun for anything after a great deal of maneuvering bess suc ceeded in handling the whole procedure to the satisfaction of primrose nancy came last and she too was a bit awkward when reuben finally sat down to do the milking the girls watched him with admiration it just takes practice he said smiling that evening mrs salisbury and mr abbott had their usual disagreement and both retired early mrs byrd soon followed leaving the girls alone on the porch do you think there will be any activity on the hill tonight george asked suddenly im not sure joanne answered but its a good clear night and the moon is full so the setting is perfect for it im dying to see what those nature enthu siasts look like added bess just so they dont come too close it was a lovely evening and nancy had been only half listening to the chatter she remained silent and thoughtful the letter addressed to the black snake colony was still very much on her mind whats up nancy bess finally asked no ticing her friends silence three guesses nancy replied with a laugh im still curious about that envelope i had in my hands this afternoon im almost certain that blurred postmark read riverside heights even if it did george remarked it could have been written by almost anyone and simply mailed in riverside heights i suppose youre right nancy agreed i guess im trying too hard but lets walk over toward the hill the four girls started off they crossed one field in front of the house and were just climbing a rail fence to the next one when nancy cried out am i seeing things look over there on that hill following her gaze the girls were astonished to see shadowy white figures flitting about in the moonlight ghosts bess exclaimed ghosts nothing george retorted theres no such animal dont be alarmed joanne said with a smile i imagine the members of the nature cult are having one of their festive airings by the light of the moon the girls watched the cult members go through their mystic rites theyre not doing much of anything nancy observed except napping around within ten minutes the ceremony apparently was concluded the white figures clustered to gether for a moment then moved off across the hillside i wonder where theyre heading nancy mused back to their tents joanne had been watching intently now she shook her head i dont think so i forgot to tell youthe cave has another opening on the slope of the hill near the river the colony members are going in that direction immediately nancys curiosity was aroused did this mean the whiterobed group intended to go into the cave itself if so why to continue the ceremony it certainly was a short performance bess remarked as the mysterious dancers vanished from sight i wonder if the ritual has any sig nificance thats what id like to know nancy said quietly and thats what we must find out not tonight joanne said firmly grand mother will be very upset if we dont come right back reluctantly nancy gave up the idea the girls started for the farmhouse but nancy kept look ing back over her shoulder determined not to miss anything however the hillside remained uninhabited and still as the girls drew near the road the motor of a car broke the silence and headlights appeared the automobile slowed down in front of the farmhouse as if about to stop then suddenly the car went on why nancy wondered had the driver seen the girls and changed his mind chapter ix black snake colony member nancy was too far away from the car to see its driver or license plate thoughtfully she went to bed but lay awake for some time feeling com pletely baffled over the many mysterious happen ings by morning she felt eager for action ever since her arrival at red gate farm nancy had wanted to visit the cavern on the hillside the strange moonlight ceremony and the unidentified car which had hesitated in front of the house only intensified her interest in the place she broached the subject of a visit there to mrs byrd but joannes grandmother frowned on the idea ill worry if you go she said those folks are probably harmless but we dont know much about them i wish now i had never rented the land the neighbors are saying i was foolish to do it in the first place and so you were mrs salisbury who had overheard the conversation chimed in youll ruin the value of your farm why people around are saying dreadful things about the members of that cult even reuben is afraid to go near the place im not nancy announced i think it would be fun to investigate mrs salisbury snorted fun girls these days have strange ideas of fun first thing you know mrs byrd shell be wanting to join the colony nonsense mrs byrd smiled in order to avoid further dissension nancy dropped the subject of the cave but that after noon she set out alone on a hike making her way to the woods which skirted the river nancy struck a wellworn path and decided to continue along it she had walked only a short way when the sound of a faint cry came to her nancy halted in the path and listened intently the cry was not repeated maybe i imagined it she said to herself nevertheless nancy quickened her pace look ing about her as she walked as she rounded a bend a few minutes later she was startled to see a woman hunched over on the ground writhing in pain whats the matter nancy cried out hurry ing over to her then the girls eyes widened this was the woman she had seen running across a field the night of the storm i tripped on a root in the path the woman murmured rocking back and forth in pain my ankleits broken nancy dropped to one knee and quickly exam ined the injured ankle it was swelling rapidly but all the bones seemed to be in place see if you can stand she advised with nancys help the woman managed to get to her feet but winced as she tried to take her first step it isnt broken nancy said gently but you have a bad sprain oh whatll i do now the woman moaned do you live far from here nancy asked the stranger looked at her rather queerly and did not answer at once nancy thought she had not understood so repeated the question about a quarter of a mile up the river was the mumbled response ill get there all right youre scarcely able to walk a step nancy said with a troubled frown please let me run back to the farm and bring help no no the woman protested clutching nancy fearfully by the arm i dont want to be a bother to anyone nonsense you shouldnt be walking at all it wont take me a minute to get someone to help you the woman shook her head stubbornly my foot feels better now i can walk by myself she started off but nearly collapsed by the time she had taken three steps if you wont let me go for help then at least let me take you home again the woman protested but nancy took hold of her arm and placed it over her own shoulder with nancys support the woman made slow and painful progress up the path this is killing you nancy said dismayed that the woman was so foolishly stubborn i can get our hired man to carry you no the woman objected vehemently her unwillingness to accept help puzzled nancy as they made their way slowly along she became aware that her companions distress was not entirely due to pain but partially to nancys own presence this mystified nancy but she could not turn back as long as she knew the woman really needed her i dont remember seeing any houses along the river nancy said after a time youre not a member of the nature cult are you a halfcynical expression crossed the womans face then one of sadness yes she returned quietly im one of the members nancy took time to scrutinize her companion more carefully than before she wore a blue gingham dress which was plain and durable and certainly did not appear to be a costume the woman did not speak or act as nancy imagined a member of the cult would she seemed like any other person it must be healthful to live an outdoor life nancy remarked feeling that some comment was necessary ive often looked over at your tents and thought i should like to visit the colony some time the woman stopped abruptly in the path and faced nancy an odd look on her face you must never come near why not it wouldnt be safe not safe nancy echoed in astonishment i dont understand ii mean the members of the cult dont want folks prying around the woman said hastily i see the rites are secret thats it the woman said in obvious relief but why couldnt i visit the colony sometime when ceremonies arent being held nancy persisted you mustnt come near the hillsideever the stranger warned the two continued up the path to nancy it was apparent that her questions had disturbed the woman for several times she caught her looking distressed and worried as they approached the hillside colony and before they were within sight of the tents the woman stopped short thank you for your help she said quietly i can make it alone from here nancy hesitated the womans firm tone told her it would do no good to protest she was not going to let nancy come any nearer the camp i at least let me find something that you can use as a cane nancy said she searched along the path and found a branch that was strong enough the woman ac cepted it gratefully her face softened and she stood for an instant looking intently at nancy youre a good girl to help a stranger like me i wish the woman turned away abruptly remember she advised sternly over her shoulder dont ever come near the camp still perplexed nancy watched the woman hobble away it took her a long time to reach the top of the hill but at last she disappeared from sight i cant understand why the poor thing acted the way she did nancy said to herself as she sat down on a log to think what harm could it have done if id gone with her to the colony the cult must have some very important secrets the more nancy considered the matter the more baffled she became the woman didnt look as though being a member of the black snake colony made her very happy nancy thought if theyre so afraid that someone will discover their secrets they must be doing more than just flitting at night in white robes maybe thats only to keep people from guessing what really goes on there as nancy reached this startling conclusion she jumped up and walked briskly toward red gate farm theres one thing certain she said to her self with a chuckle now that the woman has forbidden me to go near the camp i cant resist finding out whats happening there nancy was just approaching the farmhouse when she heard the phone ringing she hurried inside and answered it yes this is nancy drew she replied to a strange mans question one moment while nancy waited she wondered who the caller might be was someone going to threaten her to desist in her detective work oh she said as the next speaker announced himself as chief mcginnis a sense of relief came over the girl i have some news nancy the officer said its discouraging nothing on the code or the missing men then he chuckled we need an other clue from you nancy realized her old friend was teasing glad to help she said gaily whats the as signment to find out where the hale syndicate moved to after it left room then that was their headquarters nancy cried excitedly temporarily but they left no forwarding ad dress the police chief said if we could decipher the rest of the code we might be able to trace them nancy said any how ill be on the lookout for any clues at least it shouldnt be too hard to find yvonne wong chief mcginnis agreed and assured nancy he would let her know if there were any new devel opments then he asked and what are you doing any mysteries up your way there might be she told him the little she had been able to glean about the mysterious na ture cult she described the unusual moonlight ceremony the girls had witnessed and the ap pearance of the unidentified car the police chief whistled in amazement sounds as though you do have another mystery up your sleeve have you come across any pos sible clues to what the cult is worshiping nancy the girl detective hesitated a moment before telling chief mcginnis about her curious con versation with the woman she had assisted in the woods she decided to mention it and added that although the woman had readily admitted to being a member of the cult she had given nancy no reason for her firm warning to stay away from the meeting place black snake colony eh the police chief said reflectively yes nancy replied have you ever heard of it no but let me look in a report we have here on all cults ill call you right back nancy waited eagerly for the phone to ring when it did she snatched up the receiver the black snake colony is not listed chief mc ginnis told her you mean its a phony nancy asked ex citedly chapter x plan of attack chief mcginnis refused to comment on the pos sibility that the black snake colony might be a phony group they may not have been in existence long enough to be known he replied but you might try to find out what you can and let me know ill do that the young detective agreed after nancy had put down the phone she re flected for a long minute on the new twist to the hillside mystery then walked out to the front porch where mrs salisbury mr abbott and the three girls were seated nancy had not planned to tell them of her ex perience but her face was so animated it revealed her thoughts they besieged her with questions until finally she revealed her meeting with the woman member of the strange nature cult told you not to come near did she mrs salisbury cackled well i hope you intend to follow her advice nancy laughed and shook her head im more interested than ever in whats going on up there on the hillside im ready for a little adventure right about now so am i george chimed in joanne nodded vigorously while bess always more cautious agreed rather halfheartedly better stay away mr abbott advised for once not contradicting mrs salisbury you cant tell what may be going on there nancy was tempted to comment but instead she forced a smile and said it seems to me that this matter may be of deep concern to jo and her grandmother if not to me mrs byrd had stepped to the porch door in time to get the gist of the conversation and at once spoke up i think nancy is right she declared thought fully of course i dont want the girls to go looking for trouble but im beginning to think someone ought to investigate those mysterious people if anything questionable is going on i want to know about it ill ask the black snake colony to move out even if i do lose the rent why i might get into trouble myself if they stay mr abbott and mrs salisbury fell into an injured silence nancy gave her friends a sly wink and in a few minutes they all quietly with drew to the springhouse to discuss their plans here she told the girls about her conversation with chief mcginnis something peculiar is going on at those cult meetings im sure nancy went on and i must find out about them if i can do you all want to join me in the investigation of course joanne and george said do you think itll be safe bess asked im not making any rash promises nancy laughed bess gave a little shiver i dont like it but count me in how can we visit the colony without being caught george asked thats the problem nancy replied we must make our plans carefully before we do any thing i suggest we find out about the robes the cult members wear we may need to wear similar ones to help us in our investigation theres only one way to find that out joanne said some night when theyre having a cere monial meeting we can sneak through the woods and try to get a closer look at whats going on nancy nodded excitedly the double en trance to the cave will be perfect she said if we cant sneak into the meetings any other way we can get into the cave at the end they dont use sounds terribly risky to me bess com mented oh for petes sake george said scornfully dont be such a wet blanket bess her cousin opened her mouth to retort but nancy interposed quickly to forestall any further argument wed better not tell our plan to anyone ex cept your grandmother jo she advised other wise mrs salisbury and mr abbott will try to talk her out of letting us investigate after a light supper and some rather forced conversation on trivial matters the girls retired they had tried to keep silent about the activities of the nature cult but their secretive manner did not escape the notice of mrs salisbury and mr abbott youre up to something mrs salisbury re marked the next morning and if i were mrs byrd id put a stop to it at once mrs byrd however went on serenely with her work being careful not to interfere with the girls plans they maintained a close watch of the hillside but for two days seldom saw anyone in the vicinity i think theyve holed in for the rest of the summer george declared impatiently at break fast either that or theyve moved out the cults still there joanne reassured her the rent check arrived in the morning mail by the way where do these nature people get their food nancy queried they cant live on blue sky and inspiration i think friends must bring food to them in automobiles joanne answered several times ive seen swanky cars drive up and park near the hillside the cult members must be fairly well off then nancy said thoughtfully im getting tired of marking time i wish something would happen soon if it doesnt i think ill investigate that cave anywayl that night the girls were late in finishing the dishes by the time they had put everything away it was quite dark when they went out to the porch they were relieved to find that the boarders had gone to their rooms the girls sat talking quietly for some time the moon was high and nancy from force of habit glanced eagerly toward the distant hill look girls she exclaimed theyre at it again the four girls could see white objects moving to and fro apparently going through a weird ritual nancy sprang to her feet well have to hurry if we want to see any thing she said come on well take the short cut they dashed across the lawn flung open the gate and ran through the woods nancy led the way up the river path then to the sparsely wooded hillside not until they were dose to the camp did she stop well have to be very careful she warned in a whisper scatter and hide behind trees and dont make a sound the girls obeyed bess staying as close to george as possible nancy found a huge oak tree well up the hill and hid behind it from this vantage point she could see fairly well nancy had been there for less than five minutes when she heard the sound of several cars ap proaching they came up the woods road and stopped at the foot of the hill not far from the nature camp several men stepped from the cars nancy was too far away to see their faces but she did observe that they quickly donned long white robes with head masks and joined the other costumed figures who were on the brow of the hill for nearly ten minutes the members of the cult flitted back and forth waving their arms and making weird noises then they moved single file toward the cavern and vanished suddenly nancy felt herself grasped by an arm she wheeled sharply and then laughed softly george for goodness sake dont ever do that again you scared me silly what do you make of it nancy its the strangest thing ive ever seen i havent been able to figure it out what should we do next asked bess who had joined them lets follow them into the cave george pro posed rashly and be caught nancy returned no this is serious business i think its time to go home and plan our own costumes i wonder why so many people came here in automobiles joanne mused as the girls walked off slowly thats what ive been wondering nancy replied soberly but i think i might know why her friends demanded it looks to me as if only a few persons are actually living in the black snake colony ap parently they want to give the impression that the organization is a large one so they have these other people come the night set for the cere monials there were certainly a lot of men in those cars added bess why should they go to all that trouble jo anne asked doubtfully i dont know nancy admitted unless its because theyre trying to hide something theyre doing here she changed the subject i think well be able to make costumes like theirs if youll give us some old pillowcases and sheets jo when we visit the cave we must disguise ourselves to make our scheme work chapter xi a midnight message when shall we visit the cave george asked as soon as we can nancy answered of course we must help jo and her grandmother with the work since there was no further evidence of activity on the hillside the girls went to bed the next morning george remarked as she helped nancy make her bed what do you sup pose those men do between ceremonials it cer tainly is strange how much time they spend in that cave what puzzles me is those automobiles that were on the hillside bess said why did they come surely those men were here for something besides ballet dancing whats your guess nancy im afraid i havent any answer but i mean to find one for mrs byrds and jos sakes the three girls learned that reuben was due to be absent most of the day and offered to do his chores during the morning they picked cherries and took them to town to sell at a local market when they returned a small strange car was standing in the driveway loud voices were coming from the living room i dont have to sell and i wont sell mrs byrd said with finality in her tone thats what you think a man said sneer ingly youre going to lose this farm and i can buy it cheaper from the bank why dont you sell it to me and make a little profit then you can go to the city and take life easy we dont want to go to the city joanne spoke up were getting along all right here more boarders are coming soon and we are paying off our back mortgage interest so we dont have to sell outside nancy bess and george looked at one another the insistent buyer again fer vently they hoped that mrs byrd would not weaken in her decision a moment later they felt relieved i will say good afternoon mr kent mrs byrd said thank you for your offer but i can not accept it youll be sorry youll regret this the caller stormed he came out the screen door slamming it viciously behind him nancy stared in surprise mr kent certainly was one of the most illmannered men she had ever seen and also she thought wryly one of the most tenacious why was he so determined to buy the byrd home mr kent his face red with anger stepped into his car and sped off but not before he gave nancy and her friends a baleful look nice disposition george commented sarcastically i hope he never shows up again bess said firmly the girls found mrs byrd and joanne quite shaken i cant understand that mans persist ence the woman said nancy was sure the matter was tied in with the cult on the hillside but did not mention this theory she merely said try not to worry about mr kent i doubt that hell return soon the incident was forgotten as preparations for supper were started and the farm animals were fed george elected to take care of gathering eggs from the henhouse bess gave the horse hay and water ill get the cow nancy offered and went off toward the pasture to drive primrose in but the cow was not there nancy walked around the fence surrounding the field to see if there was any opening through which the animal might have wandered finally she found one and saw hoofprints leading toward a patch of woods nancy dashed off among the trees she had never been that way before but there was only one path to follow several times she paused to listen and thought she heard the faint tinkling of a cowbell somewhere ahead of her it was rapidly growing dusky in the woods and nancy hurried on again she stopped to listen she could hear the cowbell distinctly now primrose cant be far ahead she thought in relief and went in that direction nancy finally caught sight of the jersey contentedly munching grass on the hillside beyond nancy stopped short and gave a gasp of as tonishmentthe sound of the cowbell had brought her to the mouth of the cave i can hardly believe it she almost exclaimed aloud this must be the other opening near the nature camp jo told me about eagerly nancy rushed toward the cave but no sooner had she peered into the dark entrance than she was startled by the crackling of a twig behind her nancy wheeled to find a man stand ing not three feet away from her he seemed to have risen from the bushes which half hid the opening of the cave instantly it flashed through nancys mind that he had been stationed there to see that intruders did not enter whatre you doing here he asked his voice as cold as steel nancy recoiled the man stood in the shadows of the shrubbery so that she could not see his face distinctly but at the sound of his voice she knew instantly she was in danger i must persuade him i wasnt spying she thought desperately better speak up the man snarled whatre you doin here girlie i was hunting for that cow nancy replied as casually as possible she pointed to the jersey which was grazing a short distance away she held her ground defiantly there was a moments silence nancy could feel that the man was staring at her as if undecided whether or not to believe her so you were after the cow the lookout growled then why are you by this cave why i was just wondering what was inside nancy said innocently surely theres no harm in looking youve no business around here the man snapped this property belongs to the members of the black snake colony oh nancy exclaimed in pretended awe then you must belong to the colony how very interesting the man made no response to nancys remark instead he muttered round up that old cow of yours and get out of here and dont come trespassing again nancy knew she would gain nothing by argu ing obediently she overtook the cow and headed her back toward red gate the man watched until nancy disappeared into the woods as soon as she had started the cow down the path however nancy quietly retraced her steps she reached the edge of the woods just in time to catch a glimpse of the man entering the cave that proves hes one of the black snake group she told herself he was acting as a guard for them for an instant nancy was tempted to follow but common sense told her not to press her luck the lookout seemed determined enough to make trouble for her if she took the chance reluc tantly the young sleuth turned back toward the farm it was clear to nancy that the entire business of the black snake group was anything but open and aboveboard obviously they were afraid that some of the countryfolk would attempt to investi gate when nancy finally reached the barn and jo anne began to milk primrose the other girls plied their friend with questions we were beginning to worry joanne said in relief i wouldnt have let you go alone if id known this cow of ours would stray so tar im glad i went nancy said quickly she then told the others what had taken place near the mouth of the cave they gasped in as tonishment upon hearing of her encounter with the lookout werent you frightened when he sprang up out of nowhere bess asked giving nancy an admiring glance id have fainted on the spot thats an easy way out if i ever heard one nancy commented with a laugh girls dont faint these days george scoffed probably youd have screamed and brought all the members down on you theyd have dragged you off and put an end to you thanks george bess muttered you say the nicest things well girls talk all you like nancy added but dont lose your nerve altogether i still want to get a closer look at that cave not tonight bess said firmly nancy smiled i hope there wont be a ritual on the hillside tonight weve been too busy to get our costumes ready the girls watched but the distant landscape remained dark finally they went to bed not long afterward nancy was roused from a fitful slumber by the stopping of a car not far from her window she hopped from bed and went to peer out a tall slender woman who wore her hair piled high was walking to the front door nancy leaned out the window and called what is it you wish nancy drew is she here yes im nancy i have a letter for you nancy did not recog nize the womans voice but she might be dis guising it from whom your father why are you bringing it now its an urgent message the strange woman said ill leave it on the doorstep she dropped the letter hurried into the car and the man at the wheel drove off heart pound ing nancy put on her robe and slippers and hurried down to the front door chapter xii secret service agents the stopping of the car at the house had awakened mrs byrd who slept on the first floor she met nancy in the hall and asked what was happening quickly nancy told her then opened the door on the porch lay a plain envelope with nancys name typed on it this seems like a peculiar way for your father to get in touch with you mrs byrd remarked why didnt he phone if its urgent i dont understand it myself nancy an swered as she tore open the letter the message was typewritten and was succinct nancy was to return home at once her father needed her she was not to try to communicate with him he could not explain why it was signed dad nancy read the letter to mrs byrd oh i couldnt let you start out at this time of night alone the woman said at once you must wait until morning this whole thing doesnt seem like dad nancy reflected he wouldnt send a terse note like this even if he were in some kind of trouble mrs byrd was very much concerned it seems to me he would have called you on the phone in an emergency she offered thoughtfully yes nancy agreed thats why this puzzles me so but dont you worry about it mrs byrd this is something ill have to try to figure out myself but my dear mrs byrd repeated its im possible for you to do anything about it at this hour nancy carefully studied the note again sud denly she became aware of a familiar scent of perfume the young detective held the envelope to her nostrils it had been handled by someone who used the distinctive blue jade scent which bess had purchased instantly nancy was alerted it wouldnt sur prise me mrs byrd if this letter is a phony im going to call dad even though its an unearthly hour to waken him she picked up the receiver in the hall no sound reached her ears im afraid the line is dead she told mrs byrd does this happen often it has never happened before mrs byrd said i made a call after supper and everything was all right then nancy stood in perplexed silence had her fa ther tried to get her found the line out of order then given the note to the couple the woman might have carried the letter in a handbag which contained a pursesize bottle of the oriental per fume in that case i ought to start for river heights nancy thought but a feeling of suspi cion about the whole thing overpowered her it might be a trap the telephone line could have been cut one or more persons might try to cap ture her on the road but why nancy asked herself repeatedly she came to the conclusion that the hale syndi cate was back of the incident they must have found out she had reported her suspicions to the police and somehow had learned where she was staying she turned to mrs byrd and said ill wait un til seven oclock then try the phone again if it still isnt working ill go to town and call dad thank you dear mrs byrd patted nancy on the shoulder but dont go anywhere alone take bess and george with you i will promptly at seven oclock nancy tried to get in touch with her father but the phone still was not working joanne was already up but nancy roused bess and george the three girls were astounded to learn about the note well get breakfast in town nancy told mrs byrd as she prepared to drive off with her friends and if i dont have to go to river heights i can do your shopping too suppose you give me the list halfway to town george said suddenly nancy isnt your gasoline tank nearly empty nancy nodded im glad you reminded me watch for a station and well stop presently bess sighted one on the main road its the same place we stopped to eat on our way to the farm she said so it is george remarked i can phone from here nancy decided she turned in at the gravel driveway but as two other cars were ahead of her she drew up some distance from the pump how about getting breakfast here after you phone bess suggested the girls agreed bess and george entered the lunchroom while nancy went to an outdoor phone booth she had her father on the wire in a few moments dad did you send me a note last night why no quickly his daughter explained her question the lawyer said grimly its plain to see someone wants to harm you in one way or another please be very careful nancy promised and said anyway im glad youre all right after nancy hung up she dialed the phone company to report that the byrd line was out of order a few minutes later she joined bess and george at a table and whispered the result of her conversation with mr drew oh nancy this means youre in danger bess said worriedly i thought at least id be safe at red gate farm nancy said i wonder george muttered the girls were the only customers in the res taurant no one came to wait on them from an inner room evidently used as an office they could hear excited voices somethings wrong nancy said to her com panions just then two men came out of the office in company with the gasolinestation attendant and the woman who served as waitress of the restau rant the woman was talking excitedly we found the twentydollar bill in the cash register at the end of the day it looked like any other money and we didnt suspect anything was wrong until john took the days receipts to the bank and of all things they said the bill was counterfeit and theyd have to turn it over to the secret service yes one of the agents spoke up weve just come from the bank and its a counterfeit all right theres been a lot of this bad money passed lately the forgery is very clever what am i going to do the woman cried we were cheated out of twenty dollars it isnt fair to hardworking people like john and me arent you secret service agents going to do some thing about it were doing all we can one of the men re plied we dont have much to go on it was a girl who gave me the bill the woman explained there were several of them in the party id recognize oh she shrieked theres the very girl she pointed an accusing finger at nancy drew nancy and her friends stared in astonishment they could not believe what they had just heard arrest that girll the woman screamed dont let any of them get awaytheyre all in on it together just a minute one of the agents said sup pose you explain he suggested to nancy the excited woman however was not to be calmed she rushed toward nancy and shook her fist at the girl dont deny you gave me that phony bill she almost screamed i neither deny nor affirm it nancy said turning to the agents i did give the woman a twentydollar bill but how do you know it was the counterfeit it was the only twenty we took in that day the waitress retorted nancys thoughts raced ill take your word for it she said quietly opening her purse she took out another twentydollar bill the woman snatched the money and handed it to one of the secret service men is this good she asked crisply the agent examined the bill then he looked at nancy where did you get this from my father he gave me both bills as a matter of fact one was for car emergencies instead of giving the bill to the woman the man put it into his pocket this is serious busi ness young lady the bill you just gave me is also counterfeit nancy was thunderstruck bess and george gasped before any of them could speak the lunchroom woman cried out shes one of the gang arrest her for the first time the station attendant spoke up take it easy liz these girls dont exactly look like counterfeiters liz sniffed people dont usually go around paying for sundaes with twentydollar bills she said tartly my father gave me the money because i was going on a vacation a likely story the woman sneered its the truth george spoke up indignantly the idea of accusing my friend of passing bad money on purpose its ridiculous ridiculous is it the woman retorted an grily youll sing a different tune when youre in jail you cant have nancy arrested she didnt re alize it was counterfeit money bess protested george and i have some cash well pay you twenty good dollars to make up for the bad one as the cousins pooled their funds and handed over the money the woman quieted down maybe i was a little hasty she admitted but she was not entirely cowed how about your fa ther she asked nancy how come he had counterfeit bills nancy said she did not know hut certainly he had not acquired them dishonestly one of the secret service men said suppose you tell us who you are and ill tell you who she is came an authorita tive voice from the doorway chapter xiii a hesitant hitchhiker unobserved by the girls an automobile had driven up and parked near the filling station a tall young man had alighted and started for the lunchroom upon hearing the amazing con versation inside he had halted then realizing nancy was in need of help he had stepped inside karll nancy cried out she had never before been so glad to see anyone it looks as if i just got here in the nick of time karl abbott jr smiled theyre trying to arrest us bess exclaimed youre kidding karl cried in astonishment its no joke nancy returned earnestly then told him of her predicament look here karl said bluntly turning to the two secret service agents you cant hold these girls who are you one of the agents demanded my name is karl abbott and these girls are friends of mine as it happens my father is living at red gate farm in round valley where they also are staying i was on my way there when i thought id stop for a bite to eat lucky i did tool these girls may be friends of yours the un pleasant woman spoke up shrilly but this girl had better explain why she gave me counterfeit money if youre accusing these girls of deliberately trying to pass counterfeit money youre crazy karl abbott cried out youre willing to vouch for the honesty of this young ladys father as well the agent asked most definitely this is nancy drew no doubt youve heard of her father the famous lawyer if you havent you soon will not carson drew of river heights yes karl replied why didnt you tell us who you were the restaurant owner asked you didnt give me a chance to tell you any thing nancy retorted and you didnt seem ready to believe what i did have to say the two agents looked at each other one asked to see nancys drivers license then with a smile he said too bad you have such a loss because of the counterfeit money the outfit which is distributing the twentydollar bills is a clever one the money is turning up in many places ill get in touch with your father to find out where he was given the bills incidentally we under stand a few women are mixed up in the racket thats why we detained you lets get out of here george urged the girls hurriedly left the lunchroom with karl the government agents leisurely followed them outside as nancy was about to step into her car she thought of something it occurred to her that by some remote chance the investigators might be interested in the phony message which she had brought with her this may or may not have anything to do with the case she told them handing over the scented note but the signature is a forgery and the perfume has some mystery to it she gave a brief account of her own involve ment with the mystery beginning with her en counter on the train with the man who had men tioned the chief and ending with the code if the rest of the code can be deciphered nancy concluded that might give us the answer to everything including the hale syndicates whereabouts so youre the young detective chief mcgin nis mentioned in his reports to us one of the agents said admiringly what youve done so far is really astounding chief mcginnis didnt men tion you by name he probably figured you would prefer him not to your deductions seem very sound miss drew and id advise you to be careful that hale gang may think you know too much already ill take this note and pass it along to a handwriting expert perhaps yvonne wong was the person who delivered it nancy shook her head from what i could see of the woman i know she wasnt yvonne after the agent had wished nancy luck on the solution of the mystery she said goodby to the men and with the others went back to her car although karl abbott was eager to continue on to red gate farm to see his father he ex pressed concern about the three girls and their upsetting experience he asked for a detailed ac count of the events which had led to nancys pre dicament he was most interested and sympa thetic when the girls told him the whole story well he said admiringly i guess i wont worry too much about you girls you certainly arent easily daunted by emergencies after karl jr and the trio had exchanged good bys the young man got into his car and drove on to the farm bess turned to her companions where to im more starved than ever its only a short way to town from here nancy replied we can get breakfast there and then do our shopping soon the girls reached round valley when they finished eating nancy looked at mrs byrds list theres really not much on it she com mented two of us could do the shopping sup pose you girls take over and ill go buy the material for our costumes material bess queried nancy laughed if were going to join the black snake group in one of their rites well need ghost costumes and ive decided it wouldnt be fair to mrs byrd to ruin four of her sheets and pillowcases suddenly george said what are we going to use for money nancy had only two dollars bess and george between them counted six that will pay for the meat and groceries bess said i guess our costume material and the other errands will have to wait the food shopping was soon finished and the girls returned to red gate farm joanne met them at the kitchen door guess what she burst out the telephone repairman was here he said our line had been cut nancy nodded by those people who were here last night i suppose so oh nancy im so worried for you and karl jr tells us youve had another ad venture this morning he said youd explain nancy with lively interruptions from bess and george related the girls recent experience i gave those secret service men the note and told them the hale syndicate might be mixed up in some way with the counterfeiters the syndi cate may be the distributors of the phony bills well do let the authorities take care of it joanne urged i want you girls to have a good time while youre here oh im having a wonderful time nancy as sured her by the way i think we should work on our costumes for the hillside ceremony could you repay us the money we spent today so i can buy more material we decided it isnt fair to use your grandmothers good linens oh yes right away ill get it from gram and i think there are a few more groceries she needs joanne returned in a few minutes and handed over the money to which she added enough for the marketing nancy headed for town she had gone about a mile when she sighted a woman hurrying along the side of the country road she was limping slightly ill offer her a ride nancy decided she seems to be in a great hurry she halted the car and called may i give you a lift to town the woman glanced up startled nancy was surprised to see that she was the woman from the black snake colony whom she had helped several days before on the river trail what she was do ing so far from her camp nancy did not know but she was determined to make the most of the opportunity at hand please get in nancy urged as the woman hesitated im sure your foot must be paining you i notice that you are still limping thanks the woman returned gratefully hobbling over to the car door which nancy held open for her i am in a hurry to get to town before stepping inside she looked quickly over her shoulder as though fearing that someone might observe her actions she sighed in relief and settled back looking very pale and exhausted you werent intending to walk all the way to town nancy asked in a friendly conversational tone the woman nodded i had to get there some how but arent the members of your colony per mitted to use any of the cars ive seen around the camp nancy questioned watching her compan ion closely and hoping that she might tactfully glean some information we arent allowed much freedom the woman answered you shouldnt be walking on that foot yet nancy protested youre apt to injure your ankle permanently its nearly well now the woman told her avoiding nancys eyes they didnt know at the camp that i was going to town ii left in a hurry again the stranger cast an anxious glance over her shoulder she obviously thinks shes being followed nancy thought to herself perhaps shes even running away nancy wanted to ask her companion a number of questions but the womans aloofness discour aged her deciding on an entirely different course the young sleuth pretended not to pay particular attention to the woman for some time they drove along in silence nancy could see that her passenger was gradually relaxing and losing her fear am i going too fast for you nancy inquired thinking the time was right to launch the conver sation oh no the woman returned quickly you cant go too fast for me she hesitated and then added i have an important letter to mail why dont you drop it in one of the roadside mailboxes nancy suggested casually the ru ral carrier will pick it up and save you a long trip i want to get it off this morning if i possibly can ill be glad to go to the post office and mail it for you nancy said purposely drawing the woman out thank you but no the woman mumbled i id feel better if i did it myself as nancy did not reply she said i dont mean to be un grateful for all youve donereally i dont its only that i mustnt get you into trouble how could i get into trouble by helping you nancy asked with a smile you dont understand her companion re plied nervously there are things i cant ex plain the leaders of the colony will be very angry with me if they find i have left even for a few hours and especially that ive mailed this let ter to my sister the cult forbids communication with the outside world i cant understand why you tolerate such rigid supervision nancy said impatiently why the leader of the cult must treat you as pris oners youre not far from wrong the woman con fessed then why dont you run away the question startled the woman she glanced sharply at nancy then as quickly looked away i would if i dared she said finally why dont you dare nancy challenged ill help you no you mustnt get mixed up in this per haps later i can get away i dont see what anyone can do to you if you decide to leave the colony nancy went on surely youre a free person not any more her companion returned sadly im in it too deep now ill have to go on until fate helps me i wouldnt wait nancy advised bluntly let me help youright now chapter xiv disturbing gossip the strange woman in nancys car seemed to waver for a moment as if about to accept the girls offer of help then she shook her head no i wont drag you into it she said with finality you dont know what youd be getting into if you helped me why if they even learn that youve aided me in mailing this letter nancy saw the woman shudder for one fleet ing instant she too felt afraidafraid of some thing she could not define the young sleuth realized that the woman was trying to warn her of danger nancy knew the wise thing to do was forget all about the nature cult and the strange things which apparently went on in the hillside cave yet she felt that she was on the verge of discovering an important secret nancys companion was obviously relieved when the car rounded a bend and brought them within sight of town if youll just drop me off at the post office ill be most grateful the woman said may i take you back with me nancy asked ill be returning in less than an hour no ill walk back nancy saw that it was useless to protest and let the matter rest she made no comment after leaving her passenger in front of the post office nancy continued down the main street to the supermarket later while she waited in the checkout line to pay for her groceries two women took their places behind her they were talking earnestly together and did not pay any attention to nancy she in turn did not notice them until one of the shoppers began to speak on a startling subject it beats me the way those people carry on she heard one of them say youd think mrs byrd would turn them out instantly nancy became alert i suppose she needs the money the other woman responded but someone should speak to her about it the idea of those folks capering around in bedclothes they must be crazy thats just what i think the first woman re marked if i lived near that farm i wouldnt feel safe and i dont think its decent for a law abiding community like ours to have folks like that around im going to get a big group together and call on mrs byrd to tell her what we think of her ill certainly join you the woman said nancy felt the situation was becoming serious that the criticism of mrs byrd would grow even sharper it the two women carried out their threat the consequences might be very unpleas ant prospective red gate boarders might change their minds the colony might take reprisals one thing is certain nancy decided our costumes must be ready by tonight in case the colony members have a meeting she paid for the groceries and went directly to the material shop where she bought several yards of white muslin then started for home driving back to red gate farm nancy kept a sharp lookout for the woman from the black snake colony but she was nowhere along the road i wish i could have talked to her more it might have helped in my plan to attend the ceremony joanne bess and george were just returning from the woods with pails brimming over with lusciouslooking berries when nancy drove into the barnyard as they started to help her carry in the packages karl abbott jr rushed gallantly from the house to assist he glanced curiously at the soft fat one which nancy kept tucked under her arm but she did not give any explanation of its contents besides the elder mr abbott and mrs salisbury were within hearing distance immediately after a late lunch and some pleas ant conversation with the guests nancy excused herself and summoned the other girls to her room there she unwrapped the material and brought out scissors needles and thread we must work like mad she said in case theres a meeting tonight with great excitement and anticipation she cut out the first costume which was to serve as an en tering wedge to the naturecult ceremonial as nancy worked she told the story of her adven ture with her passenger and the conversation of the women in the market joanne was alarmed oh gram must never hear of this she exclaimed shed be heart broken the others agreed we wont tell mrs byrd any more than we have to george said i do hope we can solve the mystery before something ugly happens for the next few hours their needles flew furi ously at last the costumes were finished the four friends could not control their laughter as they tried them on you certainly look as if youre ready for hal loween george told nancy do you think ill pass in the moonlight they wont be able to tell you from a fullfledged member of the cult bess declared lets see you go through the mystic rites to the delight of her chums nancy danced around the room waving her arms wildly and making weird moans jo a voice called dinners ready startled the girls scrambled out of the white robes and hastily hid them they tried to com pose their faces as they hurried downstairs but merely succeeded in looking guilty seems to me you girls spent a long time locked up in your rooms mrs salisbury sniffed suspiciously planning some kind of mischief no doubt mr abbott wagged his finger playfully at the four girls george had a hard time keeping a straight face and hastily took a sip of milk bess could not re strain a giggle whereupon mrs salisbury gave her a sharp look humph she exclaimed i must say ill have to agree with mr abbott this time im sure you four are up to some prank even nancy and joanne had to smother tell tale grins they only smiled pleasantly but of fered no explanation actually the girls were so excited over their prospective adventure they could scarcely do jus tice to the excellent meal mrs byrd had pre pared karl jr as usual was a charming com panion he had many amusing anecdotes to tell and nancy was happy to observe that joanne seemed to be enjoying it all immensely indeed by the time dessert was finished nancy and her chums realized that they had temporarily forgotten counterfeiters syndicates and even the nature cult on the hill everyone was sorry a little later when the young man announced that he must leave i wish i could stay he said regretfully let ting his eyes rest especially long on nancy but i must get back to the city tonight ill try to run down again in a few days to see father take care of yourselves he added to the girls after karl jr had gone and the girls were washing the dishes george said teasingly you cant tell me father is the only attraction at red gate farm he has his eye on nancy silly nancy laughed he scarcely took his eyes off you all evening george insisted you made quite a hit this morning with that rescuedheroine bit oh honestly georgel nancy blushed you never give up do you karl jr wouldnt be so bad bess added but imagine having mr abbott for a fatherin law you do the imagining nancy said lightly im going outside and look at the hillside all the girls watched until late in the evening but the mysterious place remained dark and de serted disappointed the girls went to bed they awakened early the next morning for they had gradually become accustomed to farm hours when they learned from mrs byrd that reuben was not feeling well the girls eagerly helped with the various outdoor chores it was noontime before they realized how much time had passed you girls should have some relaxation this afternoon mrs byrd said how about a swim down in the brook theres a spot that used to be known as the old swimming hole its fairly deep that sounds wonderful bess declared jo declined but at two oclock nancy bess and george set off in bathing suits for two hours they swam floated and sunbathed on the shore every once in a while nancy or george would mention some angle of the colony hale syndi cate or counterfeiting mysteries but immediately bess would say shush were relaxing we may have a big night to night finally the girls started for the farmhouse to reach it they had to cross a field in the corner of which lay a heap of large stones apparently raked there when the acreage was cultivated george grinning climbed across the stones saying this life is making me rugged i oh ouch she cried loudly then added a snake it bit me chapter xv masqueraders nancy and george turned just in time to see a brownish snake slither off in a wiggling motion and disappear among the stones oh george bess cried was it a poisonous one im not sure she answered ii hope it wasnt a copperhead wed better not take any chances nancy de dared whipping a handkerchief from her beach robe lets put on tourniquets bess like lightning the two girls tied their handker chiefs tightly above and below the puncture marks made in georges calf by the snakes fangs then nancy took a tiny pair of scissors from her bag i wish i had something to sterilize these with she said will perfume do bess asked and took from her bag the tiny bottle of blue jade the liquid was poured onto the scissors then nancy deftly made a crosscut incision near the punctures blood spurted out and with it she hoped any serum the snake might have injected george stoically had not made a sound but fi nally she said thanks girls your quick first aid probably made it possible for me to go to the ceremonies tonightif they have them i think youd better not step on your foot or stimulate circulation nancy advised suppose bess and i carry you george started to protest but finally consented seated on a chair made by the intertwined hands of nancy and bess george was carried to ward the farmhouse the trip though awkward and slow went at a steady pace george maintained her spartan atti tude she not only refused to complain but teas ingly asked bess arent you glad i dont eat as much as you do i dont know what you mean bess replied puzzled well if i loved desserts as you do george teased i wouldnt be such a featherweight to carry bess gave her cousin an indignant glance how do you like that for gratitude next time i lug you all the way home nancy interrupted with a grin i guess we all do our share of eating dessert anyhow weve made it girls red gate farm is just ahead as they came up to the house mrs salisbury who was in the garden exclaimed oh gracious what happened mr abbott and mrs byrd hurried from the house just a precautionary measure nancy ex plained and told of the snake incident george was carried indoors and laid on a couch mrs byrd quickly called the family physician he arrived shortly and examined georges wound the doctor nodded approvingly as he bathed it with an antiseptic and removed the tourniquets excellent firstaid treatment he announced youll be fine young lady id advise you to rest for several hours thank you thats good news george gave a relieved grin for the remainder of the afternoon she was made to lie inactive when dinnertime came george got up declaring i never felt better but take it easy in case we go out tonight nancy pleaded with her to allay suspicion on the part of the other boarders bess and joanne were posted as guards across the road if they saw the beginning of rites on the hill the girls were to give birdcalls in the meantime nancy and george waited in georges room the costumes ready to be picked up at a moments notice suddenly nancy leaped from her chair and flew into her own bedroom whats eating you george called oh why didnt i think of it before how stupid of me nancy said returning with a piece of paper in her hand what are you talking about george de manded that snake today the way he wriggled it looked just like the mark over the numeral in the coded message nancy cried excitedly the we think means b george sat up you mean the b with the wavy line over it might signify the black snake col ony yes oh george this connects the hale syn dicate with the nature cult here now the mes sage reads maurice hale calling black snake colony meeting and the how about that george asked not too hard to guess george the is the letter r and could stand for red gate farm nancy youre a whiz as ive often told you her friend declared the young sleuth smiled then said wistfully if i could only have had another second to copy the next few numbers i might have known the exact time what happens now will you notify the po lice at that instant nancy and george heard soft birdcalls no time to phone now nancy said she grabbed two of the costumes and dashed from the room george followed with the others as prearranged the girls left by the kitchen door to avoid the boarders mrs byrd had been told that the girls might go up the hillside to watch if the nature cult put on a performance nancy and george joined the other girls and they all scurried toward the woods it was very dark beneath the dense canopy of trees and bess gripped nancys arm joanne was familiar with every path and led the way toward the hillside a weird cry broke the stillness involuntarily the girls halted and moved closer together whatwasthat bess chattered only some wild animal nancy reassured her come on she urged we must hurry or well miss the ritual the girls went through the dark forest as fast as they could the moon was rising and ghostly rays of light filtered through gaps in the foliage overhead a faint breeze stirred the leaves into what seemed like menacing whispers the girls finally reached the river trail and followed it we must be careful now nancy warned in a low voice were drawing near the colony the cult may have a lookout stationed during the night ceremonies i hadnt thought of that joanne murmured i almost wish i hadnt come bess whispered nervously i had no idea it would be this dark what were you expecting at ninethirty at night george chided in as low a tone as possi ble it will be lighter when the moon rises higher joanne told her stillif you want to turn back no im going through with this masquerade if the rest of you are bess retorted stalwartly nancy hoped fervently it would remain a mas querade she was firmly convinced now that the black snake group were unscrupulous people working with or at least friendly with maurice hale nancy now felt convinced that the mystic rites were nothing but a sham fortunately for nancys purpose the hillside was covered with large rocks as well as dense shrubs which would provide temporary hiding places as the girls stole cautiously up the steep path they could see cult members still congregat ing were in plenty of time she thought the girls separated george and bess crouch ing behind a huge rock joanne and nancy took cover behind a heavy growth of shrubs and tall grass for nearly ten minutes the girls watched as figures milled about the hillside then they heard the sound of cars approaching they must be coming up through the pasture again joanne said listening intently an instant later she and nancy saw the head lights of three automobiles look joanne tugged at nancys sleeve more members are coming out of their tents the two girls watched the whiterobed figures walking slowly toward the brow of the hill where the three automobiles had parked i wonder if one of the newcomers is maurice hale nancy thought she and joanne were too far away to hear what was being said but they could see distinctly they watched as a group of men and women twelve in number stepped from the cars nancy could not distinguish any of their faces the new arrivals quickly donned white gar ments and headgear similar to the outfits nancy and her friends had made then joined the other members of the cult the ghostly figures soon began dancing about in the moonlight and nancy felt that the time was right for her daring attempt to join the group before she could tell joanne there was a slight stir in the bushes directly behind her involuntarily nancy jumped fully expecting to come face to face with one of the cult mem bers instead bess and george emerged isnt it about time for us to do something they asked almost simultaneously yes nancy agreed wed better get into our robes as quickly as we can the girls were well hidden by the rocks and bushes they donned their costumes and pulled the headgear over their faces for the first time nancy noticed the scent of blue jade on bess i wonder if that was wise nancy thought if it attracts attention to bess it might increase her danger but its too late now to do anything about it as george overeager started off nancy caught her friends arm wait she warned we must slip quietly into the circle one at a time my knees are shaking now bess admitted i dont know how ill be able to dance stay here if you like nancy told her i think we should leave someone to keep guard anyway ill stay joanne offered i know the way back through the woods better than you girls do come on george pleaded if we dont hurry well be too late good luck joanne whispered as the girls crept away inch by inch the three girls made their way up the hill they crouched behind a clump of bushes a stones throw from where the cult mem bers were dancing nancy indicated that she would make the first move bess and george nodded the slightest mistake will mean detection nancy thought her heart pounding waiting for the right moment she suddenly slipped out among the whiterobed figures and in stantly began waving her arms and making gro tesque motions chapter xvi startling commands relieved that her entry into the group had not been noticed nancy marched along with the other ghostly figures if only george and bess were as successful nancy watched her disguised companions and saw that the girls would have no trouble in fol lowing the motions since each person was ap parently making them up on the spur of the moment so far so good nancy told herself satisfied now that her own position was tem porarily secure she tried to help her friends de liberately moving toward the shrubs behind which george and bess were hiding she shielded them from the view of the cult members all the time continuing her grotesque motions george realized what the young sleuth was try ing to do and made the most of the opportunity choosing her time she slipped out and joined the group on the hillside bess was more timid several times at the criti cal moment she lost her nerve but she finally managed to summon enough courage and made the plunge keep close together nancy warned in an un dertone if we lose each other it may be dis astrous by this time the girls had made up their minds that there was nothing the least bit mystic about the queer rites of the black snake colony dis guised persons on all sides of them were making crude remarks which assured the girls that the cult members did not take the ceremony seri ously this ought to give the country yokels an eye full nancy heard one man mutter how much longer do we have to do this an other grumbled im getting sick of flapping my arms around like a windmill this cult idea was all foolishness anyway still another said foolishness is it someone caught him up nancy thought she recognized the voice but was not certain let me tell you a girl was prowling around here only a few days ago i guess the chief knew his business when he thought up this crazy cult idea well enough of this a loud voice an nounced nancy decided the man must be one of the leaders we may as well go into the cave and get down to business george was just wondering what the girls had better do when bess clutched nancys hand and whispered nervously do we dare enter we must nancy returned quietly the girls stood motionless watching the whiterobed figures march single file toward the entrance to the cave finally nancy signaled and the three friends followed the group even though it occurred to them that they might be walking into a trap keep close behind me nancy warned her companions in a whisper as they approached the mouth of the opening nancy saw a tall figure robed in white standing guard her heart nearly stopped as she realized that each person was uttering some password were finished now she thought it was too late to turn back the three girls could do nothing but hope that in some way they might get past the stalwart guard nancy kept close to the person just ahead of her and as he muttered the password she man aged to hear it kamar when nancys turn came to pass the guard she spoke the word clearly as she had hoped george and bess heard and taking their cue from her repeated the password the sentry did not give them a second glance yet the girls breathed eas ier when they were safely through the entrance the marchers descended into a cold damp tunnel someone was carrying a torch at the head of the procession but nancy and her friends who were near the end of the line were in semidark ness what do you suppose were getting into george muttered nancy did not reply but gave her friend a sharp nudge as a warning not to speak a moment later bess tripped over some object in the path and would have fallen if nancy had not caught her by the arm they walked farther under ground and then unexpectedly stepped into a dimly lighted chamber the members of the cult seated themselves on the floor and the girls followed their example presently they became aware of the strong scent of blue jade perfume bess was not the only one wearing it tonight so there is a definite connection between this distinctive perfume and the black snake col ony nancy thought no wonder that man on the train was startled perhaps the women use it and he couldnt identify me but took it for granted i was one of the group if so its just as well bess has some on nancy suddenly recalled the forged note bear ing the blue jade scent the woman who de livered it to me must be a member of the cult she thought excitedly after everyone had entered the room the man who had given the sharp order outside the cave spoke again he threw off his headgear and glanced over the group appraisingly nancy was stunned maurice the man she had seen the first time she had stopped at the filling station is he maurice hale she asked herself ex citedly everyone here he demanded gruffly he counted the group and again nancy and her friends held their breaths apparently some of the members of the colony were missing for the leader did not notice that three new recruits had been added to his organization we may as well get down to work the leader announced snead have you anything to re port at the question one of the disguised persons stood up and threw off his mask again nancy was startled he was none other than the man she had seen in room heres the good money he said handing over an envelope perfect score this time for our main distribution department very fine then nothings gone wrong at your new office not yet chief was the muttered reply but yesterday i saw a bird hangin around the build inglooked like a plainclothes cop to me i dont want you to think im backing out but if you ask me id say its about time to blow this game cant last forever you know ill do the thinking for this outfit the leader scathingly retorted well stay here an other week and then pick a new spot what makes you think the cops are wise well they may have got wise to the fact that were using yvonne again thats right a shrill angry female voice in terrupted blame me every time somebody gets nervous you bring me into it nancy could scarcely restrain herself she had been right about yvonne the girl was mixed up in the hale syndicate racket you deserve blame al snead retorted irrita bly first you didnt have any more sense than to sell a bottle of that perfume to a perfect stranger i told you that girl insisted upon buying it and i was afraid if i flatly refused she and her friends would get suspicious besides i dont see what harm it did to sell the perfume to a teen ager no snead retorted sarcastically youre so simpleminded you wouldnt see it might land us in jail when pete was on the train going to river heights he noticed the scent and thought that the girl was one of the chiefs agents lucky for all of us he saw his mistake before he spilled anything yvonne sputtered back in defense well at least i phoned al at his office right away so he could warn the agents about the stray bottle of blue jade its not my fault pete happened to be on the same train as those girls the leader suddenly became impatient enough of this he shouted its not getting us anywhere snead i placed yvonne in your office and shell stay there as long as i say im satisfied with the rest of her work get me snead nodded sullenly nancy had been studying the leader intently and by this time was convinced that he was far more clever and intelligent than his subordi nates she figured that al snead was righthand man to the chief but resented his superiors favoritism toward yvonne wong the organiza tion was a large one evidently changing its scene and type of operation from time to time if only she could slip away and get help from the author ities another thing al snead continued address ing maurice hale wed better make up a new code those girls that have been gettin too close to our operation just might notify the cops all right the chief responded ill work one out in a day or two he called on another member of the organiza tion for a report two hundred packages passed sir good the leader exclaimed rubbing his thin hands now if youll follow me to the work room ill give you each your cut and dole out the stuff for next week nancy and her friends could not have retreated had they wished and certainly did not want to leave when they seemed so near the truth but the situation in which they found them selves was a foreboding one and the very atmos phere of the room was tense and frightening boldly they followed the others into an adjoining chamber which was brilliantly lighted with torches though prepared for the unexpected the girls were taken completely aback at the sight which greeted their eyes chapter xvii tense moments nancys first impression on entering was that the chamber appeared to be a cross between a print ing shop and a united states mint counterfeiters she thought excitedly hand presses stood about and several engraved plates had been left on a table various chemicals and inks were in evidence neat stacks of paper money lined one wall and other bills were scat tered carelessly on the floor never in all her life had nancy seen so much money the room was cluttered with it twentydollar bills appeared to be everywhere money still damp was drying on tables nancy observed that all the bills seemed to be of the twentydollar de nomination at last she had the answer to the many ques tions which had been troubling her this was the secret of the cave the latest racket of the hale syndicate the nature cult was a hoax its socalled mysterious rites used only as a screen to hide the work of a clever band of counterfeiters the black snake colony seemed to her to be a perfect name nancy realized that if she did not try to get away and bring help now she and her friends would fail there was nothing they could do by themselves nancy turned to relay her intentions to bess and george a slight tug on their robes was all that was needed to make them understand but to put the plan into operation was another matter the girls attempted to edge toward the cham ber entrance by degrees but al snead stood bar ring the door for the time being escape was out of the question they must bide their time as long as some members of the organization remained masked the girls knew they would be comparatively safe but already several people had stripped off their robes and headpieces every minute that the girls escape was delayed increased the danger of detection since it was impossible to sneak away nancy made careful note of her surroundings and tried to identify the faces on her mind except for yvonne the leader maurice hale al snead and the man she had seen on the train all were strangers six people besides bess george and herself remained masked as nancy surveyed the elaborate equipment in the workroom she realized that this was an un usually large gang of counterfeiters the en graved plate which had been copied from an ac tual united states government twentydollar bill was a work of art probably the leader of the gang had at one time been noted as a skilled engraver and had decided to use his talents to unlawful ad vantage nancy carefully glanced about the room mau rice hale was looking over some stacks of coun terfeit money while several members of the gang talked quietly bess and george automatically fol lowed nancys gaze but stood perfectly still next to her near the table nancy under ordinary circumstances could not have told the counterfeit money from the real thingwith the picture of jackson on the face and the white house on the back but now that she had been alerted to examine the bills care fully she noted that the color and texture of the paper appeared to be at fault when nancy felt sure that she was not being observed she stealthily picked up one of the bills and tucked it inside her robe as evidence we made a pretty fair weeks profit maurice hale said gruffly as he stacked the bills into sev eral large piles you distributors and passers keep up like this for another month and id say well all be on easy street the racket wont last another month al snead growled i tell you the federal agents are getting wise that the phony stuffs being passed around here bah hale replied contemptuously let them be suspicious they wouldnt think of this outoftheway place as our headquarters in a thousand years nancy could not help but smile at his words thats what he thinks the next voice that spoke startled nancy she recognized it instantly as belonging to mr kent the wouldbe buyer of red gate farm yeah maybe not he was saying still its too bad the old lady wouldnt sell her place then wed really have a setup it flashed through nancys mind that her hunch had been right about mr kent being in volved with the hillside cult no wonder they wanted to obtain red gate farm it would have been a better headquarters for the gang than the cave the girl detective strained her ears as the con versation continued a woman next to kent said scornfully i only hope your bright idea about that fake letter we took to the drew girl and cut ting the farm telephone wires doesnt backfire so nancy told herself it was kent and the woman who had just spoken who were the ones responsible for that part of the mystery mr kent also was undoubtedly the driver of the car which had slowed down one evening near the farm house meanwhile the leader went on deftly stacking the money nancy and her friends watched him with increasing uneasiness when the various members of the organization were called upon to accept their share of the counterfeit bills they would doubtless remove their masks how would the girls escape detection then nancy realized the situation was becoming more serious she and her friends must escape before the actual distribution of the money be gan if only al snead would move away from the door one thought comforted nancy joanne was on guard outside the cave if worst came to worst and escape was cut off joanne undoubtedly would be come alarmed and hurry back to the farmhouse for help we may have to make a dash for it nancy warned george in a whisper if that man moves away from the door be ready al snead did not move however and it seemed to the girls that he was watching them they wondered if their whispering had made him sus picious bess trembled slightly and moved nearer nancy maurice hale had finished counting the money and glancing over the assembly an nounced in a commanding voice well those of you who havent removed your masks had better do it one by one i want to be sure no one is here who shouldnt be he pointed to bess you first nancy and her friends felt themselves go cold they were trapped there was nothing they could do now but make a wild dash for safety readyl nancy muttered under her breath before the girls could put their ideas into ac tion they were startled by a loud commotion in the tunnel an instant later the guard who had been stationed at the entrance of the cave burst into the chamber he was half dragging a young girl who fought violently to free herself the victim was joanne chapter xviii prisoners nancys first impulse was to dash forward and try to help joanne but instantly she realized the foolishness of such an act george half started to ward joanne but nancy restrained her wait she whispered tensely if the situation had been grave before it was even more serious now with joanne captured there was no one to go for help the girls must depend entirely on themselves to escape from the cave no one at the farmhouse knew that they were doing anything more than watching the black snake colony from a safe distance let me go joanne cried struggling to free herself where did she come from maurice hale de manded unpleasantly i saw her hiding among the bushes the guard informed him she was spying but she got just a little too curious spying eh a harsh expression crossed the leaders face well we know what to do with snoopers its all a mistake joanne murmured on the verge of tears i didnt mean any harm im mrs byrds granddaughter and i was merely curious to know more about the cult even as joanne spoke her eyes traveled about the room noting the stacks of money and the queer printing presses she tried not to show that she understood their significance but it was too late the leader had seen her startled expression so he drawled smartly this time your curiosity has been the means of getting you into serious trouble youll learn by the time we get through with you not to meddle in affairs that dont concern you he turned quickly to snead al see that no one leaves this room yes chief the guard answered nancy wondered what he had in mind just then maurice hale continued in a cold harsh voice just to make sure that other spies havent been pulling a fast one on us ill have everyone remove his mask at once be mighty quick about it tool no bess whimpered aloud then realizing what she had done she covered her mouth and sank back against the wall all heads turned in her direction nancy and her friends had deliberately delayed in removing their masks but now nancy knew their effort to gain time was doomed with al snead still blocking the door things looked black most of the others already had stripped off their headgear in addition to maurice hale and al snead nancy immediately recognized yvonne wong and pete the man who had spoken to her on the train next she spotted mr kent and finally the woman with the upswept hairdo who had brought her the faked letter that womans the same one i saw at the serv ice station with the three men nancy thought if she hadnt changed her hair style i might have recognized her the night she delivered the note the other unmasked members were strangers to nancy tensely now she watched as the leader stood before bess nothing to be afraid of dear he said and gently lifted off the ghostly head covering the next instant maurice hale practically shrieked a spy his face contorted with rage maurice snatched the white cloth headpieces from georges face then nancys their scheme was exposed to all the members of the counterfeit gang for an instant there was stunned silence then angry cries arose from the black snake colony members theyre the ones who bought the blue jade perfume from me yvonne wong shrieked al snead glared at nancy yeah i knew something was wrong when you came into the of fice wearin the blue jade i smelled it but didnt let on he then pointed accusingly toward joanne that girl is the one who applied at our city of fice for a job when she told me who she was and where she was from i knew she was the last per son in the world wed want to hire that crazy idea of yours about someone with farm experience the leader cried we didnt need anybody to talk to our agents about cows and chickens but this place is in the country al snead defended himself and in our codes we use a lot of that kind of lingo silence maurice yelled and turned to jo anne so you thought youd get a job at our of fice and spy on us and your meddling friend nancy drew was in cahoots with you no oh no joanne cried out it was only by accident i wanted to find a job and help my grandmother nancy was just trying to help me locate the office dont expect us to believe a trumpedup story like that the leader said harshly we know all about why you two have been snooping around ever since al had pete trail you from riverside heights whats more we know how to deal with such people hale turned menacingly to nancy youll wish youd taken petes advice when he called your palhe indicated georgeand warned her that youd better mind your own business oh maurice please dont be too harsh with the girls a timid voice pleaded they didnt mean any harm as she finished the speaker re moved her mask nancy turned quickly to see the woman she had helped in the woods and later had taken to town so shes a counterfeiter nancy told herself incredulously i cant believe it didnt mean any harm maurice drawled sarcastically oh no of course not they only wanted to land the whole hale syndicate in jail not that you would care if i had known what a whiner you are id never have married you mind your own business and let me take care of this in spite of the seriousness of her own situation nancy felt pity for the woman undoubtedly as the wife of such a tyrant as maurice hale she had stayed with him against her will she had hated the life that he had forced her to lead but evi dently she had been powerless to escape from it no wonder the poor woman took a chance and slipped away from time to time nancy thought frightened by the harsh words of her husband mrs hale moved back into a far corner of the room nancy wished she could help her in some way but realized that the woman dared not say more whatll we do with these girls the leader de manded we cant let em go they know too much on all sides angry mutterings arose yvonne wong heartlessly proposed that the girls be tied up and left prisoners in the cave but maurice hale ruled down that suggestion well have to get em out of here he said theyll be missed and a searching party might visit this joint how about the shack at the river its in such a desolate spot no one would think of looking there until after he did not finish the sentence but from the sinister expression on his face nancy and her friends guessed his meaning he intended to lock them up in the cabin and leave them without food a cry of anguish came from the leaders wife rushing forward she clutched her husband fran tically by the arm oh maurice you couldnt be that cruel mr hale flung her away from him with a force that sent the woman reeling against the wall she uttered a little moan of pain and sank to the floor oh bess screamed even the cult members were startled be quiet ordered their chief the cruel action aroused nancy for an instant all eyes were centered on the woman and nancy thought she saw her opportunity quick as a flash she made a rush for the exit bess and george equally alert darted after her al snead who stood in the opening was taken completely by surprise he tried to hold his ground but the girls were too strong for him he managed to detain bess and george but nancy wriggled from his grasp she hesitated when she saw her friends had failed go on nancy bess shrieked you must es cape nancy darted into the next room while george and bess struggled with their captor try ing to block the door and give their friend more time stop that girl maurice hale shouted an grily if you let her get away ill nancy plunged into the tunnel and was swal lowed up by darkness she ran for her life and for the lives of her friends realizing this probably was her only chance the long white robe hindered her but there was no time to tear it off she held it high above her knees once she stumbled but caught her self and rushed on frantically the tunnel seemed to have no end behind her nancy could hear pounding footsteps and an gry shouts she thought the men must be gaining if only she could reach the mouth of the cave the tunnel wound in and out and several times nancy brushed against the rough stone wall the route was so circuitous that she began to think she had taken a wrong turn then just as she was giving up hope nancy spotted a dim light far ahead and knew she must be nearing the mouth of the cave no one ap peared to be left guarding the entrance her only chancel in a moment more she had reached the open air saved nancy breathed at that instant a dark figure loomed up from the grass nancy felt a heavy hand on her shoul der chapter xix destroyed evidence not so fast there the man leered as he clutched nancy firmly by the arm and whirled her around whats the big rush anyway nancy staring into his hard face saw that he was the man who had been addressed as hank one of the three men she had seen at the filling station frantically she struggled to free herself so he muttered in satisfaction the pretty blond spy the boys were telling me about i thought you were warned by the guard to keep away from here this time i take it youre lookin for something besides a stray cow yes and im going to find it nancy said bravely oh yeah youre going to find what the po lice hank looked at her costume youre a spy but your little game is up nancys pulse was racing how could she get away she could hear running footsteps coming through the tunnel and knew her chance of es cape would be over in another instant in des peration she tried to jerk herself free from hank but her captor gripped her more securely and laughed as she cried out in pain let me go nancy twisted and squirmed but her efforts only made hank tighten his grip by the time the others reached her she had given up the struggle and stood quietly waiting for the worst to come good thing you got her hank maurice hale called the little wildcat well give her a double dose for this smart trick no girls go ing to put anything over on me at the entrance of the cave it was nearly as bright as day for the moon was high maurice hale glanced nervously about as though fearing observation by unseen eyes get back inside he sharply ordered his fol lowers its a clear night and some wise bird might see us without our costumes and wonder whats up we must destroy the evidence as quickly as we can and clear out of this placel even as the leader spoke nancy thought she heard a rustling in the nearby bushes she told herself that it probably was only the wind stir ring the leaves rescue was out of the question for no one knew that she and her friends had planned such a dangerous mission how foolish of them not to have revealed their full plans to someone nancy made no protest as she was dragged back into the cavern bravely she tried to meet the eyes of her friends for she saw that they were even more discouraged than she poor bess was trembling with fright ththe perfume did it she wailed i knew this masquerade was far too dangerous for us to try cheer up nancy whispered encouragingly well find some way to get out of here bess only shook her head she was not to be deceived and to think i was the one who couldnt wait for a spooky adventure on the hillside george moaned regretfully i really ought to have my head examined the members of the syndicate were furious there would be no second opportunity for these intruders to break away at an order from the leader al snead found several pieces of rope and bound nancy and her friends hand and foot he seemed to take particular delight in making nancys bonds cruelly tight i guess thatll hold you for a while he grinned gloating over the girls predicament get to work the leader commanded his men impatiently do you think we have the rest of the night if we dont hurry up and get out of here the cops are apt to be down on us dont know what this girls done all colony members except mrs hale went to work with a will the fear of the law obviously had affected them with a sinking heart nancy realized the men planned to destroy all the evi dence of their counterfeiting operations the machines that we cant take with us well wreck maurice hale ordered if we save the plates we can start up again in a new place get a move on he stood over the men driving them furiously his wife had slumped down in a chair and had buried her face in her hands she appeared crushed only once did she summon her energy to speak maurice she murmured brokenly why wont you give up this dreadful lifealways run ning from the police we were happy before you got mixed up with such bad company her husband cut her short with a sarcastic re mark she did not try to speak again but sat hunched over looking sorrowfully at the girls nancy knew that she wanted to help them but did not have the courage for further defiance the work of destroying the counterfeiting ma chinery went on but several times maurice hale glanced impatiently at his watch no use waiting until were through here he observed after a time lets get the prisoners out of here pronto the sooner were rid of them the safer ill feel al you start on ahead with one of the automobiles you know the way to the shack dont you sure al snead agreed promptly then take hank along to keep guard and get going nancy and her chums were jerked to their feet the cords around their ankles were removed to permit them to walk but their arms were kept tied securely behind them move along al snead ordered nancy giving her a hard shove forward the girls stumbled along through the dark passageway from the inner room to the mouth of the cave men and women followed them with an gry menacing threats al and hank pushed the girls to make them hurry nancy and her friends exchanged hopeless glances from time to time george held her head up contemptuously but joanne was white as a sheet and bess was on the verge of tears guess thisll teach you girls to mix with the black snake colony a raucous voice said as the group made its way toward the exit nancy held back a retort but her icy look told the man she did not appreciate the remark their walk seemed interminable finally how ever moonlight could be seen in a moment they were approaching the mouth of the cave nancy took a few halting steps and then paused as if she had turned to stone her eyes were riv eted upon the entrance there stood mr ab botts son karl jr oh karl nancy cried out these men are counterfeiters dont let them capture you too run chapter xx a final hunch karl abbott did not run instead he signaled with his hand at once seven armed men sprang from the darkness of nearby bushes secret service agents karl explained quickly to the girls stand where you are dont anyone move ordered one of the federal men so unexpected was their arrival that the coun terfeiters were stunned for an instant no one moved then with a cry of rage maurice hale darted into the cavern he had taken only a few steps when one of the other agents grabbed him firmly by one arm none of that we have you right this time hale you wont try any funny stuff with uncle sam again some of the counterfeiters who had not yet come from the cavern had turned back theyll get away through the other exit nancy cried out karl smiled we have that covered too he now introduced the four girls to secret service agent horton who was in charge of the group the federal man gave nancy drew a quick word of praise for revealing the head quarters of the counterfeiting ring outwittedby that snooping kid maurice hale screamed the thought seemed to unnerve the man com pletely he did not protest when handcuffs were put on his wrists other members of the syndi cate submitted to the agents without resistance although yvonne wong vehemently protested her innocence i didnt know what it was all about until to night she cried angrily it isnt fair to arrest me ive worked for mr snead only a few days youll have to think up a better story than that she was told bluntly your name has been mixed up in underhanded deals before but this is the first time weve been able to get any evidence against you while the prisoners were being rounded up karl abbott rushed over to the girls and quickly freed their hands are you all right he asked anxiously yes nancy told him but if you hadnt ar rived just when you did it might have been a dif ferent story she was on the verge of asking what had brought him to the cave at the psychological mo ment when she saw that two federal agents were placing handcuffs on the wrists of maurice hales wife breaking away from her friends nancy darted to the other side of the room oh dont arrest mrs hale she pleaded she isnt like the rest she tried to save us but they wouldnt listen to her sorry horton returned but well have to take her along if you want to intercede for her later we may be able to have her sentence light ened after the prisoners had been herded out of the cave to waiting government automobiles and the printing plates used in the making of the counterfeit bills had been collected nancy felt explanations were in order from karl how did you know we had come here nancy asked him from mrs byrd she was greatly worried when i came to see father tonight she told me that after youd gone she found evidence of your costume making she confided in me you might have done just what you did she asked me to try and stop you yes go on nancy urged well ive been suspicious of this hillside ceremony stuff and after talking further with mrs byrd i decided to get in touch with the secret service men she said you had told her about they couldnt come but the chief agent in this area sent some of his other men how marvelous of you to have put two and two together bess exclaimed by the time we all got here karl went on no one was around i sneaked inside just as all of you were coming out mr horton thought you girls would not be harmed if you walked outside before the gang was captured thanks for that said george ive had enough just then secret service agent horton came over to nancys group and extended his hand to her miss drew he said earnestly i want to thank you for your work which has resulted in the solution of one of the most baffling cases of counterfeiting the united states government has ever had how did you do it nancy blushed at the praise it was sort of a chain reaction i guess the young sleuth replied and told of the various circumstances that had led to tonights adventure when she finished the agent shook his head in amazement you cracked a code this gang had thought was unbreakable my congratulations it was late when the four girls escorted by karl abbott left the cave as they neared the farmhouse joanne observed that the lights were on i hope gram hasnt been too worried before the girls reached the porch mrs byrd came hurrying toward them she clung tightly to joanne for an instant im so glad youre back she murmured in relief and you girls are all right i was terribly afraid those members of the black snake col ony she was interrupted by mrs salisburys voice from the dark porch you had us so worried we couldnt go to bed the idea of girls running around the country at this hour that nature cult is all foolishness anyway absolutely mr abbott agreed the less you meddle with their affairs the wiser youll be youre wrong this time father karl jr an nounced if the girls hadnt meddled those counterfeiters would have operated indefinitely counterfeiters the two boarders and mrs byrd exclaimed together they were tense as karl jr related every thing that had happened in fact it was not until the next day that mrs salisbury recovered from the shock sufficiently to boast well i always said those girls were up and coming mr abbott was very proud of the part his son had played in the case and said so several times mrs byrd had nothing except praise for nancy and her friends and who would think she said incredulously that besss innocent purchase of a bottle of perfume would lead you girls to a mystery right here at red gate farm however the removal of the black snake col ony from her property left her a serious financial problem im glad theyre gone she said but ill miss the money i cant hope to rent the land again it isnt fertile enough for farming all this talk about counterfeiters is apt to give red gate a bad name too ill probably lose those other boarders who were coming publicity is a queer thing nancy said thoughtfully sometimes one can work it to ones advantage thats what well do now how joanne asked well advertise that counterfeiters cavern to sightseers and make enough money to lift a dozen mortgages the others were enthusiastic during the next week the girls with karl jrs assistance placed in the cave for public display an imitation setup of the counterfeiting operation there were sev eral old printing presses and some dummy figures arranged before them as if at work scat tered about the cave floor were stacks of home made moneyto represent counterfeit bills the following week mr drew came to red gate farm a few miles away he halted his auto mobile at the side of the road and with an amused smile studied a large billboard which read follow the arrow to red gate farm see the mysterious cavern used by counterfeiters admis sion fifty cents as carson drew continued slowly in his car he presently came to another sign bolder than the first regain health at red gate farm boarders by day or week the traffic was unusually heavy and the law yer soon realized that all of the cars were headed for the farm the place was crowded he parked as near the house as he could and walked up the path the grounds were well kept and equipped with swings and huge umbrellas a number of persons evidently boarders were enjoying the garden before carson drew had reached the front door it was flung open and nancy rushed to meet him dad she cried joyfully isnt this wonderful youve done a magnificent job nancy after a hearty dinner nancy and her friends took mr drew to the hillside cave reuben ames looking most unlike himself in a new suit which was a trifle too tight was in his glory as he conducted groups of visitors through the cav ern ive collected thirty dollars already today he hailed nancy as she came up with her friends this beats plowin corn bess grinned didnt i always say that adven ture follows nancy drew around and bess was right for another exciting adven ture awaited her courageous friend who very soon was to become involved in the clue in the diary mr drew laughed nancy he said as i think of your adventure at red gate farm i cant decide whether youre better as a detective or as a promoter
