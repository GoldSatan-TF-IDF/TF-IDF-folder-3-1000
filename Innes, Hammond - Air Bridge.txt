then suddenly it was there over the end of the runway hanging like a great clumsy bird over the trees dropping towards the concrete its landing flaps down the props turning slowly i scrambled to my feet and began to run tubby was running too saeton levelled out for the touchdown and as the gap between plane and concrete lessened the aircraft seemed to gather speed till it was rushing towards us then the belly hit the concrete pieces of metal were flung wide this is the story of an enterprise begun in a hangar on a deserted airfield in wiltshire the three men behind it are exraf flyers who though widely different in character find themselves bound together by a common purpose against the background of the postwar blockade of berlin it tells of their desperate attempts to get their machine on to the airlift in time and reveals the workings of that greatest of all flying operations hammond innes air bridge note in the sections of this book dealing with the berlin airlift i am indebted to the royal air force who flew me into blockaded berlin and who gave me every facility for studying the lift both on the ground and in the air i should like to take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the air ministrys willingness to assist me and of the friendly cooperation i received from lift personnel at wunstorf and gatow at a time when they were very overworked it is inevitable in a story of this nature that the types of aircraft and the titles of airforce personnel should be those that operated at the time and at the bases concerned i wish to make it clear therefore that the story is not founded on anything that actually occurred and in particular that the characters in the story who hold official positions are entirely fictional chapter one it was dark and i was very tired my head ached and my mind was confused the road ran uphill between steep banks and there were trees with gaunt branches spread against the pale glimmer of the milky way at last i reached the level and the high banks gave place to hedges through a gap i caught a glimpse of an orange moon lying on its back on the far side of a ploughed field nothing stirred all life seemed frostbound in the cold of night i stood for a moment exhausted my knees trembling weakly and the sweat drying like cold steel against my skin a little wind ran chill fingers through the bare spikes of the quickthorn and i went on then driven by the shivers that ran through my body it was the reaction after the crash i had to find somewhere to lie up a barn anything so long as it was warm and then i had to get out of the country i was meeting the wind now even as i walked it chilled the sweat on my body my steps no longer rang firm the sound of them became a shuffle that was lost every i now and then in the lashing of the trees in a small copse the country around was quite flat now a familiar flatness the sharp edges of a large rectangular building stood for a moment black against the moon it was there for an instant gaunt and recognisable and then it was lost behind the high earth mounds of a dispersal point i stopped my body suddenly rigid the dispersal point and that distant glimpse of a hangar confirmed what i had already sensed almost automatically the flatness that stretched before me was an aerodrome if i could get a plane damn it id done it before and it had been far more difficult then i could remember the fir trees and the feel of the sand almost silver in the moonlight and the dark shadows of men against the hangar lights the picture was so vivid in my mind that the same surge of excitement took told of me now tensing my nerves giving me strength i turned quickly and slid into the woods it was less cold in the woods or else the sudden urgency of hope gave me warmth as well as energy it was darker too i might have lost my sense of direction but always there was jupiter like a candle flickering amongst the branches to show me the way the road had run the trees clutched at me whipping across my face and in a moment i felt the warm trickle of blood from the cut on my forehead the thick salt warmth of it reached my tongue as i licked at the corner of my mouth but it didnt hurt in fact i barely noticed it i was intent upon one thing and one thing only a plane i came out of the wood on the very edge of the perimeter track a fifty yard wide ribbon of tarmac rutted and hillocked by the frosts and marked with the dead stalks of summers weeds left and right it seemed to stretch to the horizon and across the track was the airfield a bleak open hilltop black under the moon for the grass was gone and it was all plough the curve of that hilltop was smooth and even like the curvature of the earths surface a section of a globe hung against the stars the only relief to that impression of void was away to the left where the black edge of a hangar seemed to be shouldering the moon up the sky i stood there for a moment conscious again of the wind cutting through my clothing as the sense of emptiness drained the excitement out of me the story of the ploughedup grassland the dead weed stalks and the frostbroken tarmac was evident in the dead atmosphere of the place the airfield was deserted it was one of the great bomber stations that had died with the end of the war it was easy to see it as it had been full of activity with the roar of planes coming in from a raid big graceful shapes in silhouette against the flarepath settling clumsily on to the runway this sort of place had been my life for six and a half years now the planes only existed as ghosts in my mind all about me was empty desolation a slow disintegration moving inevitably back to the land from which it had sprung up with a feeling of hopelessness i started along the perimeter track towards the hangars they would be just derelict shells but at least they would give me shelter for the night i felt suddenly sick and very tired a little scared too the desolation of that airfield ate into me bringing with it an awareness of my own loneliness the perimeter track seemed unending growing wider and more desolate at every stumbling step as the wind thrust into my stomach till it chilled and stiffened my spine dizziness overtook me it was the crash of course and the awful crack id got on the head and then a flicker of hope came to steady me the hangars now loomed black against the moon big rectangular skeletons slowly crumbling away but at the far end of the concrete apron there was one that looked whole and solid the line of windows along its side was intact and reflected a glimmer of starlight i quickened my pace it was just possible that some private owner a local farmer or landowner kept his plane up here on this deserted aerodrome that was the hope that sent me hurrying across the apron to the deep shadows of the hangars and as i slid from one hangar to the next i prayed to god there would be petrol in the tanks i was a fool perhaps to build my hopes on such slender foundations as the fact that one hangar was intact but when youre desperate you clutch at anything before id even reached the hangar i was already mentally in the cockpit of some tiny aircraft winging my way through the night towards france i knew exactly how the coast would look as it slid beneath me and how the channel would be gently corrugated at right angles to my line of flight as the waves reflected the slanting rays of the moon i could see myself checking in at the little hotel in montmartre where id stayed several times before and then after a rest going to badouins office badouin would fix it all for me everything would be all right as soon as id seen badouin i reached the hangar and stood for a moment in the shadow of its bulk i was panting but i no longer felt sick or dizzy i was trembling slightly but that was just nerves i had plenty of energy nothing could stop me now i slid round the corner of the building and along the face of the huge sliding doors my luck was in for the little wicket door in the centre yielded to the touch of my hand revealing a dark void full of vague shadows i stepped inside and closed the door it was still and very cold with that queer musty smell of damp on concrete some glimmer of moonlight seemed to penetrate into the rear of the hangar for the shadows resolved themselves into the nose and wings of a large fourengined plane it was facing me headon and it seemed enormous in the gloom of the hangar the incredible luck of it i ducked under the port wing and moved along the fuselage running my hand along the cold metal of it searching for the door so his work is not to be remembered i stopped with a jerk it was a girls voice that had spoken a man answered her im sorry war is a dirty business but the war is finished yes but you lost it remember and because germany loses a war my father must suffer my father has suffered enough i think your father is dead the brutal words were said in a hard matteroffact voice a silence followed peering over the tailplane i could see the outline of two figures against the steady glow of a pressure lamp the man was short thickset and powerfullooking and as he moved towards the girl he unmasked the lamp so that its dim light showed me the litter of a workbench running the width of the hangar and the dark shadow of a beltdriven machine lathe i turned quickly the lamplight was glowing on the metal of the plane and as i slid along the fuselage towards the door i saw that it was a tudor and its inboard engine was missing if i had gained the door unnoticed i should not now be setting down what must surely be the most extraordinary story of the berlin airlift but my foot caught against some scrap metal and with the sudden clang of sheet tin i froze whos that it was the mans voice and it had the drive of a man accustomed to absolute authority so youve got friends here have you the beam of a torch swept the plane and then spotlighted me with its dazzling light who are you what do you want i just stood there blinking in the glare incapable of movement panic lifting my heart into my mouth the torch moved suddenly there was a click by the wall and the sound of an engine starting up outside then lights glowed and brightened the man was facing me across the tail of the plane now and he had a gun in his hand he wasnt tall but he was immensely broad across the shoulders he was thick through like a bull and he held his head slightly forward as though about to charge i hardly noticed the girl well who are you the man repeated and began to move in on me he came slowly and inevitably like a man sure of his ability to handle a situation i broke and ran i wasnt going to be caught like this trapped in a hangar accused of attempting to steal an aircraft as well as a car if once i could get to the shelter of the woods id still have a chance i ducked under the wings with the sound of his feet pounding on the concrete behind me as i wrenched open the door of the hangar he shouted at me in german halt halt du verruckter that damned language with its memory of endless unbearable days of prison and the nagging fear of the escape gave me a last burst of energy i shot through the door and in a moment i was out on the perimeter track racing for the dark line of the woods i crossed the concrete of the runwayend my breath a wild hammering in my throat my mind had become confused so that i seemed to be running again from the tunnel mouth to the dark anonymity of the fir woods at any moment i expected to hear the deep bay of the dogs and my skin crawled between my shoulder blades just as it had done that night in germany so long ago cringing in anticipation of the shattering impact of a bullet the concrete was broken and matted with weeds then i was on plough with the clay clinging to my shoes and the sound of my flight deadened in the sticky earth i stumbled and clawed my way to the woods i heard my pursuer crash into the undergrowth close behind me branches whipped across my face i barely noticed them i found a path and then lost it again in a tangle of briar that tore at my clothes i fought my way through it to find that hed skirted the brambles and was level with me i started to double back but the undergrowth was too thick i turned and faced him then i didnt stop to think i went straight for him god knows what i intended to do i think i meant to kill him he had shouted at me in german and my mind had slipped back to that earlier time when i had been nearly hunted down his fist struck my arm with numbing force and i closed with him my fingers searching for his windpipe i felt the knobbly point of his adams apple against the ball of my thumb heard him choke as i squeezed then his knee came up and i screamed in agony my hands lost their grip and as i doubled up i saw him draw his fist back i knew what was coming and i was powerless to stop it his fist seemed huge in a shaft of moonlight and then it shattered into a thousand fragments as it broke against my jaw what followed is very confused in my mind i have a vague memory of being halfled halfcarried over ground that seemed to rise and fall in waves then i was lying on a camp bed in an office full of bright lights i was being interrogated first in german then in english there was only one person there the man who had hit me i didnt see any sign of the girl he sat in a chair leaning over me so that his big solid head seemed hung in space always on the verge of falling on me and crushing me i tried to move but my hands and feet were bound the light was above me and to the left it was very bright and hurt my eyes my jaw ached and my head throbbed and the interrogation went on and on through periods of blackout i remember coming round once with a cry of pain as the searing burn of disinfectant entered the wound on my forehead after that i slept when i woke it was daylight i lay staring at the ceiling and wondering why it was plain untreated concrete the walls were bare brick in the opposite corner the mortar had crumbled away and there was a long jagged crack stuffed with newspaper slowly the events of the night before came back to me the airfield the hangar the struggle in the woods i sat up with a jerk that sent a stab of pain shooting through my head my jaw was painful and slightly swollen the cut on my forehead was covered with lint secured by adhesive tape there was a patch of dried blood on the grey army blanket that had been pulled over me i swung my legs out of bed and then sat there for quite a while staring at the unfamiliar room and fingering my jaw it was quite a small room and had obviously been used as an office there was a cheap desk with a portable typewriter in its case an old swivel chair a steel filing cabinet and an untidy litter of books and papers the books i saw at a glance were all technical manuals engineering mechanics aviation they were thick with dust the floor was of bare boards and a rusty stove stood against one wall the chimney running out through a roughlypatched hole in the ceiling the windows were barred and looked out on to a pile of rubble and a vista of broken brick foundations halfcovered with dead sorrel stalks there was an air of disintegration about the place my gaze focused and held on the bars of the windows they were solid iron bars set in cement i turned quickly to the door with a feeling of being trapped it was locked i tried to find my shoes but they had been removed panic seized hold of me then and i stood quite still in the middle of the room in my stockinged feet and fought it down i got control of myself at last but i was overcome with a feeling of sickness and lay down on the bed after a time the sickness passed and my brain became active again i was in a hell of a spot oh i was being quite honest with myself then i knew id tried to kill a man i could remember the feel of his windpipe against my thumb the question was did he know that id meant to kill him i looked slowly round the room the iron bars the locked door the removal of my shoes he knew all right my hand groped automatically for my cigarettecase my jacket hung over the back of a chair and as i felt for the case my fingers touched the inside breast pocket it was empty my wallet was gone i found the case and lit a cigarette and then i leaned back that wallet had contained something more important than money it had contained my pilots certificate and my false identity hell hed only to read the papers i dragged at my cigarette trying to think through the throbbing ache of my head i had to get out of here but how how my eyes roved desperately over the room then i glanced at my watch it was eightfifteen probably the papers had arrived already in any case he would have phoned the police a door slammed somewhere beyond the brickwork of the walls i sat up listening for the sound of footsteps all i could hear was the beating of my heart and the buzzing of a fly trapped in a web at the corner of the window nobody came time passed slowly occasionally i heard the sound of movement somewhere in the depths of the building at eight thirtyfive a car drew up at the back there was the slam of a door and the sound of voices five minutes later the car drove off i couldnt stand it any more the feeling of impotence was getting on my nerves in a sudden mood of anger i got up and beat on the panels of the door footsteps approached a heavy solid tread boots ringing metallic on concrete then a voice asked are you awake of course im awake i replied angrily do you mind opening the door there was a moments pause and then the voice said that depends im a bit cautious after last night you damn nearly throttled me i didnt say anything and a moment later the key turned in the lock and he opened the door it was the same man all right short and broad and very solid he had thick dark hair slightly grizzled at the temples and a wide jaw that seemed to compress his lips into a thin determined line he was dressed in oilstiff overalls and the silk scarf round his neck didnt entirely hide the livid marks left by my fingers im sorry about last night i murmured he didnt come in but stood there in the gap of the doorway his legs slightly straddled staring at me he had hard slategrey eyes forget it his voice was more friendly than his eyes have you had a look at yourself in the mirror afraid i made a bit of a mess of your jaw there was an awkward silence somehow i couldnt bring myself to ask when the police would arrive id like to get cleaned up i said he nodded down the passage he stood aside to let me pass but though he didnt seem angry i noticed he took good care to keep well out of my reach outside i found myself in a brick passageway filled with sunlight an open doorway showed the woods crowding right up to the side of the building and through the lacework of the trees i caught a glimpse of the flat bare expanse of the airfield it all looked very quiet and peaceful through that door lay freedom and as though he read my thoughts he said i shouldnt try wandering about outside eraser the police are searching this area the police i swung round staring at him trying to understand the sense behind his words theyve found the car youd crashed it about halfway down baydon hill he glanced up at my forehead i did the best i could with the cut youve probably scarred yourself for life but i dont think any dirt has got into it i didnt understand his attitude when are the police coining for me i asked well discuss that later he said better get cleaned up first the lavatory is at the end there feeling dull and rather dazed i went on down the passage i could hear him following behind me then his footsteps stopped ive left my shaving kit out for you if theres anything you want shout and then he added im just knocking up some breakfast how many eggs would you like two if you can spare them i mumbled i was too astonished at the calmness of his attitude to say anything else oh im all right for eggs a girl brings them from the farm each day with the milk a door opened on the sound of sizzling fat and then closed i turned to find myself alone in the passage freedom beckoned through the sunlit doorway at the end but it was hopeless he wouldnt have left me alone like that if he hadnt known it was hopeless i turned quickly and padded down the corridor in my stockinged feet the lavatory was small with an open window looking out on to a tangle of briar it was a reminder of service quarters with its cracked basin broken utility seat and initials and other pencil scratchings still visible on the crumbling plaster a shaving kit had been left out for me and a towel hung on a nail on the window frame was a cracked mirror i stared at myself in the pockmarked surface i wasnt a particularly pleasant sight apart from the black stubble that id met every day for at least fifteen years the side of my jaw was puffed and swollen producing a queer variation of colour from red to dark purple and culminating in an ugly split of dried blood my eyes were sunk back in dark sockets of exhaustion the whites bloodshot and wildlooking and to cap it all was a broad strip of adhesive tape running right across the right side of my forehead you bloody fool i said aloud it was like talking to a stranger except that the lips of the face in the glass moved in echo of my words i almost laughed at the thought that id wanted to try and escape into the outside world looking like that i looked better after id shaved but not much better id had to leave the stubble round the swollen side of my jaw and it gave me a queer lopsided appearance the cold water had freshened me up a bit but the dark shadows round my eyes remained and there was still the adhesive tape across my forehead breakfasts ready i turned to find him standing in the doorway he nodded for me to go ahead and at the same time stepped slightly back youre taking no chances i said the bitterness in my voice was for myself not for him last door on the right he said as though i hadnt spoken inside was a trestle table the sort wed had in forward bases two plates heaped with bacon and eggs and fried bread steamed slowly and there was a pot of tea by the way my names saeton bill saeton i gather you know my name my voice trembled slightly he was standing just inside the door solid and immovable like a rock his eyes fixed on my face the personality of the man seemed to grow in silence dominating me and filling the room yes i think i know all about you he said slowly sit down his voice was remote impersonal i didnt want to sit down i wanted my shoes and my wallet i wanted to get out of there but i sat down all the same there was something compelling about the way he stood there staring at me can i have my wallet please later was all he said he sat down opposite me his back to the window and poured the tea i drank thirstily and then lit a cigarette i thought you said you could manage two eggs im not hungry i answered drawing the smoke deep down into my lungs it soothed me easing the tension of my nerves when are they coming for me i asked i had control of my voice now he frowned who he asked his mouth crammed full the police i said impatiently youve phoned them havent you not yet he pointed his fork at my plate for gods sake relax and get some breakfast inside you i stared at him you mean they dont know im here i didnt believe him nobody would calmly sit down to eat his breakfast with a man whod tried to throttle him the night before unless he knew the authorities were on their way then i remembered the car and the way hed advised me not to wander about outside the police were here about half an hour ago werent they i asked him for an answer he reached over to a side table and tossed me the morning paper i glanced down at it the story was there in bold headlines that ran halfacross the front page palestine flight foiled police prevent another plane leaving country illegally mystery of mr callahan it was all there in the opening paragraph of leaded type the whole wretched story i pushed the paper away and said why didnt you hand me over i spoke without looking up i had a peculiar sense of being trapped well talk about that later he said again he spoke as though he were talking to a child and suddenly anger came to bolster my courage what was he doing living alone up here on this deserted aerodrome tinkering about with a tudor in the dead of night why hadnt he rung the police he was playing some sort of catandmouse game with me and i wanted to get it over if it had to come let it come now right away i want you to call the police i said dont be a fool get some breakfast inside you youll feel better then but id got to my feet i want to give myself up my voice trembled it was part anger part fear there was something wrong with this place i didnt like it i didnt like the uncertainty of it i wanted to get it over sit down he too had risen and his hand was on my shoulder pressing me down nervous reaction thats all theres nothing wrong with my nerves i shook his hand off and then i was looking into his eyes and somehow i found myself back in my seat staring at my plate thats better what are you keeping me here for i murmured what are you doing up here well talk about it after breakfast i want to talk about it now after breakfast he repeated i started to insist but he had picked up the paper and ignored me a feeling of impotence swept over me almost automatically i picked up the knife and fork and as soon as id started to eat i realised i was hungry damnably hungry i hadnt had anything since midday yesterday a silence stretched over the table i thought of the trial and the prison sentence that must inevitably follow i might get a year possibly more after resisting arrest hitting a police officer and stealing a car the memory of those eighteen months in stalag luft came flooding back into my mind surely to god id had enough of prison life anything rather than be shut up again i looked across at saeton the sunlight was very bright and though i screwed up my eyes i couldnt see his expression his head was bent over the newspaper the quiet impassive way he sat there right opposite me gave me a momentary sense of confidence in him and as i ate a little flicker of hope slowly grew inside me when youve finished well go up to the hangar he lit a cigarette and turned to the inside of the paper he didnt look up as he spoke i hurried through the rest of the meal and as soon as id finished he got up put your jacket on he said ill get your shoes the air struck quite warm for november as we went out into the sunlight but there was a dank autumnal smell of rotting vegetation a berberis gleamed red against the gold of the trees and there were some rose bushes halfcovered with the dead stalks of bindweed it had been a little garden but now the wild had moved in we crossed the garden and entered a path leading through the woods it was cold and damp amongst the trees though the trunks of the silver birch saplings were dappled with sunlight the wood thinned and we came out on the edge of the airfield the sky was crystal clear bright blue with patches of cumulus the sun shone white on the exposed chalk of a dispersal point far away beyond the vast curve of the airfield a line of hills showed the rounded brown of downland grass the place was derelict with disuse the concrete of the runways cracked and sprouting weeds the buildings that dotted the woods halfdemolished into rubble the field itself all ploughed up for crops only the hangar fifty yards away to our left seemed solid and real whats the name of this airfield i asked saeton membury what are you doing living up here on your own he didnt answer and we continued in silence we turned the corner of the hangar and walked to the centre of the main doors saeton took out a bunch of keys and unlocked the wicket door that id pushed open the previous night inside the musty smell of concrete and the damp chill was familiar both the inboard engines of the plane were missing it had a sort of toothless grin saeton pressed his hand against the door till the lock clicked and then led the way to the back of the hangar where the workbench stretched along the wall sit down he said indicating a stool he drew up another with his foot and sat down facing me now then he took my wallet from his pocket and spread the contents on the oilblack wood of the bench your name is neil leyden fraser and youre a pilot correct i nodded he picked up my passport born at stirling in height fiveeleven eyes brown hair brown picture quite flattering compared with what you look like at the moment he flicked through the pages back and forth from the continent quite a bit he looked up at me quickly have you taken many planes out of the country i hesitated but there was no point in denying the thing three i said i see his eyes didnt move from my face and why exactly did you engage in this somewhat risky business look i said if you want to get me under crossexamination hand me over to the police why havent you done so already do you mind answering me that no im quite prepared to tell you why in a moment but until i have the answer to the question ive just asked i cant finally make up my mind whether to hand you over or not he leaned forward then and tapped my knee better tell me the whole thing im the one person outside of the organisers of your little racket who knows that youre the pilot calling himself callahan am i right there was nothing i could say i just nodded all right then either i can give you up or i can stay quiet that places me in the position of judge now why did you get mixed up in this business i shrugged my shoulders why the hell does anyone get mixed up in something illegal i didnt know it was illegal it wasnt at first anyway i was just engaged to pilot a director of a british firm of exporters his business took him all over western europe and the mediterranean he was a jew then they asked me to ferry a plane out they said it was being exported to a country where the british werent very popular and suggested that for the trip i used a name that was more international i agreed and on arrival in paris i was given papers showing my name as callahan it was a french plane yes i took it to haifa but why did you get mixed up with these people in the first place why the hell do you imagine i demanded angrily you know what it was like after the war there were hundreds of pilots looking around for jobs i finished as a wing co i went and saw my old employers a shipbuilding yard on the clyde they offered me a ј rise ј s a week i threw their offer back in their faces and walked out i was just about on my uppers when this flying job was offered to me i jumped at it so would you so would any pilot who hadnt been in the air for nearly a year he nodded his head slowly i thought itd be something like that are you married no engaged no any close relatives who might start making inquiries if neil eraser disappeared for a while i dont think so i answered my mothers dead my father remarried and im a bit out of touch with him why what about friends they just expect me when they see me what exactly are you driving at he turned to the bench and stared for a while at the contents of my wallet as though trying to make up his mind at length he picked up one of the dogeared and faded photographs i kept in the case this is what interested me he said slowly in fact its the reason i didnt ring the police last night and denied that id seen anything of you when they came this morning picture of you with waaf girlfriend on the back its got september self and june outside our old home after taking a postblitz cure he held it out to me and for the first time since id met him there was a twinkle in his eyes you look pretty tipsy the pair of you yes i said we were tight the whole place collapsed with us in it we were lucky to get out alive so i guessed it was the ruins that interested me your old home was a maintenance hangar wasnt it yes kenley aerodrome a lowflying daylight raid it pretty well blew the place to bits why i figured that if you could describe a maintenance hangar as your home in you probably knew something about aeroengines and engineering i didnt say anything and after staring at me for a moment he said impatiently well do you know anything about aeroengines or dont you yes i said practical or just theory given specifications and tools can you build an engine what are you getting at i asked what do you just answer my questions can you operate a lathe do milling grinding and boring screw cutting and drilling yes and then i added i dont know very much about jets but im pretty sound on all types of piston engines i see and youre a pilot yes when did you become a pilot in after i escaped from germany why i dont know i wanted a change in i was posted to bombers as flight engineer i started learning to fly then we were shot down i escaped early in and remembered enough about flying to pinch a jerry plane and crashland at an airfield back home shortly after that i got my wings he nodded vaguely as though he hadnt been listening he had turned slightly on his stool and was staring sombrely at the gleaming fuselage of the tudor his eyes caught a shaft of sunlight from the high windows and seemed to gleam with some inner fire then he turned back to me youre in a spot arent you it wasnt said unpleasantly more a statement of fact but ill make you a proposition see that engine over there i turned it stood against the wall and was chocked up on wooden blocks thats finished complete its handbuilt mostly right here in this hangar well thats one of them but theres got to be another before i can get this crate into the air he nodded towards the tudor its due to fly on the berlin airlift on th january fuel freighting weve got the tanks installed everythings ready all we need is a second engine weve started on it already but im pressed for time that first one took us six months and now carter whos been working on it with me is getting impatient im a pilot not an engineer if he walks out on me which is what he threatens to do ill have to pack up unless ive got somebody else to carry on he looked at me eyes narrowed slightly well what about it can you build another engine like that if necessary on your own i dont know i said i havent examined it and i dont know what equipment youve got my eyes roved quickly along the bench noting the lathes the racks of taps boxes of dies the turning tools the jigs and the welding equipment i should think i could i added good he got up as though it were settled and went over to the completed engine he stood there staring at it and then he turned away from it with a quick impatient movement of his shoulders as though throwing off something that was constantly at the back of his mind you wont get any pay free board and lodging beer cigarettes anything that is absolutely necessary youll work up here until the things complete after that well well see if things work out the way they should then you wont lack a permanent job if you want it you seem to be taking my acceptance rather for granted i said of course i am he said swinging round on me youve no alternative look just whats your racket i demanded im in enough trouble without getting deeper theres no racket he cut in angrily i run a company called saeton aircraft ltd and i rent these premises from the air ministry its all perfectly legal then why pick on a lonely spot like this and last night you were scared of something and you shouted at me in german why in german and who was the girl he came towards me then his head thrust forward his thick neck hard with the tautness of the muscles take my advice fraser accept my offer and dont ask questions his jaw was so tight that the words came through his teeth i had got to my feet now are you sure you havent pinched this plane i asked damn it he wasnt going to get me in a worse mess for a moment i thought he was going to strike me but instead he turned away with a little laugh no no i didnt pinch it he rounded on me and added violently nor this engine nor these tools all this equipment theres three years of my life in this hangar three years of sweating my guts out improvising struggling trying to make fools see that if only he stopped suddenly then in a voice into which he had forced mildness he said youve nothing to worry about fraser its all perfectly legal and once this plane is in the air and he was interrupted by someone banging on the hangar door he hesitated and then glanced at me that could be the police which is it to be complete the second engine for me or do i hand you over youll be quite safe up here in a day or so he added the banging on the door seemed to merge with the hammering of my heart the possibility of arrest which had gradually receded now became real and instant but i had already succumbed to a flicker of hope that had grown up inside me ill stay i said he nodded as though there had never been any doubt of it better nip into the fuselage you can hide in the toilet at the rear they wont think of looking for you there i did as he suggested and climbed into the fuselage in the dark belly of the plane i could just make out the shape of three large elliptical tanks up forard i heard the click of the door being opened and the sound of voices the door slammed to and for a moment i thought theyd left the hangar but then their footsteps were echoing on the concrete as they came down towards the bench there was the drone of a mans voice low and urgent then saeton cut him short ah right throw in your hand if you want to but well talk about it back at the quarters not here his voice was hard and angry for gods sake bill be reasonable im not throwing in my hand but we cant go on you know that as well as i do they had stopped close beside the fuselage the man was breathing heavily as though he were out of breath he had a slight cockney accent and his voice was almost pleading cant you understand im broke i havent a bean well nor have i saeton said harshly but i dont whine about it in three months from now its been two years already the other put in mildly do you think i dont know how long its been saetons voice softened listen tubby in three months well be on top of the world think of it man only three months surely to god you can pull in your belt and stick it as long as that after all weve been through together the other grunted but youre not married are you chum so your wifes been getting at you thats it is it i ought to have known it well if you think your wifes going to stop me from getting that plane into the air saeton had been lashing himself into a fury but he stopped suddenly lets go back to the quarters we cant talk here no the other said obstinately ill say what ive got to say here were going back to quarters saeton said gently well talk about it over a cup of tea no the other repeated still in the same obstinate tone well talk it over here and now if you dont mind im not going to have you rowing diana for something that isnt her diana saetons voice was suddenly harsh you havent brought her back shes down at the quarters now the other said stolidly at the quarters you bloody fool this is no place for a woman they cant keep their mouths shut and diana wont talk besides shes nowhere else to go i thought she was sharing a flat with a friend in london damn it man the other shouted cant you understand what im trying to tell you were broke im overdrawn by twenty quid and the bank has warned me ive got to settle my overdraft within three months what about your wife didnt she have a job she got fed up and chucked it and youre supposed to throw up all youve worked for just because shes bored thats typical of a woman if you can take it why cant she doesnt she understand its no good kicking at diana the other cut in shes not to blame shes stuck it pretty well if you ask me now its come to this either i find a job thatll bring us in some money so that we can live together like normal human beings or else i see you dont see at all the other snapped his voice rising on a note of anger all you can think of is the engines youre so crazy about them you dont behave like a human being at all well im not made that way im married and i want a home im not busting up my marriage because of your engines im not asking you to go to bed with them am i saeton snarled well all right if youre so in love with your matrimonial pleasures that you cant see the future thats within your grasp i think youd better withdraw that remark the mans voice was low and obstinate oh god saeton exploded all right i withdraw it but for christs sake tubby stop to think what youre doing it seemed to me it was about time i showed myself i slammed the toilet door and stomped across the steelsheeted floor of the plane from the open door of the fuselage i could see them standing staring up at me saetons companion was dressed in an old pair of grey flannels and leatherpatched sports jacket a round friendly little man with a shock of unruly hair his fresh ruddy complexion contrasted oddly with saetons hard leathery features by comparison he looked quite boyish though he was about my age little creases of fat crinkled the corners of his eyes giving them a permanent twinkle as though he were perpetually on the verge of laughter whos this he asked saeton neil fraser hes an engineer and hes come up here to work with us on that last engine my successor eh the other said quickly you knew id be leaving dont be a fool of course i didnt but i knew time was getting short with an extra hand how much are you paying him oh for gods sake saeton exclaimed angrily his keep thats all he turned to me fraser this is tubby carter he built the engine ive just shown you did you fix that toilet door yes i said its all right now i got down and shook carters hand fraser is an old friend of mine saeton explained carters small buttonbrown eyes fixed themselves on my face in a puzzled frown you look as though youve been in a rough house his eyes stared at me unwinking as i searched desperately for some reasonable explanation it was saeton who supplied the answer he got mixed up in some trouble at a nightclub but carters eyes remained fixed on my face neil fraser he seemed to be turning the name over in his mind and my heart sank suppose the police had discovered who callahan was after all id only seen one of the daily papers are you a pilot by any chance i nodded neil fraser his face suddenly lit up and he snapped his fingers bomber squadron you were the type who made a tunnel escape from prison camp and then pinched a messerschmitt and flew it back to england we met once remember at mildenhall he turned to saeton hows that for a photographic memory eh i never forget a face he laughed happily v saeton glanced at me with sudden interest then he turned to carter you stay here with fraser and talk over your boyhood memories im going to have a word with diana no you dont bill carter had caught his arm as he turned away this is between you and me you leave diana out of this saeton stopped its all right tubby he said and his voice was almost gentle i wont upset your wife i promise you but before she forces you into some deadend job she must be given the facts the situation has altered since you left on saturday with fraser here we can still get on to the airlift on schedule it took us six months to build that one carter nodded to the completed engine that included tests saeton answered and we came up against snags those have been ironed out now damn it surely shell have the sense to give you two months longer as for money leave that to me ill wring some more out of dick if i have to squeeze it out of him with my bare hands its a pity hes such a he stopped abruptly his lips compressed as though biting on the words you stay here ill talk to diana shes no fool no woman is when it comes to looking to the future weve got all the metal and castings all weve got to do is build the damned thing his eyes swung towards the plane then well have em all licked he stood staring at it as though by mere effort of will he could get it into the air then almost reluctantly his gaze came back to carter you can have that front room that used to be the office itll work out youll see she can do the cooking for us thatll keep her busy and itll give us more working time i tell you her minds made up carter said wearily saeton laughed it was a slightly cynical laugh no womans mind is ever made up he said theyre constructed for the purpose of having their minds made up for them how else do you imagine the human race survives carter stood quite still watching saeton as he left the hangar then he turned and went straight over to the end of the workbench by the telephone and took down a pair of overalls as he got into them he glanced at me curiously so youre an engineer he zipped up the front of the overalls then he went over to a small petrol engine and started it up were working on the pistons at the moment he pulled a big folder towards me across the bench and opened it out there were sheaves of fine pencil drawings here we are those are the specifications you can work a lathe i nodded he took me down the bench the lathe was an exraf type the sort wed had in the maintenance hangar at kenley the belt drive was running free with a quick movement of his hand he engaged it and at the same time picked up a halfturned block of bright metal okay then go ahead piston specifications fiveinch diameter seveninch depth threering channels two to be drilled for oil disposal and theres a threequarter inch hole for the gudgeonpin sleeve and for the love of mike dont waste metal this outfits running on a shoestring as youve probably gathered it was some time since id worked at a lathe but its a thing that once youve learnt you never forget he stood over me for a time and it made me nervous but as the shavings of metal ran off the lathe my confidence returned my mind ceased to worry about the events of the last twentyfour hours it became concentrated entirely in the fascination of turning a piece of mechanism out of a lump of metal i ceased to be conscious of his presence hands and brain combined to recapture my old skill and pride of craftsmanship took hold of me as the shape of the piston slowly emerged from the metal when i looked up again carter was leaning over the specifications his eyes staring at a bolt he was screwing in and out of a nut his mind was outside the shop worrying about his own personal problems he looked up and caught my eye then he threw the bolt down and came towards me i bent to my work again and for a time he stood watching me in silence at length he said how long have you known saeton i didnt know what to say so i didnt answer him saeton was a coastal command pilot the metal whirled under my hands thin silver slivers streaming from it i dont believe youve ever met him before in your life i stopped the lathe do you want me to balls this up i said he was fidgeting with the metal shavings i was just wondering he stopped then and changed his line of approach what do you think of him eh he was looking directly at me now hes mad of course but its the madness that builds empires i could see he worshipped the man there was a boys admiration in his voice he thinks hell lick every charter company in the country once he gets into the air theyre most of them on the verge of bankruptcy anyway i said he nodded ive been with him for two years now working in partnership you know we had one plane flying singleengined job but that crashed his fingers strayed back to the metal shavings hes a crazy devil incredible energy the hell of it is his enthusiasm is infectious when youre with him you believe what he wants you to believe did you hear what we were talking about when you were fixing that door tart of it i said guardedly he nodded absently my wifes got a will of her own shes american do you think hell persuade her to agree to give me three months more he picked up a block of metal destined to be the next piston hes right of course with the three of us working at it we ought to be able to complete the second engine in two months he sighed having come this far id like to see it through to the end this place has become almost a part of me he turned slowly and stared at the tailplane of the aircraft id like to see her flying i couldnt help him so i started the lathe again and he moved off along the bench and began work on an induction coil half an hour later saeton returned he came and stood over me as i measured the diameter of the pistonhead with a screw micrometer carter moved along the bench well he asked his voice hesitant oh she agrees saeton said his manner was offhand but when i glanced at him i saw that he was pale as though hed driven himself hard to get her agreement shell bring lunch up to us here carter stared at him almost unbelievingly then suddenly his eyes crinkled and his face fell into its natural mould of smiling good humour well im damned he said and went whistling down the bench back to his induction coil i see you know how to handle a lathe saeton said to me and then with sudden violence by god i believe well do it in a couple of months and then the phone rang he started and the light died out of his face as though he were expecting this call he went slowly down the bench and lifted the receiver his face gradually darkened as he bent over the instrument and then he shouted youre selling out on me dont be a fool dick of course i understand but wait a minute listen damn you ive got another man up here two months thats all im asking well six weeks then no of course i cant guarantee anything but youve got to hang on a bit longer in a couple of months well have it in the air surely you can hang on a couple of months all right if thats the way you feel but come down and see me first yes a thing like this needs talking over tomorrow then all right he replaced the receiver slowly was that dick carter asked saeton nodded yes hes had an offer for the aircraft and all the equipment here hes threatening to sell us up he picked up a stool and sent it spinning across the hangar god damn him why cant he understand were on the verge of success at last carter said nothing i returned to my lathe saeton hesitated and then seized hold of the folder of specifications for a moment he held it in his hands as though about to tear it across his face was dark with passion then he flung it down and went over to the engine standing on its blocks against the wall he pressed a switch and the thing roared into life a shattering earsplitting din that drowned all sound of my lathe and he stood watching it caressing it with his eyes as though all his world was concentrated in the live dinning roar of it chapter two as i worked at the lathe and the day wore on it slowly dawned on me what an incredible stroke of luck i had had it was as though i had been given another chance and this was legal i might not have taken saetons word for it but the presence of tubby carter proved there was nothing wrong with the setup he was so unquestionably honest with him working beside me the whole thing became ordinary matteroffact saeton was different it wasnt that i didnt trust the man but he was a human dynamo full of nervous violent energy the mercurial emotionalism of the celt seemed mixed with a saxon stolidity and singleness of purpose and i felt he was capable of anything he was a born leader with that vital spark that can kindle enthusiasm in others the type that can whip the dull heart of the mob into thundering passion his strength was that he didnt need the support of others it was all there inside him he showed that when he switched off the thundering din of that one engine and turned with a grim concentration to the job of winding the armature of a starter motor the structure of his life was crumbling about him his partner was selling him up but he didnt discuss it he threw himself into the work that littered the bench with the silent preoccupation of a man who can see the finished article in his minds eye something of his drive and purpose seemed to enter into the two of us as we worked beside him and the fascination of seeing a part of a complicated machine take shape under my hands so engrossed me that i lost all sense of time i didnt notice carters wife bring in our lunch saeton pushed a mug of tea and some sandwiches along the bench to me and i ate whilst i worked he and carter did the same the only interruption was just after wed switched on the light plant shortly after four there was a banging on the door saeton shouted to know who it was and a voice answered the police i looked up at him from the lathe my heart suddenly in my mouth i had so completely lost myself in the work that the reminder that the authorities were searching for me came as a shock saeton tossed me a flashmask put that on he ordered crisply the oxyacetylene equipment is at the end of the bench there i saw carter looking at me curiously then i had the mask on and was hurrying across to the oxygen cylinders by the time saeton came back with a police inspector and a sergeant i had the flame going and was cutting across a piece of scrap metal just routine the inspector said as he asked for our identity cards he glanced at them idly talking to saeton all the time thought wed take a look round membury before we packed it in but hell be out of the district by now probably out of the country in some private plane still well just take a look round in case quite a handy place an old aerodrome for a man to lie up he handed back our cards no fear of his pinching your plane anyway sir cant fly a plane with two of its engines missing can you no saeton answered and he didnt join in the inspectors goodhumoured laughter they left then and i put the flashmask aside and got back to my lathe with a feeling that the last hurdle had been overcome i was safe now so long as i remained at membury i was safe but as we worked on in the evening i was conscious of carter watching me periodically from the other end of the bench we knocked off at about eight i was pretty tired by then and i might have felt depressed but saeton clapped his hand on my shoulder youre a better acquisition than id dared to hope he said and that word of praise lifted me above physical tiredness its a pity though he added whats a pity carter asked that dick randall doesnt know anything about engineering he answered if he could understand just how much weve achieved in one single day with the three of us working without interruption for mealgetting then hed realise how close we are to success it was cold outside the hangar and the biting north wind made the cut on ray forehead ache as though the bone had been smashed back at the quarters there was a smell of roasting chicken we cleaned ourselves up and then gathered in the front room the trestle table had been covered it was only an old curtain but it gave it a more friendly air the table was laid for four saeton crossed to a cupboard and brought out glasses and a bottle of whisky i thought you were broke carter said saeton laughed only bankrupts can afford to be spendthrifts but though he laughed there was no laughter in his eyes no point in hoarding when randall may sell us out tomorrow the click of highheeled shoes sounded on the concrete of the passage outside and saeton sprang to open the door diana carter was such a contrast to her husband that she produced in me a sense almost of shock she was a product of the war a hard experiencedlooking woman with a wide overthick mouth and hennaed hair there was nothing homely about her she swept in a flash of red dirndl skirt and tawny hair with eyes that matched the green of her jersey and a motion of the body that was quite uninhibited her glance went straight to saeton and then fell to the bottle what are we celebrating bill her voice was deep and throaty with just the trace of an american accent the fact that were broke saeton answered handing her a glass randalls selling us up tomorrow then you and tubby can go and raise a family in peace she made a face at him and raised her glass youll talk him out of it she said but ill need some curtains tablecloths bedlinen and china im not going to live in a pigsty and were short of beds her gaze had fastened on me it was a curiously personal stare and her green eyes were a little too narrow a little too close saeton introduced us her eyes strayed to the adhesive tape across my forehead but all she said was where is he going to sleep ill fix him up saeton answered she nodded her gaze concentrated on him two months you said didnt you bill there was a sort of breathlessness about her that contrasted pleasantly with the essentially masculine atmosphere of the hangar and the gleam of excitement in her eyes made me think she found it more interesting keeping house for three men on this lonely airfield than sharing a flat in london with a girlfriend whos the girl that comes with the milk and eggs in the morning she asked oh she works at the farm saeton answered carelessly her name is else she behaved more like a campfollower than a landgirl she was looking at her husband as she said this but then she switched her gaze back to saeton yours really diana saeton picked up the bottle and refilled her glass have you managed to make the room opposite habitable after nearly a days work yes was she cook here before i came she came in and did things for us in the evening sometimes saeton admitted by arrangement with the farm i thought she looked at me like a cat that sees the cream whipped away from under her nose it wasnt said banteringly her tone was hard and her eyes searched her husbands face i guess i dug in my heels just in time there was a bitter clutching in her voice she was the sort of woman who would always be wanting the thing that had just been put out of her reach slowly she turned and faced saeton again is she foreign she has a queer way of talking saeton nodded yes shes german a dp her name is else langen he seemed reluctant to talk about her suppose we have some food now diana she nodded and finished her drink as she turned to go she paused so long as im here tell her to confine her activities to outside help saeton laughed ill tell her and he went on chuckling quietly to himself after diana had left the room as though at some private joke to my surprise diana proved to be a good cook the meal was excellent but before it was over the warmth of the oil stove and the whisky had made me drowsy id had a long day and not much sleep the night before and as they were planning to start work again at seven i decided to go straight to bed saeton fixed me up with a camp bed in one of the back rooms but for a long time i lay awake hearing the murmur of their voices it wasnt so much the cold that seeped up through the canvas of the bed that kept me awake as the fact that so much had happened since i had arrived at membury my mind was chockfull of halfdigested impressions all of them slightly fantastic like a dream but the thing that stood out in my mind was that this was the beginning of a new life for me i was safe up here at membury whatever the future of saetons outfit it served my purpose id stay here for a time and then when the hunt had died down id leave and get a job i wouldnt bother about flying id go back to engineering my days work had taught me that i was still an engineer and there was no shortage of jobs for engineers the only thing that worried me as i drifted off to sleep was that saetons company would pack up before it was safe for me to venture again into the outside world all that seemed to stand between it and failure was the personality of the man and yet somehow that seemed sufficient we breakfasted next morning at sixthirty diana got the meal for us an old blue dressinggown over her nightdress her face freshly madeup we ate in silence by the light of an oil lamp the threat of foreclosure hanging bleakly over the table like the reluctant daylight dianas eyes kept straying to saetons face as though searching for something there that she needed he didnt once look up he ate with the fierce concentration of a man to whom the act of feeding is a necessary interruption to the days work tubby carter on the other hand ate with a leisurely enjoyment as i went down the passage after breakfast to get my overalls i passed an open door and paused at the sight of a bed made up on the floor in the far corner hanging on the wall was the jacket saeton had worn the previous night the man had given me his own camp bed i dont know whether this had any direct bearing on my actions later but i know that at the time it made me feel part of a team and that from that moment i wanted saeton to win out and get his plane on to the airlift there was no hesitation when we reached the hangar no discussion we went straight on with the jobs we had left the night before but as we worked i was conscious of a mounting tension several times saeton paused and glanced impatiently at his watch a nerve twitched at the skin of his temple but he worked steadily unhurriedly as though the day stretched ahead with absolute security diana brought coffee shortly after eleven she tossed the morning paper to me with a little secret smile and then turned to saeton well hes here randall yes then why the devil didnt you bring him up here with you i told him to wait hes talking to that girl from the farm i thought youd like to know hes got someone with him someone with him he jerked round towards her a man yes what sort of a man short slightly bald with glasses and i dont want to know what he looks like whats his business i havent asked him she seemed to enjoy baiting him with the mystery well whats he look as though he does he asked angrily hes dressed in a dark suit and a homburg i guess he might be something in the city a lawyer maybe a lawyer my god dont say hes brought his solicitor with him go and tell them to wait ill be down right away and get rid of that girl he was scrambling out of his overalls cursing softly to himself as her heels clickclacked across to the door of the hangar when he had his jacket on he picked up a mug of coffee and drank it slowly as though steadying himself controlling the violence that seemed on the verge of erupting from him at length he turned to carter weve got to convince him tubby he said in a tight controlled voice the other nodded but dont lose your temper bill like you did last time it only makes him stutter if he was an engineer well hes not an engineer saeton snapped hes just a jerk thats been left fifty thousand by an adoring aunt he thrust his hands into his pockets all right i wont lose my temper provided he shows some sense he turned then and walked quickly out of the hangar as though he were going to something unpleasant and wanted to get it over carter watched him go and then shrugged his shoulders trouble is every time he meets randall he acts as though hes a steam hammer driving sense into a block of pig iron whats randall like i asked i wasnt really interested this was none of my business i had picked up the paper and was searching through it for a followup to the callahan story of the previous day oh hes not a bad fellow really got more money than sense thats all i had found what i wanted now a paragraph on an inside page stating that the police believed callahan had left the country i folded the paper and laid it on the bench there was nothing for me to worry about i looked across at carter why does randall want to sell up i asked carter shrugged bored i suppose hes not really interested in aircraft horse racing is what he lives for besides three years is a long time i glanced at the plane and then back again to carter there was something here i didnt understand it had been at the back of my mind and now that i didnt have to worry about myself any more it came to the fore it doesnt take three years to get a plane into the air i said carter looked up at me guardedly hasnt saeton told you anything about these engines i thought you were an old friend of his i didnt pursue the matter but turned back to the lathe it must have been about half an hour later that saeton came in his face dark with anger with him was a tall erectlooking man with a brushedup ginger moustache and rather prominent eyes he wore tweed trousers and a cloth cap and the open neck of his sheepskin jacket was filled with a brilliant blue and cold silk scarf behind them trotted a soft plump little nan with a briefcase saeton went straight over to carter you can pack up work on that induction coil tubby were through his voice was hard and vicious carter sat back on his stool still holding the coil in his hands as though he didnt want to let it go and stared at randall unbelievingly doesnt he understand we only need two more months he asked saeton with fraser here ive told him all that saeton cut in but were not dealing with randall were dealing with mr reinbaum here he nodded to the plump little man whose white fingers were fidgeting with the lock of his briefcase he holds the mortgages i dont understand carter said slowly those mortgages were given to dick as security for money he advanced to the company how does this fellow reinbaum come into it randall cleared his throat awkwardly i borrowed money on the mortgages he said well surely if you repay the money weve been over all this saeton cut in impatiently randall has lost heavily betting the word came out with an explosive violence reinbaum has received an offer for the plane and all our tools and equipment and randall has agreed to close it is out of the question that we should receive a better offer reinbaum said he had a soft slightly foreign voice the offer saeton said harshly is twentyfive thousand for the whole box of tricks thats just two thousand more than the mortgages but that means winding up the company carter said randall cant do that unless one of us agrees together we outvote him under the articles of the company please mr carter reinbaum interrupted it is not a question of voluntary liquidation you mean your going to force us into liquidation carter asked and there as an obstinate note in his voice that made me suddenly respect him the damnable part of it is saeton said angrily that when randall advanced us that last five thousand his solicitor insisted that since it was for material for building the engines the engines themselves must be included in the mortgage he swung round on randall by god he said if it wasnt that id swing for it id he turned quickly and started to pace up and down his hands clenched as he fought down the fury that mottled his features he stopped as he came face to face with the completed engine then he reached up to the wall and pressed the starter switch the engine turned coughed twice and roared into life thev hangar shook to the thundering din of it he turned to randall come here dick he shouted look at it feel the power of it that engine is ready for installation he waved his thick hand at the bench the second is already taking shape in a month it will be finished in six weeks well be on test and on the th january well be on the airlift in two months youll be director of a company owning the most talkedof plane in the world think of it saeton aircraft freighter slashes fuel costs my god man havent you any ambition well make a fortune and all im asking you for is two months youve carried the company for nearly three years another two months isnt much to ask so that was it saeton had something new in engine design something that would reduce fuel consumption his wasnt the first company that had come to grief trying to pursue this particular mirage and yet the vibrance in his voice the sheer gripping enthusiasm of the man carried conviction i stared at randall surely he would give saeton those two months i wanted to see those engines finished now i wanted to see them in the air to see them tested if saeton succeeded but randall was shaking his head im ssorry bill he was stuttering now in his embarrassment im ppretty well cleaned out you know you mean youve lost so heavily you cant buy those mortgages back saeton was staring at him hard randall nodded but what about your horses your car that house down at hatfield the other stared at him but dash it he exclaimed i cant sell the house its been in the family for generations and i wont sell my horses his face was flushed and there was an obstinate look in his eyes im sorry bill he said again but youve had all the money youre going to get out of me my solicitor warned me against oh damn your solicitor saeton shouted cant you understand that in two months time he didnt finish he had seen the obstinate look in randalls eyes and he turned away in disgust his hand reached out and switched off the engine the din gradually died away saetons hand tightened on the boss where the propeller would be fitted as he turned slowly and faced reinbaum so it comes to this were dealing direct with you mr reinbaum is that correct his voice was quiet and controlled reinbaum beamed and bowed slightly what are your terms for allowing us to continue with the fitting out of the plane reinbaum shook his head im sorry mr saeton i do not speculate ive given you some idea of what were doing here saeton said surely we can come to some arrangement the offer i have for your plane and the equipment here is conditional on acceptance within fortyeight hours reinbaum spread his hands in a little apologetic gesture unless you can pay what is due on the mortgages i must foreclose you know damn well we cant pay in two months i want the money now mr saeton the softness was leaving reinbaums voice but if you wait two months saetons voice was desperate two months isnt long in two months time ill have all the backing i repeat if you cannot pay what is due then reinbaum shrugged his shoulders saeton turned away and in the light from the high windows i caught a glint of tears in his eyes he went slowly over to the bench and stood there fiddling with the armature hed spent so many laborious hours winding his back towards us well i think that is settled then reinbaum said glancing up at randall whose face was stiff and wooden we had better go now major in a flash i saw my refuge up here on this aerodrome disappearing but it wasnt only that i believed in saeton i wanted to see these engines in the air the money i had made ferrying planes and on currency deals wasnt honest money i didnt care what happened to it probably it would be better if i threw it away and i might as well throw it away on this just a moment i said as reinbaum and randall were turning away is it one of the mortgages that has fallen due randall shook his head no its the interest on them the interest on them i exclaimed how much eleven hundred and fifty randall murmured i turned to saeton cant you raise that i said you could sell something he shook his head theres nothing here that isnt essential he said dully if we sold any part of the equipment we couldnt go on besides its all mortgaged everything in this hangar is mortgaged but surely youve got some money of your own i persisted blast you he shouted swinging round on me you dont have to hammer the truth of this home to me i dont possess any money at all for the past month weve lived on credit my bank account is overdrawn to the tune of more than a hundred pounds carter is in the same boat and dont for gods sake start asking me if i havent any friends i havent any friends to the tune of eleven hundred quid he turned to randall and reinbaum now get the hell out of here the pair of you take what action you like they turned to go just a minute i called to them the amount is eleven hundred and fifty it was reinbaum who answered the exact amount is eleven hundred and fiftytwo pounds four shillings and sevenpence then perhaps you would make me out a receipt i said i had got my wallet out and was extracting my cheque book he stood there staring at me as though a pit had suddenly opened at his feet a receipt please mr reinbaum i repeated he came slowly towards me how do i know that your cheque will be honoured i do not give a receipt you have the law to protect you in a case like that i said can i see the documents proving that you are the legal possessor of these mortgages i was enjoying myself enjoying the sudden surprised silence that descended on the hangar nobody spoke and reinbaum stared at me with baffled eyes for some reason he didnt want to be paid i thought of how i had got that money and i was suddenly glad id ferried those planes somehow this made the racket worth while saeton was the first to come to life just a minute fraser apart from the fact that i cant allow you to do this it wont help you know we owe money also weve got to be carried for two months i realise that i said whats the absolute minimum that will carry you to the flying stage he hesitated about another thousand his voice suddenly took on new life you see weve got the metal and the castings weve got everything all we need is to cover some of the bills thatll come in and our living his sudden excitement faded and his words stopped to carry us and pay the interest on these mortgages youve got to have nearly two thousand five hundred i sat down and wrote out reinbaums cheque who shall i make it out to i asked him weiner reinbaum and company he answered sullenly as i entered the amount on the cheque counterfoil saeton touched my shoulder have you really got two thousand five hundred in your account he asked almost unbelievingly not in my account i answered but with my life policy im good for that much he didnt say anything but his hand gripped my shoulder for a moment i checked the documents reinbaum reluctantly produced from his briefcase then i gave him the cheque and got his receipt all this time saeton had been standing over us and as the little man straightened up he said it was the engines you wanted wasnt it reinbaum there was a dangerous quietness about his voice i do not want anything reinbaum answered him only the moneys but i dont think he expected saeton to believe him for he added quickly my clients are interested in the charter business and who exactly are your clients saeton asked in the same quiet voice i am sorry i cannot tell you that saeton took him gently by the collar it was the engines they wanted wasnt it somebody tipped them off that you held the mortgages he turned to randall had you borrowed on these mortgages when you were down here last in october he asked im not sure randall answered unwillingly possibly did you mention it to anyone else for instance randall flushed i may have done i cant remember i you tell a stray dp and you dont tell me saetons face was white with anger and youre a director of my company my god he picked little reinbaum up by his collar with his two hands and shook him who are these clients of yours he shouted and i thought hed break the little man apart reinbaums spectacles fell to the ground his plump white hand moved agitatedly with a flash of gold please he cried i will have the police oh no you wont saeton laughed through his clenched teeth youve no friends here theyll swear i never laid a finger on you now then who are your clients he shook the man till he screamed and then he flung him away like a discarded sack reinbaum stumbled caught his foot against a stool and went sprawling on to the dusty concrete well saeton demanded standing over him the man was fumbling blindly for his glasses saeton kicked them over to him and then picked up the briefcase searching through it strewing the papers hed discarded over the floor he found what he wanted in the end holding it up his eyes darkening with anger as heread it my god he exclaimed so thats it he stuffed the letter into the pocket of his jacket and stared down at reinbaum how did they discover id got the prototype he demanded how did they know that he turned away as reinbaum shook his head obstinately all right it doesnt matter he tossed the briefcase and the rest of the papers on to the mans prostrate body now get out reinbaum seized hold of the case bundled the documents into it and fled well thats that saeton said he was standing there in the centre of the hangar like a bull that has disposed of one matador and is glaring round in search of the next his gaze fixed on randall do you realise what youve done you bloody nearly his mouth clamped shut and he came steadily down the hangar youre not fit to be a director of a company he stopped and randall muttered inarticulate apologies sit down saeton said his voice shaking with anger now write me out a letter of resignation suppose i refuse to resign randalls face was pale and though his head was turned towards saeton his eyes slid away from him refuse to resign there were white patches under saetons eyes whilst weve been slaving our guts out up here to build something worth while what have you been doing gambling gambling with the future of my company well carter and i arent working twentyfour hours a day to make a fortune for a man who has never done a thing to help us who thats not true randall answered who brought the thing out of germany in the first place youd never have got it back here unless id smuggled it out in one of my vehicles whos paid for all the development work every time youve asked for money its all covered by those mortgages saeton cut in his voice suddenly quiet youve never risked a penny whilst carter and i have sunk everything we had without security the company owes you nothing except a fee for smuggling the prototype out and ill see youre paid for that as for the mortgages its not my fault youve borrowed on them and gambled away the proceeds he paused for breath youve only yourself to blame dick he added almost gently he pulled a pen out of his pocket and pushed it into randalls hand i suggest pressure of other business randall hesitated but saeton was standing over him and there was something compelling in the quietness of the man the whiteness of his face randall glanced up once and then the pen was scratching at the paper carter had thrust in front of him as soon as randall had signed it saeton took it from him glanced at it quickly and then slipped it into his pocket and now for gods sake get reinbaum off the airfield before i murder the little bastard randall stood up hesitating as he faced us i thought for a moment he was going to say something but the hostile silence was too much for him he turned away and we watched him go heard the door click shut and then we were alone in the hangar saeton pulled out his handkerchief and mopped his face christ he said i didnt expect to come out of that with the company still intact his gaze came round to me about the luckiest thing i ever did was to tell you you could stay on up here he rubbed his hands and his voice was suddenly cheerful as he said well that leaves us short of the necessary three directors tubby i suggest therefore as an acknowledgment of our gratitude to him for saving the company in its hour of need we invite mr fraser to join the board relief had brought a hint of laughter to his voice will you second that tubby carter glanced quickly across at me i was conscious of a fractional hesitation and then he said yes i second that saeton came over and clapped me on the shoulder youre now a director of saeton aircraft ltd entitled to a yearly salary of ј he gave a quick laugh its never been paid yet and then he added but some day soon now he stopped his voice had become serious fraser i cant thank you enough god knows why you did it but he gripped my hand i cant tell you his voice broke off as though the words he sought were inadequate and he just stood there wringing my hand why did you do it eh why he was suddenly laughing i cant forget little reinbaums face when you asked him for that receipt he laughed till the tears ran down his face then with a quick change to brusqueness well why did you do it i dont quite know i answered awkwardly i wanted to thats all i turned away embarrassed by the sudden emotionalism in his voice there was a moments silence and then he said abruptly well lets get back to work the sense of purpose was back in his eyes now and it gave me an odd feeling of closeness to him as i went over to my lathe and picked up the halfcompleted piston but somehow i couldnt concentrate randalls words came between me and my work id been caught out in a racket once and i didnt want any more of it if they were smuggling foreign patents i switched off the lathe and went over to saeton he was seated on a stool working on the armature again with the fierce concentration of a man who holds the future in his hands he looked up at me as i stood over him well what is it he asked impatiently i want all the cards on the table i said i dont like working in the dark not any more he stared at me his jaw clamped shut an angry frown creasing his forehead i watched the thick hand lying on the bench slowly clench into a fist his eyes had hardened and narrowed with the clenching of his hand i was looking at the man who had hit me two nights ago in the woods on the edge of the airfield well i hesitated but i had to know where i stood the hours i had spent working at that lathe had given me a new sense of confidence in myself come on man lets have it he snapped whats on your mind this aero engine of yours i nodded to the gleaming bulk standing against the wall on its wooden chocks you didnt design it did you so thats it you think ive filched somebody elses design do you i didnt say that i answered feeling suddenly uncertain under the cold anger of his gaze i simply want to know whether you designed it of course i didnt design it he snapped youre not a fool you know damn well i dont know enough about engineering to design an aero engine he had risen slowly to his feet and was standing in what seemed to be a characteristic attitude legs slightly straddled head thrust forward i suppose now youve bought your way into the thing you think youre entitled to throw your weight about the violence died out of him and in a milder tone he added if you must know its a bit of wartime loot one day ill tell you the whole story but not now who owns the patent i asked i do he snapped the prototype was never completed for a man in your position youve a devilish sensitive conscience he sat down abruptly for gods sake lets get on weve wasted enough time already i had barely got back to my lathe when there was a knock at the door of the hangar see who it is fraser saeton said if its randall i wont talk to him but it wasnt randall it was diana and with her was a girl in a faded brown smock i knew her at once she was the girl who had been talking with saeton in the hangar that first night i had come to membury she had recognised me too for she caught her breath and stared at me as though i were something unexpected and her broad forehead contracted in a frown that gave her pleasant quiet features a brooding look she wants to see bill diana said i pulled open the door and they came in the girl hesitating over the sill as though she feared a trap then she was walking down the hangar her head erect her shoulders squared saeton looked up saw her and jumped to his feet what the devil are you doing here his thick eyebrows were dragged down his body tense the girl didnt flinch her eyes roved quickly along the bench they were wide intelligent eyes and they seemed to miss nothing finally they came to rest on the completed engine and their expression seemed to change to soften did you bring her here diana saetons voice was harsh yes she wanted to see you i dont care who she wanted to see he stormed get her out of here he got control of himself and turned to me take her outside and find out what she wants i wont have people walking in and out of this place as though it were a railway station but almost immediately he changed his mind all right ill talk to her he strode down the hangar the girl hesitated her eyes lingering a moment on the litter of the work bench then she turned and followed him thats a queer girl diana said to her husband when randall was here she hung around the quarters like a cat on hot bricks after a time she went out on to the airfield and the next i saw of her she came flying through the woods her face white and her eyes wet with tears had she been in a concentration camp or something her father died in one carter answered thats all i know saeton came back then his face angry the muscles at the side of his jaw swollen with the clenching of his teeth what did she want diana asked he didnt appear to hear her question he strode straight past her and seated himself at the bench again will you bring lunch for the three of us up here at onethirty he said diana hesitated but his manner didnt encourage questions all right she said and left the hangar i turned back to my lathe but all the time i was trying to remember the scrap of conversation id overheard that night in the hangar twice i glanced at saeton but each time his expression stopped me from putting the question that was on the tip of my tongue at length i said who is that girl his head jerked up that was else he said what was her fathers work his fist crashed down on the bench you ask too many damned questions he shouted i felt the shock of his violence as though it was a physical blow and went quickly over to the lathe but a moment later he was at my side im sorry neil he said quietly dont worry if i lose my temper now and then his hand reached out and gripped my arm and he waved his free hand to the litter of parts on the bench i feel sometimes as though these were my organs and i was being slowly manufactured and pieced together if anything happened to prevent the completion of the whole thing he didnt finish and the grip on my arm slowly relaxed im a bit tired thats all itll be like this until were in the air chapter three time stood still for me on membury aerodrome in the weeks that followed november slid into december and i scarcely noticed it we rose at six and started work at seven there was coffee around eleven and we had our lunch and our tea at the work bench breakfast and dinner were the only meals we had back at the quarters dinner anywhere between seventhirty and nine according to how the work ran tempers were short and the working hours long and though diana carter talked about prince charles and the fighting in palestine and the opening of tegel airport it meant nothing to me for i didnt read the papers my life was the cold grey cavern of the hangar i lived and dreamed engineering and the world outside membury ceased to exist and yet through it all ran a thread of pure excitement saeton never gave me a briefing on the engines he left me to find out for myself and as the satan mark ii which was what he called it took shape under our hands my sense of excitement mounted the difference lay mainly in the system of ignition and the method of fuel injection highpressure injectors delivered filtered fuel to the combustion chambers injector timing replaced ignition timing and there was a complicated system for metering the fuel the flow having to be adjusted constantly in relation to altitude it was essentially a compression ignition motor and though it was a long way removed from the diesel design it was soon clear to me that the man who had made the original design must have been a diesel expert it took us just over five weeks to build that second engine and all the time it was a race our skill against my bank balance with the airlift date looming ever nearer it was a queer life the four of us alone up on that derelict airfield held there by saetons tenacity and the gradual emergence of that second engine i got to know tubby carter and his wife well and they were as different as two people could be maybe that was why they had got married i dont know they were an oddly assorted pair tubby was a stolid unimaginative man round of face and round of figure with rolls of fat across his stomach and sides that gave him the appearance of a mansized cupid when stripped his nature was happy and friendly he was one of the nicest men i have ever met and one of the most uninteresting outside of flying and engineering he knew nothing of the world accepting it and ignoring it so long as it let him get on with his job what had caused this unenterprising son of a lancashire poultry farmer to take to flying i never discovered he had started in a blacksmiths shop and when that closed down he had got a job in a foundry producing farm equipment he was one of those men who shift along on the tide of life and the tide had drifted him into a motor factory and so into the engineering side of the aircraft industry that he had started to fly because he wanted to would have been quite out of character i imagine it just happened that way and his stolidity would have made him an ideal flight engineer in any bomber crew when i think of tubby it is of a happy child whistling gently between his teeth he was like a fat cheerful mongrel something of a cross between airedale and pug his eyes were brown and affectionate and if hed had a tail it would have wagged every time anybody spoke to him but when i think of him as a man then it is only his hands i remember his hands were long and slender and quite hairless like the rest of him very different from saetons hands give those hands a piece of metal and ask them to produce something out of it and he grew to mans stature in an instant all his being concentrated in his fingers his face wreathed in a smile that crinkled his eyes and his short fat lips pursed as he whistled endlessly at the work he was a born engineer and though he was a child in other respects he had a streak of obstinacy that took the place of initiative once he had been persuaded on a course of action nothing would deflect him it was this tenacity that made one respect as well as like him his wife was so different it was almost unbelievable her father had been a railroad construction engineer he had been killed when she was seventeen crushed by a breakdown crane toppling on its side in those seventeen years she had travelled most of america and had acquired a restless taste for movement and the atmosphere of the construction camps her mother who had been halfitalian had died in childbirth and diana had been brought up in a masculine world she had many of a mans qualities a decisiveness the need of a goal to aim for and a desire for strong leadership she was also a woman with a good deal of the hot passion of the italian after her fathers death she became a nurse and when pearl harbor came she was one of the first to volunteer for overseas service she had come to england as a waac in and had been stationed at a b station near exeter that was where she had met tubby they had met again in france and had been married at rouen in later she had worked for a short time in the malcolm club organisation whilst tubby was flying with transport command i have said that she was a hard experiencedlooking woman certainly that was my first impression but then i had expected somebody altogether younger and softer she was several years older than tubby and her life had not been an easy one her brother had been working for the opel people in germany and with no family and no friends she had been very much on her own in the big hospital in new york she would never talk about this period she had endless stories to tell of the railroad camps and of her service life in britain france and germany but i never heard her talk of her life in that new york hospital tubby she treated rather as a child i learned later that she had had an operation that had made it impossible for her to have any children of her own whether this had anything to do with it i dont know but i do know this that right from the start she was fascinated by saeton she breathed in the atmosphere of drive and urgency that he created as though it were life itself i had a feeling that in him she found all the excitement and her girlhood again as though he recreated for her the life she had led with her father on the railroads of america but though i got to know these two well saeton himself remained a mystery what his background was i never discovered it was as though he had sprung like a phoenix from the flames of war complete with his looted engine and the burning dream of a freighter fleet tramping the airways of the world hed talk and hed conjure visions but he never talked about himself he had been a test pilot before the war he knew south america particularly brazil and hed flown for an oil company in venezuela hed done some gold prospecting in south africa but as to who his family were what they did and where hed been born and brought up i still have no idea nor have i any knowledge of how he came to be a pilot he was the sort of person that you accept as a finished article his personality was sufficient in itself i felt no urge to rummage around the backstairs of his life he seemed to have no existence outside of the engines he even slept with them after that scene with randall as though he were afraid an attempt might be made to steal them when he had warned me that his temper would be short until we were in the air it was no understatement his moods were violent and when nervous or excited he used his tongue like a battering ram i remember the day after i had promised to finance the company he came up to me as i was working at the lathe i think you agreed to cover us over the building period his voice was angry almost belligerent i want some money i began to apologise for not having settled the financial details with him before but he cut me short i dont want your apologies i want a cheque the rudeness of his tone jolted me but it was typical of the man and if i expected deference on account of my financial standing in the company he made it clear i wasnt going to get it he wanted the money right away to meet some bills and i had to go back to the quarters for my cheque book that was how i first came into real contact with else the fifth character in this extraordinary story she was standing at the entrance to the quarters calling for diana shes just taken coffee up to the hangar i said the girl turned at the sound of my voice she wore the same brown overall that shed worn the previous day when diana had brought her to the hangar and in her hands she held four very still but sharpeyed fowls i have bring these she said making a slight movement of her hands that caused the one cockerel to beat his wings angrily i didnt know we were having a feast tonight i said no no mrs carter starts to keep chicken for you i think the girls voice with its marked foreign accent was like a breath of the old life a reminder of brief meetings in bars and hotel bedrooms that is all in the way of memories that most pilots take out of the cities where they touch down shell be back in a minute i said if you and the chickens can wait i started to move through the door and then stopped and we stood there for a moment smiling at each other not saying anything you are partners with mr saeton now she said at last yes she nodded and her gaze strayed to the trees that screened us from the hangar her face was rather square the cheekbones high the skin pale and dappled with freckles her nose tipped up slightly at the end as though shed pressed it too often against windows as a kid she wore no makeup and her eyebrows were thick and fair like the untidy mop of her hair that blew in the wind she turned to me slowly and her lips parted as though she were about to say something but she just stood there looking up at me with a frown as though by staring at me she could resolve some riddle that puzzled her her eyebrows were dragged down at the corners and her eyes shifted from the adhesive tape on my forehead to meet mine with a direct level gaze they were the colour of mist in a mountain valley a soft grey what were you doing up at the hangar the other night i had asked the question without thinking her lips moved slightly at the corners she had a very mobile mouth perhaps i ask you why you run away eh for an instant i thought she had connected me with the police inquiries in the neighbourhood but then she asked are you an engineer and i knew it was all right yes i said and you work on the engines with mr saeton i nodded then perhaps we meet again yes she smiled and thrust the birds into my hands will you please give these to mrs carter she halfturned to go and then hesitated when you do not know what to do with yourself perhaps you come and talk with me it is very lonely up here sometimes she turned then and walked across the clearing and as i watched her disappear amongst the trees i felt excitement singing through my blood the story of else langen was a jigsaw puzzle that i had to piece together bit by bit i asked saeton about her that night but all hed say was that she was a german dp yes but whats her story i persisted tubby says her father died in a concentration camp he nodded well i asked his eyes narrowed why are you so interested in her he demanded have you been talking to the girl i had a few words with her this morning i admitted well keep clear of her why because i tell you to he growled i dont trust her but you had her cooking here for you that was he stopped and his jaw stiffened have some sense he added the girls german and this engine were working on was first designed in germany is that why youre sleeping up at the hangar now i asked are you suggesting that the girl im not suggesting anything he snapped im just telling you to keep clear of her or is it too much to expect you to keep your hands off a woman for five weeks the sneer in his voice brought me to my feet if you think oh for gods sake neil sit down all im asking you to do is not to get talking to anyone outside of the four of us here for your sake as well as mine he added pointedly i might have taken his advice if the monotony of our life hadnt got on my nerves perhaps monotony is the wrong word it was tension really the work itself was exciting enough but we never relaxed the four of us were cooped up together never leaving the aerodrome always in the same atmosphere of pressure always in each others company within a fortnight the strain was beginning to tell tubby ceased to whistle at the bench and his round cheerful face became morose almost sulky diana did her best but her chatter was hard and brittle against the solid background of long hours in the hangar saeton became impossible tense and moody flying into a rage at the slightest provocation or at nothing at all the atmosphere got on my nerves i had to find some relaxation and automatically it seemed i began thinking of else more and more often it is very lonely up here sometimes i could see the lift of her eyebrows the smile in her eyes and the slight spread of the corners of her mouth when you do not know what to do with yourself the invitation couldnt have been plainer i brooded over it at my work and particularly i brooded over dianas suggestion that the girl had been a campfollower saeton hadnt denied it in the end i asked tubby about it i wasnt interested in her if thats what you mean he answered i dont go for foreign women what about saeton i asked bill he shrugged his shoulders i wouldnt know and then he added almost viciously they all fall for him hes got something that appeals to women and she fell for him she was always around before diana came he glanced up at me from the fuel pump he was assembling and his eyes crinkled the monastic life getting you down well you shouldnt have much trouble with else randall used to take her out in his car when he visited us up here it was a warm soft night despite a clear sky and after dinner i said id take a stroll saeton looked across at me quickly but he said nothing and a moment later i was striding through the still dampness of the woods my heart suddenly light with the sense of relief at escaping at last from the atmosphere of the aerodrome a track ran from the quarters down to the road and a little farther on i found the gates of the manor a light shone through the trees and the gentle putter of an electric light plant sounded across the silence of the lawns an owl flapped like a giant moth to the shelter of the trees i went round to the side of the house and through an uncurtained window saw else standing over a table rubbing salt into a large ham her sleeves were rolled up and her face was flushed she was a big wellbuilt girl with a full bosom and wide shoulders she looked soft and pleasant working there in that big kitchen and i found myself tingling with the desire to touch her to feel the warm roundness of her body under my hands i stood there for quite a while watching her liking the capable movements of her hands and the glowing concentration of her features at length i moved to the door and knocked she smiled when she saw who it was so you have become bored eh i thought you might like to come for a walk i said its a warm night a walk she looked up at me quickly yes why not come into the kitchen whilst i go and dress myself in some clothes it was a big kitchen warm and friendly with bacon hanging from hooks in the ceiling and bunches of dried herbs and a smell of chicken you like cream she produced a bowl full of thick cream a loaf of bread and some homemade jam help yourself please i will be one minute that is all i hadnt tasted cream in years and i was still eating when she returned you like to take some back with you mrs ellwood will not mind she is a very ospitable woman no no thanks i should have to explain to saeton where it had come from she looked at me with a slight frown but she made no comment come i take you to the pond it is very funny there at night the frogs croak and there are many wild things we went round behind the outbuildings through the farmyard and out into a grass field there are mushrooms here in the autumn what is your name neil fraser do you like working at the airfield yes i spoke without thinking conscious only of her nearness and of the fact that she hadnt hesitated to come out with me it is going well i hope yes very well when will you have finished the engines i took her hand her fingers were warm and soft in mine she raised no objection well im sorry i said what was it you asked when will you finish when do you fly i dont know i said in about a month so soon she fell silent we were in the woods again now on a path that ran downhill the night air rustled gently among the tall spearlike shafts of the osiers i tightened my grip on her hand but she didnt seem to notice for she asked if i were a flier and then began to talk about her brother who had been in the luftwaffe where is he now i asked she was silent for a moment and then she said he is dead he was shot down over england she glanced up at me her face serious do you think we shall ever be at peace germany and england were at peace now i answered oh now now you are the victors you occupy us with your troops but it is not peace there is no treaty germany is not permitted to join any international organisation we cannot trade everything is taken from us i didnt say anything i wasnt interested in a political argument i didnt want to be reminded that she was german i just wanted her companionship her warmth the feel of her close to me the screen of osiers parted and we were looking down a steep bank to a dew pond it was fringed with reeds and the still surface in the centre was like a plate of burnished pewter reflecting the stars it is beautiful here yes the cry of a night bird jarred the stillness and a frog croaked the stillness and the wintry beauty of it brought the blood hammering to my throat i reached out and caught her by the shoulder twisting her round so that her neck lay in the curve of my arm then i bent and kissed her for a moment she was limp in my arms her lips soft and open against mine then her body became rigid and her mouth tightened she fought me off with a sudden and intense fury for a moment we struggled but she was strong and my passion subsided with the obstinacy of her resistance and i let her go you you she stood there speechless panting with the effort she had made because i am german and you are english you think i should lie on my back for you verfluchter kerl ich hasse sie she turned tears of anger on her face and fled up the path in an instant the screen of osiers had swallowed her and i was alone by the pond with the protesting croak of the frogs saeton was just leaving when i got back to the quarters what have you been up to he said looking up at me from under his shaggy eyebrows that cut of yours has opened up again i put my hand to my forehead and my fingers came away sticky with blood else must have scratched the scab as she fought me off its nothing i said a branch of a tree caught me thats all he grunted and went out into the night towards the hangar as i passed the door of the carters home i heard diana say all right but any time i like the malcolm club will i was back in the tense atmosphere of our own little world and id destroyed my one chance of escape i went to bed feeling depressed and angry with myself for else had been right i had treated her as though she were a piece of occupied territory to be bought for a bar of chocolate the next day we had visitors diana rang through on the field telephone theres an raf officer here and a mr garside of the ministry of civil aviation they want to speak to bill i had answered the phone and i passed on the message to saeton he jumped to his feet as though id cracked a stock whip tell her theyre not to come up here ill see them over at the quarters he searched quickly along the bench picking up odd parts that lay amongst the junk at the back tubby take these out the back somewhere and hide them go over the whole bench and see that theres nothing left of the old engine here ill hold them at the quarters for five or ten minutes they may only have come to check over the plane prior to airworthiness tests tubby said maybe but im taking no chances youd better keep in the background neil he hurried out of the hangar and tubby searched frantically along the bench picking up parts and stuffing them into a canvas tool bag i stood watching him wondering whether my identity had been discovered tubby had barely returned from hiding the bag when saeton brought the two men into the hangar these are my two engineers he said carter and fraser tubby this is wingcommander felton raf intelligence and garside civil aviation well now what exactly do you want to look at saeton was forcing himself to be genial but i could see by the way his head was hunched into his shoulders that he was angry well if you did take it i dont imagine youd be fool enough to leave the prototype lying about the raf officer said wed like to have a look at the design youre working on im sorry saeton said thats the one thing i cant allow you to do you can have a look at the finished engine but the design remains secret until were in the air youre not being very helpful the intelligence officer said why should i be saeton demanded angrily german company complains that an english concern is working on a pet project of their own and immediately they have the support of our own people and you come rushing up here to investigate as far as im concerned the germans can stew in their own juice felton replied but theyve persuaded control commission the matter needs investigating my instructions come from bafo hq garside here is acting at the direct request of control commission have the rauch motoren sent over the plans of their prototype saeton asked no then how can you check from my plans whether ive lifted their design the intelligence officer glanced at his companion according to my information garside said they claim that the plans were looted with the prototype the plans can be withdrawn the designer is dead the fools arrested him in the middle of his work for alleged complicity in the july bomb plot then theyve only themselves to blame saeton said how did you know that it was the rauch motoren who had lodged the complaint the raf officer asked ive admitted already that it was seeing their prototype that gave me the idea saeton answered his voice was quiet he was keeping a tight hold of himself the same company has already made an effort to get control of my outfit through a gentleman called reinbaum who now holds the mortgages on the plane and equipment here he turned and faced the two of them what exactly are the authorities trying to do do they want a german company to produce a new type of aero engine in preference to a british concern carter and i have worked for nearly three years on this if wed pinched their prototype and it was so far advanced that they were ready to go into production with it surely wed have been in the air now instead of mortgaged to the hilt and still working to produce a second engine the two men glanced at each other so long as it cant be proved that you looted the thing the raf officer shrugged his shoulders the trouble with control commission is that they think in terms of supporting the jerries you dont have to worry as far as im concerned saeton three years ago i was bombing the beggars and if youd looted the complete article he turned to his companion whats your view garside the other looked helplessly round the hangar even if it was looted he said slowly it would be very difficult to prove it now he turned to saeton in any case youve done three years work on your engines my advice is get it patented as soon as possible doubtless the patents office will compare your design with the german companys if they can produce one and if they put in a claim i notified headquarters at the time i saw the rauch motoren prototype saeton said the raf officer nodded yes ive looked over your report had the devils own job digging it out of its pigeon hole in the air ministry you acted perfectly correctly as far as the authorities were concerned you dont have to worry about that but as garside says get your patents every day you delay german pressure is becoming more effective he held out his hand to saeton well good luck youd better come and have some coffee before you drive back saeton suggested and he shepherded them out of the hangar well whats all that about tubby i asked as the door of the hangar closed behind them just that our problems wont be over even when we get into the air he answered and went back to the bench saeton was looking pleased with himself when he came back what i didnt tell them he said with a grin is that the designs are already with the patents office if the german company want to put in a claim theyll have to get busy do you think randall had anything to do with that visit tubby asked randall of course not if they got hold of randall then there would be trouble at dinner that night he announced that he was going to london i want to have a word with dick he said also its time i saw the patents people diana paused with her fork halfway to her mouth how long will you be gone bill her voice was tense a couple of days two days its strange how you can live with people and not notice whats happening right under your nose because it happens so gradually tubby glanced at his wife his face pale his body very still the atmosphere had suddenly become electric in the way she had spoken she had betrayed herself she was in love with saeton and tubby knew it saeton knew it too for he didnt look at her and answered too casually i shall be away one night thats all it was queer nothing of any importance had been said and yet it was as though diana had shouted her infatuation from the middle of the runway she had stripped herself naked with that too interested too tense query and her repetition of the time as though it were eternity silence hung over the table like a storm that has revealed itself in one lightning stab but has still to break tubbys hand had clenched into a fist and i waited for the moment when hed fling the trestle table over and round on saeton id seen men break like that during the war sane solid men pushed over the edge by nerves strung too taut through danger monotony and the confined space of a small mess but he had that essential stolidity that saxon aversion for the theatrical the scrape of his chair as he thrust it back shattered the silence im going out for a breath of air his voice trembled slightly that was the only indication of the angry turmoil inside him that and his eyes which showed bright and angry in the creases of fat his cheeks quivered slightly as he turned from the table he shut the door quite softly behind him and his footsteps rang on the frozen earth outside and then died away into the woods the three of us sat there for a moment in a stunned silence then saeton said youd better go and talk to him diana i dont want him walking out on me without him wed be lost cant you think of anything but your engines the violence of her emotion showed in her voice and in her eyes he looked at her then there was something in his face i couldnt fathom a sort of bitterness a mixture of desire and frustration no he said the one word seemed drawn out of the depths of his being diana leaned quickly forward her face was white her eyes very wide and she was breathing as though she were making a last desperate effort in a race bill i cant go on like this dont you understand i didnt ask you to come here his voice rasped i didnt want you here do you think i dont know that she seemed to have forgotten my presence entirely both of them had their eyes were at grips with each other face to face with something inside them that had to come out but im here and i cant go on like this you dominate everything youve dominated me i dont care how long youre away but i cant she stopped then and looked at me as though aware of my presence for the first time i started to get to my feet but saeton leaned quickly forward and gripped my arm you stay here neil he said i think he was scared to be left alone with her still gripping my arm as though clutching hold of something solid and reasonable he turned and looked at her go and find tubby he said his voice was suddenly cold and unemotional he needs you i dont she stared at him her lips trembling she wanted to fight him to beat at his resistance till it was down but i think the essential truth of his words struck home for suddenly there were tears in her eyes tears of anger and she turned and fled from the room we heard the door of her room slam and it muffled the sound of her sobs saetons fingers slowly released their grip of my wrist damn all women to hell he muttered savagely do you want her i had put the question without thinking of course i do he answered his voice tight as a violin string and trembling with his passion and she knows it he gave a growl of anger and got to his feet but it isnt her i want any woman would do she knows that too now he was pacing up and down and i saw him feel automatically in his pocket for a cigarette ive been lost to the world up here too long god here i am with the future almost within my grasp with everything ive dreamed of coming to the verge of reality and it can all be thrown in jeopardy because a woman senses my primitive need you could send her away i suggested if she goes tubby goes too tubby loves her more than he loves himself or his future he turned and looked at me and diana loves him too this is merely he hesitated and then almost bitterly you know neil i dont think im capable of love it isnt a word i understand else knew that i thought shed see me through this period of monasticism but when it came to the point she wanted something i wasnt prepared to give her he laughed harshly diana is different but shes got tubby shes driven by nothing more than an urge for excitement theres that in women too the constant craving for novelty conquest why the hell cant she be satisfied with what shes got already his hand gripped my shoulder go and find tubby will you neil tell him oh tell him what you like but for christs sake smooth him down i cant get this engine to the flying stage nor can you hes been in it from the beginning the prototype didnt work you know for months i studied engineering made inquiries picked other peoples brains i produced a modified version flew it in an old hurricane and crashed it then i found tubby and with his genius for improvisation we built one that worked go and talk to him hes got to stay here for another month at any rate if he doesnt youve lost your money i found tubby in the hangar and i think it was then that i first really admired him he was quietly working away truing up a bearing assembly that had been giving trouble he stopped me before i could say anything bill sent you to talk to me didnt he i nodded he put the bearing down tell him that i understand and then more to himself than to me its not his fault its something diana wants that hes got it was there inside her before she ever came here a restlessness an urge for a change i thought by bringing her up here he moved his hand in a helpless gesture itll work itself out she ought to have had a child but he sighed tell bill its all right i wont blame him so long as he gives me no cause itll work itself out he repeated and then added quietly in time saeton left next morning on the old motor bike which was their sole form of transport and it was only after hed gone that i realised how much the whole tempo of the place depended on him without the driving enthusiasm of his personality it all seemed flat tubby worked with the concentration of a man trying hard to lose himself in what he was making but it was a negative drive for myself i found the rime hang slowly on the hands of my watch and i determined to go down to the farm that evening and make it up with else somehow i hadnt been able to get her out of my mind i think it was her presence in the hangar with saeton that first night that id arrived at membury that intrigued me the obvious explanation i had proved to be wrong now suddenly i was filled with an urgent desire to get at the truth also i was lonely i suppose any girl would have done then but she was the only one available and as soon as tubby and i knocked off i went down to the manor the kitchen curtains were drawn and when i knocked at the door it wasnt else who opened it a small greyhaired woman stood framed against the light a swish of silk at her feet and the scent of jasmine clinging on the air i was looking for else langen i explained awkwardly she smiled else is upstairs dressing are you from the aerodrome then you must be mr eraser wont you come in i am mrs ellwood she closed the door behind me you must find it very cold up at the airfield now i really think mr saeton should get some proper heating put in ive told him any time he or his friends want a little home comfort to come over and see us but hes always so busy we were in the kitchen now and she went over to the aga cooker and stirred vigorously at the contents of a saucepan holding her dressinggown close around the silk of her dress have you had dinner mr fraser no we have it later then why not stay and have some food with us its only stew but she hesitated im cook tonight you see were going to the red cross dance at marlborough its for else really poor child shes hardly been anywhere since she came to us of course shes what they call a dp and shes here as a domestic servant why do they call them dps its so depressing but whether shes a servant or not i dont think it right to keep a young thing shut away here without any life you people at the aerodrome are no help we never see anything of you and it is lonely up here what do you think of else dont you think shes pretty mr fraser i think shes very pretty i murmured she cocked an eye at me she was like a little greyhaired sparrow and i had a feeling that she missed nothing are you doing anything tonight mr fraser no i was just going to then will you do something for me will you come to this dance with us it would be a great kindness you see i had arranged for my son who works with the railways at swindon to come over but this afternoon he rang up to say he had to go to london i wouldnt mind if it were an english girl but you know what country places are and after all she lowered her voice she is german it would be a kindness but ive no clothes i murmured oh she waved the spoon at me like a little fairy godmother changing me into evening clothes on the spot thats all right im certain youre just about my sons size come along and well see and of course the clothes fitted it was that sort of a night by the time i had changed the three of them were assembled in the big lounge hall colonel ellwood was pouring drinks from a decanter that sparkled in the firelight he was a tall very erect man with grey hair and a long serious face his wife fluttered about with a rustle of silk and else sat in a big winged chair staring into the fire she was dressed in very deep blue and her face and shoulders were like marble she looked lonely and a little frightened she didnt look up as i came in she seemed remote shut away in a world of her own only when mrs ellwood called to her did she turn her head i think you know mr eraser she saw me then and her eyes widened for an awful moment i thought she was going to run from the room but then she said good evening in a cold distant voice and turned back to the fire she hardly said a word all through dinner and when we were together in the back of the car she drew away from me and sat huddled in her corner her face a white blur in the reflected light of the headlights not until we were dancing together in the warmth of the ballroom did she break that frigid silence and then i think it was only her sense of loneliness in that alien gathering that made her say why did you come i was lonely i said lonely she looked up at me then you have your friends i happen to work there thats all i said but they are your friends three weeks ago i had never met any of them she stared at me but you are a partner you put up money she hesitated why do you come here if you do not know them its a long story i answered and holding her close in the swing of the music i suddenly found myself wanting to tell her but instead i said else want to apologise for the other night i thought i didnt know how to put it so i said that first night i came to membury why were you in the hangar with saeton her grey eyes lifted to my face and then to the cut on my forehead that also is a long story she said slowly and then in a more friendly tone you are a strange person why did saeton think i was a friend of yours that night i asked why did he call to me in german she didnt answer for a moment and i thought she was going to ignore the question but at length she said perhaps i tell you some day we danced in silence for a time i have said that she was a big girl but she was incredibly light on her feet she was like thistledown in my arms and yet i could feel the warm strength of her under my hand the warmth and the music were going to my head banishing loneliness and the tension of the past weeks why did you come to the farm tonight she asked suddenly to see you i answered to apologise she was smiling for the first time you did not have to i told you i was lonely lonely her face seemed to harden you do not know what that word means please i would like a drink the music had stopped and i took her over to the bar well here is to the success of those engines her tone was light but as she drank her eyes were watching me and they did not smile why do you not drink you are not so crazy about those engines as mr saeton eh she used the word crazy in its real sense no i said she nodded of course not for him they are a part of his nature now a great millstone round his neck she hesitated and then said everyone makes for himself on this earth some particular hell of his own with saeton it is these engines ja she looked up into my face again when are they finished when do you fly them i hesitated but there was no reason why she shouldnt know living so close at the manor she would see us in the air with luck well be in the air by christmas airworthiness tests are fixed for the first week in january so a sudden mood of excitement showed in her eyes then you go on to the i hope your friend saeton is happy then her voice trembled slightly she was suddenly tense and the excitement in her eyes had changed to bitterness why are you so interested in saeton i asked her interested in saeton she seemed surprised almost shocked are you in love with him i asked her face hardened and she bit at her lower lip what has he been saying nothing i answered then why do you ask me if i am in love with him how can i be in love with a man i hate a man who has she stopped short staring at me angrily oh she exclaimed you are so stupid you do not understand nothing nothing her fingers were white against the stem of the glass as she sought for words why do you say you hate him i asked why because i offer him the only thing i have left to offer because i crawl to him like a dog her face was suddenly white with anger he only laugh he laugh in my face i tell you as though i am a common nutte she spat the word out as though she were hating herself as well as saeton and then that carter woman comes he is a devil she whispered and then turned quickly away from me and stared miserably at the crowded bar you talk of loneliness that is what it is to be lonely here with all these people to be away from ones own people a stranger in a you think i dont understand i said gently i was eighteen months in a prison camp in germany that is not the same thing there you are still with your own peoples not after i escaped for three weeks i was alone in germany on the run she stared up at me and gave a little sigh then perhaps you do understand but you are not alone here i hesitated and then i said more alone than i have ever been more alone than she stopped and gazed at me unbelievingly but why is that i took her arm and guided her to a seat i had to tell her now i had to tell someone and she was a german alone in england my story was safe with her i told her the whole thing sitting there in an alcove near a roaring fire with the sound of dance music in my ears when i had finished she put her hand on mine why did you tell me i shrugged my shoulders i didnt know myself lets dance i said we didnt talk much after that we just seemed to lose ourselves in the music and then mrs ellwood came and said we must go as her husband had to start work early the next morning in the car going back else didnt talk but she no longer shrank into her corner of the seat her shoulder leant against mine and when i closed my hand over hers she didnt withdraw why are you so silent i asked i am thinking of germany and what fun we could have had there in the old days do you know wiesbaden only from the air i answered and then wished i had not said that as i saw her lips tighten yes of course from the air she took her hand away and seemed to withdraw into herself she didnt speak again until the car was climbing the hill to membury and then she said very quietly do not come to see me again neil of course i shall i said no she said it almost violently her eyes staring at me out of the darkness her hand gripped mine please try to understand we are like two people who have caught sight of each other for a moment through a crack in the wall that separates us whatever the ss do to my father i am still a german i must hold fast to that because it is all i have left now i am german you are english and also you are working she stopped and her grip on my hand tightened i like you too much do not to come again please it is better so i didnt know what to say and then the car stopped we were at the track leading up to the quarters you can return the clothes in the morning mrs ellwood said i got out and thanked them for the evening as was about to shut the car door else leaned forward in england do you not kiss your partners goodnight her face was a pale circle in the darkness her eyes wide i bent to kiss her cheek but found her lips instead goodbye she whispered the ellwoods were chuckling happily as they drove off i stood watching until the red taillight had turned into the manor drive and then i went up the track to the quarters wondering about else it was to be nearly three weeks before i saw else again for saeton returned the following evening with the news that the air ministry now wanted the plane on the airlift by th january and airworthiness tests had been fixed for st january in the days that followed i plumbed the depths of physical exhaustion i had neither the time nor the energy for anything else and it went on day after day one week dragging into the next with no letup no pause saeton didnt drive he led he did as long as we did at the bench then he went back to the hangar typing letters far into the night ordering things staving off creditors running the whole of the business side of the company my admiration for the man was boundless but somehow i had no sympathy for him i could admire him but i couldnt like him he was inhuman as impersonal as the mechanism we pieced together he drove us with the sure touch of a coachman who knew just how to get the last ounce out of his horses but didnt care a damn what happened to them in the end so long as he made the next stage on time but it was exciting and it was that sense of excitement that carried me through to christmas the airfield hardened to iron as the cold gripped it the runways gleamed white with frost in the sunshine on fine days but mostly it was grey and cold with the ploughedup earth black and ringing hard and metallic like solidified lava there was no heating in the hangar it had the chill dank smell of a tomb only the work kept us warm as we lathered ourselves daily into a sweat of exhaustion saeton was working for engine completion on th december installation by rd december and first test on christmas day it was a tight schedule but he wanted a clear week for tests but though we worked far on into the night we were behind schedule all the time and it was not until christmas eve that we completed that second engine the final adjustments were made at eightthirty in the evening we were dead beat and we stood in front of the gleaming mass of metal in a sort of daze none of us said a word we just stood back and looked at it i produced a packet of cigarettes and tossed one to saeton he lit it and drew the smoke into his lungs as though smoke alone could ease the tension of his nerves all right fill her up with oil tubby and switch on the juice ill get diana shed like to be in on this he went over to the phone and rang the quarters i helped fill up with oil we checked that there was petrol in the wall tank tightened the unit of the petrol feed and switched on there was a tense silence as we waited for diana five weeks work stood before us and a touch of the starter button would tell us whether wed made a job of it it wasnt like an engine coming out of a works there everything moves with an inevitable progression from the foundry and the lathes and the electrical shop to the assembly and the final running in this was different everything had been made by hand one tiny slip in any of the precision work i thought of how tired we were it seemed incredible that everything would work smoothly a knock on the door of the hangar sounded incredibly loud in the silence tubby went to the door and let his wife in well there it is diana saeton said pointing to the thing his voice trembled slightly thought youd like to see what your cooking has given birth to our laughter was uneasy forced okay tubby let her go he turned away with a quick nervous twist of his shoulders and walked down to the far end of the bench he wasnt going to touch that starter switch himself he wasnt even going to watch he stood with his back towards us puffing at his cigarette his hands playing aimlessly with the pieces of metal lying on the bench tubby watched him hesitating go on start it saetons voice was a rasp tubby glanced at me swallowed nervously and crossed to the starter motor which was already connected up he pressed the switch it groaned overloaded with the stiffness of the metal the groaning sound went on and on he switched off and went over to the engine his practised eye running over it checking then he went back to the starter motor the groaning sound was faster now moving to a hum there was a sharp explosion the engine rocked the hum of the starter took over again and then suddenly the stillness of the hangar was shattered by a roar as the motor picked up the whole building seemed to shake tubby switched off hurried to the engine and adjusted the controls when he started it again the roar settled to a steady glorious hum of power smooth and even like the dynamos of a power station saeton ground out his cigarette and came back along the bench his face was shining with sweat shes okay he shouted above the din it was part statement part question tubby looked up from the controls and his fat friendly face was creased in a happy grin and he nodded carburation wants a bit of adjustment and the timing on that to hell with the adjustments saeton shouted well do those tomorrow all i care about at the moment is that she goes now switch the damned thing off and lets go and have a drink my god weve earned it the roar died away as tubby cut off the juice the hangar was suddenly still again but there was no tension in the stillness now we were all grinning and slapping each other on the back tubby caught hold of his wife and hugged her she had caught our mood of relief her eyes were shining and she just didnt seem able to contain her excitement anybody else like a kiss i was nearest to her and she reached up and touched her lips to mine then she turned and caught hold of saeton she pressed her lips to his her hands tightening on his overalls he caught hold of her shoulders and pushed her away almost roughly come on lets get a drink his voice was hoarse saeton had kept a bottle of whisky for this moment heres to the airlift he said to the airlift we echoed we drank it neat talking excitedly of how wed manage the installation what the first test flight would show how the plane would behave on two engines saeton planned to use the outboard engines for takeoff only with the extra power developed by the satan mark ii all flying would be done on the two engines we bridged in our excitement all the immediate problems and talked instead of how we should develop the company what planes we should buy what routes we should operate whose works we should take over for mass production in a flash the bottle was empty saeton wrung the last drop out of it and smashed it on the concrete floor thats the best bottle of scotch ive ever had and i wont have it lying on any damned rubbish heap he shouted his eyes were dilated with the drink and his own excitement our glasses suddenly empty we stood around looking at them in silence it seemed a pity to end the evening like this saeton apparently felt the same look tubby he said suppose you nip on the old bike and run down into ramsbury bring back a couple of bottles doesnt matter what it costs he glanced at me okay neil its your money and as i nodded he clapped my arm you wont regret having backed us if you live to be as old as methuselah youll never make a better investment than this more scotch tubby he waved his arm expansively get on your charger boy and ride like hell this bloody dump is out of scotch come on well hold your stirrups for you and well be out to cheer you as you ride back bottles clanking in your saddlebags we were all laughing and shouting as we trooped out to the storeroom where the bike was housed tubby roared off his face beaming his hand whacking at the rear of the bike as he flogged through the gears his taillight disappeared through the trees and we fell suddenly silent saeton passed his hand across his eyes lets go in he said moodily and i saw that the nerves at the corners of his eyes were twitching he was near to breaking point we all were a good drink would do us good and i suddenly thought of else what about making it a party i said ill go down and see the ellwoods i knew they wouldnt come but i thought else might saeton tried to stop me but i was already hurrying down the track and i ignored him a light was on over the front door of the farm it looked friendly and welcoming mrs ellwood answered my ring its you mr fraser she sounded surprised we thought you must have left weve been very busy i murmured come in wont you no thank you i just came down to say were having a party i wondered if you and colonel ellwood could come up for a drink and else i added her eyes twinkled its else youre wanting isnt it what a pity weve been expecting you all this time and now you come tonight else has had to go to london something about her passage shes going back to germany you know to germany yes oh dear its all very sudden and what we shall do without her i dont know shes been such a help when is she going i asked in a few days time i imagine it was all very unexpected just after that dance she got a letter to say her brother was very ill and now there is some trouble about her papers do come and see her before she goes yes i murmured yes ill come down one evening i backed away trying to remember if else had said she had a second brother goodnight mrs ellwood sorry you wont join us i heard the door close as i started back down the drive hell the evening suddenly seemed flat a feeling of violent anger swept through me damn the girl why for gods sake couldnt she be home this evening of all evenings i took a short cut through the woods i was just in sight of the quarters when i heard the snap of a twig behind me i glanced over my shoulder and saw the figure of a man emerging out of the darkness whos that he asked the voice was tubbys neil i said did you get the scotch for an answer i heard the clank of bottle against bottle bloody bike ran out of petrol just up the road his voice was thick hed either had several at the pub or hed opened one of the bottles what are you doing looking for fairies ive just been down to the farm i said else eh he laughed and slipped his arm through mine we went on in silence a lighted widow showed through the trees like a homing beacon we came out of the woods and there was the interior of the diningroom saeton and diana were there standing very close together a bottle on the table and drinks in their hands i wonder where they got that tubby murmured come on well give them a surprise we had almost reached the window when diana moved she put down her drink and moved closer to saeton her hand touched his she was talking i could hear the murmur of her voice through the glass of the window tubby had stopped saeton took his hand away and turned towards the door she caught hold of him swinging him round her head thrown back laughing at him the tinkle of her laughter came out to us in the cold of the night air tubby moved forward he was like a man in a dream compelled to go to the window as though drawn there by some magnetic influence saeton was standing quite still looking down at diana his hard leathery face unsoftened a muscle twitching at the corner of his mouth standing there in the darkness facing that lighted window it was like watching a puppet show all right if you want it that way saetons voice was harsh it came to us muffled but clear he knocked back his drink set down the glass and seized hold of her by the arms she lay back in his grip her hair hanging loose her face turned up to him in complete abandon saeton hesitated there was a bitter set about his mouth then he drew her to him her arms closed around his neck her passion was to me something frightening i was so conscious all the time of tubby standing there beside me it was like watching a scene from a play feeling it through the senses of a character who had yet to come on saeton was fumbling at her dress his face flushed with drink and quite violent then suddenly he stiffened his hands came away from her thats enough diana he said get me another drink no bill its me you want not drink you know you do why dont you but he took hold of her hands and tore them from his neck i said get me another drink oh god dont you understand darling her hand touched his face stroking it smoothing out the deepetched lines on either side of the mouth you want me you know you do tubby didnt move and i stood there transfixed by his immobility saetons hands slowly reached out for diana closed on her and then gripped hold of her and hurled her from him she hit the edge of the table and clutched at it he took two steps forward standing over her his head thrust slightly forward you little fool he said cant you understand you mean nothing to me nothing do you hear youre trying to come between me and something that is bigger than both of us well im not going to have everything wrecked go on she cried i know i dont rate as high as that bloody engine of yours but you cant go to bed with an engine and you can with me why dont you forget it for the moment you know you want me you know your whole bodys crying out for shut up but she couldnt shut up she was laughing at him goading him you never were cut out for a monk you lie awake at nights thinking about me dont you and i lie awake thinking about you oh bill why dont you shut up his voice shook with violence and the veins were standing out on his forehead hard and knotted her voice dropped to a low murmur of invitation i could no longer hear the words but the sense was there in her face in the way she looked at him his hands came slowly out searching for her then suddenly he straightened up his hand opened out and he slapped her across the face twice once on each cheek i said shut up now get out of here she had staggered back her hand to her mouth her face white she looked as though she were going to cry saeton reached out for the bottle if youd had any sense youd have given me that drink his voice was no longer hard next time pick somebody your own size he tucked the bottle under his arm and turned to go but he hesitated at the door looking back at her i think he was going to say something conciliatory but when he saw the blazing fury in her eyes his face suddenly hardened again if you start any trouble between me and tubby he said slowly ill break your neck do you understand he wrenched open the door and disappeared a moment later the outer door of the quarters opened and we were spotlighted in the sudden shaft of light saeton stopped how long have you two been he slammed the door i hope you enjoyed your rubbernecking im going over to the hangar his footsteps rang on the ironhard earth as his figure merged into the darkness of the woods neither of us moved for a moment utter stillness surrounded us broken only by the muffled sound of dianas sobs where she lay across the table her head buried in her hands amongst the litter of glasses i felt the chill glass of the bottles as tubby thrust them into my hands take these over to the hangar he said in a strangled voice i watched him as he opened the door of the quarters and went inside walking slowly almost unwillingly i didnt move for a moment i seemed rooted to the spot then the door of the diningroom opened and i saw him enter id no desire to stand in as audience on another painful scene i turned quickly and hurried through the woods after saeton when i entered the hangar saeton was sitting on the work bench staring at the new engine and drinking out of the bottle come in neil he waved the bottle at me have a drink his voice was slurred almost unrecognisable god knows how much hed drunk in the short time it had taken me to get to the hangar i took the bottle from him it was brandy and more thanhalfempty the liquid ran like fire down my throat and i gasped you saw the whole thing i suppose he asked i nodded he laughed a wild unnatural sound what will tubby do i dont know i said he got off the bench and began pacing up and down why did he ever let her come here it was no place for her she likes plenty going on lots of people excitement plenty of noise and movement why dont men learn to understand their wives lets forget about it he waved his arm angrily what have you got there scotch he came over and picked up one of the bottles from the bench where id placed it thank god weve got some liquor anyway he glanced at the bottle of brandy which i still held queer a woman hiding away a bottle like that he unscrewed the top of a whisky bottle havent you had enough i suggested he gave me a glassy stare its christmas eve isnt it and the engine is finished i could drink a bloody vat he raised the bottle to his lips and drank rocking slightly back on to his heels and then forward on to his toes funny isnt it he muttered hoarsely wiping his lips with the back of his hand you start out with the idea of celebrating and before you know where you are youre trying to drown your sorrows neil old man his free hand reached out and fastened around my shoulders tell me something be honest with me now i want an honest reply do you like me i hesitated if id been as drunk as he was it wouldnt have mattered but i was comparatively sober and he knew it his arm slipped away from my shoulders and he staggered away from me towards the engine he stood in front of it and addressed it you bastard he said then he lurched round towards me i havent a friend in the world he said and there was a frightful bitterness in his voice which caught on a sob of selfpity not a friend in the whole wide world he repeated diana was right an engine is something you create not a living being god damn it i dont care do you hear me i dont care i dont give a damn for the whole human race if they dont like me why should i care i dont need anything from them im building something of my own and thats all i care about do you hear i dont give a damn he turned suddenly at the sound of the hangar door opening it was tubby he came slowly down the hangar give me a drink he said saeton handed him the bottle tubby raised it to his lips and gulped saeton watching him his body tense well he asked and then as tubby didnt answer he added for gods sake say something cant you what happened tubby raised his eyes and looked at saeton but i dont think he saw him his hand strayed to the leather belt that supported his trousers i thrashed her he said in the same flat tone shes packing now packing saetons voice was suddenly hard and crisp in that moment he seemed to shake off all the effects pi the drink ive telephoned for a taxi saeton strode over to him and caught hold of him by his jacket you cant walk out on me now tubby in a few days well be making our first test flight after all this time cant you forget about your engine for just one night tubbys voice was tired there was a sort of hopelessness about it i want some money saeton thats what i came up to see you about saeton laughed suddenly there isnt any money you know that not until were on the airlift the sudden sense of domination was back in his voice and i knew that he had seen how he could keep carter with us how much do you want tubby i asked feeling for my wallet saeton rounded on me his face heavy with anger if you think the two of us can get the plane into the air youre crazy he said for one thing the margin of time is too small for another there may be alterations to make neither you nor i he turned away with a quick angry shrug how much do you want i asked again a fiver he came across to me and i gave him the notes i hate to do this neil but his voice tailed away forget it i said are you sure that will be enough he nodded its only to get diana to london shell stay with her friends shes got a job waiting for her its just to see her through for a few days shes going back to the malcolm club she worked for them during the war and theyve been wanting her back ever since the airlift got under way he stuffed the money into his pocket shell pay you back he turned to leave the hangar but saeton stopped him they employ girls at the malcolm club not engineers what are you going to do tubby looked at him im staying here he said i promised id see you into the air and ill keep my promise after that but saeton wasnt listening he came across the hangar like a man who had been reprieved his eyes were alight with excitement his whole face transfigured then its okay youre not walking out on me he caught hold of tubbys hand and wrung it then everythings all right yes tubby answered withdrawing his hand everythings all right bill but as he turned away i saw there were tears in his eyes saeton stood for a moment watching him go then he turned to me come on neil lets have a drink he seized hold of the opened bottle of scotch heres to the test flight there was only room for one thing in the mans mind with a sick feeling i turned away im going to bed i said chapter four it wasnt until the following day that i realised how much diana had been doing for us it wasnt only that shed cooked our food made our beds kept the place clean and neat and done all the little odd jobs that are so boring and yet are an essential part of the act of living shed done more than that by her brightness her cheerfulness her mere presence she had cushioned the tense exhaustion of our effort she had provided a background for us in which we could momentarily relax and gather strength for another days sustained effort the place seemed flat without her i cooked the breakfast that morning tubby hadnt got back until the early hours he looked all in when i called him his round friendly face was hollow and drained of all its natural cheerfulness and saeton looked like death when he came across from the hangar his face was grey and the corners of his eyes twitched nervously he was suffering from a hangover but i think it was more than that he was hating himself that morning there was something inside of him that drove him on it wasnt exactly ambition it was something more urgent more essentially a part of his nature a frustrated creative urge that goaded him and i think hed been fighting it through the long drunken hours of the night he wasnt a normal human being he was a cold singlepurposed machine and i think that part of him was at war with his celtic blood it was the grimmest christmas i have ever had we spent the day in bench tests on the new engine and in getting the first engine in position in the nacelle the hangar was equipped with overhead gear for this purpose it had been a maintenance hangar in the days when the americans had had the aerodrome without that gear i dont know how we should have done it but no doubt saeton had thought of that when he decided to rent the hangar i was looking after the commissariat and though it was all canned food that i served it took time i was thankful that we were so near the end of our work it wasnt only the fact that diana had gone there was tubby no setback ever discouraged him and his cheery grin had seen me through many bad moments but now his end of the bench was silent he didnt whistle any more and there was no friendly grin to cheer me he worked with stolid urgent drive as though the work itself as well as saeton stood between him and his wife it was only then that i realised how much i had leaned on his goodnatured optimism he had never asked me any questions to this day i dont know how much he knew about me he had just accepted me and in his acceptance and in his solid ordinariness he had created an atmosphere that had made the aerodrome reality and the past somehow remote that was all gone now a sense of impermanence crept into the hangar as though we were on the fringe of the outside world and i began to worry about the future wondering whether when we flew out of membury the police would get on my trail again i suddenly found myself in dread of the outside world that first day after dianas departure was hell a tenseness brooded over us in the din of the hangar where the new engine was being run in on the bench but on the following day saeton had recovered from his hangover he came down at sixthirty and got our breakfast he didnt talk much but a quiet steadying confidence radiated from him i never admired him more than i did then the following day would see the work of installation completed he was facetoface with the first test flight three years of work were concentrated on the results of that one day the previous flying tests had resulted in the plane crashing and the mans nerves must have been stretched to the uttermost but he never showed it he set out to instil confidence in us and renew our interest and enthusiasm a forced cheerfulness would have been fatal he didnt make that mistake he did it by the force of his personality by implanting in us his own feelings the mood sprang from deep within him and was natural and real i felt as though he had stretched out his hand to lift me up to his own pitch of excitement and tubby felt it too it didnt start him whistling again at his work and there was no goodnatured grin but as we heaved on the pulley chains to jockey the second engine into position for lowering into its nacelle i suddenly realised that his heart was in it again we didnt knock off that night till past ten by then the two engines were in position all we had to do the next day was connect them up fix the airscrews and prepare the plane for the first test think shell make it tubby saeton asked shed better tubby spoke through his teeth and there was a gleam in his eyes as he stared up at the plane as though already he saw her winging into gatow on those two engines we had sweated blood to produce i knew then that everything was all right in one day saeton had quietly and unobtrusively overlaid tubbys bitterness with enthusiasm for the plane and an overwhelming interest in the outcome of the flight december a tuesday was the last day of preparation as the light faded out of the sky we slid back the doors of the hangar and started up the two motors the work bench whitened under a film of cement dust kicked op by the backlash of the two props nobody cared tubby and i stood in the dust and grinned at each other as saeton revved the motors and the whole fuselage quivered against the grip of the brakes as the noise died down and the props slowly jerked to a standstill tubby gripped my arm by god he said they work its good to see something youve made running as smoothly as that ive never built an engine from scratch before he added we were building castles in the air that night as we sat over the remaining bottle of scotch the airlift was only our springboard between us we swept past the workout into the airways of the world saetons imagination knew no common bounds he drew a picture for us of planes tramping the globe able to cut steamer rates as well as steamer schedules of a huge assembly line turning out freighters of a gigantic organisation running freight to the ultimate ends of the earth the future of the passenger plane lies in jets he said but freight will go to any company that can offer the lowest rates he was standing over us and he leaned down his eyes shining and gripped the two of us by the shoulder its queer here we are just three ordinary types broke to the wide and living on credit and tomorrow in the air over this derelict airfield we shall fly the first plane of the biggest freight organisation the world has ever seen were going to be the most talkedof people in the world in a few months time its been tough going up here he grinned but not half as tough as its going to be youll look back on this period as a holiday when we start to get organised and then with one of those abrupt changes of mood he sat down well now lets get tomorrow sorted out to begin with id rather not taxi out of the hangar you never know something may go wrong and she may swing neil you know the ellwoods suppose you go down and arrange for them to send one of their tractors up here id like it here by eight he turned to tubby ground tests will take most of the morning i expect but id like to be in the air by midday how are we fixed for petrol are all the tanks full tubby shook his head no only the main tanks theyre about twothirds full thatll do what about checking over the controls tubby asked id like to run over the plane itself we did it after she was flown in saeton said yes i know but i feel we havent time tubby she came in all right and we went over her before we finally closed the purchase if she was all right then shes all right now neil go and fix that tractor will you the sooner we get to bed the better i want everyone to be fresh tomorrow he jerked back his chair and got to his feet a lot depends on it he pushed his hand through his thick hair and grinned not that i shall get much sleep im too darned excited i havent felt so excited since i did my first solo if we pull this off he laughed nervously as though he were asking too much of the gods goodnight he turned quickly and went out i glanced at tubby he was tying endless knots in a piece of string and humming a little tune he was nervous too so was i it wasnt only the test flight for me there was the future membury had been a refuge and now the outside world was crowding in on us i pushed back my chair ill go and arrange about the tractor i said but i was thinking of else i needed to feel that there was somebody just one person in the world that cared what happened to me the manor seemed in darkness but i could hear the sound of the light plant and when i rang else opened the door to me i was afraid you might have gone already i said i leave on monday she said you wish to come in she held the door open for me and i went through into the lounge where a great log blazed in the open hearth colonel and mrs ellwood have gone out for this evening she turned quickly towards me why have you come i wanted to arrange with colonel ellwood for a tractor tomorrow to bring the airplane out of the hangar i nodded were flying tests tomorrow das ist gut it will be good to see those engines in the air her tone was excited but she hesitated and the excitement died out of her leaving her face blank and miserable but he will not be here to see she turned back to the fire and almost automatically took a cigarette from the box on a side table and lit it she didnt speak for a long time just standing there drawing the smoke into her lungs and staring into the fire something told me not to say anything silence hung between us in the flickering firelight but there was nothing awkward about it it was a live warm silence and when at length she spoke the intimacy wasnt broken it has been such a long time the words were whispered to the fire she was not in the room she was somewhere far away in the reaches of her memory she turned slowly and saw me again sit down please she said and offered me a cigarette you remember i ask you not to come here again i nodded i say that a wall separates us she pushed back her hair with a quick nervous gesture i was afraid i will talk to you because i am too much alone now you are here and she shrugged her shoulders and stared into the fire again have you ever wished for something so much that nothing else matter she didnt seem to expect a reply and after a moment she went on i grew up in berlin in a flat in the fassenenstrasse my mother was a cold rather nervous person with a passion for music and pretty clothes my brother walther was her life she lived through him it was as though she had no other existence my father and his work did not mean anything to her she knew nothing about engineering she shifted her gaze from the fire and stared at me with a bitter smile i think i was never intended to be born it just happened my father never spoke about it but that i think is what happen for i was born eight years after my brother when my mother was almost forty her smile ceased suddenly i think perhaps it was a painful birth i grew up in a world that was cold and unfriendly i seldom saw my father he was always working at some factory outside berlin when i left school i took a secretarial course and became a typist in the klocknerhumboldtdeutz ag there i fell in love with my boss she gave a bitter laugh it was not difficult for him i had not had much love he took me away to austria for the skiing and for a few months we shared a little apartment just a bedroom really then he got bored and i cried myself into a nervous breakdown that was when i first really met my father my mother did not wish to be bothered with me so she sent me to stay with him in wiesbaden this was in her gaze had gone back to the fire my father was wonderful she went on speaking slowly he had never had anyone to help him before i looked after the flat and did all his typing we made excursions down the rhine and took long walks in the black forest his hair was white even then but he was still like a boy and for my part i became engrossed in his work it fascinated me i was not interested in men i could not even bear for a man to touch me any more i lived and breathed engineering enjoying the exactness of it it was something that had substance that i could believe in i think my father was very impressed it was the first time he discovered that women also have brains he sent me to the university at frankfurt where i took my engineering staatsexamen after that i return to wiesbaden to work as my fathers assistant in the engine works there that was in we were at war then and my father is engaged on something new something revolutionary we work on it together for three years for us nothing else matters oh i know that my father does not like the regime that he is in touch with old friends who believe that germany is doomed under hitler but apart from the air raids it is quiet at wiesbaden and we work at the designing board and at the bench always on the same thing she threw her cigarette into the fire her face was very pale her eyes almost luminous in the firelight as she turned to me they came when we were working in the engine shop two officers of himmlers ss they arrested him there in the middle of our work they said he was something to do with the attempt on hitlers life it was a lie he had nothing to do with the conspiracy but he had been in contact with some of the people who were involved so they took him away they would not even wait for me to get him some clothes that was on the th july they took him to dachau and i never saw him again her lips trembled and she turned away stretching her hand down for another cigarette what did you do i asked nothing there was nothing i could do i try to see him of course but it is hopeless i can do nothing suddenly we have no friends even the company for whom he has worked for so long can do nothing the herr direktor is very sympathetic but he has instructions not to employ me any more so i go back to berlin and a few days later we hear my father is dead it means little to my mother everything to me my world has ceased within a month walther also is dead shot down over england they give him the iron cross and my mother has a breakdown and i have to nurse her her world also is gone her son the pretty clothes the music and the chatter all have disappeared and the russians take berlin i do not think she wished to live any longer after walthers death she never leave her bed until she died in october of last year and you looked after her all that time i asked since she seemed to expect some comment she nodded i have never been so miserable and then when she is dead i begin to think again about my father and his work i go to wiesbaden but the designs the experimental work is all disappeared there is nothing left however the rauch motoren is still in business and they are willing for me to try to her voice died away as though she could not find the right words to try and recover the engines i suggested ja and that is why you are here at membury it was so obvious now she had told me about her father and i couldnt help but admire her pluck and tenacity she nodded why have you told me all this i asked she shrugged her shoulders and kicked at the big oak log sending a shower of sparks up the chimney i do not know then she suddenly flung up her head and looked straight at me almost defiantly because i am alone because i have always been alone since they took him away because you are english and do not matter to me she was like an animal that is cornered and has turned at bay you had better go now i have told you we are on two sides of a wall i got slowly to my feet and went towards her youre very bitter arent you i said bitter her eyes stared at me angrily of course i am bitter i live for one thing now i live for the day when my fathers work will be recognised when he will be known as one of the greatest of germanys engineers the fire suddenly died out of her and she turned away from me what else have i to live for her voice sounded desperately unhappy i reached out and put my hand on her shoulder but she shook me off leave me alone do not touch me her voice was sharp almost hysterical and then in a moment her mood changed and she turned towards me i am sorry you cannot help i should not have talked like this will you go now please i hesitated all right i said then i held out my hand goodbye else goodbye her fingers touched mine they were very cold despite the warmth of the fire yes i suppose it is goodbye will you give my message to colonel ell wood we would like his heaviest tractor at the airfield at eight oclock i will tell him she lifted her eyes to mine and you fly the test tomorrow her fingers tightened on my hand alles gute her eyes were suddenly alive almost excited i will watch it will be good to see those engines in the air even if no one knows it is his work the last few words were little more than whisper she came with me to the door then and as she stood there framed in the soft light of the lounge she said neil she had a funny way of saying it almost achieving the impossible and pronouncing the vowels individually if you come to berlin sometimes i live at number fiftytwo fassenenstrasse that is near the kurfurstendamm ask for fraulein meyer meyer ja else meyer that is my real name to come here i have to have the papers of some other girl you see i am a nazi i belong to the hitlerjugend before before they kill my father her lips twitched painfully goodbye she said quickly her fingers touched mine and then the door closed and i was alone in the dark cold of the night i didnt move for a moment and as i stood there i thought i heard the sound of sobbing but it may only have been the wind it was a long time before i got to sleep that night it was such a pitiful story and yet i couldnt blame saeton i was english she was german the wall between us was high indeed next morning the memory of her story was swamped in the urgent haste of preparations for tests it was a cold grey day and it was raining a low curtain of cloud swept across the airfield but nobody seemed to mind our thoughts were on the plane apparently else had delivered my message for promptly at eight oclock a big caterpillar tractor came trundling across the tarmac apron leaving a trail of clay and chalk clods on the wet shining surface of the asphalt we slid the hangar doors back and hitched the tractor to the planes undercarriage it gave me a sense of pride to see that gleaming tudor nose slowly out of the hangar it no longer had the toothless grin that had greeted me every morning for the past five weeks it was a complete aircraft a purposeful solidlooking machine fully engined and ready to go the tractor dragged it to the main runway and then left us well lets get moving saeton said and swung himself up into the fuselage i followed him tubby wheeled out the batteries and connected up first one engine and then another roared into life saetons hand reached up to the four throttle levers set high up in the centre of the windshield the engine revs died down as he trimmed the motors tubby came in through the cockpit door and closed it what about parachutes he asked saeton grinned theyre back in the fuselage you old jonah and theyre okay i packed them myself last night the engines roared the fuselage shivering violently as the plane bucked against the wheel brakes i was in the second pilots seat checking the dials with saeton tubby was between us fuel oil pressure and temperature gauges coolant temperature rev meters everything was registering correctly okay saeton said ground tests he released the brakes and we began to move forward down the shining surface of the runway left rudder right rudder the tail swung in response landing flaps okay tail controls okay brakes okay for an hour we roared up and down the runways circling the perimeter track watching fuel consumption oil indicators the behaviour of the plane with four motors running and then with the two new inboard engines only tubby stood in the well between the two pilots seats listening watching the dials and scribbling notes on a pad at length saeton brought the plane back to the apron opposite the hangar and cut the engines well he asked looking down at tubby his voice seemed very loud in the sudden silence for answer tubby raised his thumb and grinned just one or two things id like to check over the injection timing on that starboard motor and i want to have a look at the fuel filters we got a slight drop in revs and she sounded a bit rough saeton nodded and we climbed out as we did so i saw a movement in the trees that screened the quarters it was else saeton had seen her too whats that girl doing up here he muttered angrily then he turned quickly to me did you tell her we were flying tests this morning yes i said i thought i warned you to keep away from her he glared at me as though i were responsible for her presence there on the edge of the airfield then he switched his gaze to the fringe of trees else had disappeared its about time the authorities took some action about her how do you mean i asked shes here on false papers her name isnt really langen i know that now i said and then suddenly i understood what he was driving at do you mean to say youve reported her to the authorities of course do you think i want her snooping around the place sending reports to the rauch motoren theyd no right to let her into the country havent you done that girl enough harm i said angrily harm he glanced at me quickly how much do you know of her story he asked i know that it was her father who designed these engines i said she worked on them with him i caught hold of his arm why dont you come to terms with her i said all she really wants is recognition for her father he flung my hand off so shes got round you as she got round randall as she nearly got round me shes just a little tart trading her body for the glorification of the fatherland i felt a sudden urge to hit him dont you understand anybody i exclaimed through clenched teeth she loved her father cant you understand that all she wants is recognition for his work recognition he gave a sneering laugh its germany she loves they killed her father bur still it is germany she thinks of she offered to be my mistress if id allow the rauch motoren to manufacture the engines my engines the engines tubby and i have worked on all these years she traded on my weakness on the fact that i was alone up here and if diana hadnt come he halfshrugged his shoulders as though shaking off something he didnt like her father has got about as much to do with these engines as you have nevertheless i said it was his prototype you stole stole damn it man a country that has gone through what we have on account of the blasted germans has a right to take what it wants if professor meyer had completed the development of those engines he stopped and stared at me angrily you bloody fool neil why waste your sympathy on the girl or her father she was a good little nazi till the ss took meyer to dachau and meyer was a nazi too his lips spread in a thin bitter smile perhaps youre not aware that professor meyer was one of the men who developed the diesel engine for use in bombers london is in his debt to the tune of many hundreds of tons of bombs my mother was killed in the blitz of he turned away his shoulders hunched his hands thrust deep into his pockets and walked across the tarmac to the hangar i followed slowly thinking of the tangled pattern of motive that surrounded these engines for over an hour tubby worked on the engine then he checked over the others it was just on one oclock when he climbed down and pulled the gantry away okay he said theres nothing more i can do all right saeton said lets have a bit of food his voice was overloud as though by speaking like that he could convince us of his confidence i glanced at the plane the rain clouds had broken up and she was caught in a gleam of watery sunlight it was one thing doing ground tests quite another to commit ourselves to the takeoff but she looked just like any other tudor it was difficult to realise seeing her standing there on the tarmac that this wasnt to be a routine flight saeton had brought a loaf and some cheese and butter up from the quarters we ate it in the hangar none of us talking all of us i think very conscious of the emptiness of the place and of the aircraft standing out there on the apron waiting for us as soon as wed finished we got into our flying kit and went out to the plane saeton insisted we wear our parachutes once more we sat in the cockpit saeton and i the pilots seats tubby in the well between us the engines ticking over saetons hand reached out for the throttle levers the engines revved and we moved away across the apron along the perimeter track and swung on to the runway end the concrete stretching ahead of us a broad white path shining wet in sunlight okay saeton looked at us his jaw had broadened with the clenching of the muscles his features looked hard and unsmiling only his eyes mirrored the excitement that held him in its grip okay tubby said i nodded again saetons hand reached up for the throttle levers pressing them slowly down with his palm the four motors roared in unison the fuselage shuddered violently as the thrust of the props fought the brakes then he released the brakes and we started forward i wont pretend i wasnt nervous even a little scared but it was overlaid by the sense of excitement at the same time it was difficult to realise fully the danger viewed from the cockpit all the engines looked ordinary standard models there was nothing to bring home to us the fact that those inboard engines were the work of our own hands only the memory now distant of the countless hours wed worked at them in the hangar in a sense it was nothing more than id done hundreds of times before a routine takeoff i tried to concentrate on the dials but as we gathered speed my eyes strayed to the concrete streaming beneath us faster and faster and thence to the ploughed verge of the runway and to the woods beyond i caught a glimpse of the quarters through a gap in the trees it suddenly seemed like home would we ever again sit at the trestle table drinking scotch in celebration of success would we again lounge in those hard uncomfortable chairs talking of a huge freighter fleet and our plans for a constant stream of aircraft tramping the globe and as these questions appeared in my mind my stomach suddenly became an empty void as panic hit me suppose those pistons id worked on when i first arrived were not quite true suppose a whole stream of ugly possibilities flooded through my mind and what about the engine that had been completed before i arrived my hands tightened automatically on the control column as i felt the tail lift i glanced at saeton his face was tense his eyes fixed unblinkingly ahead one hand on the throttles the other on the control column i saw his left foot kick at the rudder to counter a sudden swing of the tail the end of the runway was in sight now it ran slightly downhill and a bunch of oaks was rushing to meet us no chance now of pulling up we were committed to the takeoff the new starboard engine was still running a little rough the tail swung left rudder again i held my breath god he was leaving it late i should have been watching the rev counters and the airspeed indicator but instead my eyes were fixed on the trees ahead they seemed to fill all my vision then the control column eased back under my tense clutched hands the wheels bumped wildly on a tornup piece of concrete the starboard motor still sounded rough the tail swung and the engine notes changed to a quieter drone we were riding air smooth steady the seat lifting me upwards as the trees slid away below us through the side window i saw membury dropping away to a black circle of plough crisscrossed by the white pattern of runways and circled by the darker line of the perimeter track the hangars small rectangles that looked like toys we were airborne and climbing steeply the full thrust of the motors taking us up in a steady circling climb i glanced at saeton his body had relaxed into the shape of his seat that was the only sign he gave of relief check undercarriage up he shouted to me as he levelled out i glanced out of the side window the starboard wheel was up inside the wing casing and i nodded his eyes remained hard and alert scanning the instrument panel tubby was jotting down notes as he read the dials oil pressure oil temp coolant temp revs with the exception of the inboard starboard engine which read vacuum pressure ins height we cruised around for a bit checking everything then we began to climb oil pressure oil temp coolant temp revs plus vacuum pressure i glanced at my watch rate of climb feet a minute at saeton levelled out okay to cut out the other motors he glanced down at tubby who nodded his face unsmiling his eyes almost lost in their creases of fat as he screwed them up against the sun which drove straight in through the windshield at the same moment i saw the outboard engine slow the individual blades of the prop became visible as it began to feather the noise in the cockpit had lessened so had the vibration we were flying on our own motors only airspeed height still climbing swindon lay below us as we turned east banking sharply the two motors hummed quietly saeton pulled back the control column the nose of the plane lifted we were climbing on the two engines only six thousand five hundred seven thousand eight thousand rate of climb feet per minute half a dozen banking turns then a long dive to and up again the motors hummed happily the starboard engine was a shade rough perhaps and engine revs were a little below those of the port motor but there was plenty of power there saeton levelled out i could do with a cigarette he was grinning happily now all tension smoothed out of his face from now on we can forget all the hours weve slaved at those engines theyre there they exist weve done what we set out to do tubby was smiling too his face wreathed in a happy grin he hummed a little tune we swung south over white horse hill the racing gallops at lambourne showed like ageold tracks along the downs climb turn dive for two hours we flew the circuit of the marlborough downs then at last saeton said okay lets go back and get some tea tomorrow well do takeoff and landing tests then well try her under full load and check petrol consumption i want that starboard motor back on bench tests first tubby shouted saeton nodded vaguely for him it was all settled hed proved the motors it only remained to get them to the highest pitch of efficiency okay he answered weve plenty of time ill fix airworthiness tests for the latter part of next week he eased the control column forward and we slid down towards the rounded brown humps of the downs ramsbury airfield slid away beneath us the kennet showing like a twisting ribbon of steel in the cold light of the sinking sun membury opened out on the hill ahead of us the two outboard motors started into life ready to land we nodded saeton looked down through the side theres a bottle of whisky down there he grinned as we peered down at the felted roof of our quarters pity diana isnt here to see this he said it without thinking i glanced at tubby his face gave no sign that hed heard better get your undercarriage down tubby said saeton laughed if you think im going to prang the thing now youre wrong his hand reached down and found the undercarriage release switch automatically he pulled it up and glanced out of his side window then he turned quickly peered down at the lever and jerked at it in the tenseness of his face i read sudden panic i turned to my own side window and craning forward peered back at the line of the wing the starboard wheel is down i reported saeton was flicking at the switch its the port wheel he said staring out of his window the bloody things jammed i dont think he was frightened for himself the panic that showed in his face was for all our achievement that could be set at nought by a crash landing i told you we ought to check over the plane tubby shouted back peering forward over the lever thats a hell of a lot of use now saetons voice rasped through his clenched teeth neil take over climb to whilst we try and sort this bastard out tubby see if shell come down on the hand gear i felt the control column go slack under my hands as he eased himself out of his seat i took hold of it at the same time reaching out for the throttle levers the engines responded to my touch and membury dropped away from us as i pulled the control column back and climbed under full power banking steadily saeton and tubby were trying to wind the port wheel down but the handle seemed to be alternately jamming and running free at feet i levelled out they had the floorboards up and tubby was head down in the gap a steady blast of bitterly cold air roared into the cockpit for an hour i stooged round and round over membury and at the end of that hour tubby straightened up his face blue with cold and stood there blowing on his ringers well saeton demanded tubby shook his head nothing we can do he said the connecting rod is snapped a fault probably anyway its snapped and theres no way of lowering the port side undercarriage saeton didnt speak for a moment his face was grey and haggard the best we can hope for then is to make a decent pancake landing his voice was a flat monotone as though all the weariness of the last few weeks had crowded in on him at this moment youre absolutely sure theres nothing we can do he asked tubby the other shook his head nothing the connecting rod has snapped and all right you said that once im not that dense he had pulled a packet of cigarettes out of his pocket he handed it to me i took one and he lit it for me it was a measure of his acceptance of the facts of the situation he would never have smoked in the cockpit unless he had abandoned all hope the lights fading i said and we havent much gas left he nodded drawing in a lungful of smoke better make for upavon tubby shouted it was an raf station and i knew what was in his mind there would be crash squads there and ambulances no well go back to membury saeton answered you two get aft have the door of the fuselage open ill take you over the airfield at feet winds easterly about force jump just before i cross the edge of the field he climbed back into his seat all right neil ill take over now i felt the pressure of his hands as he gripped the other control column and i let go of mine tubby started to protest but saeton rounded on him for gods sake do as youre told jump at the edge of the field no point in more than one of us getting hurt and as you so tactfully point out its my fault of course we should have checked the plane out of the tail of my eye i saw the starboard wheel folding into the wing again im sorry bill tubby said i didnt mean dont argue get aft you too fraser his voice was almost vicious in his wretchedness and then with that quick change of mood good luck both of you i had hesitated halfout of my seat his face was set in a grim mask as he stared straight ahead of him thrusting the control column forward dipping the nose to a long glide towards the airfield tubby jerked his head for me to follow him and disappeared through the door that communicated with the fuselage good luck i murmured saetons eyes flicked towards me and he gave a bitter laugh ive had all the good luck i need he snarled i knew what he meant whether he came out of the plane alive or dead he was finished for a moment i still hesitated i had a crazy idea that he might intend to crash the plane straight into the ground what the hell are you waiting for i think id better stay i said if i stayed hed be forced to make an attempt to land he must have sensed what was at the back of my mind for he suddenly laughed you dont know very much about me do you neil the snarl had gone out of his voice but his eyes remained hard and bitter go on get back aft with tubby and dont be a fool i dont like heroics and then suddenly shouting at me get aft man do you hear or have i got to come down there myself and throw you out his eyes narrowed ever jumped before once i answered my mind mirroring the memory of that night landing in the woods of westphalia hanging in the straps with my parachute caught in a tree and my arm broken scared eh the sneer was intentional i knew that he was goading me to jump and yet i reacted i reacted as he wanted me to because i was scared id always been scared of having to bale out after that one experience of course im not scared i snapped and turned and moved awkwardly to the fuselage the weight of my parachute bouncing against my buttocks tubby already had the door of the fuselage open the rush of air made it bitterly cold the plane was turning now over the hangars losing height rapidly he didnt say anything you havent room for anything else in your mind when you are faced with a jump we caught a glimpse of the quarters looking very neat and snug in its little patch of trees i could even make out the henrun at the back with the white dots of two or three fowl then we were banking for the runin the trees slid away under us i saw the snaking line of the road coming up from ramsbury then over tubbys shoulder i made out the edge of the airfield he glanced at me with a quick nervous grin gripped my arm tightly and then still looking at me fell outwards into space i watched his body turn over and over saw his hand pull at the release of his parachute the canopy of nylon blossomed like a flower and his body steadied swinging rhythmically we were right over the airfield now my limbs felt cold and stiff the sweat stood out on my forehead i heard saeton scream at me to jump saw him clambering out of the pilots seat he was going to leave the controls come aft and throw me out i closed my eyes quickly gripped the cold metal of the release lever and fell forward into the howl of the slipstream my legs swung over the back of my neck opening my eyes i saw the sky the sun the horizon coming up the wrong way as though i were in a loop the airfield rolling under me then i jerked at the release jerked at it again and again in desperate fear that it wouldnt work suddenly my shoulders were wrenched from their sockets the inside of my legs cut by the hard pull of the straps my legs fell into place sky and earth sorted themselves out i was dangling in space no wind no sound only the fading roar of the plane as it climbed a black dot over the far side of the airfield above me the white cloud of the parachute swung gently beautifully the airhole showing a dark patch of sky twisting my head i saw tubby touch the ground roll over and over in a perfect drill landing then he was scrambling to his feet pulling in his parachute legs braced against the drag of it emptying the air till it lay in an inert white fold at his feet travelling with the light wind the air was quite still it was as though i were suspended there over the airfield for all eternity there seemed to be no movement time and space stood still as i dangled like a daylight firework the drone of the plane had died away it had vanished as though it had never been the stillness was allpervading pleasant yet rather frightening though the movement was imperceptible my position gradually altered in relation to the ground i was gliding steadily along the line of the eastwest runway i tried to work out my angle of drop in relation to the trees bordering the airfield near the quarters but it was quite impossible to gauge the rate of fall all i know is that one moment i was dangling up there apparently motionless and the next the concrete end of the runway was rushing up to meet me i hit the concrete with my legs too firmly braced for the shock i hit it as though id jumped from a building into the street the jar of the touchdown ran up my spine and hammered at my head and then all was confusion as my parachute harness jerked me forward i had the sense to throw up my arms and duck my head into the protection of my shoulder as i hit the concrete i remember being pitched forward and over and then there was a stunning blow on the front of my head and i lost consciousness i couldnt have been out for long because i came round to find myself being slowly dragged along the concrete by my shoulders i dug my hands and feet in anchoring myself for a moment blood ran down my face and dripped into a crack in the concrete somebody shouted to me and i caught hold of the strings of the parachute struggling to fold it as id been taught to do but i hadnt the strength i dropped back halfunconscious a feeling of terrible lassitude running along my muscles the pull of my shoulders slackened somebody stooped over me and fingers worked at the harness buckles neil are you all right please i looked up then it was else what are you doing here i asked i had some difficulty in getting my breath i came to see the test what has happened why have you jumped the undercarriage i said the undercarriage then it is not the engines the engines are all right yes the engines are all right its the undercarriage wont come down i looked up at her and saw that she was staring up into the sky her eyes alight with some emotion that i couldnt understand why are you so excited i asked her because she looked down at me quickly her mouth clamped shut come i help you up now she placed her hands under my arms the world spun as i found my feet and leaned heavily against her waiting for the aerodrome to stop spinning blood trickled into my mouth and i put my hand to my forehead it was the old cut that had reopened and i thought this is where i came in what about tubby is he all right yes he is coming here now i shook the blood out of my eyes a small dot was running down the runway he shouted something i didnt understand at first then i remembered saeton and the aircraft ambulance of course the quarters were not five hundred yards away quick else i must get to the phone a muscle in one of my legs seemed to have been wrenched it was hell running but i made it in the end and seized hold of the telephone my voice when i spoke to the operator was a breathless sob she put me through to the swindon hospital and then to the fire brigade tubby came in as i finished phoning ambulance and fire brigade coming i said good youd better lie down neil your head looks bad im all right i said what about the plane the need for action had given me strength saetons stooging round over the field at about feet using up his remaining gas he turned to else youd better get some water on to heat he may be a bit of a mess when we get him in she nodded quickly and hurried out to the kitchen whats that girl doing here he asked me but he didnt seem to expect an answer for he went straight out to the airfield i followed him looking up into the sun brought a blinding pain to my eyes but by screwing them up i could see the glint of the plane as it banked the air was very still in the shelter of the woods and the sound of the engines seemed quite loud time passed slowly we stood there in silence waiting for the inevitable moment when the plane would cease its interminable circling and dive away over the horizon for the final approach my legs began to feel weak and i sat down on the ground why dont you go and lie down tubby asked his voice sounded irritable ill stay here i said i wasnt thinking of saeton then i was thinking of the plane there it was flying perfectly only that damned undercarriage stood between us and success it seemed a hard twist of fate i have arrange plenty of hot water it was else she had a steaming bowl with her and she plumped down beside me now we can fix that cut eh i winced as the hot water touched the open cut across my forehead the water smelt strongly of disinfectant then she bandaged my head and it felt better that is finished now you look like you are a wounded man so i am i said her face hung over me framed by the darkening blue of the sky she looked young and soft and rather maternal my head was in her lap i could feel the softness of her limbs against the back of my skull we should have been lying like that in a hay field in may the distant drone of the aircraft was like the sound of bees i caught the gleam of its wings just beyond her hair where the devils the ambulance tubby demanded hes coming in now i glanced at my watch it was twenty minutes since id phoned theyll be here in about ten minutes i told him he grunted a curse theyll be here too late then i could see the plane gliding over ramsbury a black dot against the sunset i thought of the engine we had laboured to complete all these weeks of saeton alone up there at the controls the pain of my head was nothing then my eyes were trained on the sky over ramsbury and every fibre of my being was concentrated on the plane which was banking sharply as it disappeared behind the trees turning for the final approach it seemed an age before it appeared again then suddenly it was there over the end of the runway hanging like a great clumsy bird over the trees dropping towards the concrete its landing flaps down the props turning slowly i scrambled to my feet and began to run tubby was running too saeton levelled out for the touchdown and as the gap between plane and concrete lessened the aircraft seemed to gather speed till it was rushing towards us then the belly hit the concrete pieces of metal were flung wide there was a horrible scraping but when the sound reached me the plane had bounced several feet above the runway it came down then with a splintering crash swivelling round the fuselage breaking up as the tail disintegrated grinding the concrete to puffs of powder the metal sheeting stripping from her belly like tinplate she slewed broadside tipping crazily righted herself straightened up and broke in half the appalling grinding sound went on for a second after she had stopped then there was a sudden frightening silence the plane lay there a crumpled wreck unnaturally still nothing moved the sunset was just as red the trees just as black nothing had changed as though the aerodrome had taken no interest in the accident somebody had pranged a plane it had happened here countless times during the war life went on tubby was running towards the machine for a second i stood rooted to the spot my stomach quivering in expectation of the sudden blossoming of the wreck into a blazing fury of fire but it just lay there inert and lifeless and i too started to run we got saeton out there was a lot of blood but it was from his nose he was unconscious when we laid him on the concrete his hand badly cut and a livid bruise across his forehead but his pulse beat was quite strong tubby loosened his collar and almost immediately his eyes opened staring up at us blankly then suddenly there was life behind them and he sat up with a jerk that brought a groan from his lips hows the plane is she his voice stopped as his eyes took in the wreck oh god he murmured he began to swear then a string of obscene oaths that ignored elses presence and were directed solely at the plane the engines are all right tubby said consolingly whats the good of engines without a plane saeton snarled i got the tail too low he began swearing again you better lie back tubby said theres nothing you can do about the plane just relax now the ambulance will be here in a minute ambulance he glared at us what damn fool phoned for an ambulance he got out his handkerchief and wiped some of the blood from his face get down to the main road and stop them he ordered tubby hoarsely tell them its all right tell them there wasnt any crash after all anything so long as you get them away from here without them coming on to the airfield but even if youre all right theres neil here needing treatment tubby said then take him with you and pack him off to hospital but i dont want them on the field i dont want them to know weve crashed but why tubby asked why saeton passed his hand across his eyes and spat blood on to the concrete i dont know why i just dont want anyone to know about this now for gods sake stop arguing and get down to the road tubby hesitated that nose of yours looks as though its broken he said and there may be something else theres nothing else broken saeton snarled if there is ill get to a doctor under my own steam now get going tubby glanced at me im all right i said he nodded and started at a steady trot across the field towards the quarters saeton struggled to his feet and stood there swaying weakly staring at the wreckage bitter black despair in his eyes then as he turned away he caught sight of else and his thick hands clenched with sudden violence of purpose i thought you were going back to germany he said hoarsely i go on monday her eyes were wide and she looked frightened wanted to be in at the death eh you timed it nicely i do not understand you do not understand eh he mimicked her crudely i suppose you dont understand what happened up there he was moving towards her staggering slightly the sweat standing out in great drops on his forehead and running down into his eyes well the connecting rod was snapped we couldnt lower the undercarriage that surprises you eh you didnt know the connecting rod was broken the expression on his face held me rooted to the spot it was a bloody mask of hatred else stood quite still her eyes wide her mouth slightly open and then suddenly she was talking talking fast the words tumbling out of her as though in themselves they could form a barrier between herself and what was moving so inevitably upon her i do not touch your plane i have nothing to do with what has happened please you must believe me why should i do this thing these are my fathers engines my fathers and mine i wish them to fly i wish to see them in the air it is all i have left of him it is the work we do together he was happy then and i was happy also i want them to fly i want them your fathers engines the contempt in his voice stopped her like a slap in the face theyre my engines mine your fathers engine wouldnt work it crashed i broke my leg trying to fly the bloody thing it was no good we had to start again all over again a new design she flung up her head then facing him like a tigress defending her young it is not a new design it is different but it is the same principle those engines belong to him they are he laughed it was a wild violent sound youve smashed what ive lived for for three years youre happy now arent you you think now that germany will get control of them again but she wont he was very close to her now you tried to kill us well now im going to thats a lie she cried i have nothing to do with it nobody has touched the airplane then why are you here on the spot gloating oh will you never understand she cried furiously i come to see them up there in the air they are my fathers work do you think it is no excitement for me to see them fly please i have nothing to do with the crash his hands had reached out to her and gripped her shoulders she was suddenly pleading i have done nothing nothing you must believe what i say but he didnt seem to hear her you tried to kill us he whispered hoarsely you tried to smash everything i have worked for first you try to bribe me with your body then you try to get control of my company when you dont succeed you try to destroy what ive worked for if you cant get what you want you must destroy it that is the german in you everything you touch you destroy and always you work for germany not for germany she cried only for my father everything i do i do for my father why could you not give him the credit for what he do youre a part of the germany ive hated since i was a kid he went on his voice thick as though clotted with blood his hands gripping her violently fumbling blindly for her throat my father in one war my mother in another all you can do is smash and break things and now im going to break you break you in little pieces her eyes stared wildly as his blunt fingers dug into her neck then she began to struggle and in that instant i came to life and moved forward but i neednt have bothered his hands clawed at her clothes and his body slowly sagged against her his knees giving under him and pitching him forward on to his face saeton had fainted else stared down at him fear and horror stamped on her face i think she thought he was dead i didnt do anything to the airplane the words were a strangled sob neil she glanced wildly at me nobody touched the airplane you must believe that saeton moved suddenly his fingers digging into the earth scrabbling at it as he tried to rise and when he had pushed himself up on to his knees she broke and ran tubby came back and we got saeton to the quarters and put him to bed his ribs were badly bruised but nothing seemed to be broken it was more shock than anything else still halfdazed he ordered us to get one of ellwoods tractors and have the wreckage dragged into the hangar he wanted it done that night he seemed to have an unreasoned instinctive urge to get the evidence of failure under cover as quickly as possible it was as though he felt none of his own injuries only the hurts of the aircraft and wanted to let it crawl away into the dark like a dog to lick its wounds by ten oclock that night it was done and all trace of the crash landing was concealed behind the closed doors of the hangar the plane was a hell of a mess the tractor took it in in two pieces the tail having ripped off completely as soon as we began to drag the wreck along the concrete saeton himself came out to the runway to make sure there was no trace of the accident left whether the plan had formed in his mind then i cant be certain personally i dont think so it was a matter of instinct rather than planning if nobody knew we had crashed there might still be a chance at any rate if the idea was in his mind it didnt show that evening as we sat over a drink and tried to sort out the future tubby was through that was clear from the start im going back to flying he said his tone was obstinate and quite final you know francis harcourt hes got two tudors on the tanking lift and hes back in england now negotiating the purchase of two more just before christmas he wrote asking me to join him as a flight engineer and youve accepted saeton asked for answer tubby produced an envelope from his pocket it was already stamped and sealed weve still a month before were due on the airlift if we hold the air ministry to their first date saeton said quietly a month tubby grunted six months wouldnt see that kite ready to fly six months and a lot of money he leaned forward and caught saeton by the arm listen bill ive worked with you for nothing for just on two years i havent got a bean out of it if you think i can go on any longer youre crazy anyway where the hell would you get the money from youve cleaned me out youve just about cleaned neil out we owe money all over the place the company is broke finished his voice softened as he saw the bitter set of saetons mouth below the bandages im sorry chum i know what this means to you but youve got to face the facts we cant go on cant we well i say we can i dont know how yet but ill find a way youll see me on the airlift next month ill do it somehow his voice was trembling but it had no conviction only violence his fist beat at the table if you think im going to let a little bitch of a german destroy everything ive worked for youre wrong i dont care what it costs me ill get those engines into the air how do you know she was responsible for what happened i asked of course she was he snarled either her or one of the rauch motoren agents you cant be certain i said cant be certain damn it man how else could it have happened she tracked me down to this airfield how she did it i dont know but suddenly she arrived at the manor and because we were shorthanded i got her to come up and cook and clean for us in the evenings i thought she was just a dp it never occurred to me she was professor meyers daughter when did you discover who she really was i asked that night you arrived and found us together in the hangar he suddenly clicked his fingers she must have done it then its the only time shes ever been alone in the hangar are you seriously suggesting the girl filed through the undercarriage connecting rod tubby asked she an engineer isnt she and she had about half an hour up there on her own she couldnt be sure the plan to buy up the outfit through randalls mortgages would succeed anyway whats it matter he added his tone suddenly rising finding out whether it was german thoroughness or a natural break wont put the crate back into the air well sort it out tomorrow he spoke through clenched teeth and his hands trembled as he thrust back his chair i think he was in the grip of a bitter raging anger on the verge of tears the man was dead beat anyway and his nerves must have been just about stretched to the edge of screaming hysteria he had risen to his feet and he stood staring at tubby are you going to post that letter yes tubby answered all right the veins on saetons forehead seemed to swell but remember this join harcourts outfit and youre through with this company understand i understand tubby said in a level tone you bloody fool saeton said and went out slamming the door i was pretty tired and my head ached i followed him out and was asleep almost before my head touched the pillow i awoke in a mood of despair my job was gone and i was broke the future was bleak i longed to be back at the bench driven beyond physical endurance to complete something that i believed in it was a chill grey morning frost riming the windows and the wind moaning round the building tubby produced tea and bacon and eggs in a mood of contrition for deserting us breakfast did nothing to lift us out of our gloom we ate in silence and went out to the hangar i suppose in the five weeks i had been there i had gradually come to identify my future with the plane seeing it lying there in the drab light its metal all broken and twisted the tail completely severed and lying like a piece of discarded junk gave me a sense of sudden loneliness this was the end of our work together we were no longer a team but three individuals going our own separate ways it was this i think that made me feel so wretched id felt safe here and complete id been doing something id come to believe in and there had been a goal to work for now there was nothing we cleared the torn metal away from the fuselage working to reach the undercarriage and find out what had gone wrong it was a useless investigation whatever we discovered it wouldnt help us we worked slowly almost unwillingly and in silence shortly before eleven the phone rang it was harcourt asking for tubby saeton and i stood listening yes yes ill be there diana is already in germany well maybe shell fix it to get to the gatow canteen fine ill meet you there tubbys eyes gleamed excitedly and he was whistling happily to himself as he replaced the receiver well when do you leave saeton barked in the hard impersonal tone he used when he wished to hide his own feelings he wants me down at northolt at ten oclock tomorrow tubby answered then youd better get moving saeton said abruptly its all right ill get a train this evening i dont want to leave without knowing what the trouble was hell man what difference does it make id like to know all the same tubby answered woodenly saeton turned away with a shrug of his shoulders well lets get on with the postmortem it was useless for him to pretend that he didnt care what had caused the break he did care he was looking for something to fight he was that sort but when we got to the connecting rod it showed a clean break and unmistakable signs of faulty casting so it wasnt else after all i said no he threw the broken rod on to the concrete and turned away better see if you can fix fraser up with a job on the airlift he said to tubby over his shoulder and he slammed out of the hangar tubby left that afternoon and with his departure a tense brooding gloom settled on the quarters saeton was impossible it wasnt only that he wouldnt talk he prowled up and down constantly irritably on the move lost in his own morose thoughts he was racking his brains for a means of getting on the airlift with the engines by th january once he turned to me his eyes wild his face looking grey and slightly crazy with his nose covered with adhesive plaster im desperate he said id do anything to get hold of a plane anything do you hear at that moment i was prepared to believe hed commit murder if he were sure of getting another aircraft as a result of it the man was desperate it showed in his eyes in the way he talked he hadnt given up hope i think that was what made the atmosphere so frightening he wasnt quite sane a sane man would see that the thing was impossible but he wouldnt he was still thinking in terms of getting those engines into the air it was incredible incredible and frightening no man should be driven by such violent singleness of purpose youre crazy i said crazy he laughed and his laugh was pitched a shade too high then he suddenly smiled in an odd secretive way yes perhaps youre right perhaps i am crazy all pioneers are crazy but believe me ill get into the air if i have to steal a plane he stopped then and stared at me fixedly in an odd sort of way then he smiled again yes he said slowly reflectively ill get on to the airlift somehow he went out then and i heard his feet dragging slowly down the frostbound path until the sound lost itself in the noise of the wind blowing through the trees i went down to the manor to see else i wanted to tell her that we knew she had had nothing to do with the failure of the undercarriage that it was in fact an accident but she had already gone she had taken the afternoon train to london because she had to be at harwich early the following morning to catch the boat i returned to the quarters feeling that my last link with the past few weeks had gone the next two days were hell i just drifted clinging desperately to membury to the hangar and the quarters i just couldnt nerve myself to face the outside world i was afraid of it afraid of the fact that i had no job and only a few pounds left in my account the memory of else haunted me god knows why i wasnt in love with her i told myself that a hundred times but it made no differencei needed a woman someone to attach myself to i was as rudderless as the wreck lying in the hangar to give me something to do saeton had told me to get to work with the oxyacetylene cutter and clean up the mess it was like operating on the broken body of a friend we lifted our two engines out of her and she looked like a toothless old hag waiting for the inevitable end i could have wept for what might have been a thousand times i remembered those supreme moments up in the air over membury when we had climbed superbly majestically on the power of the engines wed made i had felt then as though all the world lay within my grasp and now i was cleaning up the wreck cutting out the sections that had been torn to strips of tin by the concrete of the runway saeton didnt even pretend that we were working to repair the plane and yet he wasnt morose any more there was a sort of jauntiness in the way he walked and ever new and then id catch him watching me with a soft secretive smile his manner wasnt natural and i found myself wishing that hed begin cursing again wishing hed make up my mind for me by throwing me off the place well i had my wish in the end he made up my mind for me but it wasnt at all the way i had expected it it was the third evening after tubbys departure we were back in the quarters and the phone rang saeton leapt up eagerly and went into the office the room that tubby and diana had had as a bedroom i heard the murmur of his voice and then the sound of the bell as he replaced the receiver there was a pause before his footsteps came slowly across the passage and the door of the mess room opened he didnt close it immediately but stood there framed in the doorway staring at me his head sunk into his shoulders his chin thrust slightly out a queer glint of excitement in his eyes that was tubby he said slowly hes found you a job a job i felt a tingle of apprehension run along my nerves what sort of a job flying for the harcourt charter company he came in and shut the door his movements were oddly slow and deliberate he reminded me of a big cat he sat himself down on the trestle table his thick powerful body seemed to tower above me youre to pilot one of harcourts new tudors i got on to tubby two days ago about it and hes fixed it i began to stammer my thanks my voice sounded odd and far away from me as though it were somebody else speaking i was in a panic i didnt want to leave membury i didnt want to lose that illusion of security the place had given me youre to meet harcourt at northolt for lunch tomorrow saeton went on one oclock in the canteen tubby will be there to introduce you its an incredible piece of luck the excitement had spread from his eyes to his voice now the pilot he had engaged has gone down with pneumonia he stopped and stared at me his face faintly flushed as though he had been drinking his eyes sparkling like a kid that sees the thing hes dreamed of come true at last how much do these engines weve built mean to you neil he asked suddenly i didnt know quite what to say but apparently he didnt expect an answer for he added quickly listen those engines are okay youve seen that for yourself youve got to take my word for it about the saving in fuel consumption its about per cent tubby and i proved that in the bench tests on the first engine now suppose we got into the air as planned on january but we cant i cried you know very well the engines are all right arent they all we need is a new plane he was leaning down over me now his eyes fixed on mine as though trying to mesmerise me weve still got a chance neil harcourts planes are tudors in a few days time youll be at wunstorf and flying into berlin suppose something went wrong with the engines over the russian zone he paused watching for my reaction but i didnt say anything i suddenly felt icecold inside all youve got to do is to order your crew to bale out he went on speaking slowly as though talking to a child its as easy as that a little playacting a little organised panic and youll be alone in the cockpit of a tudor all youve got to do then is to make straight for membury i stared at him foolishly you are crazy i heard myself say youd never get away with it thered be an inquiry the plane would be recognised when they saw it again harcourts not a fool besides he stopped me with a wave of his hand youre wrong to begin with an inquiry would show nothing the crew would say the plane had made a forced landing in the russian zone the russians would deny it nobody would believe them as for the plane being recognised why should it nobody knows weve crashed our machine here at least they dont know how badly all that happens is that a plane disappears on the berlin airlift and on january another flies in to take its place harcourts all right he gets his insurance the countrys all right for the number of tudors remains the same god man it sticks out a mile youll make a fortune well both of us make a fortune youd never get away with it i repeated obstinately of course ill get away with it why should they ever suspect anything and if they did what then look part numbers and engine numbers can be altered to those of our wrecked tudor our own two engines will be in her as for our own plane well cut it up into small bits youve already started on that work in a few days we could have the whole plane in fragments a load of those fragments can be strewn over russian territory the rest well dump in that pond over on the far side of the airfield god its too easy all i need is for you to fly harcourts plane back here well i wont do it i said angrily do you want the germans to be the first to produce these engines his hand came out and gripped my shoulder just think before you refuse damn it havent you a spark of adventure in you a slight risk and this country can have the biggest fleet of freighters in the world a global monopoly his eyes were blazing and i suddenly felt scared the man was a fanatic i wont do it i repeated stubbornly when youve flown the plane in here all we have to do is drop you just inside the british zone he went on you report back to wunstorf with the story that you made a forced landing in the russian zone and got back under your own steam across the frontier its childs play i wont do it he gave an ugly laugh scared eh i hesitated trying to sort out in my mind whether it was because i was scared or whether my refusal was on moral grounds i couldnt sort it out all i knew was that i didnt want to be mixed up in anything like this i wanted to forget that sense of being hunted i didnt want ever again to have anything on my conscience to have to run and hide i didnt want to be afraid of the world any more he suddenly let go my arm all right he said and i didnt like the softness in his voice and the way he smiled down at me all right if thats the way you feel he paused watching me with an odd expression in his eyes do you remember the other evening i said id do anything to get hold of a plane i nodded well i meant that i meant every word of it i said i was desperate i am desperate if one mans life stood between me and getting into the air id kill that man id brush him out of my way without a thought bigger things than a single life are involved its not just my own future im thinking of dont think that i happen to believe in my country and i believe that these engines are the greatest contribution i can make to my country theres nothing i wont do to see these engines are operated by a british concern nothing nothing his voice had risen and there was a wild look in his eyes forget about yourself forget about me wont you do this for your country no i said god man you fought for your country in war you risked your life have some imagination cant you fight for her in peacetime im not asking you to risk your life all im asking you to do is to fly that plane back here whats the trouble youre not damaging harcourt or is it the risk youre afraid of i tell you there isnt any risk do it the way ive planned it and youre as safe as houses youve nothing to be afraid of im not afraid i answered hotly whats the trouble then i just dont like it and i wont do it he sighed and eased himself off the edge of the table all right if thats the way you want it he stood for a moment looking down at me the room was suddenly very silent i felt my nerves tightening so that i wanted to shout at him to do anything to relieve the tension at length he said if you dont do what i want you to ill turn you over to the police he spoke quite flatly and my inside seemed to curl up into a tight ball you were in a prison camp werent you you know what its like then three years in prison is quite a slice out of a mans life do you think you could stand it youd go mad wouldnt you you were on the edge of hysteria when you came here youre all right now but in prison you bastard i screamed at him suddenly finding my voice i called him a lot of other names i had got to my feet and i was trembling all over the sweat breaking out in prickling patches across my scalp and trickling down my forehead i was cold with fear and anger and he just stood there watching me his shoulders hunched a little forward as though expecting me to charge him a quiet confident smile on his lips well he said as i paused for breath which is it to be youre crazy i cried and youre trying to drive me crazy too i wont do it suppose one of the crew were killed suppose they did discover what had happened and if i did it then id have something on you you wouldnt stand for that somehow youd get rid of me youre not doing this for your country youre doing it for yourself your love of power is driving you driving you over the edge of reason you cant get away with a thing like which is it tobe he cut in his lips tightening and his voice suddenly cold and metallic do you take this job with harcourt or do i telephone the police ill give you half an hour to make up your mind he hesitated and then said slowly just remember what its like to be locked away in a cell seeing the sun through iron bars with no hope and no future when you get out im offering you a flying job and a future now sit down and make up your mind he turned abruptly then and went out with the closing of the door the room seemed suddenly empty and silent the key grated in the lock it was like the turning of the key in the solitary confinement cells only there the door had been of metal and had clanged stalag luft with its lines of huts the barbed wire the endless march of the guards the searchlights at night the deadly monotony was there in my mind as vivid as though i had only just escaped surely god id had enough of life behind bars surely to god chapter five i wont attempt to defend my decision saeton had asked me to steal a plane and i agreed to do it i must take full responsibility therefore for all that happened afterwards as a result of that decision we went down to ramsbury and in the smoky warmth of the pub that faces the old oak he went over the plan in detail i know it sounds incredible to steal a plane off such a highly organised operation as the berlin airlift and then after replacing two of the engines to fly it back to germany and operate it from the same airfield from which it had been stolen but he had it all worked out and when he had gone over all the details it didnt seem incredible any more the devil of it was the mans enthusiasm was infectious i can see him now talking softly in the hubbub of the bar his eyes glittering with excitement smoking cigarette after cigarette his voice vibrant as he reached out into my mind to give me the sense of adventure that he felt himself the essence of his personality was that he could make others believe what he believed in any project he gave himself to it so completely that it was impossible not to follow him he was a born leader from being an unwilling participant i became a willing one out of apparent failure he conjured the hope of success and he gave me something positive to work for i think it was the daring of the plan that attracted me more than anything else and of course i was up to the hilt in the thing financially i may have thought it was money better thrown away considering how id got it but no one likes to be broke when he is shown a way to make a fortune the only thing he didnt allow for was the human factor as we left the pub he said youll be seeing tubby tomorrow dont tell him anything about this you understand hes not to know his family were methodists he grinned at me as though that explained everything that constituted tubby carters makeup early the following morning saeton drove me to hungerford station riding behind him on the old motor bike through the white of the frozen kennet valley i felt a wild sense of exhilaration for over five weeks i hadnt been more than a few miles from membury aerodrome now i was going back into the world twentyfour hours ago i should have been scared at the prospect afraid that i might be picked up by the police now i didnt think about it i was bound for germany riding a mood of adventure that left no room in my mind for the routine activities of the law tubby met me at northolt glad to see you neil he said beaming all over his face his hand gripping my arm bit of luck morgan going sick not that i wish the poor chap any harm but it just happened right for you harcourt leaves for wunstorf with one of the tudors this evening youre flying a test with him this afternoon in our plane i glanced at him quickly our plane he nodded grinning thats right youre skipper im engineer a youngster called harry westrop is radio operator and the navigator is a fellow named field come on up to the canteen and meet them theyre all here i could have wished that tubby wasnt to be a member of the crew i immediately wanted to tell him the whole thing maybe it would have been better if i had but i remembered what saeton had said and seeing tubbys honest friendly features i knew saeton was right it was out of the question duty not adventure was his business in life but it was going to make it that bit more difficult when i ordered the crew to bale out i began to feel nervous then it was a long time since id flown operationally a long time since id skippered an air crew we went into the bar and tubby introduced me to the rest of the crew westrop was tall and rather shy with fair crinkly hair he was little more than a kid field was much older a small sourlooking man with sharp eyes and a sharper nose what are you having skipper field asked the word skipper brought back memories of almostforgotten nights of bombing i ordered a scotch field is just out of the raf tubby said hes been flying the airlift since the early days at wunstorf why did you pack up your commission i asked him he shrugged his shoulders i got bored besides theres more money in civil flying he looked at me narrowly out of his small unsmiling eyes i hear you were in squadron do you remember that started the reminiscences and then suddenly he said you got a gong for that escape of yours didnt you i nodded he looked at the ceiling and pursed his thin lips i could see the mans mind thinking back i remember now longest tunnel escape of the war and then three weeks on the run before he hesitated and then snapped his fingers of course you were the bloke that flew a jerry plane out werent you yes i said i was feeling suddenly tight inside any moment hed ask me what id been doing since then by jove thats wizard westrops voice was boyish and eager what happened how did you get the plane id rather not talk about it i said awkwardly oh but dash it i mean i tell you i dont want to talk about it damn it suppose his parachute didnt open i didnt want any heroworship i must keep apart from the crew until after the first night flight i only thought shut up my voice sounded harsh and violent heres your drink tubby said quietly pushing the glass towards me then he turned to westrop better go and check over your radar equipment harry but ive just checked it then check it again tubby said in the same quiet voice westrop hesitated glancing from tubby to me then he turned away with a crestfallen look hes only a kid tubby said and picked up his drink well heres to the airlift heres to the airlift i wondered whether he remembered the four of us drinking that toast in the mess room at membury it all seemed a long time ago i turned to field what planes were you navigating on the lift i asked him yorks he replied wunstorf to gatow with food for the bloody jerry he knocked back his drink queer isnt it just over three years ago i was navigating bombers to berlin loaded with five hundred pounders now for the last four months ive been delivering flour to them flour thats paid for by britain and america do you think theyd have done that for us he gave a bitter laugh well heres to the ruskies god rot em but for them we could have been a lot tougher you dont like the germans i asked glad of the change in conversation he gave me a thinlipped smile you should know about them youve been inside one of their camps they give me the creeps theyre a grim humourless lot of bastards as for democracy they think its the biggest joke since hitler wiped out lidice ever read miltons paradise lost well thats germany dont lets talk about it do you know wunstorf i bombed it once in the early days i said its changed a bit since then so has gatow weve enlarged them a bit i think youll be quite impressed and the run in to gatow is like nothing youve ever done before you just go in like a bus service and you keep rolling after touchdown because you know damn well theres either another kite coming down or taking off right on your tail but theyll give you a full briefing at wunstorf its reduced to a system so that its almost automatic trouble is its bloody boring two flights a day eight hours of duty whatever the weather i tried for boac but they didnt want any navigators so here i am back on the airlift blast it his gaze swung to the entrance ah heres the governor he said harcourt was one of those men born for organisation not leadership he was very short with a small neat moustache and sandy hair he had tight rather orderly features and a clipped manner of speech that finished sentences abruptly like an adding machine his method of approach was impersonal a few short questions punctuated by sharp little nods and then silence while shrewd grey eyes stared at me unblinkingly lunch was an awkward affair carried chiefly by tubby harcourt had an aura of quiet efficiency about him but it wasnt friendly efficiency he was the sort of man who knows precisely what he wants and uses his fellow creatures much as a carpenter uses his tools it made it a lot easier from my point of view nevertheless i found the test flight something of an ordeal it was the machine that was supposed to be on test hed only just taken delivery but i knew as we walked out to the plane that it was really i who was being tested he sat in the second pilots seat and i was conscious all through the takeoff of his cold gaze fixed on my face and not on the instrument panel once in the air however my confidence returned she handled very easily and the fact that she was so like the one wed flown only a few days before made it easier apparently i satisfied him for as we walked across the airfield to the bea offices he said get all the details cleared up eraser and leave tomorrow lunchtime thatll give you a daylight flight ill see you in wunstorf we left northolt the following day in cold brittle sunshine that turned to cloud as we crossed the north sea field was right about wunstorf it had changed a lot since id been briefed for that raid nearly eight years ago i came out of the cloud at about a thousand feet and there it was straight ahead of me through the windshield an enormous flat field with a broad runway like an autobahn running across it and a huge tarmac apron littered with yorks there were excavations marking new work in progress and a railway line had been pushed out right to the edge of the field beyond it stretched the westphalian plain grim and desolate with a line of firclad hills marching back along the horizon i came in to land through a thick downpour the runway was a cold shining ribbon of grey halfobscured by a haze of driven rain i went in steeply pulled back the stick and touched down like silk i was glad about that landing somehow it seemed an omen i kicked the rudder and swung on to the perimeter track the rain beating up from the concrete and sweeping across the field so that the litter of planes became no more than a vague shadow in the murk dear old wunstorf fields voice crackled over the intercom what a dump it was raining when i left probably been raining ever since a truck came out to meet us we dumped our kit in it and it drove us to the airport buildings they were a drab olive green bleak utilitarian blocks of concrete the operations room was on the ground floor i reported to the squadron leader in charge if you care to go up to the mess theyll fix you up then he saw field good god you back already bob a fortnights leave thats all i got out of getting demobilised field answered and a rise in pay ill bet the squadron leader turned to me hell get things sorted out for you report here in the morning and well let you know what your timings are the station commander came in as he finished speaking a big blond alsatian at his heels any news of that skymaster yet he asked not yet sir replied the squadron leader celle have just been on again theyre getting worried its twenty minutes overdue theres been a hell of a storm over the russian zone what about the other bases lubeck fuhlsbuttel fassberg theyve all made negative reports sir it looks as though its forcelanded somewhere berlin are in touch with the russians but so far safety centre hasnt reported anything next wave goes out at seventeen hundred doesnt it if the plane hasnt been located by then have all pilots briefed to keep a lookout for it will you he turned to go and then stopped as he saw us back in civvies eh field i must say it doesnt make you look any smarter he smiled and then his eyes met mine you must be fraser he held out his hand to me glad to have you with us harcourts up at the mess now hes expecting you he turned to the squadron leader give the mess a ring and tell wingcommander harcourt that his other tudor has arrived very good sir well have a drink sometime fraser the station commander nodded and hurried out with his dog ill get you a car the squadron leader said he went out and his shout of fahrer echoed in the stone corridor the mess was a huge building block on block of grey concrete large enough to house a division when i gave my name to the german at the desk he ran his finger down a long list block c sir rooms and just place your baggage there please i will arrange for it and come this way gentlemen wingcommander harcourt is wishing to speak with you so harcourt retained his air force title out here we followed the clerk into the lounge it had a dreary waitingroom atmosphere harcourt came straight over good trip he asked pretty fair i said whats visibility now ceilings about a thousand i told him we ran into it over the dutch coast he nodded well now weve got six planes here there was a touch of pride in the way he said it and this was reflected in the momentary gleam in his pale eyes hed every reason to be proud there was only one other company doing this sort of work how hed managed to finance it i dont know hed only started on the airlift three months ago hed had one plane then now he had six it was something of an achievement and i remember thinking this man is doing what saeton is so desperately wanting to do i tried to compare their personalities but there was no point of similarity between the two men harcourt was quiet efficient withdrawn inside himself saeton was ruthless genial an extrovert and a gambler fraser harcourts voice jerked me out of my thought yes i asked you whether youre okay to start on the wave scheduled for hours tomorrow i nodded good weve only two relief crews at the moment so youll be worked pretty hard but i expect you can stand it for a day or two his eyes crinkled at the corners overtime rates are provided for in your contracts he glanced at his watch time i was moving theres a wave due to leave at seventeen hundred field knows his way around he left us then and we went in search of our rooms it was a queer place the wunstorf mess you couldnt really call it a mess aircrews quarters would be a more apt description it reminded me of an enormous jail long concrete corridors echoed to ribald laughter and the splash of water from communal washrooms the rooms were like cells small dormitories with two or three beds one room we went into by mistake was in darkness with the blackout blinds drawn the occupants were asleep and they cursed us as we switched on the light through the open doors of other rooms we saw men playing cards reading talking going to bed getting up all the life of wunstorf was here in these electricallylit echoing corridors in the washrooms men in uniform were washing next to men in pyjamas quietly shaving as though it were early morning these billets brought home to me more than anything the fact that the airlift was a military operation a roundtheclock service running on into infinity we found our rooms there were two beds in each carter and i took one room westrop and field the other field wandered in and gave us a drink from a flask its going to be pretty tough operating six planes with only two relief crews he said it means damn nearly twelve hours duty a day suits me i replied carter straightened up from the case he was unpacking glad to be back in the flying business eh he smiled i nodded it wont last long field said what wont i asked your enthusiasm this isnt like it was in wartime he dived across the corridor to his room and returned with a folder take a look at this he held a sheet out to me it was divided into squares each square a month and each month black with little ticks every one of these ticks represents a trip to berlin and back around two hours flying it goes on and on the same routine wet or fine thick mist or blowing half a gale they send you up regular as clockwork no letup at all gets you down in the end he shrugged his shoulders and tucked the folder under his arm oh well got to earn a living i suppose but its a bloody grind believe you me after tea i walked down to the airfield i wanted to be alone the rain had stopped but the wind still lashed at the pine trees the loading apron was almost empty a huge desolate stretch of tarmac shining wet and black in the grey light only planes undergoing repairs and maintenance were left their wings quivering soundlessly under the stress of the weather it was as though all the rest had been spirited away the runways were deserted the place looked almost as empty as membury i turned back through the pines and struck away to the left to the railway sidings that had been built out to the very edge of the landing field a long line of fuel wagons was being shunted in fuel that we should carry to berlin the place was bleak and desolate the country beyond rolled away into the distance an endless vista of agriculture without hedges or trees something of the character of the people seemed inherent in that landscape inevitable ruthless and without surprise i turned and across the railway sidings i caught a glimpse of the wings of a fourengined freighter symbol of the british occupation of germany it seemed suddenly insignificant against the immensity of that rolling plain we were briefed by the officer in charge of operations at nine oclock the following morning by ten we were out on the perimeter track waiting in a long queue of planes waiting our turn with engines switched off to save petrol harcourt had been very insistent about that its all right for the raf he had said the taxpayer foots their petrol bill were under charter at so much per flight fly on two engines whenever possible cut your engines out when waiting for takeoff it made me realise how much saeton had to gain by the extra thrust of those two engines and their lower fuel consumption the thought of saeton reminded me of the thing id promised to do i wished it could have been this first flight i wanted to get it over but it had to be a night flight i glanced at tubby he was sitting in the second pilots seat the earphones of his flying helmet making his face seem broader his eyes fixed on the instrument panel if only i could have had a different engineer it wasnt going to be easy to convince him the last plane ahead of us swung into position engines revving as it roared off up the runway the voice of control crackled in my earphones okay twofivetwo youre dear to line up now take off right away perhaps it was as well to fly in daylight first i thought as i taxied to the runway end and swung the machine into position we took off dead on time at for almost threequarters of an hour we flew northeast making for the entry to the northern approach corridor for berlin corridor beacon coming up now field told me over the intercom turn on to degrees time were minus thirty seconds that meant we were thirty seconds behind schedule the whole thing was worked on splitsecond timing landing margin was only ninety seconds either side of touchdown timing if you didnt make it inside the margin you just had to overshoot and return to base the schedule was fixed by timings over radar beacons at the start and finish of the air corridor that spanned the russian zone fixed heights ensured that there were no accidents in the air we were flying angels threefive height feet twenty miles from frohnau beacon westrop reported to gatow airway as we approached berlin i began to have a sense of excitement i hadnt been over berlin since id been on night raids then i wondered what it would look like in daylight tubby seemed to feel it too he kept op looking down through his side window and moving restlessly in hi seat i pushed my helmet back and shouted to him have you seen berlin from the air since the war he nodded abstractedly i was on transport work then what are you so excited about i asked he hesitated then he smiled it was an eager boyish smile dianas at gatow shes working in the malcolm club there she doesnt know im on the airlift he grinned im going to surprise her westrops voice sounded in my earphones reporting to gatow airway that we were over frohnau beacon we switched to contact with traffic control gatow okay twofivetwo report again at lancaster house so diana was at gatow it suddenly made the place seem friendly almost ordinary it would be nice to see diana again and then i was looking out of my side window at a bombpocked countryside that merged into miles of roofless shattered buildings there were great flat gaps in the city but mostly the streets were still visible bordered by the empty shells of buildings from the air it seemed as though hardly a house had a roof we were passing over the area that the russians had fought through nothing seemed to have been done about it it might have happened yesterday instead of four years ago over the centre of the city field gave me my new course and westrop reported to gatow tower who answered okay twofivetwo report at two miles youre number three in the pattern there was less damage here i caught a glimpse of the olympic stadium and then the pine trees of the grunewald district were coming up to meet me as i descended steeply havel lake opened out the flat sheet of water across which the last survivors from the fuhrer bunker had tried to escape and westrop reported again clear to land twofivetwo came the voice of gatow control keep rolling after touchdown theres a york close behind you i lowered undercarriage and landing flaps we skimmed the trees and then we were over a cleared strip of woods dotted with the posts of the night landing beacons with the whole circle of gatow airport opening up and the pierced steel runway rising to meet us i levelled out at the edge of the field the wheels bumped once then we were on the ground the machine jolting over the runway sections i kept rolling to the runway end braked and swung left to the offloading platform gatow was a disappointment after wunstorf it seemed much smaller and much less active there were only five aircraft on the apron yet this field handled more traffic than either tempelhof in the american sector or tegel in the french as i taxied across the apron i saw the york behind me land and two army lorries manned by a german labour team still in their field grey nosed out to meet it i went on past the line of nissen huts that bordered the apron towards the hangars two tudor tankers were already at piccadilly circus the circular standing for fuel offloading i swung into position by a vacant pipe by the time we had switched off and got out of our seats the fuselage door was open and a british soldier was connecting a pipeline to our fuel tanks wheres the malcolm club tubby asked field his voice trembled slightly its one of those nissen huts over there field answered pointing to the offloading apron he turned to me know what the army call this he waved his hands towards the circular standing remember they called the crosschannel pipeline pluto well this ones called plume pipelineundermotherearth not bad eh it runs the fuel down to havel where its shipped into berlin by barge saves fuel on transport we were crossing the edge of the apron now walking along the line of nissen huts the first two were full of germans jerry labour organisation field explained what about the tower i asked above the third nissen hut was a high scaffolding with a lookout it was like a workmans hut on stilts thats the control tower for the offloading platform all this is run by the army its what they call a faso forward airfield supply organisation heres the malcolm club a blue board with raf roundel faced us better hurry if you want some coffee tubby hesitated she may not be on duty he murmured well soon see i said and took his arm inside the hut the air was warm and smelt of freshmade cakes a fire glowed red in an armytype stove the place was full of smoke and the sound of voices there were about four aircrews there in a huddle by the counter i saw diana immediately she was in the middle of the group her hand on the arm of an american control officer laughing happily her face turned up to his i felt tubby check and was reminded suddenly of that night at membury when he and i had stood outside the window of our mess then diana turned and saw us her eyes lit up and she rushed over seizing hold of tubby hugging him then she turned to me and kissed me too harry harry she was calling excitedly across the room heres tubby just flown in she swung back to her husband darling remember i told you my brother harry was in berlin well here he is i saw the stiffness leave tubbys face he was suddenly grinning happily shaking the big americans hand up and down saying my god harry i should have recognised you from your photograph instead i thought you were some boyfriend of dianas he didnt even bother to hide his relief and diana never seemed to notice that anything had been wrong she was taken too much by surprise why didnt you tell me you were flying in she cried you devil you come on lets get you some coffee they only give you a few minutes here i stood and watched her hustling him to the bun counter wondering whether he had told her what had happened at membury wondering what shed say if she knew i was going to ditch him in the russian zone you must be fraser her brother was at my elbow ive heard a lot about you from di my names harry culyer by the way he had dianas eyes but that was all they had in common he had none of her restlessness he was the sort of man you trust on sight big slowspoken friendly yes ive heard a lot about you and a crazy devil called saeton is that really his name he gave a fat chuckle seems apt from what di told me i wondered how much she had told him are you connected with the airlift i asked him he shook his head no im attached to the control office of the us military government i used to work for the opel outfit before the war so they figured id have to stay on in some sort of uniform and keep an eye on vehicle production in the zone right now i guess you could do with some coffee eh the coffee was thick and sweet with it was a potted meat sandwich and a highlycoloured cake full of synthetic cream cigarettes i said offering him a packet well thanks thats one of the troubles here in berlin cigarettes are damned hard to come by and its worse for your boys theyre down to about fifteen a day well what do you think of gatow he laughed when i told him i was disappointed you expected to find it littered with aircraft eh well thats organisation tempelhof is the same theyve got it so that these german labour teams turn the planes round in about fifteen minutes what brings you out to gatow i asked him just paying diana a visit sort of but i got a good excuse he added with a grin i had to interview a german girl who has just got a job out here as a checker in your german labour organisation some trouble about her papers and we urgently need her down at frankfurt thats why i came up to berlin youre not stationed here then i asked no im normally in the zone its nice and quiet down there by comparison i just been talking to your sib major over there the stories that man can tell whats he doing up at gatow i asked oh theres been some trouble with the russians this is your first trip isnt it well you see those trees on the other side of the airfield he nodded through the windows thats the frontier over there the russian sector no the russian zone last night red army guards opened up on a german car just after it had been allowed through the frontier barrier into the british sector then their troops crossed the frontier and pushed the car back into their zone under the nose of the raf regiment your boys are pretty sore about it you mean the car was shot up in british territory i asked he laughed seems that sort of thing is happening every day in this crazy town if they want somebody they just drive into the western sectors and kidnap them the corners of his eyes crinkled from what i hear our boys do the same in the eastern sector an raf orderly called to me from the door twofivetwo ready sir well i guess thats your call glad to have met you fraser neil diana caught hold of my arm tubby has just told me about the crash she glanced quickly at tubby who was saying goodbye to her brother whats bill doing now she asked in a quick whisper i didnt know what to say so i kept my mouth shut oh dont be silly ive got over that but i know how it must have hit him where is he now hes still at membury i said and then added hes sticking the plane together with sealing wax you dont mean to say hes still going on with it look ive got to go now i said goodbye diana she was staring at me with a puzzled frown goodbye she said automatically outside it was still raining we climbed into the plane and taxied out to the runway youre clear to line up now twofivetwo twosixo aconcrete angels threefive we flew out along the single exit corridor and were back in wunstorf in good time for lunch a letter was waiting for me at the mess the address was typed and the envelope was postmarked baydon dear neil just to let you know i have almost completed the breakup i have a flare path now all you have to do is buzz once and ill light you m good luck bill saeton as i folded the letter tubby came into the room message from harcourt were not on the wave hes switched us to says the other boys need a nights sleep so it had come i had a sudden sick feeling he peered at me anxiously you feeling all right neil yes why you look pretty pale not nervous are you damn it youve no reason to be you had enough experience of nightflying during the war his gaze fell to the letter in my hand but he didnt say anything and i tore it into small pieces and stuffed them into my pocket better turn in then if were going to fly all night i said but i knew i shouldnt sleep hell why did i have to agree to this damnfool scheme i was scared now not scared of the danger i dont think it was that but what had seemed straightforward and simple over a drink in the pub at ramsbury seemed much more difficult now that i was actually a part of the airlift it seemed utterly crazy to try and fly a plane out of this organised bus service of supply delivery and i had to convince a crew that included tubby carter that they had got to bale out over the russian zone the menace of the zone had already gripped me i lay and sweated on my bed listening to the wave taking off knowing that mine was the next wave scared that i should bungle it at tea i could eat nothing but drank several cups smoking cigarette after cigarette conscious all the time of tubby watching me with a puzzled worried expression afterwards i walked down to the field in the gathering dusk and watched the planes pile in a constant stream of aircraft glimmering like giant moths along the line of the landing lights i saw my own plane twofivetwo come in watched it swing into position on the loading apron and the crew pile out and i hung on waiting for the maintenance crew to finish servicing it at last it stood deserted a black shape against the wet tarmac that glistened with the reflection of the lights i climbed on board saeton and i had discussed this problem of simulating engine failure at great length the easiest method would have been simply to cut off the juice but the fuel cocks were on the starboard side controlled from the flight engineers seat we had finally agreed that the only convincing method was to tamper with the ignition i went forward to the cockpit and got to work on the wiring behind the instrument panel i had tools with me and six lengths of insulated wire terminating in small metal clips what i did was to fix two wires to the back of three of the ignition switches these wires i led along the back of the instrument panel and brought out at the extreme left on my own side all i had to do when i wished to simulate engine failure was to clip each pair of wires together and so short out the ignition switches that would close the ignition circuit and stop the plugs sparking it took me the better part of an hour to fix the wires i was just finishing when a lorry drove up there was the clatter of metal and the drag of a pipe as they connected the fuel lorry to the tanks in the porthand wing the lorrys engine droned as it began refuelling i waited conscious already of a fugitive guilty feeling footsteps moved round the plane rather than be caught crouched nervously in the cockpit of my own machine i went aft down the fuselage climbing round the three big elliptical tanks and dropping on to the asphalt i started to walk away from the plane but the beam of a torch picked me out and a voice said whos that squadronleader fraser i answered reverting automatically to my service title ive just been checking over something very good sir goodnight goodnight i answered and went hurriedly across to the terminal building and along the road to the mess i went up to my room and lay on my bed trying to read but i couldnt concentrate my hands were trembling time dragged by as i lay there chainsmoking shortly after seventhirty the door opened and westrop poked his head into the room you coming down to dinner sir may as well i said as we went down the echoing corridors and along the cinder paths to the mess westrop chattered away incessantly i wasnt listening until something he said caught my attention whats that about a crash i asked remember when we arrived here yesterday the station commander was talking about a skymaster that was missing he said well they made a forced landing in russian territory i got it from a flight lieutenant whos just come off duty at ops one of our crews sighted the wreck this afternoon the russians have apparently denied all knowledge of it what do you think happens to crews who get landed in the russian zone i dont know i said shortly the flight lieutenant said they were probably being held for interrogation he didnt seem worried about them but they might be injured do you think the russians would give them medical treatment sir i mean he hesitated well i wouldnt like to have a russian surgeon operate on me would you no what do you think they hope to gain by this sort of thing everybody seems convinced theyre not prepared to go to war yet theyve stopped buzzing our planes that seems to prove it they got scared when they crashed that york i was talking to an re major this afternoon he said the trouble was their lines of communication their roads are bad and their railways from russia to eastern germany are only single track but i think its more than that dont you sir i mean they cant possibly be as good as us technically they could never have organised a thing as complicated as the airlift for instance and then their planes theyre still operating machines based on the b s they got hold of during the war he went on and on about the russians until at length i couldnt stand it any more oh for gods sake i said im sick and tired of the russians sorry sir but he paused uncertainly its just well this is my first operational night flight it was only then that i realised hed been talking because he was nervous i thought my god the poor kids scared stiff of the russians and in a few hours time im going to order him to jump it made me feel sick inside why wasnt my crew composed entirely of fields i didnt care about field id have ordered him to jump over wartime berlin and not cared a damn but tubby and this child i forced myself to eat and listened to westrops chatter all through the meal he had a live inquiring mind he already knew that we had to cover seventy miles of the russian zone in flying down the berlin approach corridor he knew too all about russian interrogation methods the roundtheclock interrogation under lights the solitary confinement the building up of fear in the mind of the victim theyre no better than the nazis are they he said only they dont seem to go as far as physical torture not against service personnel he paused and then said i wish we wore uniform im certain if anything like that happened wed be better off if we were in raf uniform youll be all right i answered without thinking oh i know we shant have to make a forced landing he said quickly mistaking what had been in my mind our servicing is much better than the yanks and i wouldnt be too sure of that i cut in have a cigarette and for gods sake stop talking about forced landings im sorry sir it was only he took the cigarette you must think me an awful funk but its odd i always like to know exactly what im facing it makes it easier somehow damn the kid id always felt just like that myself ill see you at the plane at i said and got quickly to my feet as i went out of the dininghall i glanced at my watch still an hour to go i left the mess and walked down to the airfield the night was cold and frosty the sky studded with stars the apron was full of the huddled shapes of aircraft looking clumsy and unbeautiful on the ground trucks were coming and going as the faso teams worked to load them for the next wave i leaned on the boundary fence and watched them i could see my own plane it was the lefthand one of a line of tudors fuel loading and maintenance crews had completed their work the planes stood deserted and silent the minutes dragged slowly by as i stood chilled to the marrow trying to brace myself for what i had to do the odd thing is i never thought of refusing to cany out my part of the plan i could have raised technical difficulties and put it off until gradually saeton lost heart many times since i have asked myself why i didnt do this and i still dont really know the answer i like to think that saetons threat of exposing my identity to the police had nothing to do with it certainly the audacity of the thing had appealed to me also i believed in saeton and his engines and the airlift had only served to increase their importance in my eyes moreover my own future was involved i suppose the truth is that my attitude was a combination of all these things at any rate as i stood there on the edge of wunstorf airfield waiting for zero hour it never occurred to me not to do it at last my watch told me it was ninefifteen i went slowly back to the mess tubby came in as i was getting into my flying kit well thank god the weathers cleared he said cheerfully i wouldnt want to be talked down by gca the first time we went in by night gca is ground control approach a means of blind landing where the plane lands on instructions from an officer operating radar gear at the edge of the runway by ninefifty we were climbing into the plane our takeoff time was and as i lifted the heavy plane into the starlit night my hands and stomach felt as cold as ice tubby was checking the trim of the engines his hand on the throttle levers i groped down and found one of my three pairs of wires and touched the ends of them together the inboard port motor checked it worked all right i glanced quickly at tubby he had taken his hand from the throttles and was listening his head on one side then he turned to me did you hear that engine falter he shouted i nodded sounded like dirt in the fuel i called back he stayed in the same position for a moment listening then his hand went back to the throttles i glanced at the airspeed indicator and then at my watch threequarters of an hour to restorf beacon at the entrance of the air corridor the time dragged the only sound was the steady drone of the engines twice i halfcut the same motor out on the second occasion i did it when tubby had gone aft to speak to field i held the wires together until the motor had cut out completely tubby suddenly appeared at my elbow as i allowed it to pick up again i dont like the sound of that engine he shouted nor do i i said he stood quite still listening sounded like ignition ill get it checked at gatow i glanced at my watch it was elevensixteen any minute now then fields voice crackled in my ears were over the corridor beacon now right on to degrees were minus ten seconds i felt ice cold but calm as i banked my stomach didnt flutter any more i leaned a little forward feeling for the metal clips one by one i fastened them together in their pairs and one by one the engines died all except the inboard starboard motor the plane was suddenly very quiet i heard tubbys muttered curse quite distinctly check ignition i shouted to him check fuel i made my voice sound scared the airspeed indicator was dropping the luminous pointer swinging back through falling back towards the mark the altimeter needle was dropping too as the nose tilted earthwards were going down at about a minute i shouted ignition okay he reported his hand on the switches fuel okay his eyes were frantically scanning the instrument panel its an electrical fault ignition i think the bastards must have overlooked some loose wiring anything we can do i asked were down to three thousand already doubt it not much time if you think theres anything we can do say so otherwise im going to order the crew to bale out i had kept my intercom mouthpiece close to my lips so that field and westrop could hear what we were saying tubby straightened up okay wed better bale out his face looked stiff and strained in the light of the instrument panel get your parachutes on i ordered over the intercom field you go aft and get the fuselage door open we may have to ditch her out of the tail of my eye i saw the two of them struggling with their parachutes field shouted something to westrop and a moment later the bags containing the other two parachutes were slid on to the floor of the cockpit get back to the fuselage door i told westrop ill send carter aft when i want you to jump i glanced at the altimeter dial height twosix i called to tubby he straightened up nothing i can do he said its in the wiring somewhere okay i said get aft and tell the others to jump give me a shout when youre jumping he stood there hesitating for a moment okay his hand gripped my arm see you in the russian zone but he still didnt move and his hand remained gripping my arm would you like me to take her while you jump he asked i realised suddenly that he was remembering the last time id jumped over membury he thought my nerve might have gone i swallowed quickly why did he have to be so bloody decent about it of course not i said sharply get aft and look after yourself and the others his eyes remained fixed on mine brown intelligent eyes that seemed to read my mind good luck he turned and dived quickly through towards the fuselage leaning out of my seat i looked back and watched him climbing round the fuel tanks i could just see the others at the open door of the fuselage tubby joined them westrop went first then field tubby shouted to me jump i called to him the plane skidded slightly and i turned back to the controls steadying her when i looked back down the length of the fuselage there was no one there i was alone in the plane i settled myself in my seat height one thousand six hundred airspeed ninetyfive id take her down to a thousand feet that should put her below the horizon of the three who had jumped through the windshield i saw a small point of light moving across the sky the taillight of one of the airlift planes holding steadily to its course i wondered if those behind could see me in case i banked away and at the same time broke one of the wire contacts the outboard port engine started immediately as i unfeathered the prop as i banked out of the traffic stream a voice called to me you bloody fool neil you havent even got your parachute on i felt sudden panic grip me as i turned to find tubby coming back into the cockpit why the hell havent you jumped plenty of time now he said calmly perhaps the other engines will pick up i was worried about you thats why i came back i can look after myself i snapped get back to that door and jump i think he saw the panic in my eyes and misunderstood it his gaze dropped to my parachute still in its canvas bag ill take over whilst you get into your parachute with two engines we might still make gatow he was already sliding into the second pilots seat now and i felt his hands take over on the controls now get your chute on neil he said quietly we sat there staring at each other i didnt know what the hell to do i glanced at the altimeter the needle was steady at the thousand mark his eyes followed the direction of my gaze and then he looked at me again and his forehead was wrinkled in a puzzled frown you werent going to jump were you he said slowly i sat there staring at him and then i knew hed got to come back to membury with me no i said and with sudden violence why the hell couldnt you have jumped when i told you i knew you didnt like jumping he said what were you going to do try and crash land i hesitated id have one more shot at getting him to jump i edged my left hand down the side of my seat until i found the wires that connected to the ignition switch of that outboard port motor i clipped them together and the motor died its gone again i shouted to him i switched over to the automatic pilot come on i said were getting out i slid out of my seat and gripped him by the arm quick i said halfpulling him towards the exit door i think id have done it that time but he glanced back and then suddenly he wrenched himself free of my grip i saw him reach over the pilots seat saw him tearing at the wires and as he unfeathered the props the motors picked up in a thrumming roar he slid into his own seat took over from the automatic pilot and as i stood there dazed with the shock of discovery i saw the altimeter needle begin to climb through the luminous figures of its dial then i was clambering into my seat struggling to get control of the plane from him he shouted something to me i dont remember what it was i kicked at the rudder bar and swung the heavy plane into a wide banking turn were going back to membury i yelled at him membury he stared at me so thats it it was you who fixed those wires you made those boys jump the words seemed to choke him you must be crazy whats the idea i heard myself laughing wildly i was excited and my nerves were tense better ask saeton i said still laughing saeton he caught hold of my arm you crazy fools you cant get away with this of course we can i cried we have nobody will ever know i was so elated i didnt notice him settling more firmly into his seat i was thinking id succeeded id done the impossible id taken an aircraft off the berlin airlift i wanted to sing shout do something to express the thrill it gave me then the controls moved under my hands he was dragging the plane round heading it for berlin for a moment i fought the controls struggling to get the ship round the compass wavered uncertainly but he held on grimly he had great strength at length i let go and watched the compass swing back on to the lubber lines of our original course all the elation i had felt died out of me for gods sake tubby i said try to understand what this means nobodys going to lose over this harcourt will get the insurance as for the airlift in a few weeks the plane will be back on the job only then it will have our engines in it well have succeeded doesnt success mean anything to you automatically i was using saetons arguments over again but all he said was youve dropped those boys into russian territory well what of it i demanded hotly theyll be ail right so will harcourt and so will we he looked at me then his face a white mask the little lines at the corners of his eyes no longer crinkled by laughter he looked solid unemotional like a block of granite i should have known the sort of person you were when you turned up at membury like that saetons a fanatic i can forgive him but youre just a dirty little crook who has he shouldnt have said that it made me mad part fear part anger damn his bloody high and mighty principles was he prepared to die for them i reached down for the wires my fingers were trembling and numb with the cold blast of the air that came in through the open doorway aft but i managed to fasten the clips the engines died away the cabin was suddenly silent a ghostly place of softlit dials and our reflections in the windshield we seemed suddenly cut off from the rest of the world a white pinpoint of light slid over us like a star our one contact with reality a plane bound for berlin dont be a fool fraser tubbys voice was unnaturally loud in the stillness i laughed it wasnt a pleasant sound my nerves were keyed to the pitch of desperation either we fly to membury i said or we crash my teeth were clenched it might have been a strangers voice you can jump if you want to i added nodding towards the rear of the cockpit where the wind whistled unfasten those wires he shouted and when i made no move he said get them unfastened and start the motors or ill hurt you he was fumbling in the pocket beside his seat and his hand came out holding a heavy spanner he let go the controls then the plane dipped and slid away to port automatically i grasped the control column and righted her at the same time he rose in his seat the spanner lifted in his hand i flung myself sideways lunging out at him the spanner caught me across the shoulder and my left arm went numb but i had hold of his flying suit now and was pulling him towards me he had no room to use the spanner again and at the same moment the plane dropped sickeningly we were flung into the aisle and fetched up against the fuel tanks in the fuselage for a moment we stood there locked together and then he fought to get clear of me to get back to start the motors again i was determined he shouldnt id take him down into the ground rather than fly on to gatow to be accused of having attempted to take a plane off the airlift i clutched hold of him pinning his arms bracing myself against the tanks the plane lurched and we were flung between the tanks into the main body of the fuselage where the wind roared in through the open doorway that lurch flung us against the door to the toilet breaking us clear of each other he raised the spanner to strike at me again and i hit him with my fist the spanner descended striking my shoulder again i lashed out again my fist caught his jaw and his head jerked back against the metal of the fuselage at the same moment the plane seemed to fall away we were both flung sideways tubby hit the side of the open doorway i saw his head jerk back as his forehead caught a protruding section of the metal frame blood gleamed red in a long gash and his jaw fell slack slowly his legs gave under him as he fell i started forward he was falling into the black rectangle of the doorway i clutched at him but the plane swung jerking me back against the toilet door and in that instant tubby slid to the floor his legs slowly disappearing into the black void of the slipstream for an instant his thick torso lay along the floor held there by the wind and the tilt of the plane i could do nothing i was pinned by the tilt of the plane forced to stand there and watch as his body began to slide outwards slowly like a sack the outstretched hands making no attempt to hold him for a second he was there sliding slowly out across the floor and then the slipstream whisked him away and i was alone in the body of the plane with only the gaping doorway and a thin trickle of blood on the steel flooring to show what had happened i shook myself dazed with the horror of it then i closed the door and went forard almost automatically my brain registered the altimeter dial height i slipped into the pilots seat and with trembling fingers forced the wires apart the engines roared i gripped the control column and my feet found the rudder bar i banked and climbed steeply the lights of a town showed below me and the snaking course of a river i felt sick at the thought of what had happened to tubby height twofour course eightfive degrees i must find out what had happened to tubby i made a right diving turn and levelled out at five hundred feet i had to find out what had happened to him if hed regained consciousness and had been able to pull his parachute release surely the cold air would have revived him god dont let him die i was sobbing my prayer aloud i went back along the course of the river over the lights of the town a road ran out of it straight like a piece of tape and white in the moonlight then i shut down the engines and put down the flaps this was the spot where tubby had fallen i searched desperately through the windshield but all i saw was a deserted airfield bordered by pine woods and a huddle of buildings that were no more than empty shells no sign of a parachute no comforting mushroom patch of white i went back and forth over the area a dozen times the aerodrome and the woods and the bombshattered buildings stood out clear in the moonlight but never a sign of the white silk of a parachute tubby was dead and i had killed him dazed and frightened i banked away from the white graveyard scene of the shattered buildings i took the plane up to feet and fled westward across the moonfilled night away to the right i could see the lines of planes coming in along the corridor red and green navigation lights stretching back towards lubeck but in a moment they were gone and i was alone riding the sky with only the reflection of my face in the windshield for company nothing of earth but the flat expanse of the westphalian plain white like a saltpan below me chapter six there was no problem of navigation to distract my mind on the homeward run the earth lay like a white map below me i found the north sea at flushing crossed the southern extremity of it flying automatically and just as automatically picked up the thames estuary following the curves of the river till it met the kennet and all the time i was remembering every detail of what had happened it seemed such a waste that he should die like that and all because hed called me a crook my face ghostly in the windshield seemed to reflect the bitterness of my thoughts i had three hours in which to sort the thing out and face it but i didnt face it i know that now i began that flight hating myself i ended it by hating saeton it was he who had forced me into it it was he not i who was responsible for tubbys death by the time i was over the kennet i had almost convinced myself of that i dropped to a thousand feet in a mood of cold fury picked up ramsbury and swung northeast the trees of baydon hill were a dark line and there suddenly were the hangars of membury and as i swept low over the field i caught a glimpse of the quarters nestled snugly in their clearing in the woods all just as i had left it nothing changed only a man dead and the moon bathing everything in a white unreal light i had no need of any flares i skidded in a tight vicious turn dropped flaps and undercarriage and slammed the machine down on to the runway not caring whether i smashed it up in the violence of my anger saeton was at the hangar and came running out to meet me as i cut the engines he was waiting for me as i stepped out on to the concrete his face alive with excitement well done neil magnificent he seized my hand and wrung it i flung him off i couldnt say anything the words choked in my throat he was gazing at the plane caressing it with his eyes like a father who has been presented with another son to replace one that has died my hands clenched with the desire to hit out to smash the eagerness of his face then he turned and met my gaze whats the trouble his hand reached out and caught my arm in a hard unyielding grip his voice was urgent his mood tuned to mine i faced him then my guts screwed up in a right little knot in my belly and my teeth clenchedtubbys dead i said dead his fingers dug into the muscles of my arm and he stared at me hard then his grip relaxed what happened he asked in a flat tone i told him what had happened how tubbys body had slumped unconscious through the fuselage door how id searched the area and found no sign of a parachute when i had finished he turned and stared at the plane then he shook himself all right lets get the plane into the hangar the plane i heard myself laugh i tell you tubbys dead all right he said angrily so hes dead theres nothing you or i can do about it diana was at gatow i told him shes working at the malcolm club there i saw her yesterday i was remembering the sudden radiance of her face as she turned and found tubby standing beside me whats diana got to do with it he asked angrily shell get over it now give me a hand with the hangar doors weve got to get this plane under cover right away anger burst like a torrent inside me my god you callous bastard you dont care whos killed so long as you get your bloody engines into the air nothing else matters to you cant you understand whats happened he was unconscious when he fell through the door and now hes lying out there beside a disused airfield in the russian zone hes dead and you killed him i screamed and all you can think about is the plane you havent the decency even to say youre sorry he was straight and honest and decent and you wipe the memory off your mind as though he were no more than he hit me then across the face with the flat of his hand shut your mouth his voice trembled but it was without anger or violence it doesnt occur to you i suppose that i was fond of tubby he was the nearest i ever had to a friend in my life he said that slowly as though he were explaining something to himself then he turned away his shoulders hunched his hands thrust into his trouser pockets as though he didnt trust them in the open now come and help me get the hangar doors opened i followed him dully tears stinging the back of my eyeballs blurring the white naked brilliance of the scene he opened the wicket door undid the bolts of the main doors and between us we slid them back moonlight flooded into the hangar showing it strangely empty the crashed tudor was gone all that remained of it was a jumbled heap of broken metal piled along each side of the hangar walls and at the far end the bench with its lathes and machine tools stood deserted and silent the whole place reeked of tubby i could see him beside me at that bench whistling his flat unending tunes a grin crinkling his cheerful sweaty face the engines of the plane roared the vague outline of saetons head showed behind the glass of the windshield as he turned it and taxied into the hangar between us we got the doors closed again well go back to the quarters now he said you need a drink his hand gripped my shoulder im sorry neil i should have let you blow off steam youve had a hell of anight i cant get the memory of tubby out of my mind i said more to myself than to him we walked through the woods in silence and went into the mess room nothing had changed the same trestle table the four chairs and the cupboard in the corner but there were just the two of us now i stood there feeling cold and numb sit down he said and ill get you a drink he returned in a few minutes with two tumblers of whisky and a bundle of maps knock that back he said gently youll feel better then as i drank he shuffled through the maps picked out one and spread it flat on the table now then where exactly did it happen id rather not talk about it i said dully he nodded i understand how you feel but i must get it pinpointed whilst its still vivid in your mind now heres restorf at the entrance to the corridor how soon did you cut out the engines about three minutes after field had reported that wed passed the entrance beacon i answered field was your navigator yes speed about onesixty knots i put down my tumbler what are you going to do i dont know yet tubbys dead i said bitterly he was unconscious when he went through the door i searched the whole area there wasnt any sign of a parachute theres nothing we can do i looked at him the beginnings of a decision forming in my mind i must give myself up what good do you think that will do he demanded harshly i shook my head none my voice was bitter but i cant go on like this do you know what he called me he called me a dirty little crook thats what started it all i stared down at my drink he was right too thats what hurt first the callahan business now this saeton i cant go on with it itd drive me crazy all the time id be thinking stop thinking about yourself he snapped the vein on the side of his forehead was beginning to throb we killed him i said dully between us we killed him we did nothing of the sort he replied angrily it was an accident he tried to stop me taking the plane in the eyes of the law it would be damn the law so you told him what you were doing i had to he came back after the others had jumped i wiped my hand across my eyes ive made up my mind i said i cant go on oh for gods sake he cried and then he leaned towards me his eyes fixed on mine you think im callous about tubbys death dont you his gaze dropped slowly to the map and he shrugged his shoulders maybe its happened too often before men going out and not coming back i had nearly a year in command of a bomber station out in france i lost fiftyfive in that year just boys i knew who passed through my life and were gone maybe i got hardened to it his eyes lifted and fastened on me again but tubby wasnt just a boy i knew damn it we worked together for two years sidebyside on the same project with the same end in view when you told me he was dead i could have killed you youve bungled it and through your bungling youve killed the one man i was really fond of and now you have the bloody nerve to say you wont go through with the rest of the plan get this into your head neil if you dont go through with it you make tubbys death utterly pointless if it was necessary for him to die that a british company should get a world lead in airfreight transport well and good but if youre now going to i must tell the police the whole thing i repeated obstinately why telling the police wont help you say tubby is dead all right then hes dead but for the love of god lets see to it that his death was to some purpose he slewed the map round towards me now then you dropped field and the other fellow about there correct what happened then i banked away out of the traffic stream i answered my voice trembling then tubby came back to the cockpit he knew i was scared of jumps he came back to make sure i got out we were at about a thousand feet and then christ i said dont you see it was because he was so bloody decent that was why he died because he was so bloody decent he was afraid i wouldnt jump he was going to take the controls i was almost sobbing saeton pushed the tumbler into my hand drink up he said the drink produced a little oasis of warmth in the cold pit of my stomach youre at a thousand feet what happened then i swallowed another mouthful i was on two motors then i cut one i nearly convinced him he was just going aft again when he saw the clips he took control then and turned the machine back into the corridor i see and you tried to persuade him to make for membury thats when you told him our plan thats right but he wouldnt his methodist upbringing you told me about that you warned me my mind was confused now i felt damnably tired he shook my shoulder then you had a fight thats what you told me yes he called me a dirty little crook that made me mad i cut the engine out then i told him either we crashed or he let me take over thats when he came at me with a spanner the rest you know my eyelids felt heavy i couldnt keep them open what are you going to do i mumbled how long between his returning to the cockpit and the fight five minutes ten minutes i dont know what height were you when tubby went out through the fuselage door i dont know yes wait a minute about seven hundred i climbed to over two thousand and then went down to five hundred again to search for him you mentioned a disused airfield yes my head nodded forward uncontrollably and i felt him shaking me there was a small town there was a river too and a road ran north quite straight past the edge of the airfield i stared at him dully he was peering at the map marking off distances with a rule can you find it i asked he nodded yes hollmind no doubt of it what are you going to do i asked again nothing much we can do he said but an old friend of mine is at lubeck flying daks ill cable him and have him search the area as he flies over in daylight i nodded vaguely i couldnt keep my eyes open youre dead beat neil better get some sleep his voice sounded miles away i felt his hands under my arm come on old chap i think saeton must have put something in my drink for i dont remember anything more until i woke to sunlight streaming into the familiar comfortless little room it had never done that before and when i glanced at my watch i found it was past two i was still in my clothes and i had slept for nearly twelve hours i fumbled for a cigarette lit it and lay back the events of the night before came back to me then like some nightmare half forgotten in waking tubbys death was no longer vivid in my memory the whole thing had an unreal quality until i went across to the hangar and saw the plane with saeton already at work on the inboard engines feeling better he asked i left some food out for you did you find it no i walked round to the front of the machine and saw that he had already got the starboard engine out the singlepurposed drive of the man was incredible im having difficulty with the securing nuts of this engine he said can you come up and give me a hand i didnt move i stood there staring at the shining sweep of the wings hating the plane hating saeton and hating myself worst of all slowly my eyes travelled from the plane to the litter of the hangar god how the man must have worked whilst id been at wunstorf hed cut the old machine to pieces with an oxyacetylene cutter wings tail fuselage were a jumble of unrecognisable fragments piled along the walls only the engines were left intact he climbed down from the wheeled gantry snap out of it neil his voice was hard almost violent put your overalls on and get to work on that engine his face close to looked grey and haggard his eyes shadowed with sleeplessness he looked old im going to get some sleep he cleared a space for himself on the bench and lay down he kept his eyes open until id climbed the gantry and started work after that he didnt stir until i switched the light plant on he brought some food over then and we worked on together until we had the port engine lowered on to the concrete floor it was then eight fortyfive nearly news time i said and lit a cigarette my hands trembling we got the news on the planes radio there was nothing in the summary with the earphones clamped to my ears the announcers voice seemed to be there in my head telling me of political wrangles strikes a depression over iceland anything but what i wanted to hear right at the end however he paused there was a rustle of paper and then his voice was back in my ears and i gripped the edge of the seat news has fust come in that the tudor aircraft missing on the airlift since last night has crashed in the russian zone of germany two members of the crew who baled out crossed the frontier into the british zone this morning they are r e field navigator and h l westrop radio operator according to their report the planes engines failed shortly after it had turned into the northern approach corridor to berlin and the captain ordered the crew to bale out still missing are n l fraser pilot and r c carter flight engineer the pilot of one of the planes following the missing tudor has reported seeing a single parachute open at about a thousand feet it was clearly visible in brilliant moonlight as field and westrop came down together it is thought that this parachute may belong to one of the other two members of the crew so far the russians have denied that any plane crashed in their territory or that they hold any of our aircrews the plane was a tudor tanker belonging to the harcourt charter company squadron leader neil fraser escaped from germany during the war by hying out a messerschmitt after i switched it off and removed my headphones a single parachute do you think hes alive the sudden relief of hope made my voice unsteady saeton made no answer he was staring down the fuselage at nothing in particular a single parachute that must be tubby the others went out together they came down together the news said so well see what the papers say tomorrow saeton got to his feet i caught hold of his arm as he passed me whats the matter arent you glad he looked down at me his eyes grey like slate of course im glad there was no enthusiasm in his voice his reaction left me with a sense of depression the report was third or fourth hand the pilot might have been seeing two parachutes as one it might mean nothing or everything i got out on to the floor of the hangar and stood staring at the plane if only saeton hadnt taken the inboard engines out if the machine had been left as i had brought it in we could have gone over landed on that disused airfield and searched the area it was a crazy idea but it stuck in my mind and as though saeton had also thought of that he pressed straight on with the installation of the first of our own engines we finished it at three in the morning but even then i couldnt sleep my mind kept on seeing that single parachute a white mushroom of silk in the moonlight picturing tubby forced to consciousness by the rush of cold air tugging at the release pray god the papers carried more detail i was up at eight the quarters were silent there was no sign of saeton i thought he must be over at the hangar until i found a note on the mess table to say hed gone into baydon for the papers by the time id cooked the bacon he was back i saw at once he had some news there was a gleam of excitement in his eyes and his face looked younger as though all the sleeplessness had been wiped away what is it i asked breathlessly have they found him no what then take a look at that he handed me a teleprint your plane urgently required wunstorf to replace tudor tanker missing stop ministry civil aviation agree rush c of a stop report wunstorf soonest possible notifying your e ta signed aylmer bea i handed it back to him i suppose you didnt bother to see what the papers say about the crew of the plane cant you get your mind off whats happened he demanded irritably no i said i cant have you got the papers here you are he handed me a whole bundle of newspapers they tell us nothing that we didnt know last night i glanced quickly through them as he went past me to get his breakfast all the reports were the same it was obviously a handout the only difference was that in two cases the position at which the pilot had seen that single parachute was given the position was two miles north of hollmind when i entered the mess room again saeton was already there the teleprint beside his plate he was making notes whilst he ate i thrust the paper in front of him have you seen that i asked he nodded looking up at me his mouth full it means tubby is alive i cried he must have come to and pulled the release i hope youre right was all he said what else could it mean i demanded you remember i said id cable a friend of mine at lubeck i phoned it through that morning this morning i got his reply ill read it to you he pulled a second teleprint out of his pocket and read it out to me regret no trace of carter or fraser stop all aircraft ordered from dawn third to keep sharp lookout hollmind area stop routes staggered to cover limits of corridor stop visibility perfect stop two parachutes reported near frontier belonging westrop field stop no wreckage parachute or signal reported target area stop sorry signed manning he pushed it into my hand read it yourself it doesnt prove anything i said he may have been hurt if he were he would have made some signal smoke or something he turned back to his breakfast he may not have been able to he may have been unconscious then his parachute would have been seen not necessarily hollmind airfield is surrounded by a belt of pine woods his parachute could easily have been invisible from the air if hed come down in the woods if hed landed in the woods his parachute would have been caught in the trees it would be clearly visible then maybe he was seen coming down and picked up by a russian patrol or some germans i felt suddenly desperate tubby had to be alive my mind clung desperately to the slender hope of this report of a parachute near hollmind saeton looked up at me again then what time did tubby drop i dont know it must have been just near eleventhirty on the evening of the second i nodded within a few hours all pilots had been ordered to keep a sharp lookout that means that from dawn onwards there was a constant stream of aircrews overhead searching the area do you seriously suggest that in the intervening seven hours of darkness tubby would have been picked up there was a moon i said desperately all right five hours of moonlight if tubby pulled his parachute release then he would still have been there on the ground at dawn if he were hurt then he wouldnt have been able to do anything about his parachute and it would have been clearly visible from above and if he wasnt injured then hed have been able to signal he hesitated on the other hand if he never regained consciousness my god i said i believe you want him dead he didnt say anything ignoring me as i stood over him with my hands clenched ive got to know what happened i cried i caught hold of his shoulder cant you understand i cant go through life thinking myself a murderer ive got to go out there and find him find him he looked at me as though i were crazy yes find him i cried i believe hes alive ive got to believe that if i didnt believe that i moved my hand uncertainly couldnt the man see how i felt about it if hes dead then i killed him thats murder isnt it im a murderer then hes got to be alive i added desperately hes got to be better get on with your breakfast the gentleness was back in his voice damn him i didnt want kindness i wanted something to fight i wanted action when will the plane be ready i demanded thickly sometime tomorrow he answered why thats too late i said its got to be tonight impossible he answered well barely have got the second motor installed by this evening then theres the tests refuelling loading the remains of the old tudor fixing the the remains of the old tudor i stared at him you mean youre going through with the plan youll leave tubby out there another whole day just because tubbys dead he said getting to his feet the sooner you realise that the better hes dead and theres nothing you can do about it thats what you want to believe isnt it i sneered you want him dead because if he isnt dead hed give the whole game away i told you how i feel about tubby his face was white and his tone dangerously quiet now shut up and get on with your breakfast if tubbys dead i said ill do exactly what he would have done if hed been alive ill go straight to the authorities just what is it you want me to do fraser fly over there i said its no good a bunch of bored aircrews peering down at those woods from a height of three thousand or more i want to fly over the area at nought feet and if that doesnt produce any result then i want to land at hollmind airfield and search those woods on foot he stood looking at me for a moment all right he said when i asked when he hesitated its tuesday today well have the second engine installed this evening tomorrow ill fly down for the c of a could be friday night friday night i stared at him aghast but good god i exclaimed youre not going to leave tubby out there whilst you get a certificate of airworthiness you cant do that we must go tonight as soon as weve well go as soon as ive got the c of a his tone was final but dont be a fool neil he leaned towards me across the table im not leaving without a c of a when i leave its going to be for good ill be flying direct to wunstorf well call at hollmind on the way you must remember i dont share your optimism and now get some breakfast inside you weve got a lot to do but i must get there tonight i insisted you dont understand i feel i know very well how you feel he said sharply anybody would feel the same if hed caused the death of a good man like tubby but im not leaving without a c of a and thats final but the c of a might take a week i said often it takes longer two weeks well have to chance that aylmer of bea has said the civil aviation inspectors will rush it through all right im banking on it taking two days if it takes longer thats just too bad now get some breakfast inside you the sooner we get to work the sooner youll be at hollmind there was nothing i could do i got up slowly and fetched my bacon another thing he said as i sat down again im not landing at hollmind except in moonlight if its a pitch black night youll have to jump i felt my stomach go cold at the thought of another jump why not go over in daylight because its russian territory you mean because those engines are more important for gods sake stop it neil his voice was suddenly violent ive made a bargain with you to land there at night will be dangerous enough but im willing to do it for the sake of your peace of mind but not for tubby he didnt answer i knew what he was thinking he was thinking that if id described the scene accurately tubby couldnt be alive but at least he had agreed to look for him now and i held on to that the urge to find him drove me to work as id never worked the whole time id been at membury i worked with a concentrated frenzy that narrowed my world down to bolts and petrol unions and the complicated details of electrical wiring yet i was conscious at the same time of saetons divergent interest the clack of his typewriter as he cleared up the companys business the phone calls instructing the men hed picked as a crew to report to raf transport command for priority flights to biickeburg for wunstorf all reminded me that whatever had happened his driving purpose was still to get his engines on to the berlin airlift and i hated him for his callousness it was past midnight when the second engine was in and everything connected up saeton left at dawn the next morning the pipes were all frozen and we got water by breaking the ice on the rainwater butt membury was a frozen white world and the sun was hazed in mist so that it was a dull red ball as it came up over the downs the mist swallowed the tudor almost immediately i turned back to the quarters feeling shut in and wretched the next two days were the longest i ever remember to keep me occupied saeton had asked me to proceed with the cutting up of the old aircraft into smaller fragments it occupied my hands nothing more it was an automatic type of work that left my mind free to think i couldnt leave the airfield i couldnt go anywhere or see anybody saeton had been very insistent on that if i showed my face anywhere and was recognised then he wouldnt go near hollmind it meant i couldnt even visit the ellwoods i was utterly alone and by friday morning i was peering out of the hangar every few minutes searching the sky listening for the drone of the returning tudor it was saturday afternoon that saeton got in he had got his c of a his crew were on their way to wunstorf if its clear well go over tonight he said and we got straight on with the work of preparing for our final departure we tanked up and he insisted on filling the fuselage of the plane with pieces of the old tudor he was still intent on going through with his plan he kept on talking about the airworthiness tests the inspectors were pretty puzzled by the engines he said but i managed to avoid any check on petrol consumption they know theyre a new design but they dont know their value not yet the bastard could think of nothing else dusk was falling as we finished loading the interior of the hangar was still littered with debris but saeton made no attempt to dispose of it we went back to the quarters night had fallen and i had seen the last of membury when the moon rose i should be in germany i lay in my blankets barely conscious of the gripping cold my thoughts clinging almost desperately to my memory of the place saeton called me at tenthirty he had made tea and cooked some bacon as soon as he had finished his meal he went out to the hangar i lingered over a cigarette unwilling to leave the warmth of the oil stove thinking of what lay ahead of me at length saeton returned he was wearing his heavy fleecelined flying jacket ready yes im ready i said and got slowly to my feet outside it was freezing hard the night crystal clear and filled with stars saeton carried the oil stove with him at the edge of the woods he paused for a moment staring at the dark bulk of the hangar with the ghostly shape of the plane waiting for us on the apron a pity he said gruffly ive got fond of this place when we reached the plane he ordered me to get the engines warmed up and went on to the hangar he was gone about five minutes when he climbed into the cockpit he was breathing heavily as though he had been running his clothes smelt faintly of petrol okay lets get going he slid into the pilots seat and his hand reached for the throttle levers but instead of taxiing out to the runway he slewed the plane round so that we faced the hangar the wicket door was still open and a dull light glowed inside we sat there the screws turning the air frame juddering what are we waiting for i asked just burning my boats behind me he said the rectangular opening of the hangar door flared red and i knew then what he had wanted the oil stove for there was a muffled explosion and flames shot out of the gap the whole interior of the hangar was ablaze a roaring inferno which almost drowned the sound of our engines well thats that saeton said he was grinning like a child who has set fire to something for fun but his eyes as he looked at me reflected a more desperate mood another explosion shook the hangar and flames licked out of the shattered windows at the side saeton reached up to the throttle levers the engines roared and we swung away to the runway end a moment later we turned our backs on the hangar and took off into the frosted night at about a thousand feet saeton banked slightly for one last glimpse of the field it was a great dark circle splashed with an orange flare at the far end as i peered forward across saetons body the hangar seemed to disintegrate into a flaming skeleton of steel at that distance it looked no bigger than a guy fawkes bonfire we turned east then setting course for germany i stared at saeton seeing the hard inflexible set of the jaw in the light of the instrument panel there was nothing behind him now the past to him was forgotten actively erased by fire there would be nothing at membury but molten scraps of metal and the congealed lumps of the engines as though he knew what i was thinking he said whilst you were sleeping this evening i went over this machine erasing old numbers and stamping in our own there was a tightlipped smile on his face as he said this he was warning me that there would be no proof that i would not be believed if i tried to accuse him of flying harcourts plane the moon rose as we crossed the dutch coast a flattened orange in the east the scheldt glimmered below us and then the snaking line of water gave place to frosted earth were in germany now saeton shouted and there was a note of triumph in his voice in germany this was the future for him the bright brilliant future to replace the dead past but for me i felt cold and alone there was nothing here for me but the memory of tubbys unconscious body slumping through the floor of this very machine and farther back tucked away in the dark corners of my mind the feel of branches tearing at my arm the sight of the barbed wire and the sense of being hunted my brain seemed numb i couldnt think and i flew across the british zone of germany in a kind of mental vacuum then the lights of the airlift planes were below us and we were in the corridor flying at five thousand feet saeton put the nose of the machine down swinging east to clear the traffic stream and then southwest at less than a thousand with all the ground laid bare in brilliant moonlight a white world of unending hedgeless fields and black impenetrable woods we found hollmind turned north and in an instant we were over the airfield saeton pressed the mouthpiece of his helmet to his lips get aft and open the fuselage door his voice crackled in my ears you can start shovelling the bits out just as soon as you like ill stooge around to the north of the airfield i hesitated and he looked across at me you want me to land down there dont you he said well this machines heavily overloaded and that runway hasnt been used for four years its probably badly broken up by frost and im not landing till the weights out of the fuselage now get aft and kick the load out of her there was no point in arguing with him i turned and went through the door to the fuselage the dark bulk of the fuel tanks loomed in front of me i climbed round them and then i was squeezing my way through the litter of the old tudor that was piled to the roof jagged pieces of metal caught at my flying suit the fuselage was like an old junk shop and it rattled tinnily i found the fuselage door flung it back and a rush of cold air filled the plane we were flying at about two thousand now the countryside sliding below us clearly mapped in the white moonlight the wings dipped and quivered as saeton began to bank the plane above me the lights of a plane showed driving southeast towards berlin with its load of freight below the snaking line of a river gleamed for an instant a road running straight to the north the black welt of a wood and then the white weave of ploughed earth the engines throttled back and i felt the plane check as saeton applied the air brakes i caught hold of the nearest piece of metal dragged it to the windfilled gap and pushed it out it went sailing into the void a gleam of tin twisting and falling through the slipstream soon a whole string of metal was falling away behind us like pieces of silver paper it was like the phosphorescent gleam of the log line of a ship marking the curve of our flight as we banked by the time id pitched the last fragment out and the floor of the fuselage was clear i was sweating hard i leaned for a moment against the side of the fuselage panting with the effort the sweat on me went cold and clammy and i began to shiver i pulled the door to and went forard its all out now i told saeton he nodded good im going down now ill take the perimeter of hollmind airfield as my mark and fly in widening circles from that okay he thrust the nose down and the airfield rose to meet us through the windshield the concrete runways gleamed white a huge cross then we were skimming the field the starboard wingtip down as we banked in a right turn he was taking it clockwise so that i had a clear easy view of the ground through my side window keep your eyes skinned he shouted ill look after the navigation round and round we circled the airfield sliding away till it was lost behind the trees there was nothing but woods visible through my window an unending stream of moonwhite christmas trees sliding away below me my eyes grew dizzy with staring at them watching their spiky tops and the dark shadows rushing by the leading edge of the wing seemed to be cutting through them we were so low here and there they thinned out vanishing into patches of plough or the gleam of water the pattern repeated itself like flaws in a wheel as we droned steadily on that widening circle at last the woods had all receded and there was nothing below us but plough saeton straightened the plane out then and climbed away to the north well he shouted but id seen nothing not the glimmer of a light no fire no sign of the torn remains of parachute silk nothing but the fir trees and the open plough i felt numb and dead inside somewhere amongst those woods tubby had fallen somewhere deep in the dark shadows his body lay crumpled and broken i put the mouthpiece of my helmet to my lips ill have to search those woods on foot i said all right saetons voice crackled back ill take you down now hold tight its going to be a bumpy touchdown we banked again and the airfield reappeared showing as a flat clearing in the woods straight ahead of us flaps and undercarriage came down as we dropped steeply over the firs the concrete came to meet us cracked and covered with the dead stalks of weeds then our wheels touched down and the machine was jolting crazily over the uneven surface we came to rest within a stones throw of the woods the nose of the machine facing west saeton followed me out on to the concrete no light showed in all the huge flat expanse of the field nobody came to chal lenge us the place was as derelict and lonely as membury saeton thrust a paper package into my hand bread and cheese he said and heres a flask you may need it arent you coming with me i asked he shook his head im due at wunstorf at besides whats the use weve stooged the area for nearly an hour weve seen nothing to search it thoroughly on foot would take days it doesnt look much from the air but from the ground he shook his head again take a look at the size of this airfield just to walk straight across it would take you half an hour i stood there staring at the dark line of the woods the panic of loneliness creeping up on me i wont be long i said surely you can wait an hour for me two hours perhaps the plane was suddenly important to me my link with people i knew with people who spoke my own language without it id be alone in germany again in the russian zone his hand touched my arm you dont seem to understand neil he said gently youre not part of my crew not yet youre the pilot of a plane that crashed just north of here i couldnt take you on to wunstorf even if you wanted to come when youve finished your search make for berlin its about thirtyfive miles to the southeast you ought to be able to slip across into the british sector there i stared at him you mean youre leaving me here i swallowed quickly fighting off the sudden panic of fear the arrangement was that i should fly you back to germany and drop you there as far as im concerned that plan still holds all thats different is that ive landed you and so saved you a jump anger burst through my fear anger at the thought of him not caring a damn about tubby thinking only of his plans to fly his engines on the airlift youre not leaving me here saeton i cried but i must know whether hes alive or dead we know that already he said quietly hes not dead i cried hes only dead in your mind because you want him dead hes not dead really he cant be have it your own way he shrugged his shoulders and turned away towards the plane i caught him by the shoulder and jerked him round all right hes dead i shouted if thats the way you want it hes dead and youve killed him the one friend you ever had well youve killed your one friend killed him just as youd kill anyone who stood between you and what you want he looked me over measuring my mood and then his eyes were cold and hard i dont think youve quite grasped the situation he said slowly i didnt kill tubby you killed him me i laughed i suppose it wasnt your idea that i should pinch harcourts tudor i suppose thats your own machine standing there you blackmailed me into doing what you wanted my god ill see the world knows the truth i dont care about myself any more what happened to tubby has brought me to my senses youre mad thats what you are mad youve lost your reason all sense of proportion you dont care what you do so long as your dreams come true youll sacrifice everything anyone well ill see you dont get away with it ill tell them the truth when i get back if youd got a gun youd shoot me now wouldnt you or are you only willing to murder by proxy well you havent got a gun and ill get back to berlin somehow ill tell them the truth then ill i paused for breath and he said telling the truth wont help tubby now and it wont help you either try to get the thing clear in your mind fraser tubbys dead and since you killed him its up to you to see that his death is to some purpose i didnt kill him i shouted you killed him he laughed do you think anybody will believe you they will when they know the facts when the police have searched membury when they have examined that plane and theyve interrogated youve nothing to support your story he said quietly the remains of harcourts plane are strewn over the countryside just north of here field and westrop will say that you ordered them to bale out that the engines had packed up you yourself will be reporting back from the area of the crash as for membury theres nothing left of the hangar now except a blackened ruin i felt suddenly exhausted so you knew what id do you knew what i was going to do back there at membury you fooled me into pushing out that load of scrap by god dont start using your fists he cut in sharply i may be older than you but im heavier and tougher his feet were straddled and his head was thrust forward his hands down at his sides ready for me i put my hands slowly to my head oh god i felt so weak so impotent get some sense into your head before i see you again he said you can still be in this thing with me as my partner it all depends on your attitude when you reach berlin for answer i turned away and walked slowly towards the woods once i glanced back saeton was still standing there watching me then as i entered the darkness of the trees i heard the engines roar through needlecovered branches i watched the machine turn and taxi to the runway end and then it went roaring across the airfield climbing a single white light like a faded comet dwindling into the moonlit night merging into the stars then there was silence and the still shadows of the woods closed round me i was alone in the russian zone of germany chapter seven for a long time after the plane had disappeared i stood there on the fringe of the woods gazing at the empty expanse of the airfield a small wind whispered in the upper branches of the fir trees and every few minutes there was the distant drone of a plane airlift pilots flying down the corridor to berlin those were the only sounds the cold seeped through my flying suit stiffening my limbs and at length i turned and walked into the woods a few steps and i had lost the airfield the trees closed round me and i was in a world apart it was very still there in the woods even the sound of my footsteps was muffled by the carpet of pine needles i could still hear the planes but i couldnt see them the branches of the trees cut me off from the sky and only a ghostly radiance told me that the moon still filled the world with its white light i found a path and followed it to the earth mound of an old dispersal point the frostcracked concrete was a white blaze in the moonlight cutting through the dark ranks of the trees to the open plain of the airfield i stopped there to consider what i should do my mind went back to the scene in the plane we had been flying almost due south when tubbys body slid through the open doorway i had gone straight back to the cockpit and then i had looked through my side window and seen hollmind airfield below me that meant that tubby had gone out north and slightly west of the field i followed the line of the concrete till i came out on to the edge of the airfield and turned left walking in the shadow of the woods till i reached the northwest extremity of the field buildings began there shapeless heaps of broken rubble i skirted these and entered the woods again following a path that ran in the direction i wanted to go it was four oclock when i began my search i remember thinking that saeton would be at wunstorf the plane would be parked on the loading apron in the row of tudors where it had stood before only the crew would be different and the numbers and the engines hed be reporting to ops and checking in at the mess finding a bed in the echoing concrete corridors of that labyrinth that housed the human force of the airlift hed be one of them now getting up when the world was asleep going to bed when others were shaving in a few hours perhaps it would be his plane id hear droning over on its way to berlin hed be up there with success ahead of him whilst i was down in these grim dark woods searching for the body of the man whod given two years to help him build those engines damn it it wasnt even his plane it was my plane nothing was really his even the design of the engines hed pinched from elses father blind anger drove everything else out of my head for a moment then i steadied myself forcing my mind to concentrate on the thing id set myself to do i decided to walk east and west backwards and forwards on a two mile front working gradually northwards the impossibility of complete coverage was apparent from the start i had a small pocket compass that was all the trees fortunately were well spaced out but they were all alike there was nothing to guide me it was obvious that at some points i should be covering the same ground twice maybe three times whilst at other times i should be leaving large gaps uncovered but it was the only course open to me and with a feeling of hopelessness i turned west on my first beat it was past five when i came to the western fringe of the woods and looked across the dreary flatness of the mecklenburg plain with the moon dipping over it towards the horizon and in that time i had stopped a hundred times to investigate a deeper shadow a dead branch that looked like an arm or a patch of white where a beam of direct moonlight shone on the bark of a pine trunk dawn found me at the end of the eastward beat the daylight penetrated slowly into the woods a slight lightening of the deeper shadows a paling of the moons whiteness i didnt really see it until i was in a clearing that showed me the bombbattered ruins of the hangars that lay along the north fringe of hollmind airfield it was a grey dawn still but pitilessly cold with great cloud banks rolling in from the north and the feel of snow in the air i ate two sandwiches and took a nip from the flask saeton had given me there was rum in that flask and i could feel the warmth of it trickling into my stomach but as i turned westward again on my third beat i was already tired there was no breath of wind the woods seemed frozen into silence the only sound was the drone of aircraft that sound had been with me all the time it was monotonous unending but god how glad i was of it that sound was my one link with the world with reality and as the daylight increased i began to look for the planes in the gaps in the trees at last i saw one it was flying across my line of march at about three thousand feet the thick belly unmistakable a york that meant that it had come from wunstorf the men in that plane would have breakfasted before dawn with the electric lights on and the mess warm with the smell of hot radiators and food they had hot food in their bellies and hot coffee i stood there in the clearing watching the plane rill it was out of sight the smell of coffee stronger than the smell of the pines remembering a shop id known as a kid that had a big grinder always working in the window spilling its fragrance into the street as the plane disappeared over the tops of the trees another came into sight exactly the same flying the same route flying the same height i watched another and another all yorks all exactly the same it was as though they were on an endless belt going behind the trees like those little white clay airgun targets you find at fairs the smell of coffee lingered with me as i went on into the sombre gloom of the woods shortly after midday it began to snow the flakes drifting gently down out of the leaden sky dark widelyspaced specks until they landed and were transformed to little splashes of virgin white it was less cold after the snow began to fall but by then i was feeling sleepy exhausted and hungry there were two sandwiches left and half a flask of rum i saved them for the night and stumbled on on my eighth beat i found a crumpled piece of metal it was lodged in the branches of a tree a piece of the tailplane of the tudor saeton had pranged at membury it didnt seem possible that it was less than twelve hours since id slung that fragment out of the open door of the fuselage with these woods flashing by below me an hour later i nearly walked into a russian patrol i was almost on top of them before i heard the low murmur of their voices they were in a group short men with round sallow faces black boots and brown tunics buttoned to the neck the soldiers leaned on their rifles while two officers bent over a piece of metal that gleamed dully i wondered what theyd make of these scraps of metal scattered through the woods as i slipped past them and continued eastward the snow thickened and the sky darkened patches of white showed in the gaps between the trees and these i had to avoid for fear of leaving footprints in the gathering darkness and my growing weakness every shadow became a russian soldier my progress became wretchedly slow finally it was too dark to go on and i dug a hole for myself close under the lowsweeping branches of a large fir and lay down in it covering myself with pine needles i finished the two sandwiches and drank the rest of the rum but within an hour the warmth of the rum had completely evaporated the cold of the night moved in on me gripping my limbs like a steel sheet sleep was impossible i lay and shivered my mind a blank my body in a coma of misery the cold covered everything the snow became hard and powdery the trees cracked by midnight i was so frozen that i got to my feet and stamped and swung my arms my breath hung like smoke in front of my face the snow clouds had passed stars shone frostyclear above my head and the moon had risen showing me a beautiful fairywhite world of christmas trees i started moving westward walking blindly not really caring where i went so long as i got some warmth into my limbs and that was how i found tubbys flying helmet i just stumbled on it lying on a patch of snow i suppose what had happened was that it had been caught on one of the branches of a tree and when the snow weighed the branch down it had slipped to the ground i dont remember feeling any excitement i think i was too numbed with cold to have any feelings at all and i had no sense of surprise either i had been so determined to find him that it hadnt occurred to me that i should fail i have always believed that if you go out for a thing hard enough you get it in the end and i didnt bother to consider the virtual impossibility of the task i had set myself but though i had found his helmet i could find no trace of tubby himself there was just the helmet nothing else after a thorough search of the area i returned to the spot where the helmet had lain the trees were very thick and in the darkness of the shadows it was impossible to see whether there was anything lodged in the branches in the end i climbed to the top of the tree that overhung the spot with my head thrust above the snowladen branches i looked over a plain of white spikes that glistened in the moonlight by shaking the tree i got rid of most of the snow the needle foliage looked very green but there was no sign of anything that would prove that this was the spot where tubby had fallen i was halfway down the tree back in the world of halflight and shadows when my hand slid from the gritty surface of the bark to something softer my fingers closed on it feeling the smoothness of light material i didnt need to look at it to know that this was nylon i pulled at it and my hand came away with a torn strip of parachute silk about the length of a scarf i was excited then that strip of nylon silk showed that tubby had pulled his parachute release before he hit the ground and i went tumbling down the tree oblivious of the snow that fell on my neck and trickled in icy streams down my back oblivious of everything but that single fact tubby wasnt dead he might have hurt himself but hed regained consciousness hed pulled the release and his parachute had opened and i realised then how the fear of finding him a mangled bloodstained heap of broken bones and torn flesh had haunted me in a frenzy i searched the area again trampling the snow in my haste to find out what had happened to him after hed crashed through the trees but the snow hid all trace at length utterly exhausted i sat down on a dry patch of ground with my back against the bole of a tree and lit one of my last cigarettes i had searched the area in a circle extending about fifty yards from the spot where i had come upon the helmet i had found no trace of him clearly one of two things had happened either he had been all right and had left the area on foot or else he had been injured and some woodman had found him and got him away or perhaps it had been the russians whod found him maybe the patrol id seen in the afternoon had come upon him and carted him off to hollmind the possibility that he might be dead was nagging at me again i had to be sure that he was alive i got to my feet again i would have to widen my search radiate out until i found some trace i began walking again circling out from the spot where the helmet had lain the snow helped me here for all i had to do was walk outside the footprints id made on my previous circuit the moon was high overhead now and it was much lighter under the trees at four oclock in the morning after walking for over two hours in a widening circle i stumbled upon a broad track running through the woods one side of the track was sheltered by the trees and was clear of snow and there i found the marks of a farm cart i traced it back to a spot where it had stood for some time the tracks did not continue they finished there and i knew then that tubby was either dead or injured cold and wretched i turned westward and followed the track till it left the shelter of the woods and ran out into the bitter flatness of ploughed land that was all white under the moon the wheel tracks were lost under the snow now but the track was still visible two deep ruts swinging southwest towards a christmas card huddle of steeproofed farm buildings as i approached i saw the yellow glow of a light it came from the halfopen door of a barn inside the barn a man was filling sacks with potatoes from a deep square hole in the floor wooden boards heavy with earth were stacked against the heapedup straw and earth had been piled near the door the man must have sensed my presence for he suddenly paused in his work and looked straight at me where i stood in the gaping doorway he was short and wiry with a broad forehead and his eyes looked startled and afraid wer sind sie was wollen sie i am an english flier i replied in german i am looking for a friend of mine who may be injured he put down his fork and came towards me his dark frightened eyes peering first at my face then at my clothes come in then and close the door please the wind blow it open i think he fixed the latch with trembling fingers i was afraid it was the russians he laughed nervously they want everything all my crops for the east you know his speech was jerky to feed our pigs we must keep something he held the lantern close to me still examining me uncertainly apparently he was finally satisfied for he lowered the lantern and said you look tired you walk far yes what has happened to my friend i asked he was brought here wasnt he is he is he dead i waited dreading his answer he shook his head slowly nein he is not dead but he injure himself very much when he land in the trees now you lie down in the straw there i must finish my work before it is light then i get you something to eat eh but i wasnt listening thank god i breathed it aloud tubby was alive he was alive and id found him i hadnt killed him after all i felt suddenly lightheaded i wanted to laugh but once i started to laugh i felt i should never stop i held my breath fighting to control myself then i stumbled into the straw sinking into it relaxing knowing i had done everything i could and that god had been with me i had found tubby and he wasnt dead when did you find him i asked four days ago the man answered he had returned to his work and you have not handed him over to the russians he paused with a forkful of potatoes no we do not hand him to the russians you have to thank my wife for that our daughter is in berlin she live in the french sector with her husband who work on the railways there but for the she would be like us she would be under the russians i mumbled my thanks my head kept nodding it was very warm and comfortable there in the straw is he badly hurt ja he is not so good several ribs are broken and his arm and he has concussion but he is conscious you can speak with him he should have a doctor my voice sounded very far away i couldnt keep my eyes open you do not have to worry our doctor is coming here to see him every day he is a good doctor and he do not love the russians because they take him to the east for a year to work with our prisoners once he meet my son my son hans is a prisoner of the russians since before that he is in north africa and italy and then on the eastern front i do not see him now for almost six years but soon i hope he will come home we have had two letters his voice droned pleasantly and my eyelids closed i dreamt i was back in stalag luft i but the guards all wore rightnecked brown tunics and black kneelength boots and there was always snow and no hope of release or escape only the hope of death they kept on interrogating me trying to get me to admit that id killed tubby there were intensely bright lights and they kept on shaking me i woke to find the farmer bending over me shaking my shoulder wake up herr fraser he pronounced the v sharply and not as a z it is seven oclock we will have some food now and then you can talk with your friend you know my name i murmured sleepily and then i felt in my breast pocket my papers were still there he must have put them back after examining them i clambered stiffly to my feet i was cold and very tired i think perhaps we put your flying clothes under the straw eh i do not wish my men to know i have a british flier here by talking one of them might be given my farm that is something they learn from the nazis he said the word nazis unemotionally as one might talk of an avalanche or some other act of god when i had hidden my flying suit he took me across the farmyard to the house it was a cold bleak dawn heavy with leaden cloud that promised more snow overhead i heard the drone of the planes flying in to berlin but i couldnt see them for the ceiling was not much more than a thousand my memory of the kleffmanns house is vague a memory of warmth and the smell of bacon of a big kitchen with a great clumsy glowing stove and a brighteyed friendly little woman with wisps of greying hair and the slow sure movements of one who lives close to the earth and whose routine never changes i also remember the little bedroom high up under the roof where tubby lay his fat cheeks strangely hollow his face flushed with fever and his eyes unnaturally bright the ugly patterned wallpaper with butterflies flying up vertical strips was littered with photographs of hans kleffmann who would some day come back from russia and meet his mother and father again for the first time in six years there were photographs of him as a baby as a boy at the school in hollmind in the uniform of the nazi youth organisation and finally in the uniform of the wehrmacht against the background of the hradcany palace in prague in a polish village with the eiffel tower behind him in the desert leaning on a tank in rome with st peters dome over his left shoulder and there were a few less formal snaps hans in bathing shorts on the italian riviera hans with a darkhaired girl in naples hans skiing in the dolomites hans filled that room with the nostalgia of a boys life leading inevitably irrevocably to the russian prison camp they showed me a letter it was four lines long i am well and the russians treat me very kindly the food is good and i am happy love hans tubby lying in that small neatly austere bed was an intruder he was asleep when i went in the kleffmanns left me sitting by his bed whilst they got on with the business of the farm tubbys breath came jerkily and painfully but he slept on and i had a long time in which to become familiar with hans its almost as though i had met him i got to know him so well from those faded photographs arrogant and fanatical in victory hardfaced and bitter in defeat there in that room i was face to face with the germany of the future the germany that was being hammered out on the vulcan forge of british american and soviet policy i found my eyes turning back repeatedly to the grim relentless face in the photograph taken at lwow in the autumn of and comparing it with the smiling carefree kid in knickerbockers taken outside the hollmind school then tubby opened his eyes and stared at me at first i thought he wasnt going to recognise me we stared at each other for a moment and then he smiled he smiled at me with his eyes his lips a tight line constricted by pain neil how did you get here i told him and when id finished he said you came back that was kind of you he had difficulty in speaking and his voice was very weak are they looking after you all right i asked awkwardly he nodded slowly the old woman is very kind she treats me as though i were her son and the doctor does his best you ought to be in hospital i said he nodded again but its better than being in the hands of the russians thank god youre alive anyway i said i thought i hesitated and then said i was afraid id killed you you were unconscious when you went out through the door i didnt mean it tubby please believe that forget it he said i understand it was good of you to come back he winced as he took a breath did you take the plane back to saeton yes i said its got our engines in now and saetons at wunstorf they ordered him over immediately to replace harcourts tudor his mouth opened to the beginning of a laugh and then he jerked rigid at the pain it caused him you ought to be in hospital i said again listen i added do you think you could stand another journey in that cart up to hollmind airfield i saw him clench his teeth at the memory could you stand it if you knew at the end there would be a hospital and everything in the way of treatment you need the sweat shone on his forehead yes he breathed so quietly that i could hardly hear him yes id face it again if i knew that maybe the doc here would fix me up with a shot of morphia but theyve so little in the way of drugs theyve been very kind but theyre germans and they havent the facilities for his voice trailed away i was afraid he was going to fade into unconsciousness and i said quickly im going now tubby tonight ill start out for berlin ill make it just as quickly as i can then within a few hours ill be back with a plane and well evacuate you from hollmind okay he nodded goodbye then for the moment ill get through somehow and then well get you to a hospital hold on to that youll be all right the corners of his lips twitched in a tight smile good luck he whispered and then as i rose from the bed his hand came out from beneath the sheets and closed on mine neil i had to bend down to hear him i want you to know i wont say anything ill leave things as i find them the plane crashed engine failure ignition his voice died away and his eyes closed bending close to him i could hear the sob of his breathing i reached under his pillow for his handkerchief to wipe the sweat from his forehead the handkerchief was dark with blood i knew then that his lung was punctured i wiped his forehead with my own handkerchief and then went quietly out of hanss little bedroom and down the dark stairs to the kitchen they gave me a bed and i slept until it was dark then after a huge meal by the warmth of the kitchen stove i said goodbye to the kleffmanns in a night or two i told them i will be back with a plane and well get him away gut gut the farmer nodded it is better so he is very bad i think also it is dangerous for us having him here in the farm frau kleffmann came towards me she had a bulky package in her hand here is food for your journey herr fraser some chicken and some bread and butter and apples she hesitated if anything happens do not worry about your friend he is safe here we will look after him there has been war between us but my hans is in russia i will care for your friend as i would have others care for hans if he is sick auf wiedersehen her gnarled hand touched my arm and her eyes filled with tears she turned quickly to the stove the farmer accompanied me to the door i try to arrange for you to ride in a lorry who go once a week to berlin with potatoes but he spread his hands hopelessly the driver is sick he do not go tonight if you go three miles beyond hollmind there is a cafe there for motor drivers i think you will perhaps get a ride there he gave me instructions how to bypass hollmind and then shook my hands viel gluck herr fraser come soon please for your friend i fear he is very sick more snow had fallen during the day but now the clouds had been swept away by a bitter east wind and the night was cold and clear the moon had not yet risen but the stars were so brilliant that i had no difficulty in seeing my way as soon as my eyes became accustomed to the darkness high above me the airlift planes droned at regular threeminute intervals i could see their navigation lights every now and then green and red dots moving steadily through the litter of stars and the drift of the milky way the white pinpoint of their taillights pointed the way to berlin for me i had only to follow them through the night sky and i should arrive at gatow for them gatow was twenty minutes flying time but for me i turned south on the hard straight road that led to the town of hollmind wondering how long the journey would take me the snow was deep and crisp under my feet kleffmann had given me an old fieldgrey wehrmacht greatcoat and a wehrmacht forage cap hanss castoff clothing for the first time since id landed in germany i felt warm and wellfed nothing stirred on the road the snow seemed to have driven all transport off it my footsteps were muffled and i walked in a deep silence the only sound was the drone of the planes overhead and the hum of the wind in the telegraph wires i reached the fork where the road branched off that i was to take in order to bypass hollmind there was a signboard there berlin km fiftyfour kilometres isnt far not much more than thirty miles a days march but though i had had a good rest i was still tired and very stiff i was wearing shoes and my feet were blistersore and there was the cold for a time the warmth of exercise kept it out but as i tired the sweat broke out on my body and chilled into a clammy icecold film and then the wind cut through my clothing and into my flesh seeming to blow straight on to my spine god it was cold for miles it seemed i walked along byroads through unmarked snow and there was no traffic i must have missed the turning back on to the berlin road for it was almost midnight when i finally found it again and i saw no transport cafe only dark woods and the illimitable miles of white agricultural land flat and windswept several times i tried to thumb a lift but each time the heavy longnosed german trucks ignored me thundering by in a shower of snow that spattered icily on my face however the fourth truck i waved to stopped and a voice called out wohin freund berlin i shouted there was a pause and then a red army soldier clambered down from the cabin he was sleepy and hed left his rifle in the truck that was the only thing that saved me he asked me in vile german for my papers fortunately the edge of the road was wooded i dived into the dark shelter of the pines ignoring the branches that lashed at my face running until i was exhausted dawn found me trudging through powdery snow along a narrow side road flanked with trees following blindly the drone of the airlift planes it was a bloodred dawn wild and violent and full of cold the sun was a misty red disc above the pines i staggered into the shelter of the woods ate frau kleffmanns chicken and bread wrapped myself in pine needles and slept all that day i slept if you can call it sleep it was more like a bonechilled coma i suppose i was suffering from mental as well as physical exhaustion at all events i found the present and the past inextricably mixed in my mind so that the urge to reach berlin became confused with the urge to get out of germany and i was back in those cold wretched starved weeks of escape night came at last cold and black there were no stars i stumbled to the road and headed southeast the drone of the planes my only guide i passed through a small town not bothering to note its name joined a broader road where the snow had been churned up by traffic and the first truck that came along stopped beside me in the headlights i saw that the country bordering the road was flat if there had been woods i should almost certainly have dived into them but it was bare open plain wo wollen sie bin mein lieber the driver called berlin i heard myself answer in a cracked trembling voice any moment i expected the brown tunic clad figure of a red army man to jump out and face me but all that happened was that the driver called kommen sie rauf kamerad ich fahre auch nach berlin it was almost too good to be true i hauled myself up into the cabin the driver was alone there was no mate with him the gears ground and the old vehicle lurched forward wheels spinning in the snow the cabin was hot and stuffy and smelt comfortingly of exhaust fumes was wollen sie in berlin the driver asked work i answered him gruffly in german out of russia into the western sectors eh he grinned at me he was a small hardbitten little man with ferrety eyes well i dont blame you if i thought there was a trucking job for me in the western sectors id be across the border in no time but i have a wife and family up in lubeck every night i come down this same road sometimes i wish i was up there flying the i was in the luftwaffe you know radio operator had a little radio business before the war but now of course it is finished there are so few radio sets it is better to drive a truck but those bastards up there get to berlin a lot quicker than i do my wife always tells me he went on and on about himself and the drone of his voice merged with the engine and the eternal distant hum of aircraft throbbing through the clouds my head nodded sleepy with the sudden unaccustomed warmth of the cabin his voice lost itself in the engine i slept fitfully conscious of the lights of a town of a signboard caught in the headlights that said berlin km of the unending dirty yellow of hardpacked snow slipping away beneath us and then finally he was shaking me aufwachen aufwachen berlin i opened my eyes blearily and surveyed unlit slushfilled streets flanked by the empty blasted shells of buildings which had not been touched since wed smashed them to rubble five years ago so this was berlin where are you making for i asked him potsdam he peered at me out of the corners of his eyes thats in the russian zone dont imagine youll be wanting to go there he laughed mirthlessly his breath whistling through broken front teeth where are we i asked oranienburg he was still looking at me out of the corners of his eyes you are a pole no you are not german not with that accent i didnt say anything and he shrugged his shoulders na was schadet es schon he eased his foot on the accelerator pedal well where do you wish to go eh in a few moments i turn right i have to keep inside the russian zone but if you follow this road it will lead you to frohnau frohnau is in the french sector frohnau frohnau beacon frohnau meant berlin to every airlift pilot but the warmth of the truck held me tight in my seat frohnau was many miles from gatow i should have to walk right across berlin more than twenty kilometres where do you go when you turn right i asked velten schonewald airfield falkensee staaken airfield past gatow and then into potsdam choose which you like its all the same to me youre going near gatow i asked him his eyes narrowed what do you want gatow for eh his voice was harsher he braked violently and the lorry skidded as he swung right off the main oranienburgberlin road why gatow he repeated and when i didnt say anything he added slowly gatow is in the british sector its owned by die verdatnmten tommies night after night they come die verfluchten kerle i have send my family to my parents in hamburg night after night the english come they flatten hamburg and the schweinehunde kill both the kids the boy was nine and the girl five they were crushed when the building they shelter in collapses he stopped talking and stared at me why do you want gatow eh i have a job to go to in the british sector i answered what sort of a job i thought desperately remembering the crowded nissen huts at the edge of the offloading apron at gatow i said labour corps i have a friend who is a checker at gatow unloading the airlift planes his lips tightened you say airlift when we always say why do you say airlift i shrugged my shoulders only die verdammten english and americans call it airlift for a long time there was a tense silence in the cabin we were entering falkensee now staaken aerodrome lay ahead and then gatow please your papers i wish to see your papers i hesitated i have no papers i said i felt empty and cold inside so no papers eh he peered through the windshield searching the road ahead with his eyes there were few lights falkensee was asleep then far ahead in the gleam of the headlights i saw two figures in the grey of the german police the drivers foot checked on the accelerator and his eyes swung nervously to me i knew what he was going to do then i could see him working it out in his mind there was only one thing for me to do i felt with my hand for the handle of the door and pushed it swung back violently and a stream of bitter air struck my face i heard the door clang against the tin of the cabin saw the rutted slushy snow spraying up from the wheels heard the driver shout as he leaned across to grip my arm and i jumped i hit the snow with my feet and was flung down striking the side of the lorry with my head a sudden blackness enveloped me as the snow closed over my face i could not have been out for more than a few seconds for the lorry was still screeching to a halt its horn blaring excitedly as i lifted my head from the cold gritty filth of the snow i pressed myself upwards with my hands feeling suddenly sick at the sight of my blood scarlet against the yellow gravelcovered surface of the snow then i was on my feet and running for the shelter of a sidestreet shouts echoing after me as i turned out of the main street i looked over my shoulder and saw that the two german policemen were level with the stationary truck now and running towards me whistles shrilled the sidestreet was narrow and flanked with the rubble ruins of shattered buildings i scrambled over a pile of bricks and mortar and half staggered half fell into a cleared space that had been the cellars of houses in the next street an open doorway gaped black and i slid into the welcoming darkness and leaned panting against the wall almost oblivious in my fear of the nauseating smell of human excreta more whistles shrilled and voices shouted in the darkness outside boots climbed the mound of rubble up which i had scrambled mortar dust streamed down in a choking cloud in the open doorway hier kurt hierlang ist er gelaufen the voice was heavy and menacing the man was standing right above my hideout there was a clatter of dislodged bricks higher up the crumbling rubble and a voice answered faintly nein komm hierlang hier kann er zur friedrichstrasse durchkommen the chase went thudding and slithering over my head and gradually faded into the distance all the time i had been standing there rigid now my muscles relaxed i wiped the sweat from my forehead my hand was gritty and i winced with the pain of the grit on raw flesh it was the old cut in my forehead that had opened up my hand came away wet and sticky with my own blood the moon was shining opaquely through low cloud and the faint ghostly light of the doorless gap showed my hand all red and dripping the blood was trickling down my face getting into my eyes and into the corner of my mouth the way it had done that first time id come to membury only there was grit in my mouth now sharp and hard setting my teeth on edge as i clenched them i wiped my hands on the inside of my clothes and then tied my handkerchief over the cut for a long time i just stood there trying to stop the trembling of my limbs it was very cold it seemed as though my body had no warmth and the wind cut like a knife through the gaping doorway nervous reaction and the shock of my fall from the moving lorry i wished to god i had some liquor with me something to warm the frozen guts of my belly i moved at last and went out of the nauseous cell i was facing a cleared strip where demolition gangs had been working there was a railway and a line of loaded tip trucks the snow was a thin layer of powder that had deepened into windy little drifts in the corners of stillstanding masonry behind rose a hill of brick and rubble over which the gaunt finger of a building pointed a broken chimney at the pale luminous clouds there was no sound except the distant rumble of the airlift rolling into gatow the pursuit had moved on and lost me i stood for a moment getting my bearings this was falkensee a western suburb of berlin the sound of the planes landing and taking off from gatow drew me as something familiar friendly and homelike i could almost smell the coffee and cakes in the malcolm club but if i went direct to gatow i should all the time be in the russian zone to the east lay the british sector and i knew it couldnt be far away i faced into the wind and began to walk my left leg was very stiff and painful when i moved i had grazed my kneecap when i fell and had strained a muscle somewhere in the groin but i didnt care about that my one thought was to get out of the russian zone and into the british sector the sight of another human being sent me scuttling into the doorway or into the shadows of the broken buildings that flanked the streets and yet not more than two or three miles away in the same sort of streets i should be able to stop the first person i met and demand his help i twisted and turned through narrow broken streets always keeping the sound of gatow over my right shoulder at length i came out on to a broad highway that led almost due east it was falkenhagener chaussee and it ran straight like a ruled line towards spandau and spandau i knew was in the british sector it it was three oclock in the morning and the falkenhagener chaussee seemed dead nothing stirred the snowpowdered thoroughfare was deserted the crumbling masses of the buildings were white mounds in the darkness marked occasionally by a stillstanding wall tottering skyward like some twothousandyearold tomb seen along the appian way somewhere in berlin a train whistled like an owl in a forest of dead oaks there were no lights no people no suggestion even that anything lived here it was all devastation and slow timeless ruin for an hour or more i limped along that arrowstraight road without seeing a living soul with only the constant drone of gatow to remind me i was still in a living world and to give me hope then at last when i was tottering with weakness i saw the distant gleam of lights shining on a road barrier i was nearing the limits of the russian zone that knowledge gave me fresh strength i walked to within five hundred yards of the barrier and then turned down a sidestreet at a crossing a small truck slipped quietly eastward without lights i followed it on to a quiet rubblepacked track that ran close beside the railway a goods train clanked noisily a rattle of buffers that seemed to split the night it was so loud in the utter stillness for half an hour i walked eastward searching the track ahead trembling and scuttling into the shadows at every sign of movement but always it was nothing but my eyes playing me tricks and at the end of half an hour i knew i must have passed over into the british sector a blockaderunning german lorry had shown me the way through the road checks i followed thei railway right into spandau and there a german railway worker going on duty at five in the morning directed me to a british army mt section i must have looked a pretty sight for all the time he was talking to me the german kept looking nervously about him and when he had given the directions i wanted he was almost running in his hurry to get away from me i found the place without difficulty it was an raoc depot and a big board directed me into the sidings of what had once been a huge factory i was trembling with fatigue and feeling sick with relief when i faced the german orderly who seemed to be the only person awake in the depot at first he refused to do anything about me his eyes were coldly contemptuous i began to curse him in english all the filthy words i could think of spewed off my tongue as i consigned the whole german race to perdition with tears of frustration hot on my eyeballs still he didnt move and then i saw hanging on a peg a web belt complete with holster and revolver i dived towards it pulled the revolver out and thumbed forward the safety catch with trembling fingers now get the duty officer i shouted quick or i shoot the man hesitated and then hurried out returning a few minutes later with a tall lanky youth who had an officers greatcoat wrapped over his pyjamas a solitary pip gleaming on its shoulder whats the trouble he asked sleepily rubbing at his eyes my names fraser i said squadron leader ј fraser ive just got out of the russian zone ive got to get to gatow at once he was staring at the weapon in my hand do you usually go about threatening people with revolvers he came across to me and took the revolver out of my hands this is an army revolver is it yours no i said i got it there and i nodded to the belt hanging on the hook the lieutenant swung round on the orderly whats that equipment doing there heinrich they began a long discussion as to why an officer had left it in the orderly room at length i shouted at him for christs sake he turned and stared at me blankly heinrich here says you threatened him with this revolver he said accusingly look i couldnt keep my hands still i was so angry cant you understand what im trying to tell you im an raf officer im a pilot on the airlift and my plane crashed at hollmind ive just got out of the russian zone i must get to gatow quickly i want transport do you understand some transport ive got to get to gatow i was talking wildly i knew that i knew i must seem like a lunatic but there was nothing i could do about it my nerves were all to pieces may i have a look at your papers please i fumbled for my wallet dropping the papers on the floor in my nervous haste the german orderly picked them up for me and handed them back with a click of the heels his eyes were no longer contemptuous the lieutenant glanced through them you say you crashed at hollmind i nodded when when was it the night before last or no i mustnt say that it was the original night he wanted the night when tubby had gone out through the door my mind searched desperately for a date but id lost all sense of time several days ago i mumbled whats it matter when i crashed whats your base wunstorf you were flying a york no a tudor tanker a tudor his face suddenly cleared and he gave me a sheepish grin i say im awfully sorry sir of course i know who you are now youre the chap who flew that messerschmitt out of germany during the war i mean well theres been a lot about it in the papers nobody could find any trace of the plane and you and carter were missing he looked at me hesitating awkwardly you look as though youve had a rough trip sir are you all right i mean oughtnt i to run you down to a firstaid post i must get to gatow i said yes of course ill drive you myself ill just put some things on wont be a jiffy he hesitated in the doorway would you like a cup of char and youd probably like to get cleaned up a bit thats an awfully nasty cut youve got he took me through to the washroom the water was icy cold however i cleaned off some of the dirt and he produced a proper bandage from a firstaid kit then the german orderly appeared with a steaming tin mug of dark sweet tea ten minutes later we were in an army fifteen hundredweight roaring along the wilhelmstrasse we turned left on to the gatower damm i knew i was home then for planes were thundering low overhead with their flaps down and the underbelly of the low cloud was illumined by the brilliant fireglow of the sodium lights and highintensity cross bars that marked the approach to gatow we were stopped at the barrier to gatow airport and a corporal of the raf police came out and peered at the car a gleam of whiteblancoed webbing against the blue of his battledress then he asked for our papers squadron leader fraser is just out of the russian zone my lieutenant explained quickly hes the pilot of that tudor that crashed the corporal handed my papers back without looking at them glad youre safe sir he drew himself up stiffly and saluted the truck ground forward where do you want to go the lieutenant asked terminal building all the time id been getting closer to gatow id been wondering about what i should do when i got there there was diana that was the first thing i had to do tell diana that tubby was alive and safe and i wanted to get hold of saeton now that i was back in the organised life of occupied berlin i had a feeling that there might be difficulties raised about landing an raf plane in the russian zone officially it would be embarrassing if the plane were captured by a russian patrol the diplomatic repercussions would be endless and farreaching but if saeton would land there unofficially he had the nerve to do it he wouldnt be hidebound by regulations and diplomatic dangers saeton was the person i had to see will you take me straight to the malcolm club please i said malcolm club thats down by faso isnt it thats right sure you dont want to report in to ops first he asked no the malcolm club please okay the truck slipped down through the trees past the lighted entrance of the mess and then suddenly there were the yellow and purple runway and perimeter lights of gatow with the concrete square box of the terminal building to the right rising to the tall lighted windows of the control tower the truck turned left through the whitepainted boundary fence skirted a bea skymaster and hummed across the tarmac which was streaked with a white winddriven powder of snow the hangars were dark rectangular shadows to our left and ahead the lights of piccadilly circus shone yellow showing the plume standing empty of aircraft planes moved along the perimeter track engines roaring drowning the thinner sound of planes streaming in along the runway everything was normal familiar i might never have been outside the organised busservice of the airlift we skirted piccadilly circus tyres jolting rhythmically on the joints of the concrete and then we were on the faso apron where big arc lamps blazed and there was the bustle of planes and lorries and german offloading teams the control tower shack on its scaffold stilts stood high and dark above the line of nissen huts shall i wait for you the lieutenant asked as he drew up at the roundel signboard of the malcolm club no thanks i said ill be all right now and thank you very much for running me out not at all he got down and opened the door for me his hand steadying me as though he thought i were too weak to climb out on my own goodbye sir and good luck he gave me a parade ground salute i hesitated at the entrance of the club and stood watching him get back into his truck turn and drive off the red taillight dwindled and was lost amongst the litter of lights i stared at the planes coming in they were daks from lubeck with coal there was a line of them standing in the slush of the apron i stared at them dully a girl checker with the nearest german labour team looked up from her manifest and stared at me she was big and fairhaired with high cheek bones she reminded me of else except that she was covered in coal dust i turned towards the entrance to the malcolm club still hesitating reluctant to go in if diana were there it would be all right but if she werent id have to explain myself and the filthy state i was in and i should be surrounded by a barrage of questions as air crew after air crew came in and wanted to know the story of the crash a group of raf boys tumbled out of the hut laughing and talking bringing with them through the open doorway that familiar smell of coffee and cakes there was no point in putting it off any longer besides the smell of the place had made me realise how hungry i was i brushed quickly at my filthy clothing and pushed open the door it was hot inside the stove roaring red and the place full of smoke and cheerful chatter i crossed the long room pushing my way towards the counter conscious of the gradual fall of conversation as eyes fastened on my scarecrow figure is mrs carter here i asked the girl behind the counter i had spoken quietly but even so my voice sounded loud in the silence that had developed the girl looked nervously to the mute groups behind me no she said she doesnt come on until seven i glanced at my watch it was halfpast six ill wait i said can i have some coffee and a plate of sandwiches please the girl hesitated all right she said a hand touched my shoulder i spun round and found myself facing a big blond man with a wide moustache who are you he asked the silent circle of eyes echoed his question my names fraser i answered fraser he turned the name over in his mouth as though searching for it in his memory and then he suddenly boomed out fraser you mean the pilot of that tudor thats right i said fraser good christ almighty he seized hold of my hand dont know you from adam old man but allow me to do the honours and welcome you back you look about all in here joan the coffee and sandwiches are on me what happened come on tell us all about it weve got to go in a minute what happened the circle of faces closed in like a pack of wolves avid for news their eyes shone with excitement questions were hurled at me from all directions theres nothing to tell i murmured awkwardly the engines failed the plane crashed near hollmind and youve just got out of the russian zone yes the girl thrust a cup of coffee and a plate of sandwiches into my hand if you dont mind id rather not talk about it the heat of the room was making my legs shake under me im very tired you must excuse me i must sit down hands gripped my arms at the elbows and halflifted me to one of the easychairs by the stove you sit there and drink your coffee old man well have you fixed up in no time i must speak to mrs carter i insisted all right well get her for you they left me then and i grasped the coffee cup in my hands feeling the warmth of it spread up my arms savouring the glorious reviving smell of it i could hear them talking about me in the background fresh air crews came in to replace others that went out to their planes the word was passed on and they took up the story talking about me in whispers somebody came and squatted down on his haunches beside me glad to know youre back fraser he said you must be the greatest escape merchant alive all the boys back at wunstorf will be glad as hell to know youre back we thought youd had it wunstorf i stared at him his face seemed vaguely familiar thats right remember me im the guy that was sitting right next to you at dinner that night you crashed you were growling at westrop for talking too much about the russians seems he had second sight or something ill see that the station commander knows youre back is the wunstorf wave coming in now i asked yes just started to come in is a man called saeton flying a tudor tanker on the lift yet is he flying the lift the kid laughed ill say he is been flying for two days now and hes got the development section puzzled as hell flies on his two inboard engines all the time except on takeoff and his fuel consumption is knocking holes the size of a hangar door in all the aero engine boys ideas he said you worked on the motors with him at one time boy hes certainly got them guessing boffins from farnborough are flying out tomorrow with the cto of the ministry of civil aviation and a big pot from the ministry of supply saeton will be in shortly how soon i asked about quarter of an hour the tudors arent far behind us an raf corporal pushed forward he had a big web satchel with a red cross on it ive got an ambulance outside sir do you think you can walk to it or shall i get a stretcher in for you you can send your bloody ambulance away i said angrily why the devil couldnt they leave me alone im not leaving here until ive seen mrs carter the fellow hesitated very good sir ill be back in a minute and then well get you patched up nasty cut you got there sure youre all right sir of course im all right i snapped ive walked nearly twenty miles already tonight very good sir he went to the door and opened it and at that moment diana came in her face devoid of makeup looked quite haggard at sight of me she stopped as though she couldnt believe that i was really sitting there in an easychair beside the stove so it is you she said it almost accusingly then she came slowly towards me what happened what have you done with tubby why didnt you let him jump with the others her voice trembled and there was a look of dull pain in her eyes you neednt worry i said hes safe she stared at me youre lying her voice was suddenly hard you know hes dead tubbys all right i repeated hes alive i dont understand her voice had faded to a whisper it cant be true if youre alive then its tubby whose body her words died away in a choking sob tubbys alive i said again i reached out and caught hold of her hand her fingers were cold and slack in mine diana i want your help hes alive but hes injured and weve got to get him out youve got to persuade saeton to fly there and get him out what are you saying her voice was flat and toneless i didnt understand her attitude i thought youd be glad i said i came straight here to tell you glad that youre alive she turned away of course im glad only i loved him she suddenly burst out i loved him i tell you somebody bent over me an officer in raf uniform with dark bootbutton eyes and a thin aquiline nose youre fraser arent you he said they just told me for gods sake i pushed him away im trying to tell mrs carter something yes i heard i think youd better listen to me first im the io here we know all about your plane it crashed two miles north of hollmind airfield dived straight into the ground i stared at him who told you it crashed at hollmind i demanded the russians the russians yes after denying the whole thing for days they came through with a report yesterday theyve found the wreckage in the woods north of hollmind he leaned down and lowered his voice they also found the remains of one body we didnt know whether it was yours or carters his glance slid to diana whose face was buried in her hands now youre safe of course we know whose it was he straightened up soon as youre ready well go up to my office and ill get a statement from you ill have to have a report ready for the station commander i stared at him why should the russians make such a report it didnt make sense i felt suddenly scared scared that they wouldnt believe what i had to tell them chapter eight the next quarter of an hour was a nightmare i started by trying to convince the intelligence officer that the russian report was nonsense it was a mistake he believed the information the russians had given him whats more the lieutenant who had driven me to gatow had reported to him after dropping me at the malcolm club he knew that id held a german orderly up with a revolver you dont know what youre saying or what youre doing fraser he said his voice was cold and practical better come up to my office and then ill take you along to the sick bay i thought of the little patrol of red army men in the woods near hollmind they knew damn well the plane hadnt dived into the ground can i see this report i asked him its up at my office now does the report give any details oh yes its quite detailed no question about it being your plane theyve even got the number twofivetwo he turned to the medical orderly who had returned take mrs carter back to her quarters wait i said if i couldnt convince him at least i might be able to convince diana i pulled myself out of my seat and went over to her catching hold of her shoulders and shaking her in my desperate urge to get her to concentrate on what i had to tell her youve got to listen to me diana she lifted her head and stared at me through teardimmed eyes i was with tubby yesterday he is alive the desire to believe me was there in her face hope showed for an instant in her eyes but then it died and she clenched her teeth take him away from me please she said in a whisper the io pulled my hand away from her shoulder the russians wouldnt say he was dead if he wasnt he pushed me gently back into the chair just take it easy youre a bit upset but its no good raising mrs carters hopes carters dead no question of that now all i want from you hes not dead i cut in angrily hes badly injured but hes alive hes at a farm stop it neil diana screamed at me for gods sake stop it why do you keep saying hes alive when you know hes dead if it hadnt been for me she added in a lifeless tone hed never have taken the job hed still have been with saeton bill wouldnt have crashed him hed have been all right with bill oh god she was beside herself and i sat there staring at the misery which made her face look wild and wondering how the devil i could convince her that her husband was alive i turned to the io i want to see the station commander i said i want a plane put at my disposal tonight do you think hed do that what do you want a plane for his tone was the sort you use to placate an excited child and i saw him exchange a quick glance with the medical orderly i want to fly to hollmind airfield i answered quickly if i can land at hollmind i can get carter out is that ambulance still here he asked the medical orderly yes sir mr fraser told me to send it away but i thought id better he stared at me without finishing the sentence good come along fraser you need a good hot drink warmth and a bed well soon have you fixed up his hand was on my arm gently but firmly raising me from my seat i flung him off cant you understand what im trying to tell you tubby carter is alive he didnt die in any crash it was on the tip of my tongue to say there hadnt been any crash but i knew he wouldnt believe that not unless i told him the whole story and i wasnt going to do that until i had seen saeton hes at a farm being cared for by the local doctor hes got a broken arm several broken ribs and a pierced lung and he needs treatment now be reasonable fraser the ios hand was back on my arm we all understand how you feel but its no good pretending hes alive just because youre worried that you jumped when he was still in the plane well get all that sorted out later now come on up to the sick bay so they were going to pin that on me i felt the blood rush hammering to my head damn them at least that wasnt the truth id gone back for him hadnt i i felt a sense of utter frustration taking hold of me and then dianas hand was on my arm why do you keep on talking about a farm she asked the desire to believe me was back in her face i told her about the kleffmanns then and about their son hans tubby is lying in hanss old room i said i halfclosed my eyes forcing into my mind the picture of that room the wallpaper has butterflies on it and its littered with faded photographs of hans the bedstead is of iron and brass and the single dormer window looks out on to the roof of a barn i seized hold of her shoulder again youve got to believe me diana youve got to help me persuade saeton to fly in to hollmind tonight please please for gods sake believe what im trying to tell you she stared at me and then she nodded slowly halfdazed i must believe you she said half to herself her eyes searched my face you do know what youre saying dont you you arent lying just to protect yourself to protect myself yes so that wed think you didnt leave him to she stopped and bit hold of her lip no i cant believe youd do that i guess you mean what you say she looked up quickly at the io leave us a minute do you mind id like to talk to him the io hesitated and then turned away to the coffee counter how did you know bill was here she was leaning forward and the unexpectedness of her question nearly caught me off my guard i was feeling wretchedly tired the warmth of the stove was making me sleepy i pushed my hand over my face one of the air crews a fellow from wunstorf told me i answered i shook myself trying to keep my mind clear i mustnt tell her what really happened if i did that saeton wouldnt help me can you find out when hell be in i asked her ive got to speak to him once i get up there in the terminal building theyll start questioning me and then theyll push me off to hospital or something saeton must take me to hollmind tubbys got to be flown out tonight why are you so set on bill going she asked he was a friend of tubbys i said it was tubby who got those engines made for him wasnt it damn it he owes tubby that theres no other reason she hesitated staring at me hard you say you jumped leaving tubby in the plane again the quickness of her question almost caught me off my guard i said nothing of the sort dont try and pin anything like that on to me i added angrily then why was he hurt and not you because i dropped my head into my hand pressing at the corners of my eyes with finger and thumb trying to loosen the band of strain that was tightening across my forehead i dont know i said wearily for gods sake stop asking me questions all i want you to do is to get saeton for me diana caught hold of the lapels of my german greatcoat youre lying her voice hissed between her clamped teeth youre lying neil i know you are youre hiding something what is it you must tell me what it is she was shaking me violently what happened what really happened leave me alone cant you i whispered if only shed leave me alone let me think get saeton i added i want to talk to saeton something happened that night didnt it something happened neil what was it please tell me what it was she was kneeling beside me now and her voice had risen hysterically i could feel the sudden silence in the room feel them staring at me the regular air crew boys men who knew nothing about my story who would be judging me in the light of diana clinging to my greatcoat and crying out what happened what happened that night wait till saeton comes i said wearily whats bill got to do with it was he the cause of it she looked wildly round and then swung fiercely back on me will you talk if bill is here will you tell me that really happened then yes if youll get him to fly out to hollmind tonight he can land at the airfield and then well get tubby out tubby will be all right then hollmind is a disused aerodrome i checked that yesterday when i got the news are you sure hell be able to land there hes done it once what do you mean i pressed my head into my hand nothing i said if i didnt get some sleep soon id be saying the first thing that came into my mind i didnt mean anything i murmured i dont know what im saying im very tired diana get saeton for me will you and stop asking me questions she hesitated as though on the brink of another question but all she said was bill isnt here yet the io was back at my side now you want saeton hell be here any minute now the first tudor has just come in you worked with him on these engines of his i understand yes i didnt want to talk any more the idea that the authorities wouldnt help me was firmly fixed in my mind saeton was the only man who could help me i sat there stupid with the warmth of the stove and the fatigue of my body feeling the blood drying in a crust on my temple watching the door air crews moved in and out and as they passed they stared at us silently as though we were some queer tableau entirely divorced from the solid everyday routine of flying in and out of berlin then at last the door was pushed open and saeton came striding in followed by his crew he was almost past us before he saw me he checked rocking back on his heels as though for an instant he had been caught off balance then his features set themselves into a smile of welcome hallo neil he reached down and grasped my shoulder glad youre safe but i noticed that his eyes didnt light up with his face they were hard as slate and withdrawn as though wrestling with the problem of my presence he had a silk sweat rag knotted round his throat and his flying suit was unzipped making him appear more solid than ever well what happened how did you get out i hitched a ride and walked the rest i said there was an awkward silence he seemed to want to put a question but his eyes slid to the others and he remained silent i knew suddenly that he was nervous i hadnt thought of him as a man who could ever be nervous but as he lit a cigarette his hands were trembling youve heard the news have you about the engines i mean theyre proving even better than we expected twenty per cent increase in power and a fortyfive per cent reduction in fuel consumption theyre going to be tubby is alive i said alive the echo of my statement was jerked out of him as though id hit him below the belt then he recovered himself are you sure youre not he stopped conscious of the silence of the others watching him where is he in a farmhouse near hollmind airfield i see he took a long pull at his cigarette the news had jolted him and i could see he didnt know what to do about it he glanced at diana and then at the io who drew him on one side i saw the mans lips frame the words russian report and i could almost have laughed at the thought of an raf intelligence officer giving saeton the details of what had happened to that plane when all the time it was sitting out there on the faso apron unloading fuel at length saeton said all right ill see if i can get some sense out of him mind if i talk to him alone the io agreed and led diana away saeton came and stood over me he was smiling for some reason the russians have been very helpful he said he was quite sure of himself again now youve heard about this report have you they say they found the remains of one of the crew i made no comment his head was in silhouette against the light it hung over me as it had done that first night at membury and he was smiling well how did you find him i told him about the search and when i had finished he said so hes injured badly broken arm and ribs and a pierced lung i said weve got to get him out he needs hospital treatment and if he doesnt get it i dont know i answered theres a german doctor looking after him but tubby is pretty bad i think he might die i see he ran his thumb along the blue line of his jaw what are you going to do about it i cant do anything that bloody little intelligence officer doesnt believe me i want you to tell them you believe what im saying persuade them to give us a plane us he gave a quick laugh tubby wont talk i said quickly he promised me im on the very edge of success he said and i realised that he had room for nothing else in that queer urgent mind of his yes i heard about that i said is it true officials are coming out from england he nodded his eyes lighting up everythings gone marvellously first trip my flight engineer was staggered by the performance of the engines within twentyfour hours it was all over the mess at wunstorf and raf engineers were flying the airlift with me checking for themselves now the ministry of civil aviation and the ministry of supply are sending their experts out including a boffin from farnborough by this afternoon what about tubby i said you cant abandon him youve got to get him out you should have thought about him before you told me you were going to the authorities as soon as you got back here i wont talk i said hastily nor will tubby its too late to say that now and then he added slowly as far as im concerned tubby is dead he said it without any emotion and i stared up at him seeing the hard line of his jaw the cold slatiness of his eyes unable to believe even then that he meant what he said weve got to get him out i insisted he shrugged his shoulders you know damn well i cant accept your story it would be fatal i didnt believe him at first you cant leave tubby out there in the russian zone ill do nothing to betray the belief of the authorities in this russian report was his reply the full horror of what he was saying dawned on me slowly you mean the words choked in my throat i mean ill do nothing he said all right if he was as coldblooded as that do you remember how you blackmailed me into stealing that plane i asked he nodded slowly that cold smile back on his lips well im going to blackmail you now i said either you fly me into hollmind tonight to pick up tubby or i tell the io here everything how i pinched the plane how i nearly killed tubby how you altered the numbers and we strewed the wreckage of our old tudor through the hollmind woods and how you set fire to the hangar at membury so that there would be no trace you think hed believe you there was almost a sneer in his voice get him out saeton i whispered urgently if you dont ill bust the whole game wide open understand his eyes narrowed slightly that was the only sign he gave that he took my threat seriously dont think i havent taken care of the possibility of your reaching berlin he said quietly he glanced round at diana and the io and then in a louder voice no wonder you get scared when it comes to jumping youre about the most imaginative flier i ever met he turned and nodded to the io im sorry he said i cant get any sense out of him he drew the officer to one side im afraid hes pretty bad concussion or something he keeps on talking about pinching a plane and having a fight with carter i think hes all mixed up in his mind with that escape he did from germany in they began whispering together and i heard the io mention the word psychiatrist diana was staring at me dully all hope gone from her eyes her body slumped at the shoulders in an attitude of dejection saeton and the io came back towards me and i heard saeton saying if we knew what happened when the plane crashed you know damn well it didnt crash i jerked out sudden overwhelming hatred of him swept me to my feet i know what it is you want tubby dead you know damn well the credit for those engines is his you want him dead they stared at me like humans looking through bars at a caged animal ill get him away the io whispered quickly to saeton and saeton nodded i turned to diana then she was the person i had to convince she knew saeton knew the setup above all she was the only one of them that wanted to believe that tubby was alive diana you must listen to me i implored her youve got to believe me tubby isnt dead i saw him yesterday afternoon my head was swimming and i pressed my hands to my temples no it wasnt yesterday it was the day before he was badly injured but he could talk i promised id come back for him if you love him diana youve got to help me youve got to make the people here believe a hand grasped my shoulder and spun me round shut up saetons face was thrust close to mine shut up do you hear tubbys dead youre just saying this to cover yourself cant you realise how diana feels until you turned up there was a good chance he was alive everybody thought the body the russians found in the plane must be yours you were the skipper but you turn up so its tubby who is dead and now you try to raise false hopes in an effort to i flung his hand off you devil i said youre the cause of all this its all your fault hes out there in the russian zone i turned to diana the plane didnt crash at all i cried i flew it back to membury saeton forced me to do it tubby tried to prevent me there was a struggle and i could see they didnt believe me get him out of here i heard saeton say get him out before he drives mrs carter crazy hands closed on my arms and i was dragged across the room to the door i screwed my head round and saw saeton standing alone his face grey and tired looking and diana was staring across at him her lips trembling behind them the air crews stood in silence looking on then the door closed in my face and i was out in the grey dawn of gatow airfield with the roar of planes and the deliberate operational movements of lorries and german labour teams i had a brief glimpse of the faso apron gleaming dully in its leaden mantle of slush close by a german labour team was hauling sacks of coal from the belly of a dak and beyond it another dak was swinging off the perimeter track and an raf corporal was signalling it into position a lorry rolled past us to meet it a sergeant of the raf police had the ambulance doors open and i was bundled in the intelligence officer climbed in beside me the sergeant saluted stiffly and the doors closed boxing us into a dark little world that shook with the roar of planes a slight vibration of the stretcher bunk on which i had been sat told me the engine was running and then we moved off slithering on the wet surface as we swung round the fuel standing at piccadilly circus where are we going i asked the io sick bay he answered i rang up squadron leader gentry from the malcolm club hes the mo hes expecting you i was conscious of that sense of helplessness that comes to the individual when he is in process of being absorbed into the machine of an organised unit once i was in the mos clutches anything could happen theyd regard any request as prejudicial to the patients recovery they might even drug me i want to see the station commander i said the intelligence officer didnt answer i repeated my request take my advice fraser he said coldly see the mo first i hesitated somehow his voice seemed to carry a note of warning but i wasnt thinking about myself i was thinking about tubby ive got to see the station commander i said well you cant im taking you to the mo put your request to him if you want to in the halflight i could see his eyes watching me im saying that for your own good for my own good his eyes had turned away as though breaking off the conversation all i could see was the pale outline of his face under the peaked cap im not worrying about myself i said its carter im worried about i should have thought that was a waste of time now the tone of his voice stung me civil airlift pilots come under raf for administration and discipline dont they i asked the line of his head nodded slowly very well then take me to the station commanders office thats a formal request his eyes were back on my face again now have it your own way he said but if youre fit enough to see the station commander youre fit enough to see squadron leader pierce raf police he turned and tapped on the partition separating us from the driver a small hatch slid back terminal building first he ordered the driver what did you mean about raf police i asked pierce is very anxious to see you some question of an identity check identity check what do you mean for a moment the thought of tubby was thrust out of my mind identity check had saeton talked about me was that what he meant when he had said he had taken care of the possibility of my reaching berlin was this his attempt to discredit me whose instructions is he acting on i asked i know nothing about it the io answered in that same cold deliberate voice before i could question him further the ambulance had stopped and we were getting out the terminal building was a lifeless hulk of concrete in the cloudskimmed dawn the tall windows of the control tower looked with dead eyes upon the runway where a single tudor was lining up for takeoff there was no outward sign that this was the hub and heart of the worlds busiest air traffic centre beyond it the wings of a dak widened against the dull cloudscape over berlin as it dropped towards the runway like a toy pulled by an unseen string as we went through the swing doors the tudor took off with a roar that split the dawncold stillness the io took me up to the first floor little placards stood out from the doors of woodpartitioned offices flight lieutenant symes intelligence officer white on blue next to public relations the io pushed open the door wait here will you fraser ill go down and see if the station commander has come in yet he usually shows up about this time likes to have a look around before breakfast he turned to the medical orderly you wait here with mr fraser corporal he glanced at me quickly but his eyes slid away from mine and i went into his office wondering whether he thought i was going to try and escape the corporal shut the door as i stood there listening to the ios footsteps fading down the wide corridor the office was a big one with two windows looking out across the standing and the hangars to the faso apron still barely visible in the reluctant daylight of that bleak january morning the arc lamps had been switched off but runway and perimeter lights still burned a complicated network of yellow and purple the dak was landing now and another tudor was moving up the perimeter tracks towards the control tower i could almost hear the pilot calling his number over the r t requesting permission from traffic control to taxi and i wondered whether it was saeton beyond the hangars lorries moved in a steady stream from the offloading platform moving slowly and positively towards berlin with their loads of ruhr coal fraser i turned the door behind me had opened and the io was standing there holding it open for a short burly man in a wing commanders uniform this is the station commander the io said closing the door and switching on the light sit down fraser the station commander nodded to a chair glad you got back all right but im sorry about carter his voice was quiet impersonal he placed his cap on the top of a steel filing cabinet and seated himself at the desk in the naked lights i saw that the beaverboard walls of the office were covered with maps and charts a kaleidoscope of colour russian tanks russian planes survey maps of berlin germany with the air corridors marked in white tape a huge map of the british zone dotted with flags bearing squadron numbers and a smaller map of eastern germany covered with chinograph on which had been scribbled in different colours the numbers of russian units the whole room was a litter of secret and semisecret information most of it relating one way and another to the russians understand you wanted to see me the slight rise of inflection in the station commanders voice at the end of the sentence was i knew my cue but i hesitated reluctant to commit myself to a line of approach well i gripped hold of the wooden arms of the chair the walls of the room were beginning to move again it seemed very hot in there and the lights were blinding i want a plane sir tonight carters alive and ive got to get him out we can land at hollmind hes at a farm about three miles from the airfield the words came out in a rush tumbling incoherently over each other not a bit as i had intended it would only take a couple of hours the airfields quite deserted and the runway is sound how do you know i stared at him it sounded like a trap the way he barked the question at me his face kept blurring so that i couldnt see his expression how do i know i moved my fingers back and forth along the dirtcaked lines of my forehead i just know i heard myself mumble i just know thats all i straightened my body up will you let me have a plane sir tonight the door behind me opened and a squadron leader came over to the desk a thin file in his hand heres the report you wanted sir the mans eyes glanced curiously in my direction ive rung for the mo and pierce is in my office now shall i let him come up the station commander glanced quickly across at me and then nodded all right any further news about that threat of ackack practice in the exit corridor no more than we know already sir air safety centre have lodged protests but as far as were concerned at the moment the russians will be firing to feet in the exit corridor i dont think were going to give way i should damn well hope not theyre just bluffing they know what it means if they start shooting our boys down he gave a long sigh all right freddie but let me know as soon as you get any news the door closed and the station commander stared for a moment out through the windows to where another freighter was thundering down the runway he watched it rise watched it until it disappeared into the low cloud a small speck carrying an air crew of four headed for base through the exit corridor his eyes switched slowly to me where were we oh yes you claim carter is alive he picked up the file his adjutant had brought in opened it and handed me a slip of paper read that fraser its the russian report on your aircraft i took it and held it in my hands the print blurring into solid straight lines i let my hand drop not bothering to go through it i know about this i said its completely phoney it didnt dive into the ground and they didnt find the charred remains of a body they dont know anything about the plane theyre just guessing the wreckage is strewn for miles around how do you mean the station commanders voice was sharp and practical i pressed my fingers to my temples how was i going to make them understand what had really happened it was quite clear to me ordinary and straightforward but as soon as i tried to put it into words i knew it would sound fantastic i think wed better do it by questions sir the ios voice seemed oddly remote yet it rattled in my ears like the sharp dry sound of a porcupines quills hes just about dead beat all right symes go ahead i wanted to tell the station commander to let me tell it in my own way but before i could say anything the ios sharp insistent voice was saying you claim carter is alive that hes lying injured at a farmhouse near hollmind hollmind is thirty miles from the point where westrop and field jumped thats almost ten minutes flying time what happened in those ten minutes didnt carter jump with the others no he stayed in the plane with you yes he knew i didnt like jumping i was determined now that they should have every detail of the thing if i told them everything kept nothing back they must believe me we had to jump once before at membury when the undercarriage of saetons tudor jammed thats how he knew i was scared he came back to see me out then i got the engines going and started to fly to membury he got angry then and you mean gatow dont you no membury i stared at him trying to force him to understand that i meant membury i was taking the tudor back to membury thats why i took the job with harcourt it was all planned i was to steal a plane from the airlift and my voice trailed away as i saw the look of bewilderment on the station commanders face if only theyd let me tell it my own way i dont understand this sequence of events at all fraser his voice was kindly but there was an underlying impatience go back to where you and carter are alone in the plane westrop and field had jumped who went out next please i implored let me tell it my own way when i reached membury just answer my questions will you fraser the voice was authoritative commanding it reminded me of saetons voice who jumped next all my muscles seemed rigid with the violence of my need to tell it to them as a straight story but i couldnt fight him i hadnt the energy it was so much easier just to answer the questions carter i said in a dull voice but i thought you said he came back to see you out i pushed him out i see you pushed him out i could tell by the tone in which he repeated the phrase that he didnt believe me and then what happened i flew the plane back to membury it was moonlight all the way i found the airfield quite easily and when i landed please fraser i want to get at what happened in that plane now try to help me what happened after carter went out we know the plane dived into the ground i want to know how it didnt dive into the ground i said i told you what happened i flew it back to membury he got up and came over to me now pull yourself together please his hand pressed gently on my shoulder we naturally want to know what happened theres no question of the accuracy of the russian report theyve even sent us a piece of the tailplane the plane is yours all right it has your flight number on it and its unquestionably a tudor now what caused it to crash it didnt crash i said wearily i tell you i flew it then if it didnt crash how the devil are the russians able to send us a sample of the wreckage that clearly shows it to be your plane i tell you we put it there i replied desperately we loaded it into the plane and flew it there saeton stooged around whilst i pushed the bits out then he landed me at hollmind that was when he flew out to wunstorf to join the airlift i searched all that night and all the next day for some trace of carter then i found his helmet it was just after the snow had started it was lying on the snow and i just cant follow what youre saying the station commander interrupted will you please stick to what happened in the plane but before i could answer the door of the room opened come in pierce you too gentry the station commander crossed over to the taller of the two men drawing him aside and speaking to him in a low voice i could see the two of them glancing covertly in my direction symes was beating an impatient tattoo on the edge of the desk with his long fingers his dark eyes fixed curiously on my face i felt as though an invisible curtain was being lowered separating me from contact withthem and i pulled myself to my feet you dont understand said angrily i joined harcourts outfit in order to get hold of one of his planes wed crashed ours it had to be replaced we had to get hold of another plane in order to test the engines saeton was due on the airlift on the th we had to have another plane the only place we could get one was in germany off the airlift it had to be a tudor that was why my voice trailed away as i saw them all staring at me as though i were crazy the man who was talking to the station commander said quietly its obvious hes had a nasty shock hes suffering from some sort of mental disturbance hes all mixed up with that escape he did ill get him down to the sick bay the station commander stared at me and then nodded all right but i wish to god i could find out what happened to that plane of yours nothing happened to it i cried angrily there was nothing wrong with it at all i flew it back to membury all the russians have found yes yes the station commander cut in impatiently weve heard all about that all right gentry take him down to the sick bay only for gods sake get some reasonable statement out of him as soon as possible the mo nodded and started towards me it was then that the other man stepped forward mind if i have a word with him first sir the station commander shrugged his shoulders just as you like pierce i suppose you think in his present muddled state hes more likely to tell you the truth he gave a quick laugh i hope you make better progress than we have he crossed to the door and paused with his hand on the handle id like a word with you symes after breakfast the io rose to his feet very good sir the door closed behind the station commander and as i slid wearily back into my seat the policeman came and leaned on the edge of the desk his hard slightly pitted features seeming to hang over me a dark blur against the lights my names pierce he said raf policy youre fraser i nodded hopelessly all chance of a plane had vanished with the departure of the station commander and i felt drained and utterly exhausted if only theyd let me tell my story the way id wanted to but i knew that even then they wouldnt have believed me put into words it immediately became fantastic christian names neil leyden again i nodded it was stupid of him asking me my name when everybody in the room knew damn well who i was ive been instructed to ask you a few questions his voice was quiet almost gentle very different from his features do you remember the night of november th last year i thought back what an age it seemed that was the night id arrived at membury yes i said i began working with saeton that night at membury yes how did you get there by car yes by car theres no train service to membury a car was found that night at the foot of baydon hill that was your car wasnt it i stared at him struggling to understand the drift of his questions my hand reached up almost automatically to the crust of blood where my forehead was cut i had a crash i said he nodded youve another name havent you callahan i started involuntarily so that was it this was what saeton had meant i stared up at him meeting his steady gaze knowing theyd got me and thinking that i might just as well have refused when saeton had forced me to take that job with harcourt but it didnt matter now so much had happened nothing seemed to matter any more it was as though in some queer way i was now paying the price for what id done to tubby yes i said in a whisper im callahan and then in the silence that gripped the room i asked what happens now he shrugged his shoulders its nothing to do with me old man ill send back a report to england in due course i imagine youll be flown back and theyll decide what theyre going to do about you theres no warrant for your arrest or anything like that at the moment he coughed awkwardly sorry to have to put the questions so soon after your escape from the russian zone now i think youd better go along with squadron leader gentry here its time you had that cut cleaned up and you look as though you could do with a bit of rest i shant be worrying you again not for some time anyway so you can just relax i thought how reasonable and logical his questions had been if i could get him to do the questioning about what had happened to tubby theyd believe me then i pulled myself to my feet again he was already at the door just a minute i gasped feeling the room reel ive got to tell you something he had stopped in the doorway and was looking at me with a slight frown you got this from saeton didnt you it was saeton who told the authorities who i was you know why he did that it was because he was afraid id talk i didnt want to pinch the plane but he made me do it he said if i didnt hed i closed my eyes trying to shut out the blurred movement of the room the engines of a plane thundered on the perimeter track just outside the building the windows rattled the sound merging with the din in my ears the sound was like the roar of a great fall it went on and on dont you see i gasped he blackmailed me my knees trembled and gave somebody called out something and i felt myself slipping hands caught hold of me as i fell supporting me whilst my legs seemed to trickle away like usedup water from the base of my body everything was remote and indistinct as i slipped into unconsciousness i suppose they gave me something for i dont remember anything more till i woke up in bed with a nurse standing over me feeling better her voice was gentle and soothing yes thanks i closed my eyes searching in my mind for what had happened gradually piecing it together open your mouth please i want to take your temperature i obeyed her automatically and she pushed a thermometer under my tongue you were a bit feverish when they brought you in and youve been talking a lot delirious what was i saying keep your mouth closed now all about your flight and a friend of yours in the russian zone squadron leader pierce was here for a time theyre flying you out tomorrow that is if the mo says youre fit enough flying me out tomorrow i thrust at the bed forcing myself up into a sitting position if they flew me out tomorrow nothing could ever be done about tubby now dont get excited otherwise we shant allow you to go her hands touched my shoulders pushing me gently back against the pillows my eyes went past her searching the room at least i was on my own a single window rattled to the sound of planes behind black curtains whats the time i mumbled the question my tongue still closed over the thermometer dont talk please its nearly seven and if youre good you can have some supper she reached down and took the thermometer out of my mouth peering at it through her thicklensed glasses thats fine were back to normal now she shook it down with a neat practised flick of the wrist ill get you some food are you hungry i realised then what the faint feeling in the pit of my stomach was i couldnt remember when id last had a meal very i said she smiled in her efficient impersonal way just a minute nurse i said as she was going out im still at gatow arent i she nodded will you get a message to someone for me its for mrs carter she works in the malcolm club i want her to come and see me right away its urgent tell her mrs carter is she the wife of your friend she nodded ill see she gets the message she went out closing the door and i lay there staring at the light which hurt my eyes listening to the planes coming in and taking off and going over and over in my mind what i would say to diana when she came there must be no mistake this time i had to convince her she was my one hope if they flew me out in the morning id be able to do nothing more for tubby and then i began to think about saeton i was angry then and i wished to god i had never met the man the nurse wasnt away long and when she returned she had a tray full of dishes i brought you extra big helpings of everything she said they told me you probably hadnt had a proper meal for some time what about mrs carter i asked is she coming i havent been able to get your message to her yet you must i said desperately please sister its urgent all right dont you fuss now ill see she gets your message now you eat that i thanked her for the food and she left me for a time i could think of nothing but the joy of eating again i ate until i was full and then i lay back replete and the thought of tubby was nagging at my mind again perhaps if i put it all down on paper the thought excited me that was the answer if they read it as a straightforward report i would address it to squadron leader pierce he had a logical reasonable mind they couldnt ignore it if it was sent to them in the form of a factual report i lay there planning how id write it until the nurse returned you must have been hungry she said as she saw the empty plates you look better too the mo will be round later i dont think you need be afraid hell stop you from going out on the p in the morning what about mrs carter did you get my message to her i asked yes i went all the way down to the malcolm club myself im sorry mr fraser but she wont see you didnt you tell her it was urgent the sense of being boxed in with an invisible wall of disbelief was back with me again yes i told her that i even told her it might affect your recovery what did she say she said there was no point in her seeing you i lay back and closed my eyes feeling suddenly exhausted what was the good of going on fighting then i remembered the report i was going to write can i have a pencil and some paper please she smiled you want to write to your girlfriend yes yes thats it i nodded can i have them quickly please its urgent i must write now she laughed i remember it was a pleasant laugh everything is always urgent with you isnt it id like a pen if possible i added it would be better if it was written in ink somehow it seemed to make it more formal more definite than if i scribbled it in pencil where are my clothes theres a pen in my flying suit theyre in the cupboard just outside ill get it for you i havent any notepaper im afraid will typing paper do yes anything only hurry please ive got a lot to write and i want to get it finished before the mo comes round but the mo didnt come round propped up in bed i set it all down right from the time of my arrival at membury i had no reason to hide anything now and my pen fairly flew over the paper and when i was in the middle of it the door opened and saeton walked in he was dressed in his flying kit feeling better he asked as he crossed the room i thought you were flying tests i said so i am but they cant spare tankers off the fuel run the boffins are flying routine flights with me it was odd how matteroffact our conversation was and saeton kept it that way he came over and sat down on my bed writing a report yes he nodded i guessed youd do that it wont help you you know neil unless tubby gets back to corroborate your statement he glanced at his watch ive only got about five minutes so ill say what ive got to say right away he hesitated as though marshalling his thoughts youve put a lot of money and work into the company i wouldnt want you to think im not grateful and i wouldnt want you to lose by it i think he meant that youve seen pierce yes i said and youve guessed that it was i who put them on to you i nodded well you didnt give me much alternative did you i was convinced tubby was dead and you made it quite clear that if you didnt find him youd give yourself up to the police i couldnt risk that i had to discredit you in advance he took a packet of cigarettes out of his pocket and tossed me one his eyes were watching my face as he lit it for me im very near to success now neil im so near success that the authorities would be most unwilling to believe any report that you made the rauch motoren have got the americans behind them if your report were accepted it would mean a trial and the whole thing would become public in those circumstances the americans would bring pressure to bear on our people and the engines might have to be handed back to the rauch motoren at best the design would become generally available for any company in any country you see what im driving at you want me to keep my mouth shut exactly i want you to admit that the russian report is correct i started to say something but he held up his hand i know its tough on you youll go to jail for this callahan business but as an airlift pilot i dont imagine youll get more than a year perhaps less after all youve got a fine record as for the fact that you came out of the crash alive you could say it was tubby not you who was scared of jumping arent you forgetting one thing i said whats that that tubby is alive i hadnt forgotten that he leaned closer to me his eyes still on my face i can cope with your evidence or tubbys evidence but riot the two of you together what do you mean if you do as i want you to it doesnt matter to me if tubby does get out alive a fantastic story told by a man who has been badly injured wouldnt carry much weight now as regards compensation for yourself im prepared to offer you ј and of course your posi tion as a director of the firm would stand and dont think i wont have the money to pay you ill have all the money i want in a few days time and youll leave tubby to rot in that farmhouse he shrugged his shoulders i cant do anything about getting him out if thats what you mean if you admit the russian report to be true then i must accept it that hes dead and if i send in this report i asked he glanced at his watch and then got to his feet time i was going he paused looking down at me if you send in that report nothing will come of it that i can assure you without tubbys corroborative evidence it will be disregarded and ill see to it that there is no corroborative evidence i stared at him his tone was so easy and natural it was difficult to believe that there was any sort of a threat behind his words what do you mean by that i asked him think it out for yourself neil but remember this i havent come all this way with those engines to be beaten now and either way tubby doesnt get brought back for hospital treatment he nodded either way tubby remains where he is by god youre a callous bastard i said i thought he was the only man you were ever fond of that touched him on the raw and his face darkened with sudden passion do you think i like the thought of him out there in the russian zone but i cant help it this thing is a lot bigger than the comfort of one man i think i told you once that if one man stood between me and getting those engines into the air id brush him aside well that still holds good as far as im concerned tubby is dead he glanced at his watch again well think it over neil his tone was once more even and friendly either way you wont help tubby so you might just as well tear up that report he hesitated and then he said gently weve come a long way together in a short time neil id like to know that we were going on together youve done all you could to help when the going was tough dont shut yourself out from the thing just as its starting to go well id like us to continue the partnership he nodded cheerily and opened the door a moment later it had closed on his thick burly figure and i was alone again i lay there for a moment going over in my mind that incredible conversation appalled at saetons complete lack of any moral sense this was the third time in our short acquaintance that he had forced a desperate choice on me but this time it never entered my head to agree to his terms i didnt even consider them i was chinking only of tubby somehow i had got to get him out i dont know quite when i reached the decision to get out of the sick bay it just seemed to come as a logical answer to my problem so long as i remained there i should be taken out on the p flight in the morning and then there would be no chance of doing anything for tubby on the other hand if i were clear of gatow free of the whole organisation then there might still be a chance as soon as i had reached that decision i set to work again on the report by tenfifteen it was done after that i lay back shielding my eyes from the light waiting shortly before eleven the nurse came in lights not out yet she patted the pillows into place youre looking tired now my what a lot you have written to your girlfriend it isnt to my girlfriend i said rather sharply wheres the mo hes not coming to see you tonight but dont worry hell be here first thing in the morning the morning was no good this must be read tonight by somebody in authority do you know squadron leader pierce i asked of course will you do something for me will you get this to him tonight i folded the numbered sheets across and handed them to her will you see that he gets it personally and i suppose its urgent she smiled indulgently as she took the sheets from me all right ill see he gets it if you promise to be a good boy and go to sleep ill sleep if i know that will reach pierce tonight will you promise that sister when hes read it hell understand the urgency she nodded seriously humouring me with an imitation of my own mood now you go to sleep goodnight the room was suddenly in darkness as she switched out the light i had to suppress an urge to leap out of bed and go with her to the mess but it wouldnt help shed only think i was mad and shed call the mo and between them theyd drug me into a coma until i was on that damned plane and out of berlin the door closed with a decisive click and i lay there suddenly aware that i was alone again and all that stood between tubby and complete disbelief of his need for help were a few flimsy sheets of paper in the hands of a nurse who thought i was slightly nuts i waited for about half an hour and then i slipped out of bed and groped my way to the door a blast of cold air swept past me as i opened it a bluepainted bulb showed me the top of some stairs and a corridor the concrete flooring was bitterly cold against the soles of my feet i found the cupboard my clothes were still there and i bundled them over my arm and slipped back into the room it took me some time to dress in the dark fumbling awkwardly with the laces of my cold wet shoes tugging at the zip of my flying suit finally i struggled into the heavy german greatcoat and jammed the forage cap over the bandages that circled my head thinking back on it now i suppose i was still a little dazed with the exhaustion of the last few days for i had no plan and as far as i can remember my mind made no effort to grapple with the problem of what i intended to do i just knew i had to get out of the clutches of the gatow authorities before they flew me out and like an automaton who can only manage one idea at a time i worked towards that end without a thought to the future as soon as i was dressed i felt my way to the door and opened it the single bluepainted light bulb threw a weird light on to the empty corridor and the deserted stairhead there was no sound except the intermittent murmur of the planes i closed the door and went boldly down the stairs there were two flights each with its blue light and then i was in the entrance hall the light was bright here and a mans figure lounged by the open doorway where a car was drawn up i hesitated but there was no point in skulking in the shadows i crossed the hall and went quickly out through the door to the accompaniment of a murmured gute nachf from the german driver who stood there i replied gute nacht my heart hammering against my ribs but he made no move to stop me and in a moment the night had swallowed me with its blackness and its murmuring of the wind in the firs i kept to the road walking quickly the sound of the planes on the airfield over my left shoulder and in a few minutes i came out on to the road which ran from the entrance gates down past the mess to the terminal building i recognised it at once in the lights of a volkswagen saloon that went careering past me i waited until its lights had completely disappeared and then i crossed the road and slipped into the sheltering anonymity of the fir woods i had no difficulty getting out of gatow unobserved i simply pressed on through the woods keeping the sound of the airfield at my back i had occasional glimpses of the lights of buildings and the swift rush of cars headlights the rest was utter blackness with the branches clutching at my bandaged head and roots tripping at my feet i met no one and in a comparatively short time i was brought up by a wire boundary fence after that i was in the open with the lights of a lorry showing me the kladowerdamm and the way to berlin there was some advantage in wearing hanss discarded greatcoat and cap for i was able to stop the first lorry that came along the truck was a bedford one of a continuous line that moved through the night from the faso apron to berlin i suppose the driver took me for one of the german labour teams slogging my way home i climbed in and lay back on piledup bags of flour that tickled my nostrils with their fine dust as we clattered over the potholed road we went into berlin by way of the an der heer strasse with its glimpse of havel lake where the sunderlands had landed through the summer there were lights along the an der heer strasse for the power like that of gatow itself came from the russian zone but darkness closed in with the trees of the grunewald and the broad straight line of the kaiserdamm was like a dark cleft in the waste of ruins dimly seen from the swaying back of the lorry at length the truck slowed and the driver shouted to me wo wollen sie hin anywhere in the centre of berlin will do i answered in german i drop you at the gedachtniskirche the gedachtniskirche i knew the kaiser wilhelm memorial church one of the most conspicuous buildings in berlin it had been pointed out to me more than once during operational briefings danke schon i said a few minutes later the lorry stopped again leaning out i saw a gigantic ruined tower rearing above us into the darkness a train hooted eerily and clattered by wheels rattling hollow on the rails of a viaduct i climbed over the tailboard and dropped to the ground danke schon i called to the driver cute nacht gute nacht his voice was almost drowned in the roar of the engine as the heavilyladen lorry rolled on with its load of flour i watched it disappear round the bend of the platz and then i was alone in the darkness with the monstrous hulk of the gedachtniskirche above me its colossal tower so battered by bombs that it looked as though it must topple into the street i turned and walked slowly up the kurfurstendamm this had been the piccadilly of berlin now it was a broken ruined thoroughfare the shops groundfloor affairs of wood and plaster board whose flimsy construction seemed constantly threatened by the rubble of the upper stories there was no lighting in the kurfurstendamm all allied berlin was under drastic powercut now that fuel had to be flown in but it was possible to see as though the thousands who huddled behind the broken facades of the buildings emanated a sort of radiance it was past midnight now but despite the cold there were still prostitutes on the sidewalks wandering up and down past the deserted street cafes there were cars too blackmarketeers cars and taxis with american negroes trading currency prowlers moved in the shadows pimps and currency dealers men who brushed by with a muttered funf ost fur eine west bundles of rags lay huddled in doorways or dragged slowly along with a clop of wooden shoes as they searched the dustbins in the rich heart of berlin i drifted up the kurfurstendamm only half conscious of the dim shadowy life around me my mind suddenly facetoface with the problem of what i was going to do now until that moment my only thought had been to escape from the organised world that centred around the airlift at gatow and so avoid beingflown out on the p passenger service in the morning but now in the heart of occupied berlin dressed half as a british civilian flier and half as a german labourer with no german money and no one i knew i felt suddenly lost and slightly foolish but i wasnt cold any more and i had food inside me my head was painful but my mind was clear as i grappled with the problem a dim figure slid past me with its muttered ich tausche ost gegen west i stopped him do you exchange english pounds i asked him in german englische pfunde ja you want deutschmark or bafs west deutschmark i answered what is the rate of exchange i give you thirtytwo deutschmark for one pound sterling gold teeth glittered with a drool of saliva as the lights of a car slid past the man had a widebrimmed black hat and his face was swarthy with greasy sideboards the long semitic nose was thrust inquisitively into my face a greek or perhaps a pole certainly not a german i changed ten pounds with this shadow of the berlin underworld and with the deutschmark forming a wad in the pocket of my flying suit i felt that the first hurdle was past but what next i stood on a corner by one of those circular poster hoardings that look like overgrown pillar boxes and wondered how i could get tubby out of the russian zone if i could get tubby out then thered be no doubt about my story but in all berlin i had no friend to help me chapter nine to have no friends no sense of security in a city occupied by ones own people is not pleasant there was no one i could turn to i thought of dianas brother harry culyer maybe he was still in berlin but would he believe me when my own people didnt and to contact any of the allied headquarters and clubs would only be putting me back into the situation from which i had just been at such pains to escape i dont know what made me think of it maybe it was the prostitute who murmured in english hallo darling from the shadowy gloom of the sidewalk the softwarmth of her voice came like the nuzzling of a friendly bitch and when i didnt turn away the dim shadow of her slunk to my side you are american she asked the power of the dollar was strong on the kurfurstendamm no english i answered i saw her eyes soft and hungry in the darkness looking me over and noting my clothes probably she thought i was a deserter deserters would be bound to make for the kurfurstendamm but she asked no questions all she said was you come with me honey i have a room only two blocks away and it is comfortable i didnt answer because her german accent had started a train of thought in my mind please come her voice was suddenly desperate i have been here all evening and i am hungry you take me to a cafe i know somewhere is cheap very cheap her hand reached out and slid along my arm please honey i sing for you too perhaps i was in opera once i only do this when my baby and i are hungry and nobody will pay to hear me sing my name is helga you like me i give you love and music you forget everything come on honey she dragged at my arm please honey where is the fassenenstrasse i asked it is just near here you wish to go i take you if you wish the voice was harder now desperately urgent please it is cold standing here please honey all right i said take me there okay we moved off together up the wide cleft of the kurfurstendamm her hand clutching my arm she was tall and her hip was level with mine pressing against it she hummed a little aria something from verdi where is this place you wish to go honey she said stopping at a corner here is the fassenenstrasse it runs right across the kurfurstendamm which part do you wish i want number i said its near the savoy hotel ach so das savoy it is this way she took me down a tramlined street and underneath the iron girders of a railway bridge and then we passed the hotel savoy and were at number she stared at the blank face of the closed door why you bring me here she asked this is not a club we cannot eat here why you bring me eh i have a friend here i said and tugged at the oldfashioned bellpull then i pulled out my deutschmark and gave her twenty she stared at them go and get something to eat i said and thank you for showing me the way her eyes looked up into my face unbelievingly you do not want me she evidently saw that i didnt for she made no protest instead she reached up and kissed me danke schon she turned away quickly and as the sound of her high heels faded away into the darkness i wondered whether perhaps she really was an opera singer with a baby and no job there was the rattle of a chain from the other side of the heavy door and then it opened just a crack and a womans voice old and hoarse and rather frightened asked me what i wanted i am a friend of fraulein langen i answered in german i wish to see her please i do not know any fraulein langen the door was closing and i put my foot against it fraulein meyer then and i added quickly i have come all the way from england to see her aus england there was a moments pause you are english the old woman spoke the words slowly as though she had learned the language at school yes i said i am an english flier neil fraser tell her the door opened to the full extent of the securing chain beady eyes stared at me through the crack you do not look to be very english she said suspiciously where in england do you meet fraulein meyer at membury i answered i have had an accident thats why im dressed like this membury so it is very late but come in kommen sie herein the door opened she closed it hastily behind me and in the darkness i heard the rattle of bolts and chain we must be very careful the russians you know it is terrible they come and take people away an electric torch gleamed faintly poor fraulein meyer so pretty so clever and all this trouble over herpapers i followed the old womans shapeless figure up the stairs the sound of our footsteps on the bare boards was very loud in the stillness of the house i do not like to think what the russians do to her if the english send her to the east sector police the russians are brutes schweinehunde they rape everyone a door opened as the torch finally gave out a match spurted and rose in a steady flame as a candle was lit was ist los anna it was else though i couldnt see her i recognised her voice ein mann aus england herr fraser er sagt er kennt sie von membury her herr fraser elses tone was suspicious the flame of the candle was lifted to my face through it i saw that she was peering at me with wide frightened eyes her dressinggown clutched tightly round her neil it is you she began to laugh then i think it was relief at finding it really was me you look so funny why are you in berlin and why do you dress yourself up in the uniform of the wehrmacht its a long story i said she smiled another long story that is what you say before remember may i come in i want to talk to you yes of course i have only a bedroom now but she glanced uncertainly at the old woman so many peoples in berlin have no homes she murmured then she glanced up at my face again and saw the bandages you have hurt yourself again also i had an accident i said come in then she said and pushed open the door of her room anna have we any of that coffee left ja but for two cups only the old woman answered it is so difficult now in berlin this blockade it is worse than she shrugged her shoulders let us have the coffee anna when it is finish it is finish schon the old woman tapped her torch on the banisters and it flickered into doubtful life as she hobbled off down the stairs else led me into her room and shut the door it was a big room furnished as part bedroom and part sitting room with a couch under the window a dressingtable covered with photographs and a big double bed in the corner it had the fierce penetrating cold of a room that has had no heat in it for a long time is your head all right she asked can i do anything for it no its all right i said they fixed it for me at gatow gatow when do you arrive at gatow this morning so it is you i see standing outside the malcolm club i stared at her remembering the girl checker with her face covered in coal dust are you working with the german labour organisation i asked ja she laughed it is what you peoples call a very small world eh but why i asked she shrugged her shoulders i must work also i wish to be at gatow to see if mr saeton get on to the airlift it is most important that i find this thing out well he is ive seen him today she nodded he make the first flight two days ago and he has my fathers engines i know them by the sound tell me something please how does he manage to fly again so quickly his own plane is crashed it was finished this cannot be the same airplane it isnt i said but how does he get another he have no money you tell me so yourself did you get it for him yes i said she stared at me angrily and i added do you know what the word blackmail means she nodded well he blackmailed me into getting him another plane i stole it off the airlift for him you stole it i do not understand i told her briefly what had happened then and when i had finished she stood there staring down at the flame of the candle he is mad that one she breathed she turned to look at me and the corners of her mouth turned up momentarily in a smile i think perhaps you are a little mad also perhaps i was i said youve no idea how glad i was to find that tubby was alive she nodded slowly the trouble is saeton wont do anything to get him out he cant think of anything but the engines she swung round on me he is crazy he is crazy i tell you it is as though as though when he steal my fathers work he start somethings and now he cannot stop her words were an echo of my own thoughts my mind was on tubby and i was wondering what saeton would do when he discovered i had made a written report he would brazen it out say that i was suffering from delusions as a result of the crash but all the time he would be thinking of tubby out there in that farmhouse the one man who by his mere existence threatened the whole future of what he was striving for and as i thought about this saeton loomed in my mind as a sort of monster a man who as else said had started something that he could not stop i must get tubby out i said is that why you come to see me i nodded dimly aware that she wanted some other explanation of my visit but i was too tired to pretend everything i had done since waking up in gatow sick bay had been done because of tubby i was responsible for what had happened i had to get him out youve got to help me i said why should i her voice was harder now his wife work at the malcolm club let her help him but she thinks hes dead i told you that if his wife think he is dead why should not i i stepped forward and caught her by the shoulders youve got to help me else why she was staring up at me her eyes wide almost calculating why i dropped my hands to my side and turned away why should this german girl i had met two or three times help me i dont know why i said there was a knock at the door and the old woman came in with the coffee on a tray and a small oil lamp hier ist ihr kaffe fraulein else do you keep some for yourself anna else asked the old woman moved her head from side to side awkwardly just a little just for one cup her beady eyes fastened on me soil ich aufbleiben um den herrn hinauszulassen else spoke quickly to her in german and the old woman laughed so she stared at me as though i were some strange animal i do not meet one like that and still laughing to herself she sidled out and closed the door what was all that about i asked else looked across at me she is worried for me that is all i tell her you are quite safe but she turned away to hide her smile her smile made me angry why didnt you tell her what happened when you took me to listen to the frogs i demanded if i tell her that she said over her shoulder as she poured out the coffee then she will want to see you go and you must sleep you look tired i also am tired i have to be up at six to catch the lorry to gatow i brushed my hand across my face i was tired can you really put me up for the night of course if you do not mind the couch there it is hard but it is all right i have to sleep there myself several times now drink this please while it is hot but i stared at her you mean sleep here in this room she looked up at me quickly have you some place in berlin you can go then no i said no ive no place i can go now very well then it is settled you sleep on the couch and i go back to my bed she went over to the bed and ripped off two of the blankets there we share the bedclothes all right she put them on the couch i am sorry i am not able to give you a room for yourself once we have the whole floor seven rooms with bathroom kitchen everything but part of the house is destroyed and there are many families homeless so now all i have is this one room she shrugged her shoulders it is all right but i do not like to share my kitchen with other peoples please you will excuse me but i am cold she slipped into the bed and reached for her coffee cup do you have a cigarette i felt in my pocket the nurse had given me a packet yes here we are she took one and i lit it for her her eyes watched me over the flame and then she blew out a long streamer of smoke oh it is so good to have a cigarette i do not have one since i leave england dont you get any at gatow i asked no they do not give us any i do not think there are very many for your own people is the work hard no just checking the manifest of the cargo so that nothing is missing but it is a long time i am there and it is very cold on the airfield i had sat down on the edge of the bed to drink my coffee perhaps it was the closeness maybe it was just the strangeness of the circumstances the two of us sharing that one room at any rate that was the end of our small talk there seemed nothing really to say and i sat there staring at her and absorbing the warmth of the coffee tired though i was i found the blood hammering in my veins i suddenly found i wanted her i wanted her more than id wanted anything in my life before for the moment it seemed as though her competence and selfsufficiency were swept aside she was just a rather pathetic very attractive girl sitting up in a double bed and i wished to god she was sitting there waiting for me but somehow i could do nothing about it i didnt want to do anything to break the mood of that moment if i had touched her i think she would have responded but if that had happened then something would have gone that i desperately wanted instead of touching her i said else youve got to help me she frowned and pulled her dressinggown closer round her to find your friend carter she asked with a queer lift of the eyebrows that gave her a puzzled look i nodded ive got to get him out of the russian zone it means so much to you the softness disappeared from her face what happens if we do not get your friend out he may die i said and if he die what happens then therell be no evidence to support my report of what happened and saeton will go on flying my fathers engines yes hell get away with the whole thing she nodded as though that were the answer she had expected all right i will do what i can i started to thank her but she cut me short i do not do this thing for you neil i do it because i wish to destroy saeton her hands were fastened tightly on the bedclothes the cigarette burning unheeded in the saucer as she stared past me to the lamp he has taken everything that is left of my father the work we do together i hate him i hate him i tell you she spat the words out through clenched teeth in the intensity of her feeling he has no soul he is a monster that night you come to membury i offer him i offer him myself i know he want me i do not love him but i think i will barter my body for the recognition i want of my fathers work do you know what he do he laugh in my face she relaxed slowly and picked up her cigarette then you come into the hangar after that i telephone to reinbaum to go ahead and smash his company she gave a bitter little laugh but you save it for him then he crash and i think that is the end of him but you save him again she gave me a wry little smile and now you wish me to help you that is very funny she sat for a moment quite still then with a quick movement of her fingers she stubbed out the cigarette okay neil i do what i can now we must get some sleep if i find somebody to take us into the russian zone it will be at night because it will be for the black market perhaps tomorrow night you think you can find somebody i asked she nodded ja i think so i have many friends among the drivers at gatow i will find someone who goes near hollmind there are many trucks going from the western sectors into the russian zone the russians do not mind because they get things they want that way i shall find someone i cant thank you enough i began but she stopped me you do not have to thank me i do not do this for you goodnight she snuggled down into the bedclothes i had got to my feet and for a moment i stood there hesitating staring down at her it seemed to me there were two elses the girl who excited me and was sweet and gentle and the german who was revengeful and who would stop at nothing to do what she thought was right for her country and her father goodnight i turned heavily away and blew the lamp out in the heavy curtained darkness of the room i undressed to my underclothes and curled myself up on the couch under the blankets it was bitterly cold in that room it ate right into my bones but then i thought of tubby alone out there in that german farmhouse desperately hurt and the cold didnt seem so bad i prayed that else would find some means of getting me there so that i could bring him back so that i could prove that what i had said was true neither the cold nor the constant racket of the airlift overhead kept me awake for long i slept and in a moment it seemed the lamp was lit again and the old woman was in the room talking to else i turned over and opened my eyes else was already up brushing her hair the old woman was standing by the door a spluttering candle in her hand i hope you are not too cold herr fraser she said in german it may have been my fancy but i thought her gnarled features had an expression of contempt as she said something very rapidly to else what did she say i asked as the bundle of old clothes disappeared through the door else was giggling to herself nothing she said she made some crack i said you really wish to know she was smiling she say you are not much like our boys that if you are typical english then she do not understand how you win the war did you sleep well i slept all right i said curtly wondering why the hell i hadnt shared elses bed since that was apparently what had been expected of me you were not cold it didnt stop me sleeping now you are sulking you do not want to pay any attention to anna she is oldfashioned that is all now please will you turn the other way i have to wash i turned over and faced the heavy curtains that covered the window what time is it i asked a quarter past five good god i lay there feeling the cold numbing my body thinking how tough else must be the room was icy and i could hear her splashing about with the water is that hot water i asked thinking i would feel a lot better if i could have a shave of course not we cannot heat water our fuel is for cooking only if you stay here long you will get used to it stay here long the problem of the future suddenly faced me i was a fugitive in berlin i could not go back to my own people not until tubby was out of the russian zone you must find some transport going to hollmind tonight i said urgently if i dont get him out soon he may without thinking i had turned towards her and then the future and tubby were driven out of my mind by the sight of else leaning over the basin washing herself she was naked to the waist and her firm breasts looked big and warm in the soft lamplight she turned her head conscious of my stillness and for a moment her hands were still holding the flannel as she met my gaze water ran from her neck down her breasts and poured from her nipples into the basin i thought i told you to turn the other way she laughed it was an unselfconscious laugh do not stare at me as though you were hungry have you never seen a girl washing herself before she dipped the flannel into the water and began washing the soap from her face it might have been the most natural thing in the world for her to have a man in her room watching her as she washed has this happened before i asked thickly what her words were halfobscured by the flannel i didnt mean that i said quickly and turned to face the curtains again the sight of her still a vivid picture on the retina of my brain she came and stood over me i didnt hear her come across the room for her feet were bare i just sensed her standing there looking down at me her fingers touched my hair sometimes i think you are very young neil you do not know much about life or perhaps it is because we live among the ruins and when you do that you have not many conventions left life is very primitive in berlin like when we are in a yacht or up in the mountains she turned away with a little sigh you would have liked it here in germany before the war she was dressed by the time the old woman brought breakfast up it is not much else said as she handed me a plate of dark bread with a small piece of butter but you will become accustomed to that if you stay here long i hardly recognised her as the same person she wore no makeup and she was padded out underneath a dirty raincoat so that she had no shape only her hair looked the same golden silk fa the soft glow of the lamp at ten to six she pulled on an old brown beret now i must go to catch the truck in the kurfurstendamm i think it is best if you do not go out you have no papers and your shoes do not go with your wehrmacht coat our police are very suspicious i held the door open for her huddled against the cold in my borrowed greatcoat do not worry i will find some way to get your friend out i touched her hand it was very cold thank you i said youve been very kind and understanding i am not being kind she said almost sharply i am doing this for myself i would like to say differently but she stared at me her eyes very wide and troubledlooking but it is the truth her hand tightened on mine one thing i wish you to know however i am glad it is something you want also i am glad we both want this she said it quite fiercely as though she were angry with herself for what had gone before then she reached up and kissed me pressing her lips to mine as though this alliance were something she had wanted badly do not worry i fix something for tonight i asked i hope so she smiled and slipped out through the door do not go out please her footsteps sounded quick and light on the stairs disappearing into the dark vault of the house i heard the front door open and close then there was silence and i shut the door and went back into the lamplit room that was so full of the girl who had just left me for some time i wandered round it conscious of the alien heaviness of the furniture of the photographs and particularly of her things that lay strewn about clothes books sewing an empty silver cigarette box hair brushes washing things old papers the tumbled bedclothes her nightdress and the slippers shed worn all the litter of things that were else when she herself was not there it was the photographs that i returned to they were mostly of a big man with a short pointed beard and a high domed forehead curving back to a mane of white hair it was her father and the quiet serious features with the slight droop at the corners of the mouth the rather blunt nose and the lines of thought that furrowed the broad forehead reminded me of else when she was puzzled by something there was the suggestion of a twinkle in the lines at the corners of the eyes but the face had none of elses fierceness and passion that she had got from her mother professor meyer was a deeper more thoughtful person than his daughter this was particularly noticeable in the photographs of the two of them together these were holiday snaps taken whilst climbing or on skis but though the photographs showed her faults more clearly i was glad of the opportunity to study her father it explained so much of her that had puzzled me and i could understand more clearly her passionate loyalty to the work that she and this old man who was now dead had done together very conscious of elses presence in that room i returned to the couch and for a long time lay huddled under the blankets thinking about her and the peculiar relationship that was developing between the two of us i tried to analyse my feelings but i couldnt and in the end i went to sleep i didnt get up until past midday the sky was overcast the battered buildings opposite black in the bitter cold overhead the airlift planes droned steadily but i could not see them the old woman brought me some food bread and some soup that was chiefly potatoes she didnt attempt to talk to me there was a barrier between us that was something more than a question of race i found the answer in an old photograph album tucked away in a bookshelf a picture of a little girl and an attractive middleaged nurse underneath was written in an awkward childish hand ich und anna by five oclock the light was fading and i could no longer decipher the unaccustomed german print of the book i was reading i began to pace the room wondering whether else would have found transport to take me into the russian zone my mood was a queer mixture of impatience and fear it was bitterly cold just after six i heard the sound of footsteps on the stairs i checked in my pacing and listened this wasnt the clumsy sound of wooden clogs on bare boards it was a mans tread and he wore shoes he didnt belong to the building the footsteps stopped on the landing outside and the old womans clogs shuffled to the bedroom door i do not know why she is not back already she said in german but you can wait for her in her room will she be long the man asked his german was too lazy too soft in a panic i looked round for some place to conceal myself but i was still standing in the middle of the room when the door opened she always return at five i do not know what has happened there was a knock at the door and the old woman opened it without waiting for permission the gentleman here speaks your language perhaps you can talk to him while you are waiting for fraulein meyer i had backed away towards the window the old woman stood aside and elses visitor came in i saw his brown boots and the olive khaki of his trousers an american and then i looked at his face good god i exclaimed it was harry culyer dianas brother how did you know where i was he stopped staring at me what makes you think i did fraser didnt diana send you i asked diana no of course not why are you here then i might ask you the same question his gaze travelled quickly over the room missing nothing and finally coming to rest on the wehrmacht greatcoat i was wearing so this is where youre hiding up they told me at gatow youd disappeared from the sick bay youve been to the airport today he nodded ive just come from there did you see diana yes why she knows the truth now doesnt she there was a puzzled frown on his face and i added quickly she knows tubby is alive now she knows that doesnt she my hands were sweating and i was almost trembling as i put the question alive you know as well as i do hes dead he was leaning slightly forward and his grey eyes were no longer friendly so its true what they told me about you what did they tell you oh just that you were a sick man thats all he had thrown his hat on to the couch and he lowered his long body down beside it when will the meyer girl be back i guess i must just have missed her at the airport i dont know i said did you see pierce or the yes i saw them both he eyed me watchfully as though i was a strange dog that he was not quite sure of i sent pierce a report a written report did he mention it no he said nothing about a report did he mention me at all he lifted his eyes to my face suppose you stop asking questions fraser his tone was abrupt almost angry but i must know i said i must know what he said about me all right if you want to know he said you were ill he was watching me closely as he said this like a doctor examining a patient for reaction i slumped down on to the farther end of the couch so he doesnt believe it even when he sees it in writing i felt suddenly very weary it would be so much easier just to say no more give myself up and go back to england to stand trial i must get tubby out i murmured i must get him out i was speaking to bolster my determination but of course he stared at me as though i was mad youre waiting to see else are you i asked and when he gave an abrupt nod i added well since youve nothing to do whilst you wait you may as well hear what happened that night in the corridor id like to know whether you believe me why dont you rest he suggested impatiently you look just about all in can i have a cigarette ive finished all mine he tossed me a packet you can keep those thanks i lit one just because youve been told im ill it doesnt mean i cant remember what happened the chief thing for you to know is this tubby is alive and but for that bastard saeton hed be here in berlin now its a pity your sister cant recognise the truth when she hears it i had his interest then and i went straight on to tell him the whole thing i was just finishing when footsteps sounded on the stairs outside elses footsteps she looked damnably tired as she pushed open the door ive done it neil we she stopped as she saw culyer im so sorry mr culyer have you been waiting long it hasnt been long culyer answered rising to his feet ive been talking to fraser here or rather hes been talking to me else glanced quickly from one to the other of us you know each other we met the other day out at gatow culyer answered i tried to catch you at the airport miss meyer but i guess youd just gone he glanced awkwardly at me can we go somewhere and talk he asked hen else spread her hands in a quick gesture of despair i am afraid this is the only room i have you will not mind neil if we talk about our own business for a moment will you she turned to culyer have the british agreed shall i be permitted to go to frankfurt culyer glanced hesitantly at me then he said yes everythings fixed miss meyer as soon as your papers come through well fly you down to frankfurt and then you can join professor hinkmann of the rauch motoren and get to work right away of course he added you must realise saeton is a jump or two ahead of us his engines are flying right now of course else said what about patents that is still undecided culyer answered were pressing hard for refusal of patent on the grounds that its largely your fathers work mind you saetons developed them to the flying stage but i think our case may be strong enough for the whole thing to be left to sort itself out in open competition anyway what i wanted to tell you was that the british have agreed for you to come to frankfurt i thought youd want to know that right away thank you yes she hesitated and then asked no questions about the papers i had in england no questions theyll forget about that else turned and pulled off her beret she stood for a moment staring at the large photograph of her father that stood above the huge oak tallboy he would have been glad about this she suddenly swung round to culyer again it was saeton who informed the british security officials about my papers wasnt it culyer shrugged his shoulders i dont think we need concern ourselves with that miss meyer no perhaps it is not important she turned to me saeton has requested the permission of the station commander to fly a plane to hollmind to hollmind i stared at her hardly able to believe my ears when tonight are you certain i asked urgently how do you know she smiled i have friends at gatow a young officer of the rasc tell me saeton is flying there tonight just to make certain for a second i was filled with relief saeton had realised he had been inhuman he was going to get tubby out and then elses choice of words thrust themselves into my mind just to make certain in an instant the monster i had built of saeton was there again in my mind just to make certain i heard myself say aloud my god it cant be that it cant be whats that you say culyer asked uneasily but i was looking at else wondering whether she knew what was in my mind it must be tonight i said what must be tonight culyer asked nothing else said quickly please mr culyer i am very tired and i have some things to do he looked uncertainly from one to the other of us and then picked up his hat okay miss meyer ill be getting along then as soon as the formalities are through ill contact you thank you she held the door open for him he hesitated on the threshold and his gaze swung back to me he was obviously puzzled else touched his arm you will not say anything about mr eraser please he shrugged his shoulders i guess its none of my business anyway but it was his business he was dianas brother will you be seeing your sister again i asked him he nodded im going out to gatow right now will you give her a message will you tell her tubby will be all right that its true what i said in that report every word of it he glanced across at else do you know about this else nodded and do you believe him do you believe carter is still alive the way he says he is of course else said culyer shook his head slowly i dont know what to think but ill give her your message fraser maybe if saetons flying out there he shrugged his shoulders goodnight miss meyer i hope well have this thing all tied up very shortly now this project has great possibilities and my headquarters he was still talking as else lighted him to the stairs but i wasnt listening i was thinking of tubby out there in that farmhouse saeton was flying to hollmind that was the thing that was still in my mind i turned to the window i had to get out there right away i had to get there somehow the door of the room closed and i swung round else was standing there staring at me are you all right neil she asked yes of course im all right i answered irritably when you came in tonight you started to say something oh yes i have found a truck that is going into the russian zone it is all fixed when for i asked it must be tonight i must get there tonight she nodded yes it is tonight thank god i crossed the room and caught hold of her arms how did you manage it i asked oh i find out about it from one of the drivers at gatow we have to be at the corner of fassenenstrasse and the kantstrasse at tenthirty not before i thought of the short time it would take to fly what time is saeton leaving do you know she shook her head that is something i cannot find out but he will not dare to go till it is very late if he have to leave the plane on hollmind airfield that was true how long will it take in this truck of yours she shrugged her shoulders we do not go the direct way there are things to be delivered you understand two or three hours perhaps two or three hours i turned away couldnt the driver be persuaded to go there first i do not think so she replied but i will talk to him perhaps if you have money you know ive no money i cut in a few marks then we will see i stopped in my pacing and turned to her we i asked you dont mean youre coming into the russian zone but of course i started to dissuade her but she was quite determined if i do not come the driver of the truck will not take you it is a big risk for him if we are stopped by the red army then there has to be some story that they can understand it is better if you have a german girl with you she turned to the bed now please i must rest you also i do not think you are too well not too well that phrase kept recurring to me as i lay sleepless on the couch else was asleep the instant she had climbed into her bed but i had been resting all day there was no sleep left in me and all the time i lay there feeling the cold even through my clothes and listening to the sound of the airlift planes overhead i kept on turning her words over in my mind was she herself uncertain of my story was that why she was coming to see whether it was the truth or only the hallucinations of a sick man i remembered how culyer had reacted i must have fallen asleep in the end for i woke in a sweat of fear that tubby was dead and that the authorities at gatow had been right in believing the russian report and then i saw that else was dressing and everything seemed suddenly normal and reasonable we were going out of berlin in a black market truck and in a few hours we should be coming back with tubby i was glad then that she was coming if tubby were dead or if he didnt survive the journey back then she would be witness to the fact that he had been at the farmhouse at hollmind that he had been alive we had some food and by tenthirty we were at the corner of the fassenenstrasse and the kantstrasse the truck was late and it was very cold by eleven oclock i was becoming desperate convinced that something had gone wrong with her arrangements and that it would not come else however seemed quite resigned to waiting it will come she kept saying you see it will come threequarters of an hour late it ground to a stop beside us one of those ugly longnosed german vehicles driven by a youth who was introduced to me as kurt and whose jaw bore the purple markings of a bad burn an older man was with him in the cab we bundled into the back climbing over packing cases piled to the roof to a cramped and awkward space that had been left for us the gear cogs fought for a hold on each other oil fumes seeped up from the floor the packing cases jolted around us as we crawled out of berlin we were nearly three hours in the back of that truck we were cold and we both suffered from waves of nausea owing to the fumes periodically the truck stopped packing cases were offloaded and their place was taken by carcases of meat or sacks of flour i cursed these delays and at each stop it seemed more and more urgent that i should reach the farmhouse before saeton at last all the packing cases had been offloaded we made one more stop for poultry there must have been hundreds of dead birds and then at last through a rent in the canvas cover i saw that we had turned south shortly afterwards the truck stopped and i was told to get out and sit with the driver to direct him we were then on the outskirts of hollmind it was difficult to get my bearings after being cooped up in the body of the truck so long however i knew i had to get to the north of hollmind and after taking several wrong turnings i at last found myself on a stretch of road that i remembered by then the driver was getting impatient and he drove down it so fast that i nearly missed the track up to the farm and we had to back the track was narrow and rutted and when he saw it the driver refused to take the truck up it else got down and did her best to persuade him but he resolutely shook his head if i go there he told her i may get stuck also i do not know these people at the farm the red army may be billeted there anything is possible no i wait for you here on the road but hurry i do not like to remain parked at the side of the road too long it is very conspicuous so else and i went up the track alone the ice crackling under our feet the mud of the ruts black and hard like iron how far she asked about half a mile i said my teeth were chattering and there was an icy feeling down my spine the lane branched and i hesitated trying to remember which track i had come down that night that seemed so long ago you have been here before havent you neil else asked and there was a note of uncertainty in her voice of course i said and started up the lefthand fork but it only led to a barn and we had to turn back and take the other fork we must hurry else whispered urgently kurt is a nervous boy i do not wish for him to drive away and leave us nor do i i said thinking of the nightmare journey i had had into berlin we were right this time and soon the shape of the farm buildings was looming up ahead of us against the stars its all right i said as the silhouette of the outbuildings resolved itself into familiar lines this is the place so the farm does exist your friend is alive of course i said i told you i am sorry neil her hand touched my arm you mean you werent sure you were hurt and you look so ill i do not know what to think all i know is that it is urgent for you to come and that i must come with you i could see the faint shape of her head her eyes looked very big in the darkness i took hold of her hand come on i said i hope to god i stopped then for we had turned the corner of a barn and i saw there was a lamp on in the kitchen of the farmhouse it was nearly two yet the kleffmanns hadnt gone to bed the shadow of a man crossed the drawn curtains i hurried across the yard and tapped on the window it was kleffmann himself who answered my tap he came to the back door and peered nervously out into the night herr kleffmann i called softly its me fraser can we come in ja kommen sie herein hurry please as he stood back to let us through the door he turned his face towards the lamplight that came through from the kitchen he looked startled almost scared is he all right i asked your friend yes he is all right a little better i think i breathed a sigh of relief weve got a truck waiting down on the road i said this is fraulein meyer he shook hands with else come in come in both of you he shut the door quickly and led us through into the kitchen mutter here is herr fraser back again frau kleffmann greeted me with a soft eager smile but her eyes strayed nervously to the stairs that led up from the kitchen i do not understand she murmured uneasily in german then she turned to her husband and said why do they both come i started to explain elses presence and then i stopped that wasnt what she had meant lying across the back of a chair was a heavy fleecelined flying jacket else had seen it too i turned to the kleffmanns they were standing quite still staring towards the dark line of the stairs from above us out of the silence of the house came the sound of footsteps they were coming down the stairs else gripped my arm what is it she whispered i couldnt answer her my gaze was riveted to the stairs and all the muscles of my body seemed frozen in dread of the thing that was in my mind the footsteps were heavy now on the bare boards of the landing then they were coming down the last flight i saw the boots first and then the flying suit and followed the line of the zip to his face saeton the name came from my lips in a whisper god ill never forget the sight of his face it was grey like putty and his eyes burned in their sockets he stopped at the sight of us and stood staring at me eyes and face were devoid of expression he was like a man walking in his sleep hows tubby my voice was hoarse and grating hes all right he answered coming on down into the kitchen why did you have to come here his voice was flat and lifeless and it carried with it a terrible note of sadness i came to get him out i said he shook his head slowly its no use now what do you mean i cried you said he was all right what have you done to him nothing nothing that wasnt necessary i started towards the stairs then but he stopped me dont go up he said and then slowly he added hes dead dead the shock of the word drove me to action i thrust past him but he caught me by the arm as i started up the stairs its no good neil hes dead i tell you but that is impossible frau kleffmann had retreated towards her chair by the fire only this morning the doctor is here and he say he will be well again now you say he is dead saeton pushed his hand across his eyes it it must have been a stroke heart or something he muttered uncertainly but only this evening he is laughing and joking with me frau kleffmann insisted is not that so frederick she asked her husband just before you come i take him his food and he is laughing and saying i make him so fat he live up to his name where is he else whispered to me up at the top of the house an attic ill go up and see whats happened i started up the stairs again but saeton blocked my way hes dead i tell you dead going and looking at him wont help i stared at him the blackness of the eyes the smallness of the pupils the man seemed curled up inside himself and through the windows of those eyes i looked in on fear and the bitter driven urge of something that had stepped out of the worlds bounds in sudden panic i flung him aside and leaped up the stairs there was a small lamp on the landing and i picked it up as i turned to climb to the attic the door of tubbys room was ajar and as i went in the lamplight picked out the photographs of hans lining the walls my eyes swung to the bed in the corner and then i stopped from the tumbled bedclothes tubby stared at me with fixed and bloodshot eyes his face had a bluish tinge even in the softness of the lamplight there was a froth of blood on his puffed lips and his tongue had swollen so that it had forced itself between his teeth he had struggled a great deal before he had died for in the wreck of the bed his body lay in a twisted and unnatural attitude avoiding the fixed gaze of his eyes i crossed the room and touched the hand that had reached clear of the bed and was hanging to the floor the flesh was still warm else came into the room then and stopped so it is true she looked across at me with a shudder how does it happen perhaps it was a stroke perhaps my voice trailed away as i saw her eyes fasten on something that lay beside the bed look she shivered slightly pointing to the pillow i bent and picked it up it was damp and torn and bloody at the centre where tubby had fought for air the truth of how he had died was there in my hands he did it she whispered he killed him i nodded slowly i think i had known it all along tubbys wasnt the face of a man who had died a natural death poor devil alive he had threatened the future of saetons engines because of that saeton had come all the way from berlin to kill him to smother him as he lay helpless on the bed the force that had been driving saeton all along had taken him to the final and irrevocable step he had killed the man without whom the engines could never have been made the one man whom hed thought of as a friend if one man stood between me and success id brush him aside i could remember how he had stood in the centre of the mess room at membury and said that and now he had done it he had brushed tubby aside i dropped the pillow back on to the floor with a feeling of revulsion i think he is mad elses horrified whisper voiced my own thoughts and at that moment i heard slow heavy footsteps on the stairs saeton was coming back up to the attic i wasnt prepared to face him yet i reached for the door closing it my action unreasoned automatic i slid the bolt home and stood there listening to the footsteps getting nearer come away from the door else whispered urgently i stepped back and as i looked at her i saw she was scared the footsteps stopped outside the door and the handle turned then the thin deal boards bulged to the pressure of the man whose breathing i could hear the room was very still as we waited i think else thought he would break the door down i didnt know what i expected all i knew was that i didnt want to talk to him the silence in the room was heavy with suspense then his footsteps sounded on the stairs again as he went slowly down i opened the door and listened there was the murmur of voices and then the side door closed with a bang from the window i saw saeton looking big and squat in his flying jacket cross the farmyard and go out through the gate by the barn i felt relieved that he had left it wasnt only that i didnt want to talk to him i was scared of him perhaps elses fear was infectious but i think it would have come anyway the abnormal in its most violent form is a thing all sane men are afraid of the initiative lies with the insane its that which is frightening i turned back to the door ill get kleffmann i said we must get his body down to the truck and take it back to berlin tubbys sightless eyes watched me in a fixed stare i turned quickly and went down the stairs conscious of elses footsteps hurrying after me the kitchen looked just the same as when we had entered it frau kleffmann sat huddled in her thick dressinggown by the fire her husband paced nervously up and down there was nothing in the warmth and friendliness of that room to indicate what had happened upstairs in the attic only the tenseness frau kleffmann looked up quickly as i entered is it true she asked is he dead yes i said hes dead it is unbelievable she murmured and he was such a nice friendly man why did that other man herr saeton leave so quickly kleffmann demanded i could see that he was suspicious but there seemed no point in telling him what had happened he was worried about his plane i said will you help me get carters body down we are taking it back to berlin ja he nodded ja i think that is best would you please find something for us to carry him on i asked frau kleffmann she nodded rising slowly to her feet a little dazed by what had happened you stay here else i said and followed kleffmann up the stairs to the attic again we covered tubby with a blanket and got his body down the steep narrow stairs back in the kitchen else and frau kleffmann had fixed a blanket over two broom handles the improvised stretcher lay on the table and we put tubbys body on it frau kleffmann began weeping gently at the sight of his shrouded figure i think she was remembering her son out there in a soviet labour camp else stood quite still staring down at the shape huddled under the blanket will you help us to carry him down to the truck i asked kleffmann ja it is better that you take him away from here his voice trembled slightly and the sweat shone on his forehead he had known as soon as hed seen tubby that the poor devil hadnt died naturally and he wanted to get the body out of his house to be shot of the whole business he hadnt said anything but he knew who had done it and he was scared we picked the stretcher up he at one end i at the other come on else i said she didnt move and as i lifted the latch of the door she said wait her voice was pitched high on a hysterical note do you think saeton will let you go back to berlin with with that she came across the room seizing hold of my arm and shaking it in the extremity of her fear he cannot let either of us go back i stood still staring at her the truth of what she was saying gradually sinking in he is waiting for us out there she jerked her arm towards the window i could see in her eyes that she was still remembering the sight of tubbys face as he lay propped up in that bed i lifted the stretcher back to the table and went towards the window my hand was on the curtains to pull them back when else seized my arm keep away from the window please neil i could feel the trembling of her body i turned irresolutely back into the room was he really waiting for us out there the palms of my hands were damp with sweat saeton had never turned back from anything he had started he wouldnt turn back now else and i were as fatal to him as a hangmans rope a desperate feeling of weariness took hold of me so that my limbs felt heavy and my movements were slow what do we do then nobody answered my question they were all staring at me waiting for me to make the first move have you got a gun here i asked kleffmann he nodded slowly ja i have a shotgun that will do i said can i have it please he went out of the room and returned a moment later with the gun it looked about the equivalent of an english bore he gave it to me together with a handful of cartridges ill go out by a window on the other side of the house i said when ive gone keep the doors bolted i turned to else ill circle the house and then go down to the road and persuade kurt to bring the truck up here she nodded her lips compressed into a tight line if i find its all clear ill whistle a bit of the meistersingers dont open up until you hear that i turned to kleffmann have you got another gun he nodded i have one i use for the rooks good keep it by you i broke the gun i held in my hands and slipped a cartridge into each of the barrels i felt like a man going out to finish off an animal that has run amok as i snapped the breech else caught hold of my hand be careful neil please i i do not know what i shall do if i lose you now i stared at her surprised at the intensity of feeling in her voice ill be all right i said and then i turned to kleffmann and asked him to show me to the other side of the house chapter ten dropped out near some bushes and slid into their shadow overhead the stars still shone bright and cold but to the west the sky was black with cloud the wind seemed warmer now i pulled my coat round me and slid along the wall of the house ran past the gate to the farmyard and crouched in the shadow of the barn i stood there quite still the barrel of the gun cold on the palm of my left hand listening to the sounds of the night one by one i identified them the wind tapping the branch of a tree against the wooden side of the barn a cow moving in its stall the grunt of a pig the tinkle of ice knocked from some guttering by the flutter of an owl and over all these sounds the solid thumping of my heart i tried to tell myself that i was a fool to be standing out there scared of every shadow that seemed to move waiting with a gun in my hand but every time i nearly convinced myself that i was being a fool the memory of tubbys face came to remind me that saeton was now a killer for a long time i stood quite still with my back against the wood of the barn hoping that somewhere in the darkness round me i should hear a sound see a movement that would prove he was really there i longed to know to end the suspense of waiting but nothing stirred it was out of the question for me to stand there doing nothing till dawn kurt was waiting down on the road and he would not wait much longer the thing to do was to go down there and get the truck up if he left without us the memory of that other journey into berlin spurred me to action moving warily i slid along the wall of the barn past a piledup heap of manure through a litter of decaying farm machinery a twig snapped under my feet i stepped in a rut where the water was all frozen and the ice crunched under my weight they were only little noises but they sounded loud and once away to the left i thought i heard an answering movement but when i stopped there was nothing but the sounds i had already identified i circled the farm without seeing any sign of saeton then i started down the track to the road i kept well clear of the ruts moving slowly along the grass verge brambles tearing at my trousers and then suddenly out of the darkness ahead the beam of a torch stabbed the night as the dazzle of it touched my eyes i flung myself sideways but i wasnt quick enough there was a spurt of flame and the bullet thudded into my body knocking me off my feet and sending me sprawling into the brambles that bor dered the track boots crunched in the frozen ruts as the beam of the torch probed my shelter i lifted the shotgun and fired at the torch the kick of the gun wrenched me with pain but the torch went out and above the sound of the shot i heard a cry i fought my way through the thicket the thorns tearing at my face and hands all the right side of my body racked with pain behind the screen of brambles i crouched down and very gently ejected the spent shell and reloaded my right hand had no strength in it the fingers were stiff and clumsy and the cartridges sticky with blood the click of the catch as i closed the breech seemed unnaturally loud in the stillness that had descended on the lane my eyes had been momentarily dazzled by the torch but as they became accustomed to the darkness again i saw the line of the brambles bordering the track and on either side of me and behind me the slope of the ground was visible against the stars i was in a slight hollow if he tried to circle me i should see him against the stars the danger lay to my immediate front the strange thing was that now i knew he was there and was at grips with him i was no longer afraid away to my left on the main road the engine of a truck broke the silence headlights cut a swathe through the night and began to move frightened by the shots kurt was pulling out leaving us to find our own way back to berlin i cursed under my breath as i listened to the sound of the engine dying away soon all that remained was a faint glow in the darkness to the south then that too was gone the wind rustled in the brambles a night bird cried its call there was no other sound then something moved in the bushes to my left it moved again nearer this time i raised the gun to my shoulder there was the sound of earth being dislodged and the rattle of dry bramble branches almost at my side i fired at the sound from behind me echoing the sound of my own shot the revolver smacked a bullet into the ground at my feet i swung round realising how hed fooled me by throwing earth into the undergrowth i saw his figure crouched against the stars and let off my second barrel at it there was a grunt and a curse as something thudded to the ground desperately i broke my gun and fumbled in my pocket for the cartridges when the gun was loaded i started forward i knew i had to finish it off now if i didnt i should lose my nerve i sensed that in the trembling of my hands i had to finish it one way or the other crouched low i could see his body close to the ground as he waited for me whatever happened now i was close enough for the shotgun to be effective i steeled myself to the jolt of a bullet hitting id let him have both barrels wherever he got me id still have time to fire but i didnt have to even when i was so close i could have blown the top of his head off he did not move he was crouched in an unnatural position his head bent almost to the ground his fingers dug deeply into the hard earth beside him his torch glimmered faintly in the starlight the chromium was all wet and sticky as i picked it up and when i flicked it on i saw the metal was badly dented and filmed with blood i turned him over on to his back and as i did so his service revolver slipped from between his fingers his left arm was all bloody the hand horribly pitted by the shot there was a livid bruise above his left temple and the skin had split but apart from this he didnt seem badly hurt and his breathing was quite natural i think what had happened was that the main weight of my shot had struck the torch and flung it against the side of his head there was no doubt that hed been knocked clean out i picked up the revolver and slipped it into my pocket i turned then and went back into the lane through a gap in the bramble hedge it was fortunate that the torch hadnt been put out of action because i was feeling dizzy and very faint as i staggered up the track and without its light im not at all sure i should have been able to find my way back to the farm i was pretty well all in by the time i reached the side door i remember slumping against it beating on it with my hands but they had no strength and all i achieved was a faint scrabbling as i slid to the ground probably else was listening for me at any rate i never sang a bar of the meistersingers but when i came round i was in a chair by the kitchen fire and else was cutting the bloodsoaked clothes away from the wound in my shoulder as she saw my eyes open her hand reached up and she pushed her fingers through my hair you are always in the wars neil she smiled softly i think you need someone to look after you wheres kleffmann i asked her hier his big figure bent over me what is it i gave him the revolver and told him to go down the lane and get saeton if hes still there i dont think hell give you much trouble i said what happened else asked as i told her frau kleffmann came in with a bowl of hot water else began to bathe the wound and the warmth of the water took some of the numbness out of it i think the bullet is still there else said after peering at the torn flesh with the aid of a torch well patch me up the best you can i said ive got to fly to fly yes the truck is gone kurt cleared off as soon as he heard our shots our only way out now is saetons plane but the airfield is more than a mile from here else pointed out i do not think you will be able to walk so far perhaps not well borrow a horse and cart from the kleffmanns ive no doubt theyll be only too glad to speed the parting guests i tried to smile at my little joke but i didnt seem able to make the effort i felt sick and tired as soon as else had finished dressing my wound i got her and frau kleffmann to harness one of the farm horses they had got tubbys body on to the cart and i was sitting in it by the time kleffmann returned with saeton it was lucky that the farmer was a big man for saeton was still unconscious he carried him slung over his shoulders in a firemans lift and when he reached the cart he dumped the body into the muck of the farmyard like a sack of potatoes ready he asked me yes im ready i said i was anxious to be off the plane was my only hope of getting back to berlin i knew the kleffmanns wouldnt shelter us after what had happened and every minute the plane stood out there in the airfield it ran the risk of being spotted by a red army patrol else helped kleffmann load saetons body on to the cart then he climbed up and clicked his tongue at the horse frau kleffmann opened the gate for us she spoke quickly and urgently to her husband he nodded and the cart jolted over the frozen ruts into the lane i called goodbye to her but she did not answer she just stood there a frozen expression on her face glad to see us go kleffmann had returned the revolver to me and i kept my left hand on the butt as it lay in the pocket of my coat my eyes were on saetons unconscious body as we jolted towards the woods rain clouds were spreading across the night sky and when we entered the woods it was as dark as pitch nobody spoke and the only sound was the creaking of the cart and an occasional snort from the horse i kept my foot against saetons body the cart jolted in the ruts and each jolt was like a knife stabbing at the blade of my shoulder else had seated herself so that i could lean against her and she seemed conscious of my pain for when it was very bad she would slip her hand over my left arm we must have been about halfway through the woods when saeton stirred he lay groaning for a moment and then he sat up i could see his face a pale oval in the darkness my hand tightened automatically on the gun in my pocket dont move i told him ive got a gun if you move ill shoot there was a long silence then he said thats you is it neil yes i told him he was sitting up now and he gave a little cry of pain as he shifted his position what happened i didnt say anything he could think it out for himself the silence became heavy as the memory of tubbys death came to all of us wheres tubby he asked at length did you bury him no his body is beside you in the cart he said my god why couldnt you leave him there and then silence descended on us again i tried not to think of what tubby looked like there under the blanket the pain helped it wrenched at my mind and made it difficult to think i clung to the gun if he made any move id use it maybe he sensed that for he stayed quite still all the way through the woods at last we were out of the trees and dragging slowly across the flat expanse of the airfield it was very dark isolated drops of rain began to fall where did you leave the plane i asked saeton he didnt answer maybe he thought if he said nothing we might fail to find it i peered anxiously into the darkness ahead the cart jolted endlessly in the black void maybe the horse could see when we couldnt at any rate the plane was suddenly there right in front of us a shadowy insubstantial shape kleffmann reined in the horse and turned to me i think it is better if one of us goes and has a look round there i will go else said she eased herself gently away from me and dropped to the ground in a moment the darkness had swallowed her i waited my nerves tense for the challenge of a russian sentry but no sound broke the stillness only the soft whisper of the rain falling then else was back it is okay she whispered and we started forward again else was at the horses head and she backed the cart against the door of the fuselage it was queer to think that that plane was the bridge between us and berlin standing there it was just an inert piece of metal and yet with a pilots direction it would set us down at gatow it seemed to me symbolic of the whole airlift symbolic of the ingenuity of man to do the impossible to jump in a few minutes from alien to friendly ground but it required the direction of a pilot and my body cringed at the thought that it was i who had got to bridge that gap in a night of black darkness without a navigator and with a bullet wound in my shoulder at least it was a dakota i dont think i could have handled a fourengined job else helped kleffmann to get tubbys body into the fuselage saeton and i were alone in the cart i saw him shift his position keep still i ordered him what are you going to do he asked fly your plane back to gatow what a bout me youre coming too there was a pause and then he said youre wounded arent you yes i said but dont worry ill make it and if you dont if i dont youll be able to take over and fly where you like it wasnt subtlety on my part that made me say that but looking back on it i think that was why he didnt make a break for it there on hollmind airfield maybe he was too weak he had been out for a hell of a long time but if hed jumped from the cart right then hed have had a chance else and kleffmann appeared at the fuselage door again get in i told saeton i had the gun in my hand now and dont try anything i said im quite willing to fire he got up without a word his movements were slow but that was the only indication he gave that he had been hurt i followed him feeling sick and a little giddy as i moved my cramped limbs kleffmann dropped into the cart and picked up the reins clicking his tongue to the horse i called my thanks to him from the door of the fuselage but he didnt answer where horse and cart had been there was nothing but the blackness of the airfield and only the faint creaking of the cart told me that a moment before it had stood there beside the plane herr kleffmann is glad to go i think else said in a strained voice i couldnt blame him but i wished i could have done something to compensate him for what had hap pened he and his wife had been very good to tubby all right get the door closed i said i switched the lights on and for the first time i saw saetons face it was streaked with mud and blood and the skin was quite white his left arm hung limp at his side and blood trickled from his shotpitted hand sit down i said he began to move towards the long line of seats that flanked the fuselage then he stopped and faced me again neil cant we come to an arrangement no i said you know damn well we cant because of tubby yes he grunted and pushed his hand across his face smearing the blood it was necessary he said heavily you made it necessary it was coldblooded murder i said he shrugged his shoulders you left me no alternative its a pity you cant see the wider issues whats one mans life against what we planned the man was your friend i said do you think i enjoyed doing what i had to he said with a trace of anger and then almost to himself he took rime to die and he knew what i was going to do as i pulled the pillow from under his head i hated doing it and i hated you for making me do it my hand clenched round the butt of the revolver at his sudden violence now its done he added why not leave it at that why make his death pointless it was the same argument that hed used before when he had been trying to stop me making that report the man could see things only from the standpoint of his own ambition sit down i said again and turned to else youll have to watch him do you know how to use one of these she took the gun from me and examined it is the safety catch on now or is it off its off i told her she nodded that is all i have to know i understand how to use it saeton had sat down now sit over there i told her and keep well away from him if he moves from that seat youre to shoot you understand are you capable of firing just because a man moves she glanced at saeton you do not have to worry i know how to shoot her hand had closed over the gun and she had the muzzle of it pointing towards saeton her eyes were steady and her hand did not tremble i knew she would fire if saeton moved and i started forward towards the cockpit but she put out her hand are you all right neil do you need some help ill be all right i said she smiled and pressed my sound arm good luck she whispered but i wasnt so sure i would be all right when i had struggled into the pilots seat a wave of dizziness came over me and i had to fight it off the engines started without difficulty and i left them running to warm up whilst i went back to the navigators table and worked out my course it would be easy enough getting back to berlin once i had got the plane into the air what worried me was the airlift i could go in above the liftstream but when i was over berlin i should have to come down to the line of flight of the other planes somehow id have to fit myself into the pattern and with the weather closing in i might have to do this in cloud there would be a big risk of collision then for a moment i sat there fighting a growing weakness and the frightened emptiness of my belly i neednt go in to berlin i could make for one of the base airfields wunstorf or celle which was nearer or i could fly north to lubeck which was nearer still but i had no navigator and i was very conscious of the fact that i was in no fit state to pilot a plane lubeck was the better part of miles away nearly an hours flying whereas i could be in gatow in twenty minutes i reached up to the throttle levers and revved the engines it would have to be gatow i switched on the twin spotlights released the brakes and taxied out to the runway end as i swung the plane into position for takeoff i called to else all set have you fixed your safety belt yes she called back i am okay fine i shouted and reached up to the throttle levers reaching up to control the engines stretched the muscles of my back and i bit my lip with the pain of my shoulder my right hand was useless to adjust the engines i had to let go of the control column again i was conscious of that feeling of emptiness in my stomach i was a fool to try and fly in the state i was in but there was no alternative we had to get out of the russian zone the plane rocked and juddered as the engines revved my eyes ran over the dials of the control panel everything was okay i peered through the windshield it was sheeting with rain now the spotlights showed a few yards of weedgrown concrete streaming with water and then lost themselves in the steel curtain of the rain for a moment i hesitated unwilling to commit myself to the takeoff then quickly before reason could support my instinctive fear i released the brakes and the plane began to move forward into the steel rods of the rain the concrete came at me out of the murk and streamed beneath me faster and faster i braced my knees against the control column steadying it as i adjusted the engines then the tail lifted and a moment later my hand was on the control column pulling it back pulling the plane up off the ground something slid away beneath us it may have been a tree or the top of one of the ruined airfield buildings after that i was alone in the lighted cockpit riding smoothly through the inky blackness of the night seeing nothing in the windshield but the water washing down it and the image of my own face white in the glass i trimmed the engines and banked slowly on to my course climbing all the time at feet i levelled out clear of the rain clouds in bright starlight and relaxed in my seat i checked oil pressure and engine revs everything was okay i felt drained of all energy my eyelids closed for a second and then i forced them open it would be so easy to slip into unconsciousness i fought off the faintness holding myself against it as one does when one is tight and refusing to go under i glanced at my watch it was a quarter to five by five oclock i should be approaching gatow i was shivering with cold once else came through into the cockpit to see if i was all right she looked tired and her eyes seemed very large in the pallor of her face she held the gun firmly in her hand and her gaze was concentrated on the door to the fuselage as she spoke to me is saeton all right i asked her yes has he tried to move no he do not try anything i think he is dazed by what has happened also he has lost much blood he is very weak i think she put her hand on my arm can you land all right do you think yes i said better get back to your seat and strap yourself in tight ill be going down in a few minutes she nodded good luck neil i didnt say anything and she went back into the fuselage below me i could just see the grey fluffy sea that marked the topside of the rain clouds it was one thing piloting the plane up here in the clear starlit night but i had got to go down through that stuff somewhere only a few minutes ahead of me i had got to go down and contact a single square mile of ground through the impenetrable murk of the rain the thought of it made me feel sick and i wished now that i had gone north to lubeck maybe the weather would have been better at lubeck but i was committed now it was no good turning back as i sat there in the cockpit i was conscious of a growing sense of panic to go on and on that was all i wanted to go on into infinity into unconsciousness automatically i kept glancing at my watch just as automatically i pressed forward on the control column as my watch came up to five pushing the nose of the plane down it was only years of operational training that enabled me to do that for it was against all reason against all the instinctive desire of mind and body it meant action the clouds came up to meet me from a flat sea of grey they became a tenuous insubstantial drift of mist then the stars were blotted out and nothing was visible beyond the pulsating interior of the cockpit i watched the altimeter dial through my earphones i was picking up instructions from gatow airways to planes reporting over frohnau okay york channel aable and call controller and then another york was in my headphones reporting number and cargo at twenty miles york clear to beacon i pressed my a button for automatic radio tuning to gatow tower york clear to qsy channel ddog and call gatow director channel ddog that was ground control approach things were bad down there it meant ceiling zero and driving rain it meant that i should have to do a controlled approach landing id never done one before id never been talked down in my life we hadnt had those sort of aids when i had been flying on ops i cleared my throat and pressed my b button hallo gatow airways i called hallo gatow airways faint through the earphones came the answering voice from gatow gatow airways answering give your number and position please give your number and position please over hallo gatow i have no number this is saetons dakota returning from hollmind fraser piloting i am now levelling out at angels five and will give you my position from frohnau beacon can you direct me in please over gatow airways answering you cannot land at gatow i repeat you cannot land at gatow overshoot and proceed to wunstorf proceed to wunstorf acknowledge please over a wave of dizziness caught me and for a moment i thought i was going to black out then it had passed fraser answering i must land at gatow i am injured i must land at gatow i started to tell them what had happened to tubby and how saeton was wounded but they cut me short overshoot and proceed to wunstorf i repeat overshoot and proceed to wunstorf i cannot fly any farther i cried desperately am coming down repeat i am coming down there was a pause then okay fraser give your position please i looked quickly down at the instrument panel the plane was fitted with a sperry automatic pilot i am going back now to get m f bearings on frohnau and gatow off i switched over to the automatic pilot and went back to the navigators desk i got the m f bearings and found that my position was almost directly over spandau i moved back to the cockpit and in sliding into the pilots seat wrenched my arm so that i had to bite back the scream of pain that came to my throat halfcollapsed over the control column i called gatow again hallo gatow fraser calling am flying angels five directly above spandau please direct me please direct me course now degrees please direct me over hallo fraser keep flying your present height and course i will direct you in a few minutes give speed and acknowledge over speed i answered i await your directions over i wiped the sweat from my forehead and disconnected the automatic pilot waves of nausea swept over me my mind seemed a blank unable to concentrate through the earphones came the sound of gatow calling other planes from the fuselage behind me i heard saetons voice call out fraser are you in trouble no i said no im all right if you want any help but i didnt trust him im all right i called back dont flap my throat felt dry my tongue was like a piece of coarse flannel i wanted to vomit hallo fraser gatow airways calling fraser can you hear me over fraser answering i hear you my voice sounded weak and hoarse oh god i breathed lets get this over gca think they have located you channel ddog and call director roger gatow i pressed my d button my hand trembling and damp with sweat hallo gatow director fraser calling gatow director a new voice much clearer sounded in my earphones turn degrees fraser turn degrees roger director i braced myself for the effort and shifted the control column giving right rudder at the same time the movement brought the sweat cold on my forehead again i should never make it i felt i just couldnt make it the control column was heavy as lead to work the rudder brought my shoulder in contact with the back of the seat pain seared through my neck and up into my head as i completed the turn and straightened out god this was going to be hell thank you fraser came the voice of the director of controlled approach have now identified you new course left on to degrees and reduce height to acknowledge roger i turned the plane on to its new course my senses strained to catch the directors voice i felt sick with the strain if only i had done one of these landings before a sheet of water lashed against the windshield the plane bucketed violently wrenching at my shoulder as i moved to maintain course the control column thrust forward my eyes fixed on the altimeter dial and the luminous circle of the compass where the needle hovered at else touched my arm are you all right neil can i do anything no i said im all right just watch saeton thats all she wiped the sweat from my forehead with her handkerchief if you want me im all right i almost screamed at her strap yourself in go on fix your safety belt well be going down in a minute she hesitated her hand touched mine a caress a wish that she could help and then she was gone and i was alone with the voice of gca saying right on to degrees now fraser right on to speed should be now youre doing fine youll be into the glide path soon how are you feeling im feeling all right i answered i wasnt but there was no point in telling him that my eyes found it difficult to focus on the instruments the concentration was causing dizziness hallo york climb to and return to base climb to and return to base emergency landing ahead of you acknowledge over it was the voice of gatow director clearing the way for me and almost immediately acknowledged then gca was calling me again right on to degrees now fraser i shifted the rudder slightly and slid on to the new course thats fine fraser youre on the glide path now reduce speed to lower flaps and undercarriage two miles to touchdown youre doing fine can you hear me over yes i can hear you i answered a new voice came in this is talk down dont acknowledge from now on check flaps and undercarriage reduce height by feet per minute fine right two degrees youre one and a half miles from touchdown now you re fifty feet above the glide path youre doing fine right on the glide path now one mile to go i could see nothing through the windshield just my reflection that was all i stared at the instrument panel the dials were blurred i seemed conscious of nothing but the voice in my earphones my whole body was tense reacting to the gca directors instructions the pain was blinding my body seemed one screaming hell of pain it shot along my nerves and jangled in my head like a burglar alarm i could feel the nerves of my brain stretched taut and i prayed god dont let me black out now half a mile to go now youre coming in a little too steeplyyoure below the glide path keep up fraser keep up i jerked at the control column cursing blindly to keep myself from screaming thats fine youre bang on now left one degree youre coming in to touchdown now start to level out you should be able to see the runway lights now level out level out look ahead and land visual i jerked at the control column peering through the streaming windshield a light showed a row of lights they were blurred and unreal i felt the plane sag i had pulled it up too hard it sagged right down on to the lights dropping on its belly heavily uncontrollably the wheels hit and i screamed as the seat slashed up into my shoulder for a second we were airborne and instinctively i applied left rudder and altered the position of the control column we hit the deck again but this time we stayed there i sagged over the control column in a blinding sheet of pain and then i reached for the brakes and applied them the plane swung right rudder but the wing dipped and suddenly we were pivoting to a stop and i blacked out i couldnt have been out long for when i came round else was just coming through into the cockpit are you all right neil i sat up slowly feeling the stillness of the plane the lack of motion thank god we were on the ground i wiped the cold sweat out of my eyes with the back of my hand i was on the floor and outside the plane i heard voices and the sound of cars and then the roar of a plane landing close by yes i said weakly im all right what about you i had my safety belt fixed she had knelt down beside me and was loosening my collar you were wonderful neil saeton said you were crazy to try it he do not think you will do it i do not think he want you to do it and when you have done it he ask me she turned her head at a sound from the open door of the fuselage they are coming now you will soon be in hospital and then you will be able to rest figures appeared in the cockpit doorway the faces were blurred and i pushed my hand across my eyes whats all this about fraser it was the wing co flying because of you two planes have had to over shoot and return to base you were told to proceed to wunstorf please else interrupted him he is hurt its his own fault the wing commander snapped if hed done as he was told he is hurt with a bullet else cut in how can he go on to wunstorf now please let the doctor see him he is very bad i think i caught hold of elses arm with my left hand help me to my feet i said she put her hands under my armpits and levered me up i braced myself against the navigators table my eyes closed fighting to maintain consciousness the station commander appeared in the doorway from very far away it seemed i heard him call for a medical orderly then he turned back to me before you go off in the ambulance eraser perhaps youll explain the extraordinary message you gave airways what was that i asked uncertainly something about carter having been murdered i pushed the sweat out of my eyes again god i felt weak he was murdered i said saeton killed him because he knew i would try to get him back from the russian zone if i brought carter back then you would have to believe what i put in my report my vision had cleared slightly and behind the station commander i saw the figure of squadron leader pierce do you believe me now i asked pierce wheres saeton he asked i thought you said youd brought him back why are you piloting the plane i let saeton borrow the wing commander asked and then pierce again what have you done with saeton questions questions questions why the devil couldnt they leave me alone you dont believe what i toldyou my voice was shrill you dont believe me do you all right then i pushed them out of the way staggering blindly as i stumbled into the body of the plane tierce i called standing over the blanketed figure of tubby still strapped along the seats take a look at that pierce pulled back the blanket there was a gasp and a short heavy silence so carter was at your farmhouse at hollmind he slowly put back the blanket then he turned to me and gripped my left arm im sorry fraser ive been rather dense now wheres saeton i looked round i couldnt see him and i glanced at else you were in charge of him where is he i asked she shrugged her shoulders i do not know after you land i come straight to the cockpit i do not trouble myself with him any more pierce strode to the door sergeant you were the first here did anybody leave the plane yes sir came the answer a big powerfullooking man there was a hurried exchange of words and then the sergeant added he commandeered one of the jeeps said he had something urgent to report he was injured i think sir leastways there was a lot of blood on im pierce glanced at me did saeton do that he nodded to the figure huddled under the blanket yes i said right sergeant take my jeep find the man and arrest him his name is saeton pierce turned and pushed his way up the fuselage a moment later i heard him on the r t to emergency ordering them to signal raf police to close all exit gates and patrol the standings where aircraft were parked another plane thundered in down the runway the station commander took my arm im sorry fraser it seems weve all made a mistake now well get you to the mo he piloted me to the door an ambulance was waiting ah there you are gentry frasers hurt better get him across to the sick bay right away else and the station commander helped me out of the fuselage the rain drove in sheets across the runway lights we were just moving across to the back of the ambulance when pierce flung out of the plane shouting for a car what is it pierce the station commander called saeton he shouted control have just come through on the r t plane thats saetons tudor has just passed the tower taxiing towards the runway theyve ordered him to stop but he doesnt answer theyre calling an raf regiment patrol car now we halted and our eyes were turned eastwards towards the purple lights of the perimeter track faintly through the driving rain the lights of an aircraft showed swinging on the last turn moving forward to line up at the runway end the driving squalls of rain periodically wiped it out but a moment later we caught the roar of its engines and twin spotlights came hurtling through the murk towards us went roaring past us and swept up and on into the night a single white light that dwindled and was lost almost instantly in the moment of its hissing thundering passage past us i had recognised saetons tudor my tudor the cause of tubbys death i felt suddenly sick at heart at the thought of saeton getting away with it there were the engines too they were tubbys work as much as his you must stop him i said to the station commander stop him dont you worry was the reply well get him well send fighters up and force him down i felt sorry then i had asked for a manhunt and it seemed i was going to get it i shivered violently and the mo hustled me into the ambulance all the way to the sick bay i was thinking about saeton alone up there in the cockpit of his plane he was injured like i had been but there was no comforting goal for him nothing for him to try for he would eventually black out and then it is best he go like this else said quietly i nodded perhaps it was best but i couldnt help thinking about it where would he try to make for russia one of the satellite countries he could sell those engines to the russians he would be safe behind the iron curtain again as though she had read my thoughts else said you do not have to worry about saeton he is gone behind the iron curtain now i must work to reproduce the engines that we of the west have lost and you must help neil you are the only person now who know what those engines are like i didnt say anything i was only remembering that saeton had fought in two wars for his country he had murdered a man so that those engines would be produced in british factories surely he wouldnt barter them with the russians for his life the mo wanted to put me straight to bed but as soon as he had dressed my shoulder i insisted on being taken down to the operations room he tried to make me remain in the sick bay but somehow i couldnt face the thought of lying there waiting for news in the end he agreed to let me go but before i left he gave me a dry overcoat and a blanket to wrap round me the operations room seemed crowded there was the station commander and pierce the wing co flying and the io somebody tried to stop else from coming in with me i told him to go to hell and then harry culyer was coming towards me i just been down to the mortuary with di he said she asked me to tell you how much she appreciated his voice trailed off she was pretty cut up poor kid whats the news of saeton i asked theyve got fighter squadrons up searching for him the station commander turned at the sound of my voice well get him he said the weathers clearing to the west to the west he nodded hes flying westward i asked yes one of our mobile radar outfits located him a few minutes back just south of hanover then he did not go to russia else exclaimed of course not i said but why does he not go to the soviet zone is he so stupid he does not know he will be safe there i do not understand it was impossible for me to explain to the satisfaction of her logical german mind why saeton had turned his back on the east so i let it go i found a chair and slumped into it reports were coming in all the time on an r t loudspeaker but i didnt listen it was squadrontobase stuff the fighters reporting back i didnt want to listen it was horrible to think of saeton up there being hounded by a pack of fighters and he could so easily have turned eastwards the minutes dragged slowly by fivethirty six sixthirty dawn was breaking over the airfield and then suddenly there was a whoop and somebodys voice was crackling over the radio ive got him now flying at feet course slightly north of west he is now over the scheldt estuary making for england home and beauty i should say what do i do now over tell that boy to start heading him off back into germany the station commander ordered and get the rest of the squadron up with him we followed it all in the rtf messages in a moment the whole pack of them were buzzing round saeton beating him up diving past his nose flying just above him trying to force him down and away from the coast and i sat there and thought of saeton alone there in the cockpit of the tudor his hand undressed and bleeding and the fighters hurtling across the perspex so close that he could almost touch them i could almost feel him wincing at each roar of a machine scraping at the paint of the aircraft i remembered the pain i had suffered at each movement of the control column god it was horrible intermittently the voice of a radio operator kept calling saeton ordering him to return to base to return to wunstorf i sat rigid in my seat expecting all the time to hear saetons voice come in but he didnt answer and as the minutes dragged by the operations room with its constant stream of instructions to planes coming in and the group of officers waiting became unreal in my mind i was there in the cockpit of the tudor with saeton he has turned north now he has turned north we are diving right across his nose hut we are making no impression he wont turn back the bastard wont alter course what are your instructions please we cannot fly any closer over the voice of the leader of the fighter squadron excited tensed up with the danger of the thing he was doing i didnt hear the reply i was with saeton seeing him hunched over the control column his face grey the blood oozing between his fingers and sticky on the wheel i could see him in my mind so clearly solid and square as immovable from his purpose as a bull who has seen the red of the matadors cloak what was his purpose what did he plan to do and as if in answer to my question the leader of the squadron came back on the air hes putting his nose down now were over the north sea and then more excited hes going into a power dive hes trying to shake us off hes going straight down now my god no its all right f for freddie swept right across his nose but hes clear now thought theyd tangle that time im right on his tail now hes diving on full power air speed im keeping right on his tail hes going straight down were at now four three two my god isnt he ever going to pull out i dont think he can pull out he cant possibly pull out there was a pause then the fighter was pulling out of his dive i knew the rest of it before the squadron leader came back on the air ive just pulled out and am banking the tudor drove straight into the sea theres a great column of water its settling now cant see anything of the plane theres just some slick on the surface of the sea thats all he went straight in never pulled out of that dive went slap in am returning to base now am returning the squadron to base there was a heavy silence in the operations room broken only by the squadron leaders voice calling his aircraft into formation in that silence i had a strange feeling of loss one shouldnt have any sympathy for a man like saeton his ambition had outrun the bounds of our social code he had killed a man and yet there had been something approaching greatness in him he was a man who had seen a vision i shifted stiffly in my chair and found that elses hand was gripping mine culyer was the first to speak poor devil he must have blacked out but i knew he hadnt blacked out else knew it too for she said he choose the best way there was a note of admiration in her voice im sorry it had to end like that the station commander murmured i think he was regretting his order to send fighters up i closed my eyes i was feeling very tired fraser i looked up culyer was standing over me you worked on those engines with saeton didnt you i nodded i was too tired to speak you know we were arranging for miss meyer here to get to work for us and the rauch motoren well thats going to take time suppose we do a deal with the british suppose the two of you work on the project together still the engines i wanted to say damn the bloody engines i wanted to tell him that theyd already cost the lives of two men and then i looked up and saw else watching me there was excitement a sort of longing in her eyes and then i knew what the future was all right i said well work on it together somehow that seemed to make sense if we reproduced those engines for the west then perhaps saeton and tubby would not have died for nothing as soon as i had made the decision the tenseness inside me seemed to ease and i was relaxed for the first time in days else was smiling she was happy and despite the pain of my shoulder i think i was happy too the end
