america jennie gerhardt chapter i one morning in the fall of a middleaged woman accompanied by a young girl of eighteen presented herself at the clerks desk of the principal hotel in columbus ohio and made inquiry as to whether there was anything about the place that she could do she was of a helpless fleshy build with a frank open countenance and an innocent diffident manner her eyes were large and patient and in them dwelt such a shadow of distress as only those who have looked sympathetically into the countenances of the distraught and helpless poor know anything about any one could see where the daughter behind her got the timidity and shamefacedness which now caused her to stand back and look indifferently away she was a product of the fancy the feeling the innate affection of the untutored but poetic mind of her mother combined with the gravity and poise which were characteristic of her father poverty was driving them together they presented so appealing a picture of honest necessity that even the clerk was affected what is it you would like to do he said maybe you have some cleaning or scrubbing she replied timidly i could wash the floors the daughter hearing the statement turned uneasily not because it irritated her to work but because she hated people to guess at the poverty that made it necessary the clerk manlike was affected by the evidence of beauty in distress the innocent helplessness of the daughter made their lot seem hard indeed wait a moment he said and stepping into a back office he called the head housekeeper there was work to be done the main staircase and parlor hall were unswept because of the absence of the regular scrubwoman is that her daughter with her asked the housekeeper who could see them from where she was standing yes i believe so she might come this afternoon if she wants to the girl helps her i suppose you go see the housekeeper said the clerk pleasantly as he came back to the desk right through there pointing to a nearby door shell arrange with you about it a succession of misfortunes of which this little scene might have been called the tragic culmination had taken place in the life and family of william gerhardt a glassblower by trade having suffered the reverses so common in the lower walks of life this man was forced to see his wife his six children and himself dependent for the necessaries of life upon whatever windfall of fortune the morning of each recurring day might bring he himself was sick in bed his oldest boy sebastian or bass as his associates transformed it worked as an apprentice to a local freightcar builder but received only four dollars a week genevieve the oldest of the girls was past eighteen but had not as yet been trained to any special work the other children george aged fourteen martha twelve william ten and veronica eight were too young to do anything and only made the problem of existence the more complicated their one mainstay was the home which barring a sixhundreddollar mortgage the father owned he had borrowed this money at a time when having saved enough to buy the house he desired to add three rooms and a porch and so make it large enough for them to live in a few years were still to run on the mortgage but times had been so bad that he had been forced to use up not only the little he had saved to pay off the principal but the annual interest also gerhardt was helpless and the consciousness of his precarious situation the doctors bill the interest due upon the mortgage together with the sums owed butcher and baker who through knowing him to be absolutely honest had trusted him until they could trust no longer all these perplexities weighed upon his mind and racked him so nervously as to delay his recovery mrs gerhardt was no weakling for a time she took in washing what little she could get devoting the intermediate hours to dressing the children cooking seeing that they got off to school mending their clothes waiting on her husband and occasionally weeping not infrequently she went personally to some new grocer each time farther and farther away and starting an account with a little cash would receive credit until other grocers warned the philanthropist of his folly corn was cheap sometimes she would make a kettle of lye hominy and this would last with scarcely anything else for an entire week cornmeal also when made into mush was better than nothing and this with a little milk made almost a feast potatoes fried was the nearest they ever came to luxurious food and coffee was an infrequent treat coal was got by picking it up in buckets and baskets along the maze of tracks in the nearby railroad yard wood by similar journeys to surrounding lumberyards thus they lived from day to day each hour hoping that the father would get well and that the glassworks would soon start up but as the winter approached gerhardt began to feel desperate i must get out of this now pretty soon was the sturdy germans regular comment and his anxiety found but weak expression in the modest quality of his voice to add to all this trouble little veronica took the measles and for a few days it was thought that she would die the mother neglected everything else to hover over her and pray for the best doctor ellwanger came every day out of purely human sympathy and gravely examined the child the lutheran minister pastor wundt called to offer the consolation of the church both of these men brought an atmosphere of grim ecclesiasticism into the house they were the blackgarbed sanctimonious emissaries of superior forces mrs gerhardt felt as if she were going to lose her child and watched sorrowfully by the cotside after three days the worst was over but there was no bread in the house sebastians wages had been spent for medicine only coal was free for the picking and several times the children had been scared from the railroad yards mrs gerhardt thought of all the places to which she might apply and despairingly hit upon the hotel now by a miracle she had her chance how much do you charge the housekeeper asked her mrs gerhardt had not thought this would be left to her but need emboldened her would a dollar a day be too much no said the housekeeper there is only about three days work to do every week if you would come every afternoon you could do it very well said the applicant shall we start today yes if youll come with me now ill show you where the cleaning things are the hotel into which they were thus summarily introduced was a rather remarkable specimen for the time and place columbus being the state capital and having a population of fifty thousand and a fair passenger traffic was a good field for the hotel business and the opportunity had been improved so at least the columbus people proudly thought the structure five stories in height and of imposing proportions stood at one corner of the central public square where were the capitol building and principal stores the lobby was large and had been recently redecorated both floor and wainscot were of white marble kept shiny by frequent polishing there was an imposing staircase with handrails of walnut and toestrips of brass an inviting corner was devoted to a news and cigarstand where the staircase curved upward the clerks desk and offices had been located all done in hardwood and ornamented by novel gasfixtures one could see through a door at one end of the lobby to the barbershop with its chairs and array of shavingmugs outside were usually two or three buses arriving or departing in accordance with the movement of the trains to this caravanserai came the best of the political and social patronage of the state several governors had made it their permanent abiding place during their terms of office the two united states senators whenever business called them to columbus invariably maintained parlor chambers at the hotel one of them senator brander was looked upon by the proprietor as more or less of a permanent guest because he was not only a resident of the city but an otherwise homeless bachelor other and more transient guests included congressmen state legislators and lobbyists merchants professional men and after them the whole raft of indescribables who coming and going make up the glow and stir of this kaleidoscopic world mother and daughter suddenly flung into this realm of superior brightness felt immeasurably overawed they went about too timid to touch anything for fear of giving offense the great redcarpeted hallway which they were set to sweep had for them all the magnificence of a palace they kept their eyes down and spoke in their lowest tones when it came to scrubbing the steps and polishing the brasswork of the splendid stairs both needed to steel themselves the mother against her timidity the daughter against the shame at so public an exposure wide beneath lay the imposing lobby and men lounging smoking passing constantly in and out could see them both isnt it fine whispered genevieve and started nervously at the sound of her own voice yes returned her mother who upon her knees was wringing out her cloth with earnest but clumsy hands it must cost a good deal to live here dont you think yes said her mother dont forget to rub into these little corners look here what youve left jennie mortified by this correction fell earnestly to her task and polished vigorously without again daring to lift her eyes with painstaking diligence they worked downward until about five oclock it was dark outside and all the lobby was brightly lighted now they were very near the bottom of the stairway through the big swinging doors there entered from the chilly world without a tall distinguished middleaged gentleman whose silk hat and loose military capecoat marked him at once among the crowd of general idlers as some one of importance his face was of a dark and solemn cast but broad and sympathetic in its lines and his bright eyes were heavily shaded with thick bushy black eyebrows passing to the desk he picked up the key that had already been laid out for him and coming to the staircase started up the middleaged woman scrubbing at his feet he acknowledged not only by walking around her but by graciously waving his hand as much as to say dont move for me the daughter however caught his eye by standing up her troubled glance showing that she feared she was in his way he bowed and smiled pleasantly you shouldnt have troubled yourself he said jennie only smiled when he had reached the upper landing an impulsive sidewise glance assured him more clearly than before of her uncommonly prepossessing appearance he noted the high white forehead with its smoothly parted and plaited hair the eyes he saw were blue and the complexion fair he had even time to admire the mouth and the full cheeks above all the wellrounded graceful form full of youth health and that hopeful expectancy which to the middleaged is so suggestive of all that is worth begging of providence without another look he went dignifiedly upon his way but the impression of her charming personality went with him this was the hon george sylvester brander junior senator wasnt that a finelooking man who went up just now observed jennie a few moments later yes he was said her mother he had a goldheaded cane you mustnt stare at people when they pass cautioned her mother wisely it isnt nice i didnt stare at him returned jennie innocently he bowed to me well dont you pay any attention to anybody said her mother they may not like it jennie fell to her task in silence but the glamor of the great world was having its effect upon her senses she could not help giving ear to the sounds the brightness the buzz of conversation and laughter surrounding her in one section of the parlor floor was the diningroom and from the clink of dishes one could tell that supper was being prepared in another was the parlor proper and there some one came to play on the piano that feeling of rest and relaxation which comes before the evening meal pervaded the place it touched the heart of the innocent workinggirl with hope for hers were the years and poverty could not as yet fill her young mind with cares she rubbed diligently always and sometimes forgot the troubled mother at her side whose kindly eyes were becoming invested with crows feet and whose lips half repeated the hundred cares of the day she could only think that all of this was very fascinating and wish that a portion of it might come to her at halfpast five the housekeeper remembering them came and told them that they might go the fully finished stairway was relinquished by both with a sigh of relief and after putting their implements away they hastened homeward the mother at least pleased to think that at last she had something to do as they passed several fine houses jennie was again touched by that halfdefined emotion which the unwonted novelty of the hotel life had engendered in her consciousness isnt it fine to be rich she said yes answered her mother who was thinking of the suffering veronica did you see what a big diningroom they had there yes they went on past the low cottages and among the dead leaves of the year i wish we were rich murmured jennie half to herself i dont know just what to do confided her mother with a longdrawn sigh i dont believe theres a thing to eat in the house lets stop and see mr bauman again exclaimed jennie her natural sympathies restored by the hopeless note in her mothers voice do you think he would trust us any more lets tell him where were working i will well said her mother wearily into the small dimly lighted grocery store which was two blocks from their house they ventured nervously mrs gerhardt was about to begin but jennie spoke first will you let us have some bread tonight and a little bacon were working now at the columbus house and well be sure to pay you saturday yes added mrs gerhardt i have something to do bauman who had long supplied them before illness and trouble began knew that they told the truth how long have you been working there he asked just this afternoon you know mrs gerhardt he said how it is with me i dont want to refuse you mr gerhardt is good for it but i am poor too times are hard he explained further i have my family to keep yes i know said mrs gerhardt weakly her old shoddy shawl hid her rough hands red from the days work but they were working nervously jennie stood by in strained silence well concluded mr bauman i guess its all right this time do what you can for me saturday he wrapped up the bread and bacon and handing jennie the parcel he added with a touch of cynicism when you get money again i guess youll go and trade somewhere else no returned mrs gerhardt you know better than that but she was too nervous to parley long they went out into the shadowy street and on past the low cottages to their own home i wonder said the mother wearily when they neared the door if theyve got any coal dont worry said jennie if they havent ill go a man run us away was almost the first greeting that the perturbed george offered when the mother made her inquiry about the coal i got a little though he added i threw it off a car mrs gerhardt only smiled but jennie laughed how is veronica she inquired she seems to be sleeping said the father i gave her medicine again at five while the scanty meal was being prepared the mother went to the sick childs bedside taking up another long nights vigil quite as a matter of course while the supper was being eaten sebastian offered a suggestion and his larger experience in social and commercial matters made his proposition worth considering though only a carbuilders apprentice without any education except such as pertained to lutheran doctrine to which he objected very strongly he was imbued with american color and energy his transformed name of bass suited him exactly tall athletic and wellfeatured for his age he was a typical stripling of the town already he had formulated a philosophy of life to succeed one must do something one must associate or at least seem to associate with those who were foremost in the world of appearances for this reason the young boy loved to hang about the columbus house it seemed to him that this hotel was the center and circumference of all that was worth while in the social sense he would go downtown evenings when he first secured money enough to buy a decent suit of clothes and stand around the hotel entrance with his friends kicking his heels smoking a twoforfivecent cigar preening himself on his stylish appearance and looking after the girls others were there with him town dandies and nobodies young men who came there to get shaved or to drink a glass of whisky and all of these he admired and sought to emulate clothes were the main touchstone if men wore nice clothes and had rings and pins whatever they did seemed appropriate he wanted to be like them and to act like them and so his experience of the more pointless forms of life rapidly broadened why dont you get some of those hotel fellows to give you their laundry he asked of jennie after she had related the afternoons experiences it would be better than scrubbing the stairs how do you get it she replied why ask the clerk of course this plan struck jennie as very much worth while dont you ever speak to me if you meet me around there he cautioned her a little later privately dont you let on that you know me why she asked innocently well you know why he answered having indicated before that when they looked so poor he did not want to be disgraced by having to own them as relatives just you go on by do you hear all right she returned meekly for although this youth was not much over a year her senior his superior will dominated the next day on their way to the hotel she spoke of it to her mother bass said we might get some of the laundry of the men at the hotel to do mrs gerhardt whose mind had been straining all night at the problem of adding something to the three dollars which her six afternoons would bring her approved of the idea so we might she said ill ask that clerk when they reached the hotel however no immediate opportunity presented itself they worked on until late in the afternoon then as fortune would have it the housekeeper sent them in to scrub up the floor behind the clerks desk that important individual felt very kindly toward mother and daughter he liked the formers sweetly troubled countenance and the latters pretty face so he listened graciously when mrs gerhardt ventured meekly to put the question which she had been revolving in her mind all the afternoon is there any gentleman here she said who would give me his washing to do id be so very much obliged for it the clerk looked at her and again recognized that absolute want was written all over her anxious face lets see he answered thinking of senator brander and marshall hopkins both were charitable men who would be more than glad to aid a poor woman you go up and see senator brander he continued hes in twentytwo here he added writing out the number you go up and tell him i sent you mrs gerhardt took the card with a tremor of gratefulness her eyes looked the words she could not say thats all right said the clerk observing her emotion you go right up youll find him in his room now with the greatest diffidence mrs gerhardt knocked at number twentytwo jennie stood silently at her side after a moment the door was opened and in the full radiance of the bright room stood the senator attired in a handsome smokingcoat he looked younger than at their first meeting well madam he said recognizing the couple and particularly the daughter what can i do for you very much abashed the mother hesitated in her reply we would like to know if you have any washing you could let us have to do washing he repeated after her in a voice which had a peculiarly resonant quality washing come right in let me see he stepped aside with much grace waved them in and closed the door let me see he repeated opening and closing drawer after drawer of the massive blackwalnut bureau jennie studied the room with interest such an array of nicknacks and pretty things on mantel and dressingcase she had never seen before the senators easychair with a greenshaded lamp beside it the rich heavy carpet and the fine rugs upon the floor what comfort what luxury sit down take those two chairs there said the senator graciously disappearing into a closet still overawed mother and daughter thought it more polite to decline but now the senator had completed his researches and he reiterated his invitation very uncomfortably they yielded and took chairs is this your daughter he continued with a smile at jennie yes sir said the mother shes my oldest girl is your husband alive what is his name where does he live to all of these questions mrs gerhardt very humbly answered how many children have you he went on six said mrs gerhardt well he returned thats quite a family youve certainly done your duty to the nation yes sir returned mrs gerhardt who was touched by his genial and interesting manner and you say this is your oldest daughter yes sir what does your husband do hes a glassblower but hes sick now during the colloquy jennies large blue eyes were wide with interest whenever he looked at her she turned upon him such a frank unsophisticated gaze and smiled in such a vague sweet way that he could not keep his eyes off of her for more than a minute of the time well he continued sympathetically that is too bad i have some washing here not very much but you are welcome to it next week there may be more he went about now stuffing articles of apparel into a blue cotton bag with a pretty design on the side do you want these any certain day questioned mrs gerhardt no he said reflectively any day next week will do she thanked him with a simple phrase and started to go let me see he said stepping ahead of them and opening the door you may bring them back monday yes sir said mrs gerhardt thank you they went out and the senator returned to his reading but it was with a peculiarly disturbed mind too bad he said closing his volume theres something very pathetic about those people jennies spirit of wonder and appreciation was abroad in the room mrs gerhardt and jennie made their way anew through the shadowy streets they felt immeasurably encouraged by this fortunate venture didnt he have a fine room whispered jennie yes answered the mother hes a great man hes a senator isnt he continued the daughter yes it must be nice to be famous said the girl softly chapter ii the spirit of jennie who shall express it this daughter of poverty who was now to fetch and carry the laundry of this distinguished citizen of columbus was a creature of a mellowness of temperament which words can but vaguely suggest there are natures born to the inheritance of flesh that come without understanding and that go again without seeming to have wondered why life so long as they endure it is a true wonderland a thing of infinite beauty which could they but wander into it wonderingly would be heaven enough opening their eyes they see a conformable and perfect world trees flowers the world of sound and the world of color these are the valued inheritance of their state if no one said to them mine they would wander radiantly forth singing the song which all the earth may some day hope to hear it is the song of goodness caged in the world of the material however such a nature is almost invariably an anomaly that other world of flesh into which has been woven pride and greed looks askance at the idealist the dreamer if one says it is sweet to look at the clouds the answer is a warning against idleness if one seeks to give ear to the winds it shall be well with his soul but they will seize upon his possessions if all the world of the socalled inanimate delay one calling with tenderness in sounds that seem to be too perfect to be less than understanding it shall be ill with the body the hands of the actual are forever reaching toward such as these forever seizing greedily upon them it is of such that the bond servants are made in the world of the actual jennie was such a spirit from her earliest youth goodness and mercy had molded her every impulse did sebastian fall and injure himself it was she who struggled with straining anxiety carried him safely to his mother did george complain that he was hungry she gave him all of her bread many were the hours in which she had rocked her younger brothers and sisters to sleep singing wholeheartedly betimes and dreaming far dreams since her earliest walking period she had been as the right hand of her mother what scrubbing baking errandrunning and nursing there had been to do she did no one had ever heard her rudely complain though she often thought of the hardness of her lot she knew that there were other girls whose lives were infinitely freer and fuller but it never occurred to her to be meanly envious her heart might be lonely but her lips continued to sing when the days were fair she looked out of her kitchen window and longed to go where the meadows were natures fine curves and shadows touched her as a song itself there were times when she had gone with george and the others leading them away to where a patch of hickorytrees flourished because there were open fields with shade for comfort and a brook of living water no artist in the formulating of conceptions her soul still responded to these things and every sound and every sigh were welcome to her because of their beauty when the soft low call or the wooddoves those spirits of the summer came out of the distance she would incline her head and listen the whole spiritual quality of it dropping like silver bubbles into her own great heart where the sunlight was warm and the shadows flecked with its splendid radiance she delighted to wonder at the pattern of it to walk where it was most golden and follow with instinctive appreciation the holy corridors of the trees color was not lost upon her that wonderful radiance which fills the western sky at evening touched and unburdened her heart i wonder she said once with girlish simplicity how it would feel to float away off there among those clouds she had discovered a natural swing of a wild grapevine and was sitting in it with martha and george oh wouldnt it be nice if you had a boat up there said george she was looking with uplifted face at a faroff cloud a red island in a sea of silver just supposing she said people could live on an island like that her soul was already up there and its elysian paths knew the lightness of her feet there goes a bee said george noting a bumbler winging by yes she said dreamily its going home does everything have a home asked martha nearly everything she answered do the birds go home questioned george yes she said deeply feeling the poetry of it herself the birds go home do the bees go home urged martha yes the bees go home do the dogs go home said george who saw one traveling lonesomely along the nearby road why of course she said you know that dogs go home do the gnats he persisted seeing one of those curious spirals of minute insects turning energetically in the waning light yes she said half believing her remark listen oho exclaimed george incredulously i wonder what kind of houses they live in listen she gently persisted putting out her hand to still him it was that halcyon hour when the angelus falls like a benediction upon the waning day far off the notes were sounding gently and nature now that she listened seemed to have paused also a scarletbreasted robin was hopping in short spaces upon the grass before her a humming bee hummed a cowbell tinkled while some suspicious cracklings told of a secretly reconnoitering squirrel keeping her pretty hand weighed in the air she listened until the long soft notes spread and faded and her heart could hold no more then she arose oh she said clenching her fingers in an agony of poetic feeling there were crystal tears overflowing in her eyes the wondrous sea of feeling in her had stormed its banks of such was the spirit of jennie chapter iii the junior senator george sylvester brander was a man of peculiar mold in him there were joined to a remarkable degree the wisdom of the opportunist and the sympathetic nature of the true representative of the people born a native of southern ohio he had been raised and educated there if one might except the two years in which he had studied law at columbia university he knew common and criminal law perhaps as well as any citizen of his state but he had never practised with that assiduity which makes for preeminent success at the bar he had made money and had had splendid opportunities to make a great deal more if he had been willing to stultify his conscience but that he had never been able to do and yet his integrity had not been at all times proof against the claims of friendship only in the last presidential election he had thrown his support to a man for governor who he well knew had no claim which a strictly honorable conscience could have recognized in the same way he had been guilty of some very questionable and one or two actually unsavory appointments whenever his conscience pricked him too keenly he would endeavor to hearten himself with his pet phrase all in a lifetime thinking over things quite alone in his easychair he would sometimes rise up with these words on his lips and smile sheepishly as he did so conscience was not by any means dead in him his sympathies if anything were keener than ever this man three times congressman from the district of which columbus was a part and twice united states senator had never married in his youth he had had a serious love affair but there was nothing discreditable to him in the fact that it came to nothing the lady found it inconvenient to wait for him he was too long in earning a competence upon which they might subsist tall straightshouldered neither lean nor stout he was today an imposing figure having received his hard knocks and endured his losses there was that about him which touched and awakened the sympathies of the imaginative people thought him naturally agreeable and his senatorial peers looked upon him as not any too heavy mentally but personally a fine man his presence in columbus at this particular time was due to the fact that his political fences needed careful repairing the general election had weakened his party in the state legislature there were enough votes to reelect him but it would require the most careful political manipulation to hold them together other men were ambitious there were a halfdozen available candidates any one of whom would have rejoiced to step into his shoes he realized the exigencies of the occasion they could not well beat him he thought but even if this should happen surely the president could be induced to give him a ministry abroad yes he might be called a successful man but for all that senator brander felt that he had missed something he had wanted to do so many things here he was fiftytwo years of age clean honorable highly distinguished as the world takes it but single he could not help looking about him now and then and speculating upon the fact that he had no one to care for him his chamber seemed strangely hollow at times his own personality exceedingly disagreeable fifty he often thought to himself alone absolutely alone sitting in his chamber that saturday afternoon a rap at his door aroused him he had been speculating upon the futility of his political energy in the light of the impermanence of life and fame what a great fight we make to sustain ourselves he thought how little difference it will make to me a few years hence he arose and opening wide his door perceived jennie she had come as she had suggested to her mother at this time instead of on monday in order to give a more favorable impression of promptness come right in said the senator and as on the first occasion he graciously made way for her jennie passed in momentarily expecting some compliment upon the promptitude with which the washing had been done the senator never noticed it at all well my young lady he said when she had put the bundle down how do you find yourself this evening very well replied jennie we thought wed better bring your clothes today instead of monday oh that would not have made any difference replied brander lightly just leave them on the chair jennie without considering the fact that she had been offered no payment for the service rendered was about to retire had not the senator detained her how is your mother he asked pleasantly shes very well said jennie simply and your little sister is she any better the doctor thinks so she replied sit down he continued graciously i want to talk to you moving to a nearby chair the young girl seated herself hem he went on clearing his throat lightly what seems to be the matter with her she has the measles returned jennie we thought once that she was going to die brander studied her face as she said this and he thought he saw something exceedingly pathetic there the girls poor clothes and her wondering admiration for his exalted station in life affected him it made him feel almost ashamed of the comfort and luxury that surrounded him how high up he was in the world indeed i am glad she is better now he said kindly how old is your father fiftyseven and is he any better oh yes sir hes around now although he cant go out just yet i believe your mother said he was a glassblower by trade yes sir brander well knew the depressed local conditions in this branch of manufacture it had been part of the political issue in the last campaign they must be in a bad way truly do all of the children go to school he inquired why yes sir returned jennie stammering she was too shamefaced to own that one of the children had been obliged to leave school for the lack of shoes the utterance of the falsehood troubled her he reflected awhile then realizing that he had no good excuse for further detaining her he arose and came over to her from his pocket he took a thin layer of bills and removing one handed it to her you take that he said and tell your mother that i said she should use it for whatever she wants jennie accepted the money with mingled feelings it did not occur to her to look and see how much it was the great man was so near her the wonderful chamber in which he dwelt so impressive that she scarcely realized what she was doing thank you she said is there any day you want your washing called for she added oh yes he answered monday monday evenings she went away and in a half reverie he closed the door behind her the interest that he felt in these people was unusual poverty and beauty certainly made up an affecting combination he sat down in his chair and gave himself over to the pleasant speculations which her coming had aroused why should he not help them ill find out where they live he finally resolved in the days that followed jennie regularly came for the clothes senator brander found himself more and more interested in her and in time he managed to remove from her mind that timidity and fear which had made her feel uncomfortable in his presence one thing which helped toward this was his calling her by her first name this began with her third visit and thereafter he used it with almost unconscious frequency it could scarcely be said that he did this in a fatherly spirit for he had little of that attitude toward any one he felt exceedingly young as he talked to this girl and he often wondered whether it were not possible for her to perceive and appreciate him on his youthful side as for jennie she was immensely taken with the comfort and luxury surrounding this man and subconsciously with the man himself the most attractive she had ever known everything he had was fine everything he did was gentle distinguished and considerate from some far source perhaps some old german ancestors she had inherited an understanding and appreciation of all this life ought to be lived as he lived it the privilege of being generous particularly appealed to her part of her attitude was due to that of her mother in whose mind sympathy was always a more potent factor than reason for instance when she brought to her the ten dollars mrs gerhardt was transported with joy oh said jennie i didnt know until i got outside that it was so much he said i should give it to you mrs gerhardt took it and holding it loosely in her folded hands saw distinctly before her the tall senator with his fine manners what a fine man he is she said he has a good heart frequently throughout the evening and the next day mrs gerhardt commented upon this wonderful treasuretrove repeating again and again how good he must be or how large must be his heart when it came to washing his clothes she almost rubbed them to pieces feeling that whatever she did she could scarcely do enough gerhardt was not to know he had such stern views about accepting money without earning it that even in their distress she would have experienced some difficulty in getting him to take it consequently she said nothing but used it to buy bread and meat and going as it did such a little way the sudden windfall was never noticed jennie from now on reflected this attitude toward the senator and feeling so grateful toward him she began to talk more freely they came to be on such good terms that he gave her a little leather picturecase from his dresser which he had observed her admiring every time she came he found excuse to detain her and soon discovered that for all her soft girlishness there lay deepseated in her a conscious deprecation of poverty and a shame of having to own any need he honestly admired her for this and seeing that her clothes were poor and her shoes worn he began to wonder how he could help her without offending not infrequently he thought to follow her some evening and see for himself what the condition of the family might be he was a united states senator however the neighborhood they lived in must be very poor he stopped to consider and for the time the counsels of prudence prevailed consequently the contemplated visit was put off early in december senator brander returned to washington for three weeks and both mrs gerhardt and jennie were surprised to learn one day that he had gone never had he given them less than two dollars a week for his washing and several times it had been five he had not realized perhaps what a breach his absence would make in their finances but there was nothing to do about it they managed to pinch along gerhardt now better searched for work at the various mills and finding nothing procured a sawbuck and saw and going from door to door sought for the privilege of sawing wood there was not a great deal of this to do but he managed by the most earnest labor to earn two and sometimes three dollars a week this added to what his wife earned and what sebastian gave was enough to keep bread in their mouths but scarcely more it was at the opening of the joyous christmastime that the bitterness of their poverty affected them most the germans love to make a great display at christmas it is the one season of the year when the fullness of their large family affection manifests itself warm in the appreciation of the joys of childhood they love to see the little ones enjoy their toys and games father gerhardt at his sawbuck during the weeks before christmas thought of this very often what would little veronica not deserve after her long illness how he would have liked to give each of the children a stout pair of shoes the boys a warm cap the girls a pretty hood toys and games and candy they always had had before he hated to think of the snowcovered christmas morning and no table richly piled with what their young hearts would most desire as for mrs gerhardt one could better imagine than describe her feelings she felt so keenly about it that she could hardly bring herself to speak of the dreaded hour to her husband she had managed to lay aside three dollars in the hope of getting enough to buy a ton of coal and so put an end to poor georges daily pilgrimage to the coal yard but now as the christmas week drew near she decided to use it for gifts father gerhardt was also secreting two dollars without the knowledge of his wife thinking that on christmas eve he could produce it at a critical moment and so relieve her maternal anxiety when the actual time arrived however there was very little to be said for the comfort that they got out of the occasion the whole city was rife with christmas atmosphere grocery stores and meat markets were strung with holly the toy shops and candy stores were radiant with fine displays of everything that a selfrespecting santa claus should have about him both parents and children observed it all the former with serious thoughts of need and anxiety the latter with wild fancy and only partially suppressed longings frequently had gerhardt said in their presence kriss kringle is very poor this year he hasnt so very much to give but no child however povertystricken could be made to believe this every time after so saying he looked into their eyes but in spite of the warning expectation flamed in them undiminished christmas coming on tuesday the monday before there was no school before going to the hotel mrs gerhardt had cautioned george that he must bring enough coal from the yards to last over christmas day the latter went at once with his two younger sisters but there being a dearth of good picking it took them a long time to fill their baskets and by night they had gathered only a scanty supply did you go for the coal asked mrs gerhardt the first thing when she returned from the hotel that evening yes said george did you get enough for tomorrow yes he replied i guess so well now ill go and look she replied taking the lamp they went out into the woodshed where the coal was deposited oh my she exclaimed when she saw it why that isnt near enough you must go right off and get some more oh said george pouting his lips i dont want to go let bass go bass who had returned promptly at a quarterpast six was already busy in the back bedroom washing and dressing preparatory to going downtown no said mrs gerhardt bass has worked hard all day you must go i dont want to pouted george all right said mrs gerhardt maybe tomorrow youll be without a fire and then what they went back to the house but georges conscience was too troubled to allow him to consider the case as closed bass you come too he called to his elder brother when he was inside go where said bass to get some coal no said the former i guess not what do you take me for well then ill not said george with an obstinate jerk of his head why didnt you get it up this afternoon questioned his brother sharply youve had all day to do it aw i did try said george we couldnt find enough i cant get any when there aint any can i i guess you didnt try very hard said the dandy whats the matter now asked jennie who coming in after having stopped at the grocers for her mother saw george with a solemn pout on his face oh bass wont go with me to get any coal didnt you get any this afternoon yes said george but ma says i didnt get enough ill go with you said his sister bass will you come along no said the young man indifferently i wont he was adjusting his necktie and felt irritated there aint any said george unless we get it off the cars there wasnt any cars where i was there are too exclaimed bass there aint said george oh dont quarrel said jennie get the baskets and lets go right now before it gets too late the other children who had a fondness for their big sister got out the implements of supply veronica a basket martha and william buckets and george a big clothesbasket which he and jennie were to fill and carry between them bass moved by his sisters willingness and the little regard he still maintained for her now made a suggestion ill tell you what you do jen he said you go over there with the kids to eighth street and wait around those cars ill be along in a minute when i come by dont any of you pretend to know me just you say mister wont you please throw us some coal down and then ill get up on the cars and pitch off enough to fill the baskets dye understand all right said jennie very much pleased out into the snowy night they went and made their way to the railroad tracks at the intersection of the street and the broad railroad yard were many heavily laden cars of bituminous coal newly backed in all of the children gathered within the shadow of one while they were standing there waiting the arrival of their brother the washington special arrived a long fine train with several of the new style drawingroom cars the big plateglass windows shining and the passengers looking out from the depths of their comfortable chairs the children instinctively drew back as it thundered past oh wasnt it long said george wouldnt i like to be a brakeman though sighed william jennie alone kept silent but to her particularly the suggestion of travel and comfort had appealed how beautiful life must be for the rich sebastian now appeared in the distance a mannish spring in his stride and with every evidence that he took himself seriously he was of that peculiar stubbornness and determination that had the children failed to carry out his plan of procedure he would have gone deliberately by and refused to help them at all martha however took the situation as it needed to be taken and piped out childishly mister wont you please throw us down some coal sebastian stopped abruptly and looking sharply at them as though he were really a stranger exclaimed why certainly and proceeded to climb up on the car from whence he cast down with remarkable celerity more than enough chunks to fill their baskets then as though not caring to linger any longer amid such plebeian company he hastened across the network of tracks and was lost to view on their way home they encountered another gentleman this time a real one with high hat and distinguished cape coat whom jennie immediately recognized this was the honorable senator himself newly returned from washington and anticipating a very unprofitable christmas he had arrived upon the express which had enlisted the attention of the children and was carrying his light grip for the pleasure of it to the hotel as he passed he thought that he recognized jennie is that you jennie he said and paused to be more certain the latter who had discovered him even more quickly than he had her exclaimed oh there is mr brander then dropping her end of the basket with a caution to the children to take it right home she hurried away in the opposite direction the senator followed vainly calling three or four times jennie jennie losing hope of overtaking her and suddenly recognizing and thereupon respecting her simple girlish shame he stopped and turning back decided to follow the children again he felt that same sensation which he seemed always to get from this girl the far cry between her estate and his it was something to be a senator tonight here where these children were picking coal what could the joyous holiday of the morrow hold for them he tramped along sympathetically an honest lightness coming into his step and soon he saw them enter the gateway of the low cottage crossing the street he stood in the weak shade of the snowladen trees the light was burning with a yellow glow in a rear window all about was the white snow in the woodshed he could hear the voices of the children and once he thought he detected the form of mrs gerhardt after a time another form came shadowlike through the side gate he knew who it was it touched him to the quick and he bit his lip sharply to suppress any further show of emotion then he turned vigorously on his heel and walked away the chief grocery of the city was conducted by one manning a stanch adherent of brander and one who felt honored by the senators acquaintance to him at his busy desk came the senator this same night manning he said could i get you to undertake a little work for me this evening why certainly senator certainly said the groceryman when did you get back glad to see you certainly i want you to get everything together that would make a nice christmas for a family of eight father and mother and six children christmas tree groceries toys you know what i mean certainly certainly senator never mind the cost now send plenty of everything ill give you the address and he picked up a notebook to write it why ill be delighted senator went on mr manning rather affected himself ill be delighted you always were generous here you are manning said the senator grimly from the mere necessity of preserving his senatorial dignity send everything at once and the bill to me ill be delighted was all the astonished and approving groceryman could say the senator passed out but remembering the old people visited a clothier and shoe man and finding that he could only guess at what sizes might be required ordered the several articles with the privilege of exchange when his labors were over he returned to his room carrying coal he thought over and over really it was very thoughtless in me i mustnt forget them any more chapter iv the desire to flee which jennie experienced upon seeing the senator again was attributable to what she considered the disgrace of her position she was ashamed to think that he who thought so well of her should discover her doing so common a thing girllike she was inclined to imagine that his interest in her depended upon something else than her mere personality when she reached home mrs gerhardt had heard of her flight from the other children what was the matter with you anyhow asked george when she came in oh nothing she answered but immediately turned to her mother and said mr brander came by and saw us oh did he softly exclaimed her mother hes back then what made you run though you foolish girl well i didnt want him to see me well maybe he didnt know you anyhow she said with a certain sympathy for her daughters predicament oh yes he did too whispered jennie he called after me three or four times mrs gerhardt shook her head what is it said gerhardt who had been hearing the conversation from the adjoining room and now came out oh nothing said the mother who hated to explain the significance which the senators personality had come to have in their lives a man frightened them when they were bringing the coal the arrival of the christmas presents later in the evening threw the household into an uproar of excitement neither gerhardt nor the mother could believe their eyes when a grocery wagon halted in front of their cottage and a lusty clerk began to carry in the gifts after failing to persuade the clerk that he had made a mistake the large assortment of good things was looked over with very human glee just you never mind was the clerks authoritative words i know what im about gerhardt isnt it well youre the people mrs gerhardt moved about rubbing her hands in her excitement and giving vent to an occasional well isnt that nice now gerhardt himself was melted at the thought of the generosity of the unknown benefactor and was inclined to lay it all to the goodness of a great local mill owner who knew him and wished him well mrs gerhardt tearfully suspected the source but said nothing jennie knew by instinct the author of it all the afternoon of the day after christmas brander encountered the mother in the hotel jennie having been left at home to look after the house how do you do mrs gerhardt he exclaimed genially extending his hand how did you enjoy your christmas poor mrs gerhardt took it nervously her eyes filled rapidly with tears there there he said patting her on the shoulder dont cry you mustnt forget to get my laundry today oh no sir she returned and would have said more had he not walked away from this on gerhardt heard continually of the fine senator at the hotel how pleasant he was and how much he paid for his washing with the simplicity of a german workingman he was easily persuaded that mr brander must be a very great and a very good man jennie whose feelings needed no encouragement in this direction was more than ever prejudiced in his favor there was developing in her that perfection of womanhood the full mold of form which could not help but attract any man already she was well built and tall for a girl had she been dressed in the trailing skirts of a woman of fashion she would have made a fitting companion for a man the height of the senator her eyes were wondrously clear and bright her skin fair and her teeth white and even she was clever too in a sensible way and by no means deficient in observation all that she lacked was training and the assurance of which the knowledge of utter dependency despoils one but the carrying of washing and the compulsion to acknowledge almost anything as a favor put her at a disadvantage nowadays when she came to the hotel upon her semiweekly errand senator brander took her presence with easy grace and to this she responded he often gave her little presents for herself or for her brothers and sisters and he talked to her so unaffectedly that finally the overawing sense of the great difference between them was brushed away and she looked upon him more as a generous friend than as a distinguished senator he asked her once how she would like to go to a seminary thinking all the while how attractive she would be when she came out finally one evening he called her to his side come over here jennie he said and stand by me she came and moved by a sudden impulse he took her hand well jennie he said studying her face in a quizzical interrogative way what do you think of me anyhow oh she answered looking consciously away i dont know what makes you ask me that oh yes you do he returned you have some opinion of me tell me now what is it no i havent she said innocently oh yes you have he went on pleasantly interested by her transparent evasiveness you must think something of me now what is it do you mean do i like you she asked frankly looking down at the big mop of black hair well streaked with gray which hung about his forehead and gave an almost lionine cast to his fine face well yes he said with a sense of disappointment she was barren of the art of the coquette why of course i like you she replied prettily havent you ever thought anything else about me he went on i think youre very kind she went on even more bashfully she realized now that he was still holding her hand is that all he asked well she said with fluttering eyelids isnt that enough he looked at her and the playful companionable directness of her answering gaze thrilled him through and through he studied her face in silence while she turned and twisted feeling but scarcely understanding the deep import of his scrutiny well he said at last i think youre a fine girl dont you think im a pretty nice man yes said jennie promptly he leaned back in his chair and laughed at the unconscious drollery of her reply she looked at him curiously and smiled what made you laugh she inquired oh your answer he returned i really ought not to laugh though you dont appreciate me in the least i dont believe you like me at all but i do though she replied earnestly i think youre so good her eyes showed very plainly that she felt what she was saying well he said drawing her gently down to him then at the same instant he pressed his lips to her cheek oh she cried straightening up at once startled and frightened it was a new note in their relationship the senatorial quality vanished in an instant she recognized in him something that she had not felt before he seemed younger too she was a woman to him and he was playing the part of a lover she hesitated but not knowing just what to do did nothing at all well he said did i frighten you she looked at him but moved by her underlying respect for this great man she said with a smile yes you did i did it because i like you so much she meditated upon this a moment and then said i think id better be going now then he pleaded are you going to run away because of that no she said moved by a curious feeling of ingratitude but i ought to be going theyll be wondering where i am youre sure youre not angry about it no she replied and with more of a womanly air than she had ever shown before it was a novel experience to be in so authoritative a position it was so remarkable that it was somewhat confusing to both of them youre my girl anyhow the senator said rising im going to take care of you in the future jennie heard this and it pleased her he was so well fitted she thought to do wondrous things he was nothing less than a veritable magician she looked about her and the thought of coming into such a life and such an atmosphere was heavenly not that she fully understood his meaning however he meant to be good and generous and to give her fine things naturally she was happy she took up the package that she had come for not seeing or feeling the incongruity of her position while he felt it as a direct reproof she ought not to carry that he thought a great wave of sympathy swept over him he took her cheeks between his hands this time in a superior and more generous way never mind little girl he said you wont have to do this always ill see what i can do the outcome of this was simply a more sympathetic relationship between them he did not hesitate to ask her to sit beside him on the arm of his chair the next time she came and to question her intimately about the familys condition and her own desires several times he noticed that she was evading his questions particularly in regard to what her father was doing she was ashamed to own that he was sawing wood fearing lest something more serious was impending he decided to go out some day and see for himself this he did when a convenient morning presented itself and his other duties did not press upon him it was three days before the great fight in the legislature began which ended in his defeat nothing could be done in these few remaining days so he took his cane and strolled forth coming to the cottage in the course of a half hour and knocked boldly at the door mrs gerhardt opened it goodmorning he said cheerily then seeing her hesitate he added may i come in the good mother who was all but overcome by his astonishing presence wiped her hands furtively upon her muchmended apron and seeing that he waited for a reply said oh yes come right in she hurried forward forgetting to close the door and offering him a chair asked him to be seated brander feeling sorry that he was the occasion of so much confusion said dont trouble yourself mrs gerhardt i was passing and thought id come in how is your husband hes well thank you returned the mother hes out working today then he has found employment yes sir said mrs gerhardt who hesitated like jennie to say what it was the children are all well now and in school i hope yes replied mrs gerhardt she had now unfastened her apron and was nervously turning it in her lap thats good and where is jennie the latter who had been ironing had abandoned the board and had concealed herself in the bedroom where she was busy tidying herself in the fear that her mother would not have the forethought to say that she was out and so let her have a chance for escape shes here returned the mother ill call her what did you tell him i was here for said jennie weakly what could i do asked the mother together they hesitated while the senator surveyed the room he felt sorry to think that such deserving people must suffer so he intended in a vague way to ameliorate their condition if possible goodmorning the senator said to jennie when finally she came hesitatingly into the room how do you do today jennie came forward extending her hand and blushing she found herself so much disturbed by this visit that she could hardly find tongue to answer his questions i thought he said id come out and find where you live this is a quite comfortable house how many rooms have you five said jennie youll have to excuse the looks this morning weve been ironing and its all upset i know said brander gently dont you think i understand jennie you mustnt feel nervous about me she noticed the comforting personal tone he always used with her when she was at his room and it helped to subdue her flustered senses you mustnt think it anything if i come here occasionally i intend to come i want to meet your father oh said jennie hes out today while they were talking however the honest woodcutter was coming in at the gate with his buck and saw brander saw him and at once recognized him by a slight resemblance to his daughter there he is now i believe he said oh is he said jennie looking out gerhardt who was given to speculation these days passed by the window without looking up he put his wooden buck down and hanging his saw on a nail on the side of the house came in mother he called in german and then not seeing her he came to the door of the front room and looked in brander arose and extended his hand the knotted and weatherbeaten german came forward and took it with a very questioning expression of countenance this is my father mr brander said jennie all her diffidence dissolved by sympathy this is the gentleman from the hotel papa mr brander whats the name said the german turning his head brander said the senator oh yes he said with a considerable german accent since i had the fever i dont hear good my wife she spoke to me of you yes said the senator i thought id come out and make your acquaintance you have quite a family yes said the father who was conscious of his very poor garments and anxious to get away i have six children all young shes the oldest girl mrs gerhardt now came back and gerhardt seeing his chance said hurriedly well if youll excuse me ill go i broke my saw and so i had to stop work certainly said brander graciously realizing now why jennie had never wanted to explain he half wished that she were courageous enough not to conceal anything well mrs gerhardt he said when the mother was stiffly seated i want to tell you that you mustnt look on me as a stranger hereafter i want you to keep me informed of how things are going with you jennie wont always do it jennie smiled quietly mrs gerhardt only rubbed her hands yes she answered humbly grateful they talked for a few minutes and then the senator rose tell your husband he said to come and see me next monday at my office in the hotel i want to do something for him thank you faltered mrs gerhardt ill not stay any longer now he added dont forget to have him come oh hell come she returned adjusting a glove on one hand he extended the other to jennie here is your finest treasure mrs gerhardt he said i think ill take her well i dont know said her mother whether i could spare her or not well said the senator going toward the door and giving mrs gerhardt his hand goodmorning he nodded and walked out while a halfdozen neighbors who had observed his entrance peeked from behind curtains and drawn blinds at the astonishing sight who can that be anyhow was the general query see what he gave me said the innocent mother to her daughter the moment he had closed the door it was a tendollar bill he had placed it softly in her hand as he said goodby chapter v having been led by circumstances into an attitude of obligation toward the senator it was not unnatural that jennie should become imbued with a most generous spirit of appreciation for everything he had done and now continued to do the senator gave her father a letter to a local mill owner who saw that he received something to do it was not much to be sure a mere job as nightwatchman but it helped and old gerhardts gratitude was extravagant never was there such a great such a good man nor was mrs gerhardt overlooked once brander sent her a dress and at another time a shawl all these benefactions were made in a spirit of mingled charity and selfgratification but to mrs gerhardt they glowed with but one motive senator brander was goodhearted as for jennie he drew nearer to her in every possible way so that at last she came to see him in a light which would require considerable analysis to make clear this fresh young soul however had too much innocence and buoyancy to consider for a moment the worlds point of view since that one notable and halcyon visit upon which he had robbed her her original shyness and implanted a tender kiss upon her cheek they had lived in a different atmosphere jennie was his companion now and as he more and more unbended and even joyously flung aside the habiliments of his dignity her perception of him grew clearer they laughed and chatted in a natural way and he keenly enjoyed this new entrance into the radiant world of youthful happiness one thing that disturbed him however was the occasional thought which he could not repress that he was not doing right other people must soon discover that he was not confining himself strictly to conventional relations with this washerwomans daughter he suspected that the housekeeper was not without knowledge that jennie almost invariably lingered from a quarter to threequarters of an hour whenever she came for or returned his laundry he knew that it might come to the ears of the hotel clerks and so in a general way get about town and work serious injury but the reflection did not cause him to modify his conduct sometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was not doing her any actual harm and at other times he would argue that he could not put this one delightful tenderness out of his life did he not wish honestly to do her much good he thought of these things occasionally and decided that he could not stop the selfapproval which such a resolution might bring him was hardly worth the inevitable pain of the abnegation he had not so very many more years to live why die unsatisfied one evening he put his arm around her and strained her to his breast another time he drew her to his knee and told her of his life at washington always now he had a caress and a kiss for her but it was still in a tentative uncertain way he did not want to reach for her soul too deeply jennie enjoyed it all innocently elements of fancy and novelty entered into her life she was an unsophisticated creature emotional totally inexperienced in the matter of the affections and yet mature enough mentally to enjoy the attentions of this great man who had thus bowed from his high position to make friends with her one evening she pushed his hair back from his forehead as she stood by his chair and finding nothing else to do took out his watch the great man thrilled as he looked at her pretty innocence would you like to have a watch too he asked yes indeed i would said jennie with a deep breath the next day he stopped as he was passing a jewelry store and bought one it was gold and had pretty ornamented hands jennie he said when she came the next time i want to show you something see what time it is by my watch jennie drew out the watch from his waistcoat pocket and started in surprise this isnt your watch she exclaimed her face full of innocent wonder no he said delighted with his little deception its yours mine exclaimed jennie mine oh isnt it lovely do you think so he said her delight touched and pleased him immensely her face shone with light and her eyes fairly danced thats yours he said see that you wear it now and dont lose it youre so good she exclaimed no he said but he held her at arms length by the waist to make up his mind what his reward should be slowly he drew her toward him until when very close she put her arms about his neck and laid her cheek in gratitude against his own this was the quintessence of pleasure for him he felt as he had been longing to feel for years the progress of his idyl suffered a check when the great senatorial fight came on in the legislature attacked by a combination of rivals brander was given the fight of his life to his amazement he discovered that a great railroad corporation which had always been friendly was secretly throwing its strength in behalf of an already too powerful candidate shocked by this defection he was thrown alternately into the deepest gloom and into paroxysms of wrath these slings of fortune however lightly he pretended to receive them never failed to lacerate him it had been long since he had suffered a defeat too long during this period jennie received her earliest lesson in the vagaries of men for two weeks she did not even see him and one evening after an extremely comfortless conference with his leader he met her with the most chilling formality when she knocked at his door he only troubled to open it a foot exclaiming almost harshly i cant bother about the clothes tonight come tomorrow jennie retreated shocked and surprised by this reception she did not know what to think of it he was restored on the instant to his faroff mighty throne and left to rule in peace why should he not withdraw the light of his countenance if it pleased him but why a day or two later he repented mildly but had no time to readjust matters his washing was taken and delivered with considerable formality and he went on toiling forgetfully until at last he was miserably defeated by two votes astounded by this result he lapsed into gloomy dejection of soul what was he to do now into this atmosphere came jennie bringing with her the lightness and comfort of her own hopeful disposition nagged to desperation by his thoughts brander first talked to her to amuse himself but soon his distress imperceptibly took flight he found himself actually smiling ah jennie he said speaking to her as he might have done to a child youth is on your side you possess the most valuable thing in life do i yes but you dont realize it you never will until it is too late i love that girl he thought to himself that night i wish i could have her with me always but fortune had another fling for him to endure it got about the hotel that jennie was to use the mildest expression conducting herself strangely a girl who carries washing must expect criticism if anything not befitting her station is observed in her apparel jennie was seen wearing the gold watch her mother was informed by the housekeeper of the state of things i thought id speak to you about it she said people are talking youd better not let your daughter go to his room for the laundry mrs gerhardt was too astonished and hurt for utterance jennie had told her nothing but even now she did not believe there was anything to tell the watch had been both approved of and admired by her she had not thought that it was endangering her daughters reputation going home she worried almost incessantly and talked with jennie about it the latter did not admit the implication that things had gone too far in fact she did not look at it in that light she did not own it is true what really had happened while she was visiting the senator its so terrible that people should begin to talk said her mother did you really stay so long in the room i dont know returned jennie compelled by her conscience to admit at least part of the truth perhaps i did he has never said anything out of the way to you has he no answered her daughter who did not attach any suspicion of evil to what had passed between them if the mother had only gone a little bit further she might have learned more but she was only too glad for her own peace of mind to hush the matter up people were slandering a good man that she knew jennie had been the least bit indiscreet people were always so ready to talk how could the poor girl amid such unfortunate circumstances do otherwise than she did it made her cry to think of it the result of it all was that she decided to get the washing herself she came to his door the next monday after this decision brander who was expecting jennie was both surprised and disappointed why he said to her what has become of jennie having hoped that he would not notice or at least not comment upon the change mrs gerhardt did not know what to say she looked up at him weakly in her innocent motherly way and said she couldnt come tonight not ill is she he inquired no im glad to hear that he said resignedly how have you been mrs gerhardt answered his kindly inquiries and departed after she had gone he got to thinking the matter over and wondered what could have happened it seemed rather odd that he should be wondering over it on saturday however when she returned the clothes he felt that there must be something wrong whats the matter mrs gerhardt he inquired has anything happened to your daughter no sir she returned too troubled to wish to deceive him isnt she coming for the laundry any more i i ventured the mother stammering in her perturbation she they have been talking about her she at last forced herself to say who has been talking he asked gravely the people here in the hotel who what people he interrupted a touch of annoyance showing in his voice the housekeeper the housekeeper eh he exclaimed what has she got to say the mother related to him her experience and she told you that did she he remarked in wrath she ventures to trouble herself about my affairs does she i wonder people cant mind their own business without interfering with mine your daughter mrs gerhardt is perfectly safe with me i have no intention of doing her an injury its a shame he added indignantly that a girl cant come to my room in this hotel without having her motive questioned ill look into this matter i hope you dont think that i have anything to do with it said the mother apologetically i know you like jennie and wouldnt injure her youve done so much for her and all of us mr brander i feel ashamed to keep her away thats all right mrs gerhardt he said quietly you did perfectly right i dont blame you in the least it is the lying accusation passed about in this hotel that i object to well see about that mrs gerhardt stood there pale with excitement she was afraid she had deeply offended this man who had done so much for them if she could only say something she thought that would clear this matter up and make him feel that she was no tattler scandal was distressing to her i thought i was doing everything for the best she said at last so you were he replied i like jennie very much i have always enjoyed her coming here it is my intention to do well by her but perhaps it will be better to keep her away at least for the present again that evening the senator sat in his easychair and brooded over this new development jennie was really much more precious to him than he had thought now that he had no hope of seeing her there any more he began to realize how much these little visits of hers had meant he thought the matter over very carefully realized instantly that there was nothing to be done so far as the hotel gossip was concerned and concluded that he had really placed the girl in a very unsatisfactory position perhaps i had better end this little affair he thought it isnt a wise thing to pursue on the strength of this conclusion he went to washington and finished his term then he returned to columbus to await the friendly recognition from the president which was to send him upon some ministry abroad jennie had not been forgotten in the least the longer he stayed away the more eager he was to get back when he was again permanently settled in his old quarters he took up his cane one morning and strolled out in the direction of the cottage arriving there he made up his mind to go in and knocking at the door he was greeted by mrs gerhardt and her daughter with astonished and diffident smiles he explained vaguely that he had been away and mentioned his laundry as if that were the object of his visit then when chance gave him a few moments with jennie alone he plunged in boldly how would you like to take a drive with me tomorrow evening he asked id like it said jennie to whom the proposition was a glorious novelty he smiled and patted her cheek foolishly happy to see her again every day seemed to add to her beauty graced with her clean white apron her shapely head crowned by the glory of her simply plaited hair she was a pleasing sight for any man to look upon he waited until mrs gerhardt returned and then having accomplished the purpose of his visit he arose im going to take your daughter out riding tomorrow evening he explained i want to talk to her about her future wont that be nice said the mother she saw nothing incongruous in the proposal they parted with smiles and much handshaking that man has the best heart commented mrs gerhardt doesnt he always speak so nicely of you he may help you to an education you ought to be proud i am said jennie frankly i dont know whether we had better tell your father or not concluded mrs gerhardt he doesnt like for you to be out evenings finally they decided not to tell him he might not understand jennie was ready when he called he could see by the weakflamed unpretentious parlorlamp that she was dressed for him and that the occasion had called out the best she had a pale lavender gingham starched and ironed until it was a model of laundering set off her pretty figure to perfection there were little laceedged cuffs and a rather high collar attached to it she had no gloves nor any jewelry nor yet a jacket good enough to wear but her hair was done up in such a dainty way that it set off her wellshaped head better than any hat and the few ringlets that could escape crowned her as with a halo when brander suggested that she should wear a jacket she hesitated a moment then she went in and borrowed her mothers cape a plain gray woolen one brander realized now that she had no jacket and suffered keenly to think that she had contemplated going without one she would have endured the raw night air he thought and said nothing of it he looked at her and shook his head reflectively then they started and he quickly forgot everything but the great fact that she was at his side she talked with freedom and with a gentle girlish enthusiasm that he found irresistibly charming why jennie he said when she had called upon him to notice how soft the trees looked where outlined dimly against the new rising moon they were touched with its yellow light youre a great one i believe you would write poetry if you were schooled a little do you suppose i could she asked innocently do i suppose little girl he said taking her hand do i suppose why i know youre the dearest little daydreamer in the world of course you could write poetry you live it you are poetry my dear dont you worry about writing any this eulogy touched her as nothing else possibly could have done he was always saying such nice things no one ever seemed to like or to appreciate her half as much as he did and how good he was everybody said that her own father they rode still farther until suddenly remembering he said i wonder what time it is perhaps we had better be turning back have you your watch jennie started for this watch had been the one thing of which she had hoped he would not speak ever since he had returned it had been on her mind in his absence the family finances had become so strained that she had been compelled to pawn it martha had got to that place in the matter of apparel where she could no longer go to school unless something new were provided for her and so after much discussion it was decided that the watch must go bass took it and after much argument with the local pawn broker he had been able to bring home ten dollars mrs gerhardt expended the money upon her children and heaved a sigh of relief martha looked very much better naturally jennie was glad now however when the senator spoke of it her hour of retribution seemed at hand she actually trembled and he noticed her discomfiture why jennie he said gently what made you start like that nothing she answered havent you your watch she paused for it seemed impossible to tell a deliberate falsehood there was a strained silence then she said with a voice that had too much of a sob in it for him not to suspect the truth no sir he persisted and she confessed everything well he said dearest dont feel badly about it there never was such another girl ill get your watch for you hereafter when you need anything i want you to come to me do you hear i want you to promise me that if im not here i want you to write me ill always be in touch with you from now on you will have my address just let me know and ill help you do you understand yes said jennie youll promise to do that now will you yes she replied for a moment neither of them spoke jennie he said at last the springlike quality of the night moving him to a burst of feeling ive about decided that i cant do without you do you think you could make up your mind to live with me from now on jennie looked away not clearly understanding his words as he meant them i dont know she said vaguely well you think about it he said pleasantly im serious would you be willing to marry me and let me put you away in a seminary for a few years go away to school yes after you marry me i guess so she replied her mother came into her mind maybe she could help the family he looked around at her and tried to make out the expression on her face it was not dark the moon was now above the trees in the east and already the vast host of stars were paling before it dont you care for me at all jennie he asked yes you never come for my laundry any more though he returned pathetically it touched her to hear him say this i didnt do that she answered i couldnt help it mother thought it was best so it was he assented dont feel badly i was only joking with you youd be glad to come if you could wouldnt you yes i would she answered frankly he took her hand and pressed it so feelingly that all his kindly words seemed doubly emphasized to her reaching up impulsively she put her arms about him youre so good to me she said with the loving tone of a daughter youre my girl jennie he said with deep feeling id do anything in the world for you chapter vi the father of this unfortunate family william gerhardt was a man of considerable interest on his personal side born in the kingdom of saxony he had had character enough to oppose the army conscription iniquity and to flee in his eighteenth year to paris from there he had set forth for america the land of promise arrived in this country he had made his way by slow stages from new york to philadelphia and thence westward working for a time in the various glass factories in pennsylvania in one romantic village of this new world he had found his hearts ideal with her a simple american girl of german extraction he had removed to youngstown and thence to columbus each time following a glass manufacturer by the name of hammond whose business prospered and waned by turns gerhardt was an honest man and he liked to think that others appreciated his integrity william his employer used to say to him i want you because i can trust you and this to him was more than silver and gold this honesty like his religious convictions was wholly due to inheritance he had never reasoned about it father and grandfather before him were sturdy german artisans who had never cheated anybody out of a dollar and this honesty of intention came into his veins undiminished his lutheran proclivities had been strengthened by years of churchgoing and the religious observances of home life in his fathers cottage the influence of the lutheran minister had been allpowerful he had inherited the feeling that the lutheran church was a perfect institution and that its teachings were of allimportance when it came to the issue of the future life his wife nominally of the mennonite faith was quite willing to accept her husbands creed and so his household became a godfearing one wherever they went their first public step was to ally themselves with the local lutheran church and the minister was always a welcome guest in the gerhardt home pastor wundt the shepherd of the columbus church was a sincere and ardent christian but his bigotry and hardandfast orthodoxy made him intolerant he considered that the members of his flock were jeopardizing their eternal salvation if they danced played cards or went to theaters and he did not hesitate to declare vociferously that hell was yawning for those who disobeyed his injunctions drinking even temperately was a sin smoking well he smoked himself right conduct in marriage however and innocence before that state were absolute essentials of christian living let no one talk of salvation he had said for a daughter who had failed to keep her chastity unstained or for the parents who by negligence had permitted her to fall hell was yawning for all such you must walk the straight and narrow way if you would escape eternal punishment and a just god was angry with sinners every day gerhardt and his wife and also jennie accepted the doctrines of their church as expounded by mr wundt without reserve with jennie however the assent was little more than nominal religion had as yet no striking hold upon her it was a pleasant thing to know that there was a heaven a fearsome one to realize that there was a hell young girls and boys ought to be good and obey their parents otherwise the whole religious problem was badly jumbled in her mind gerhardt was convinced that everything spoken from the pulpit of his church was literally true death and the future life were realities to him now that the years were slipping away and the problem of the world was becoming more and more inexplicable he clung with pathetic anxiety to the doctrines which contained a solution oh if he could only be so honest and upright that the lord might have no excuse for ruling him out he trembled not only for himself but for his wife and children would he not some day be held responsible for them would not his own laxity and lack of system in inculcating the laws of eternal life to them end in his and their damnation he pictured to himself the torments of hell and wondered how it would be with him and his in the final hour naturally such a deep religious feeling made him stern with his children he was prone to scan with a narrow eye the pleasures and foibles of youthful desire jennie was never to have a lover if her father had any voice in the matter any flirtation with the youths she might meet upon the streets of columbus could have no continuation in her home gerhardt forgot that he was once young himself and looked only to the welfare of her spirit so the senator was a novel factor in her life when he first began to be a part of their family affairs the conventional standards of father gerhardt proved untrustworthy he had no means of judging such a character this was no ordinary person coquetting with his pretty daughter the manner in which the senator entered the family life was so original and so plausible that he became an active part before any one thought anything about it gerhardt himself was deceived and expecting nothing but honor and profit to flow to the family from such a source accepted the interest and the service and plodded peacefully on his wife did not tell him of the many presents which had come before and since the wonderful christmas but one morning as gerhardt was coming home from his night work a neighbor named otto weaver accosted him gerhardt he said i want to speak a word with you as a friend of yours i want to tell you what i hear the neighbors you know they talk now about the man who comes to see your daughter my daughter said gerhardt more puzzled and pained by this abrupt attack than mere words could indicate whom do you mean i dont know of any one who comes to see my daughter no inquired weaver nearly as much astonished as the recipient of his confidences the middleaged man with gray hair he carries a cane sometimes you dont know him gerhardt racked his memory with a puzzled face they say he was a senator once went on weaver doubtful of what he had got into i dont know ah returned gerhardt measurably relieved senator brander yes he has come sometimes so well what of it it is nothing returned the neighbor only they talk he is no longer a young man you know your daughter she goes out with him now a few times these people they see that and now they talk about her i thought you might want to know gerhardt was shocked to the depths of his being by these terrible words people must have a reason for saying such things jennie and her mother were seriously at fault still he did not hesitate to defend his daughter he is a friend of the family he said confusedly people should not talk until they know my daughter has done nothing that is so it is nothing continued weaver people talk before they have any grounds you and i are old friends i thought you might want to know gerhardt stood there motionless another minute or so t his jaw fallen and a strange helplessness upon him the world was such a grim thing to have antagonistic to you its opinions and good favor were so essential how hard he had tried to live up to its rules why should it not be satisfied and let him alone i am glad you told me he murmured as he started homeward i will see about it goodby gerhardt took the first opportunity to question his wife what is this about senator brander coming out to call on jennie he asked in german the neighbors are talking about it why nothing answered mrs gerhardt in the same language she was decidedly taken aback at his question he did call two or three times you didnt tell me that he returned a sense of her frailty in tolerating and shielding such weakness in one of their children irritating him no she replied absolutely nonplussed he has only been here two or three times two or three times exclaimed gerhardt the german tendency to talk loud coming upon him two or three times the whole neighborhood talks about it what is this then he only called two or three times mrs gerhardt repeated weakly weaver comes to me on the street continued gerhardt and tells me that my neighbors are talking of the man my daughter is going with i didnt know anything about it there i stood i didnt know what to say what kind of a way is that what must the man think of me there is nothing the matter declared the mother using an effective german idiom jennie has gone walking with him once or twice he has called here at the house what is there now in that for the people to talk about cant the girl have any pleasure at all but he is an old man returned gerhardt voicing the words of weaver he is a public citizen what should he want to call on a girl like jennie for i dont know said mrs gerhardt defensively he comes here to the house i dont know anything but good about the man can i tell him not to come gerhardt paused at this all that he knew of the senator was excellent what was there now that was so terrible about it the neighbors are so ready to talk they havent got anything else to talk about now so they talk about jennie you know whether she is a good girl or not why should they say such things and tears came into the soft little mothers eyes that is all right grumbled gerhardt but he ought not to want to come around and take a girl of her age out walking it looks bad even if he dont mean any harm at this moment jennie came in she had heard the talking in the front bedroom where she slept with one of the children but had not suspected its import now her mother turned her back and bent over the table where she was making biscuit in order that her daughter might not see her red eyes whats the matter she inquired vaguely troubled by the tense stillness in the attitude of both her parents nothing said gerhardt firmly mrs gerhardt made no sign but her very immobility told something jennie went over to her and quickly discovered that she had been weeping whats the matter she repeated wonderingly gazing at her father gerhardt only stood there his daughters innocence dominating his terror of evil whats the matter she urged softly of her mother oh its the neighbors returned the mother brokenly theyre always ready to talk about something they dont know anything about is it me again inquired jennie her face flushing faintly you see observed gerhardt apparently addressing the world in general she knows now why didnt you tell me that he was coming here the neighbors talk and i hear nothing about it until today what kind of a way is that anyhow oh exclaimed jennie out of the purest sympathy for her mother what difference does it make what difference cried gerhardt still talking in german although jennie answered in english is it no difference that men stop me on the street and speak of it you should be ashamed of yourself to say that i always thought well of this man but now since you dont tell me about him and the neighbors talk i dont know what to think must i get my knowledge of what is going on in my own home from my neighbors mother and daughter paused jennie had already begun to think that their error was serious i didnt keep anything from you because it was evil she said why he only took me out riding once yes but you didnt tell me that answered her father you know you dont like for me to go out after dark replied jennie thats why i didnt there wasnt anything else to hide about it he shouldnt want you to go out after dark with him observed gerhardt always mindful of the world outside what can he want with you why does he come here he is too old anyhow i dont think you ought to have anything to do with him such a young girl as you are he doesnt want to do anything except help me murmured jennie he wants to marry me marry you ha why doesnt he tell me that exclaimed gerhardt i shall look into this i wont have him running around with my daughter and the neighbors talking besides he is too old i shall tell him that he ought to know better than to put a girl where she gets talked about it is better he should stay away altogether this threat of gerhardts that he would tell brander to stay away seemed simply terrible to jennie and to her mother what good could come of any such attitude why must they be degraded before him of course brander did call again while gerhardt was away at work and they trembled lest the father should hear of it a few days later the senator came and took jennie for a long walk neither she nor her mother said anything to gerhardt but he was not to be put off the scent for long has jennie been out again with that man he inquired of mrs gerhardt the next evening he was here last night returned the mother evasively did she tell him he shouldnt come any more i dont know i dont think so well now i will see for myself once whether this thing will be stopped or not said the determined father i shall talk with him wait till he comes again in accordance with this he took occasion to come up from his factory on three different evenings each time carefully surveying the house in order to discover whether any visitor was being entertained on the fourth evening brander came and inquiring for jennie who was exceedingly nervous he took her out for a walk she was afraid of her father lest some unseemly things should happen but did not know exactly what to do gerhardt who was on his way to the house at the time observed her departure that was enough for him walking deliberately in upon his wife he said where is jennie she is out somewhere said her mother yes i know where said gerhardt i saw her now wait till she comes home i will tell him he sat down calmly reading a german paper and keeping an eye upon his wife until at last the gate clicked and the front door opened then he got up where have you been he exclaimed in german brander who had not suspected that any trouble of this character was pending felt irritated and uncomfortable jennie was covered with confusion her mother was suffering an agony of torment in the kitchen why i have been out for a walk she answered confusedly didnt i tell you not to go out any more after dark said gerhardt utterly ignoring brander jennie colored furiously unable to speak a word what is the trouble inquired brander gravely why should you talk to her like that she should not go out after dark returned the father rudely i have told her two or three times now i dont think you ought to come here any more either and why asked the senator pausing to consider and choose his words isnt this rather peculiar what has your daughter done what has she done exclaimed gerhardt his excitement growing under the strain he was enduring and speaking almost unaccented english in consequence she is running around the streets at night when she oughtnt to be i dont want my daughter taken out after dark by a man of your age what do you want with her anyway she is only a child yet want said the senator straining to regain his ruffled dignity i want to talk with her of course she is old enough to be interesting to me i want to marry her if she will have me i want you to go out of here and stay out of here returned the father losing all sense of logic and descending to the ordinary level of parental compulsion i dont want you to come around my house any more i have enough trouble without my daughter being taken out and given a bad name i tell you frankly said the senator drawing himself up to his full height that you will have to make clear your meaning i have done nothing that i am ashamed of your daughter has not come to any harm through me now i want to know what you mean by conducting yourself in this manner i mean said gerhardt excitedly repeating himself i mean i mean that the whole neighborhood talks about how you come around here and have buggyrides and walks with my daughter when i am not here thats what i mean i mean that you are no man of honorable intentions or you would not come taking up with a little girl who is only old enough to be your daughter people tell me well enough what you are just you go and leave my daughter alone people said the senator well i care nothing for your people i love your daughter and i am here to see her because i do love her it is my intention to marry her and if your neighbors have anything to say to that let them say it there is no reason why you should conduct yourself in this manner before you know what my intentions are unnerved by this unexpected and terrible altercation jennie had backed away to the door leading out into the diningroom and her mother seeing her came forward oh said the latter breathing excitedly he came home when you were away what shall we do they clung together as women do and wept silently the dispute continued marry eh exclaimed the father is that it yes said the senator marry that is exactly it your daughter is eighteen years of age and can decide for herself you have insulted me and outraged your daughters feelings now i wish you to know that it cannot stop here if you have any cause to say anything against me outside of mere hearsay i wish you to say it the senator stood before him a very citadel of righteousness he was neither loudvoiced nor angrymannered but there was a tightness about his lips which bespoke the man of force and determination i dont want to talk to you any more returned gerhardt who was checked but not overawed my daughter is my daughter i am the one who will say whether she shall go out at night or whether she shall marry you either i know what you politicians are when i first met you i thought you were a fine man but now since i see the way you conduct yourself with my daughter i dont want anything more to do with you just you go and stay away from here thats all i ask of you i am sorry mrs gerhardt said brander turning deliberately away from the angry father to have had such an argument in your home i had no idea that your husband was opposed to my visits however i will leave the matter as it stands for the present you must not take all this as badly as it seems gerhardt looked on in astonishment at his coolness i will go now he said again addressing gerhardt but you mustnt think that i am leaving this matter for good you have made a serious mistake this evening i hope you will realize that i bid you goodnight he bowed slightly and went out gerhardt closed the door firmly now he said turning to his daughter and wife we will see whether we are rid of him or not i will show you how to go after night upon the streets when everybody is talking already in so far as words were concerned the argument ceased but looks and feeling ran strong and deep and for days thereafter scarcely a word was spoken in the little cottage gerhardt began to brood over the fact that he had accepted his place from the senator and decided to give it up he made it known that no more of the senators washing was to be done in their house and if he had not been sure that mrs gerhardts hotel work was due to her own efforts in finding it he would have stopped that no good would come out of it anyway if she had never gone to the hotel all this talk would never have come upon them as for the senator he went away decidedly ruffled by this crude occurrence neighborhood slanders are bad enough on their own plane but for a man of his standing to descend and become involved in one struck him now as being a little bit unworthy he did not know what to do about the situation and while he was trying to come to some decision several days went by then he was called to washington and he went away without having seen jennie again in the mean time the gerhardt family struggled along as before they were poor indeed but gerhardt was willing to face poverty if only it could be endured with honor the grocery bills were of the same size however the childrens clothing was steadily wearing out economy had to be practised and payments stopped on old bills that gerhardt was trying to adjust then came a day when the annual interest on the mortgage was due and yet another when two different grocerymen met gerhardt on the street and asked about their little bills he did not hesitate to explain just what the situation was and to tell them with convincing honesty that he would try hard and do the best he could but his spirit was unstrung by his misfortunes he prayed for the favor of heaven while at his labor and did not hesitate to use the daylight hours that he should have had for sleeping to go about either looking for a more remunerative position or to obtain such little jobs as he could now and then pick up one of them was that of cutting grass mrs gerhardt protested that he was killing himself but he explained his procedure by pointing to their necessity when people stop me on the street and ask me for money i have no time to sleep it was a distressing situation for all of them to cap it all sebastian got in jail it was that old coalstealing ruse of his practised once too often he got up on a car one evening while jennie and the children waited for him and a railroad detective arrested him there had been a good deal of coal stealing during the past two years but so long as it was confined to moderate quantities the railroad took no notice when however customers of shippers complained that cars from the pennsylvania fields lost thousands of pounds in transit to cleveland cincinnati chicago and other points detectives were set to work gerhardts children were not the only ones who preyed upon the railroad in this way other families in columbus many of them were constantly doing the same thing but sebastian happened to be seized upon as the columbus example you come off that car now said the detective suddenly appearing out of the shadow jennie and the other children dropped their baskets and buckets and fled for their lives sebastians first impulse was to jump and run but when he tried it the detective grabbed him by the coat hold on here he exclaimed i want you aw let go said sebastian savagely for he was no weakling there was nerve and determination in him as well as a keen sense of his awkward predicament let go i tell you he reiterated and giving a jerk he almost upset his captor come here now said the detective pulling him viciously in an effort to establish his authority sebastian came but it was with a blow which staggered his adversary there was more struggling and then a passing railroad hand came to the detectives assistance together they hurried him toward the depot and there discovering the local officer turned him over it was with a torn coat scarred hands and face and a black eye that sebastian was locked up for the night when the children came home they could not say what had happened to their brother but as nine oclock struck and then ten and eleven and sebastian did not return mrs gerhardt was beside herself he had stayed out many a night as late as twelve and one but his mother had a foreboding of something terrible tonight when halfpast one arrived and no sebastian she began to cry some one ought to go up and tell your father she said he may be in jail jennie volunteered but george who was soundly sleeping was awakened to go along with her what said gerhardt astonished to see his two children bass hasnt come yet said jennie and then told the story of the evenings adventure in explanation gerhardt left his work at once walking back with his two children to a point where he could turn off to go to the jail he guessed what had happened and his heart was troubled is that so now he repeated nervously rubbing his clumsy hands across his wet forehead arrived at the stationhouse the sergeant in charge told him curtly that bass was under arrest sebastian gerhardt he said looking over his blotter yes here he is stealing coal and resisting an officer is he your boy oh my said gerhardt ach gott he actually wrung his hands in distress want to see him asked the sergeant yes yes said the father take him back fred said the other to the old watchman in charge and let him see the boy when gerhardt stood in the back room and sebastian was brought out all marked and tousled he broke down and began to cry no word could cross his lips because of his emotion dont cry pop said sebastian bravely i couldnt help it its all right ill be out in the morning gerhardt only shook with his grief dont cry continued sebastian doing his very best to restrain his own tears ill be all right whats the use of crying i know i know said the grayheaded parent brokenly but i cant help it it is my fault that i should let you do that no no it isnt said sebastian you couldnt help it does mother know anything about it yes she knows he returned jennie and george just came up where i was and told me i didnt know anything about it until just now and he began to cry again well dont you feel badly went on bass the finest part of his nature coming to the surface ill be all right just you go back to work now and dont worry ill be all right how did you hurt your eye asked the father looking at him with red eyes oh i had a little wrestling match with the man who nabbed me said the boy smiling bravely i thought i could get away you shouldnt do that sebastian said the father it may go harder with you on that account when does your case come up in the morning they told me said bass nine oclock gerhardt stayed with his son for some time and discussed the question of bail fine and the dire possibility of a jail sentence without arriving at any definite conclusion finally he was persuaded by bass to go away but the departure was the occasion for another outburst of feeling he was led away shaking and broken with emotion its pretty tough said bass to himself as he was led back to his cell he was thinking solely of his father i wonder what ma will think the thought of this touched him tenderly i wish id knocked the dub over the first crack he said what a fool i was not to get away chapter vii gerhardt was in despair he did not know any one to whom he could appeal between the hours of two and nine oclock in the morning he went back to talk with his wife and then to his post of duty what was to be done he could think of only one friend who was able or possibly willing to do anything this was the glass manufacturer hammond but he was not in the city gerhardt did not know this however when nine oclock came he went alone to the court for it was thought advisable that the others should stay away mrs gerhardt was to hear immediately what happened he would come right back when sebastian was lined up inside the dock he had to wait a long time for there were several prisoners ahead of him finally his name was called and the boy was pushed forward to the bar stealing coal your honor and resisting arrest explained the officer who had arrested him the magistrate looked at sebastian closely he was unfavorably impressed by the lads scratched and wounded face well young man he said what have you to say for yourself how did you get your black eye sebastian looked at the judge but did not answer i arrested him said the detective he was on one of the companys cars he tried to break away from me and when i held him he assaulted me this man here was a witness he added turning to the railroad hand who had helped him is that where he struck you asked the court observing the detectives swollen jaw yes sir he returned glad of an opportunity to be further revenged if you please put in gerhardt leaning forward he is my boy he was sent to get the coal he we dont mind what they pick up around the yard interrupted the detective but he was throwing it off the cars to half a dozen others cant you earn enough to keep from taking coal off the coal cars asked the court but before either father or son had time to answer he added what is your business car builder said sebastian and what do you do he questioned addressing gerhardt i am watchman at millers furniture factory um said the court feeling that sebastians attitude remained sullen and contentious well this young man might be let off on the coalstealing charge but he seems to be somewhat too free with his fists columbus is altogether too rich in that sort of thing ten dollars if you please began gerhardt but the court officer was already pushing him away i dont want to hear any more about it said the judge hes stubborn anyhow whats the next case gerhardt made his way over to his boy abashed and yet very glad it was no worse somehow he thought he could raise the money sebastian looked at him solicitously as he came forward its all right said bass soothingly he didnt give me half a chance to say anything im only glad it wasnt more said gerhardt nervously we will try and get the money going home to his wife gerhardt informed the troubled household of the result mrs gerhardt stood white and yet relieved for ten dollars seemed something that might be had jennie heard the whole story with open mouth and wide eyes it was a terrible blow to her poor bass he was always so lively and goodnatured it seemed awful that he should be in jail gerhardt went hurriedly to hammonds fine residence but he was not in the city he thought then of a lawyer by the name of jenkins whom he knew in a casual way but jenkins was not at his office there were several grocers and coal merchants whom he knew well enough but he owed them money pastor wundt might let him have it but the agony such a disclosure to that worthy would entail held him back he did call on one or two acquaintances but these surprised at the unusual and peculiar request excused themselves at four oclock he returned home weary and exhausted i dont know what to do he said despairingly if i could only think jennie thought of brander but the situation had not accentuated her desperation to the point where she could brave her fathers opposition and his terrible insult to the senator so keenly remembered to go and ask her watch had been pawned a second time and she had no other means of obtaining money the family council lasted until halfpast ten but still there was nothing decided mrs gerhardt persistently and monotonously turned one hand over in the other and stared at the floor gerhardt ran his hand through his reddish brown hair distractedly its no use he said at last i cant think of anything go to bed jennie said her mother solicitously get the others to go theres no use their sitting up i may think of something you go to bed jennie went to her room but the very thought of repose was insupportable she had read in the paper shortly after her fathers quarrel with the senator that the latter had departed for washington there had been no notice of his return still he might be in the city she stood before a short narrow mirror that surmounted a shabby bureau thinking her sister veronica with whom she slept was already composing herself to dreams finally a grim resolution fixed itself in her consciousness she would go and see senator brander if he were in town he would help bass why shouldnt she he loved her he had asked over and over to marry her why should she not go and ask him for help she hesitated a little while then hearing veronica breathing regularly she put on her hat and jacket and noiselessly opened the door into the sittingroom to see if any one were stirring there was no sound save that of gerhardt rocking nervously to and fro in the kitchen there was no light save that of her own small roomlamp and a gleam from under the kitchen door she turned and blew the former out then slipped quietly to the front door opened it and stepped out into the night a waning moon was shining and a hushed sense of growing life filled the air for it was nearing spring again as jennie hurried along the shadowy streets the arc light had not yet been invented she had a sinking sense of fear what was this rash thing she was about to do how would the senator receive her what would he think she stood stockstill wavering and doubtful then the recollection of bass in his night cell came over her again and she hurried on the character of the capitol hotel was such that it was not difficult for a woman to find ingress through the ladies entrance to the various floors of the hotel at any hour of the night the hotel not unlike many others of the time was in no sense loosely conducted but its method of supervision in places was lax any person could enter and by applying at a rear entrance to the lobby gain the attention of the clerk otherwise not much notice was taken of those who came and went when she came to the door it was dark save for a low light burning in the entryway the distance to the senators room was only a short way along the hall of the second floor she hurried up the steps nervous and pale but giving no other outward sign of the storm that was surging within her when she came to his familiar door she paused she feared that she might not find him in his room she trembled again to think that he might be there a light shone through the transom and summoning all her courage she knocked a man coughed and bestirred himself his surprise as he opened the door knew no bounds why jennie he exclaimed how delightful i was thinking of you come in come in he welcomed her with an eager embrace i was coming out to see you believe me i was i was thinking all along how i could straighten this matter out and now you come but whats the trouble he held her at arms length and studied her distressed face the fresh beauty of her seemed to him like cut lilies wet with dew he felt a great surge of tenderness i have something to ask you she at last brought herself to say my brother is in jail we need ten dollars to get him out and i didnt know where else to go my poor child he said chafing her hands where else should you go havent i told you always to come to me dont you know jennie i would do anything in the world for you yes she gasped well then dont worry about that any more but wont fate ever cease striking at you poor child how did your brother come to get in jail they caught him throwing coal down from the cars she replied ah he replied his sympathies touched and awakened here was this boy arrested and fined for what fate was practically driving him to do here was this girl pleading with him at night in his room for what to her was a great necessity ten dollars to him a mere nothing i will arrange about your brother he said quickly dont worry i can get him out in half an hour you sit here now and be comfortable until i return he waved her to his easychair beside a large lamp and hurried out of the room brander knew the sheriff who had personal supervision of the county jail he knew the judge who had administered the fine it was but a five minutes task to write a note to the judge asking him to revoke the fine for the sake of the boys character and send it by a messenger to his home another ten minutes task to go personally to the jail and ask his friend the sheriff to release the boy then and there here is the money he said if the fine is revoked you can return it to me let him go now the sheriff was only too glad to comply he hastened below to personally supervise the task and bass a very much astonished boy was set free no explanations were vouchsafed him thats all right now said the turnkey youre at liberty run along home and dont let them catch you at anything like that again bass went his way wondering and the exsenator returned to his hotel trying to decide just how this delicate situation should be handled obviously jennie had not told her father of her mission she had come as a last resource she was now waiting for him in his room there are crises in all mens lives when they waver between the strict fulfilment of justice and duty and the great possibilities for personal happiness which another line of conduct seems to assure and the dividing line is not always marked and clear he knew that the issue of taking her even as his wife was made difficult by the senseless opposition of her father the opinion of the world brought up still another complication supposing he should take her openly what would the world say she was a significant type emotionally that he knew there was something there artistically temperamentally which was far and beyond the keenest suspicion of the herd he did not know himself quite what it was but he felt a largeness of feeling not altogether squared with intellect or perhaps better yet experience which was worthy of any mans desire this remarkable girl he thought seeing her clearly in his minds eye meditating as to what he should do he returned to his hotel and the room as he entered he was struck anew with her beauty and with the irresistible appeal of her personality in the glow of the shaded lamp she seemed a figure of marvelous potentiality well he said endeavoring to appear calm i have looked after your brother he is out she rose oh she exclaimed clasping her hands and stretching her arms out toward him there were tears of gratefulness in her eyes he saw them and stepped close to her jennie for heavens sake dont cry he entreated you angel you sister of mercy to think you should have to add tears to your other sacrifices he drew her to him and then all the caution of years deserted him there was a sense both of need and of fulfilment in his mood at last in spite of other losses fate had brought him what he most desired love a woman whom he could love he took her in his arms and kissed her again and again the english jefferies has told us that it requires a hundred and fifty years to make a perfect maiden from all enchanted things of earth and air this preciousness has been drawn from the south wind that breathed a century and a half over the green wheat from the perfume of the growing grasses waving over heavyladen clover and laughing veronica hiding the green finches baffling the bee from roselined hedge woodbine and cornflower azure blue where yellowing wheat stalks crowd up under the shadow of green firs all the devious brooklets sweetness where the iris stays the sunlight all the wild woods hold of beauty all the broad hills of thyme and freedom thrice a hundred years repeated a hundred years of cowslips bluebells violets purple spring and golden autumn sunshine shower and dewy mornings the night immortal all the rhythm of time unrolling a chronicle unwritten and past all power of writing who shall preserve a record of the petals that fell from the roses a century ago the swallows to the housetops three hundred times think of that thence she sprang and the world yearns toward her beauty as to flowers that are past the loveliness of seventeen is centuries old that is why passion is almost sad if you have understood and appreciated the beauty of harebells three hundred times repeated if the quality of the roses of the music of the ruddy mornings and evenings of the world has ever touched your heart if all beauty were passing and you were given these things to hold in your arms before the world slipped away would you give them up chapter viii the significance of the material and spiritual changes which sometimes overtake us are not very clear at the time a sense of shock a sense of danger and then apparently we subside to old ways but the change has come never again here or elsewhere will we be the same jennie pondering after the subtle emotional turn which her evenings sympathetic expedition had taken was lost in a vague confusion of emotions she had no definite realization of what social and physical changes this new relationship to the senator might entail she was not conscious as yet of that shock which the possibility of maternity even under the most favorable conditions must bring to the average woman her present attitude was one of surprise wonder uncertainty and at the same time she experienced a genuine feeling of quiet happiness brander was a good man now he was closer to her than ever he loved her because of this new relationship a change in her social condition was to inevitably follow life was to be radically different from now on was different at this moment brander assured her over and over of his enduring affection i tell you jennie he repeated as she was leaving i dont want you to worry this emotion of mine got the best of me but ill marry you ive been carried off my feet but ill make it up to you go home and say nothing at all caution your brother if it isnt too late keep your own counsel and i will marry you and take you away i cant do it right now i dont want to do it here but im going to washington and ill send for you and here he reached for his purse and took from it a hundred dollars practically all he had with him take that ill send you more tomorrow youre my girl now remember that you belong to me he embraced her tenderly she went out into the night thinking no doubt he would do as he said she dwelt in imagination upon the possibilities of a new and fascinating existence of course he would marry her think of it she would go to washington that faroff place and her father and mother they would not need to work so hard any more and bass and martha she fairly glowed as she recounted to herself the many ways in which she could help them all a block away she waited for brander who accompanied her to her own gate and waited while she made a cautious reconnaissance she slipped up the steps and tried the door it was open she paused a moment to indicate to her lover that she was safe and entered all was silent within she slipped to her own room and heard veronica breathing she went quietly to where bass slept with george he was in bed stretched out as if asleep when she entered he asked is that you jennie yes where have you been listen she whispered have you seen papa and mamma yes did they know i had gone out ma did she told me not to ask after you where have you been i went to see senator brander for you oh that was it they didnt say why they let me out dont tell any one she pleaded i dont want any one to know you know how papa feels about him all right he replied but he was curious as to what the exsenator thought what he had done and how she had appealed to him she explained briefly then she heard her mother come to the door jennie she whispered jennie went out oh why did you go she asked i couldnt help it ma she replied i thought i must do something why did you stay so long he wanted to talk to me she answered evasively her mother looked at her nervously wanly i have been so afraid oh so afraid your father went to your room but i said you were asleep he locked the front door but i opened it again when bass came in he wanted to call you but i persuaded him to wait until morning again she looked wistfully at her daughter im all right mamma said jennie encouragingly ill tell you all about it tomorrow go to bed how does he think bass got out he doesnt know he thought maybe they just let him go because he couldnt pay the fine jennie laid her hand lovingly on her mothers shoulder go to bed she said she was already years older in thought and act she felt as though she must help her mother now as well as herself the days which followed were ones of dreamy uncertainty to jennie she went over in her mind these dramatic events time and time and time and again it was not such a difficult matter to tell her mother that the senator had talked again of marriage that he proposed to come and get her after his next trip to washington that he had given her a hundred dollars and intended to give her more but of that other matter the one allimportant thing she could not bring herself to speak it was too sacred the balance of the money that he had promised her arrived by messenger the following day four hundred dollars in bills with the admonition that she should put it in a local bank the exsenator explained that he was already on his way to washington but that he would come back or send for her keep a stout heart he wrote there are better days in store for you brander was gone and jennies fate was really in the balance but her mind still retained all of the heartinnocence and unsophistication of her youth a certain gentle wistfulness was the only outward change in her demeanor he would surely send for her there was the mirage of a distant country and wondrous scenes looming up in her mind she had a little fortune in the bank more than she had ever dreamed of with which to help her mother there were natural girlish anticipations of good still holding over which made her less apprehensive than she could otherwise possibly have been all nature life possibility was in the balance it might turn good or ill but with so inexperienced a soul it would not be entirely evil until it was so how a mind under such uncertain circumstances could retain so comparatively placid a vein is one of those marvels which find their explanation in the inherent trustfulness of the spirit of youth it is not often that the minds of men retain the perceptions of their younger days the marvel is not that one should thus retain but that any should ever lose them go the world over and after you have put away the wonder and tenderness of youth what is there left the few sprigs of green that sometimes invade the barrenness of your materialism the few glimpses of summer which flash past the eye of the wintry soul the half hours off during the long tedium of burrowing these reveal to the hardened earthseeker the universe which the youthful mind has with it always no fear and no favor the open fields and the light upon the hills morning noon night stars the birdcalls the waters purl these are the natural inheritance of the mind of the child men call it poetic those who are hardened fanciful in the days of their youth it was natural but the receptiveness of youth has departed and they cannot see how this worked out in her personal actions was to be seen only in a slightly accentuated wistfulness a touch of which was in every task sometimes she would wonder that no letter came but at the same time she would recall the fact that he had specified a few weeks and hence the six that actually elapsed did not seem so long in the meanwhile the distinguished exsenator had gone lightheartedly to his conference with the president he had joined in a pleasant round of social calls and he was about to pay a short country visit to some friends in maryland when he was seized with a slight attack of fever which confined him to his room for a few days he felt a little irritated that he should be laid up just at this time but never suspected that there was anything serious in his indisposition then the doctor discovered that he was suffering from a virulent form of typhoid the ravages of which took away his senses for a time and left him very weak he was thought to be convalescing however when just six weeks after he had last parted with jennie he was seized with a sudden attack of heart failure and never regained consciousness jennie remained blissfully ignorant of his illness and did not even see the heavytyped headlines of the announcement of his death until bass came home that evening look here jennie he said excitedly branders dead he held up the newspaper on the first column of which was printed in heavy block type death of exsenator brander sudden passing of ohios distinguished son succumbs to heart failure at the arlington in washington recent attack of typhoid from which he was thought to be recovering proves fatal notable phases of a remarkable career jennie looked at it in blank amazement dead she exclaimed there it is in the paper returned bass his tone being that of one who is imparting a very interesting piece of news he died at ten oclock this morning chapter ix jennie took the paper with but illconcealed trembling and went into the adjoining room there she stood by the front window and looked at it again a sickening sensation of dread holding her as though in a trance he is dead was all that her mind could formulate for the time and as she stood there the voice of bass recounting the fact to gerhardt in the adjoining room sounded in her ears yes he is dead she heard him say and once again she tried to get some conception of what it meant to her but her mind seemed a blank a moment later mrs gerhardt joined her she had heard basss announcement and had seen jennie leave the room but her trouble with gerhardt over the senator had caused her to be careful of any display of emotion no conception of the real state of affairs ever having crossed her mind she was only interested in seeing how jennie would take this sudden annihilation of her hopes isnt it too bad she said with real sorrow to think that he should have to die just when he was going to do so much for you for us all she paused expecting some word of agreement but jennie remained unwontedly dumb i wouldnt feel badly continued mrs gerhardt it cant be helped he meant to do a good deal but you mustnt think of that now its all over and it cant be helped you know she paused again and still jennie remained motionless and mute mrs gerhardt seeing how useless her words were concluded that jennie wished to be alone and she went away still jennie stood there and now as the real significance of the news began to formulate itself into consecutive thought she began to realize the wretchedness of her position its helplessness she went into her bedroom and sat down upon the side of the bed from which position she saw a very pale distraught face staring at her from out of the small mirror she looked at it uncertainly could that really be her own countenance ill have to go away she thought and began with the courage of despair to wonder what refuge would be open to her in the mean time the evening meal was announced and to maintain appearances she went out and joined the family the naturalness of her part was very difficult to sustain gerhardt observed her subdued condition without guessing the depth of emotion which it covered bass was too much interested in his own affairs to pay particular attention to anybody during the days that followed jennie pondered over the difficulties of her position and wondered what she should do money she had it was true but no friends no experience no place to go she had always lived with her family she began to feel unaccountable sinkings of spirit nameless and formless fears seemed to surround and haunt her once when she arose in the morning she felt an uncontrollable desire to cry and frequently thereafter this feeling would seize upon her at the most inopportune times mrs gerhardt began to note her moods and one afternoon she resolved to question her daughter now you must tell me whats the matter with you she said quietly jennie you must tell your mother everything jennie to whom confession had seemed impossible under the sympathetic persistence of her mother broke down at last and made the fatal confession mrs gerhardt stood there too dumb with misery to give vent to a word oh she said at last a great wave of selfaccusation sweeping over her it is all my fault i might have known but well do what we can she broke down and sobbed aloud after a time she went back to the washing she had to do and stood over her tub rubbing and crying the tears ran down her cheeks and dropped into the suds once in a while she stopped and tried to dry her eyes with her apron but they soon filled again now that the first shock had passed there came the vivid consciousness of everpresent danger what would gerhardt do if he learned the truth he had often said that if ever one of his daughters should act like some of those he knew he would turn her out of doors she should not stay under my roof he had exclaimed im so afraid of your father mrs gerhardt often said to jennie in this intermediate period i dont know what hell say perhaps id better go away suggested her daughter no she said he neednt know just yet wait awhile but in her heart of hearts she knew that the evil day could not be long postponed one day when her own suspense had reached such a pitch that it could no longer be endured mrs gerhardt sent jennie away with the children hoping to be able to tell her husband before they returned all the morning she fidgeted about dreading the opportune moment and letting him retire to his slumber without speaking when afternoon came she did not go out to work because she could not leave with her painful duty unfulfilled gerhardt arose at four and still she hesitated knowing full well that jennie would soon return and that the specially prepared occasion would then be lost it is almost certain that she would not have had the courage to say anything if he himself had not brought up the subject of jennies appearance she doesnt look well he said there seems to be something the matter with her oh began mrs gerhardt visibly struggling with her fears and moved to make an end of it at any cost jennie is in trouble i dont know what to do she gerhardt who had unscrewed a doorlock and was trying to mend it looked up sharply from his work what do you mean he asked mrs gerhardt had her apron in her hands at the time her nervous tendency to roll it coming upon her she tried to summon sufficient courage to explain but fear mastered her completely she lifted the apron to her eyes and began to cry gerhardt looked at her and rose he was a man with the calvin type of face rather spare with skin sallow and discolored as the result of age and work in the wind and rain when he was surprised or angry sparks of light glittered in his eyes he frequently pushed his hair back when he was troubled and almost invariably walked the floor just now he looked alert and dangerous what is that you say he inquired in german his voice straining to a hard note in trouble has some one he paused and flung his hand upward why dont you speak he demanded i never thought went on mrs gerhardt frightened and yet following her own train of thought that anything like that would happen to her she was such a good girl oh she concluded to think he should ruin jennie by thunder shouted gerhardt giving way to a fury of feeling i thought so brander ha your fine man that comes of letting her go running around at nights buggyriding walking the streets i thought so god in heaven he broke from his dramatic attitude and struck out in a fierce stride across the narrow chamber turning like a caged animal ruined he exclaimed ruined ha so he has ruined her has he suddenly he stopped like an image jerked by a string he was directly in front of mrs gerhardt who had retired to the table at the side of the wall and was standing there pale with fear he is dead now he shouted as if this fact had now first occurred to him he is dead he put both hands to his temples as if he feared his brain would give way and stood looking at her the mocking irony of the situation seeming to burn in his brain like fire dead he repeated and mrs gerhardt fearing for the reason of the man shrank still farther away her wits taken up rather with the tragedy of the figure he presented than with the actual substance of his woe he intended to marry her she pleaded nervously he would have married her if he had not died would have shouted gerhardt coming out of his trance at the sound of her voice would have thats a fine thing to talk about now would have the hound may his soul burn in hell the dog ah god i hope i hope if i were not a christian he clenched his hands the awfulness of his passion shaking him like a leaf mrs gerhardt burst into tears and her husband turned away his own feelings far too intense for him to have any sympathy with her he walked to and fro his heavy step shaking the kitchen floor after a time he came back a new phase of the dread calamity having offered itself to his mind when did this happen he demanded i dont know returned mrs gerhardt too terrorstricken to tell the truth i only found it out the other day you lie he exclaimed in his excitement you were always shielding her it is your fault that she is where she is if you had let me have my way there would have been no cause for our trouble tonight a fine ending he went on to himself a fine ending my boy gets into jail my daughter walks the streets and gets herself talked about the neighbors come to me with open remarks about my children and now this scoundrel ruins her by the god in heaven i dont know what has got into my children i dont know how it is he went on unconsciously commiserating himself i try i try every night i pray that the lord will let me do right but it is no use i might work and work my hands look at them are rough with work all my life i have tried to be an honest man now now his voice broke and it seemed for a moment as if he would give way to tears suddenly he turned on his wife the major passion of anger possessing him you are the cause of this he exclaimed you are the sole cause if you had done as i told you to do this would not have happened no you wouldnt do that she must go out out out she has become a streetwalker thats what she has become she has set herself right to go to hell let her go i wash my hands of the whole thing this is enough for me he made as if to go off to his little bedroom but he had no sooner reached the door than he came back she shall get out he said electrically she shall not stay under my roof tonight at once i will not let her enter my door again i will show her whether she will disgrace me or not you mustnt turn her out on the streets tonight pleaded mrs gerhardt she has no place to go tonight he repeated this very minute let her find a home she did not want this one let her get out now we will see how the world treats her he walked out of the room inflexible resolution fixed upon his rugged features at halfpast five when mrs gerhardt was tearfully going about the duty of getting supper jennie returned her mother started when she heard the door open for now she knew the storm would burst afresh her father met her on the threshold get out of my sight he said savagely you shall not stay another hour in my house i dont want to see you any more get out jennie stood before him pale trembling a little and silent the children she had brought home with her crowded about in frightened amazement veronica and martha who loved her dearly began to cry whats the matter george asked his mouth open in wonder she shall get out reiterated gerhardt i dont want her under my roof if she wants to be a streetwalker let her be one but she shall not stay here pack your things he added staring at her jennie had no word to say but the children cried loudly be still said gerhardt go into the kitchen he drove them all out and followed stubbornly himself jennie went quietly to her room she gathered up her few little belongings and began with tears to put them into a valise her mother brought her the little girlish trinkets that she had accumulated from time to time she did not take she saw them but thought of her younger sisters and let them stay martha and veronica would have assisted her but their father forbade them to go at six oclock bass came in and seeing the nervous assembly in the kitchen inquired what the trouble was gerhardt looked at him grimly but did not answer whats the trouble insisted bass what are you all sitting around for he is driving jennie away whispered mrs gerhardt tearfully what for asked bass opening his eyes in astonishment i shall tell you what for broke in gerhardt still speaking in german because shes a streetwalker thats what for she goes and gets herself ruined by a man thirty years older than she is a man old enough to be her father let her get out of this she shall not stay here another minute bass looked about him and the children opened their eyes all felt clearly that something terrible had happened even the little ones none but bass understood what do you want to send her out tonight for he inquired this is no time to send a girl out on the streets cant she stay here until morning no said gerhardt he oughtnt to do that put in the mother she goes now said gerhardt let that be an end of it where is she going to go insisted bass i dont know mrs gerhardt interpolated weakly bass looked around but did nothing until mrs gerhardt motioned him toward the front door when her husband was not looking go in go in was the import of her gesture bass went in and then mrs gerhardt dared to leave her work and follow the children stayed awhile but one by one even they slipped away leaving gerhardt alone when he thought that time enough had elapsed he arose in the interval jennie had been hastily coached by her mother jennie should go to a private boardinghouse somewhere and send back her address bass should not accompany her but she should wait a little way up the street and he would follow when her father was away the mother might get to see her or jennie could come home all else must be postponed until they could meet again while the discussion was still going on gerhardt came in is she going he asked harshly yes answered mrs gerhardt with her first and only note of defiance bass said whats the hurry but gerhardt frowned too mightily for him to venture on any further remonstrance jennie entered wearing her one good dress and carrying her valise there was fear in her eyes for she was passing through a fiery ordeal but she had become a woman the strength of love was with her the support of patience and the ruling sweetness of sacrifice silently she kissed her mother while tears fell fast then she turned and the door closed upon her as she went forth to a new life chapter x the world into which jennie was thus unduly thrust forth was that in which virtue has always vainly struggled since time immemorial for virtue is the wishing well and the doing well unto others virtue is that quality of generosity which offers itself willingly for anothers service and being this it is held by society to be nearly worthless sell yourself cheaply and you shall be used lightly and trampled under foot hold yourself dearly however unworthily and you will be respected society in the mass lacks woefully in the matter of discrimination its one criterion is the opinion of others its one test that of selfpreservation has he preserved his fortune has she preserved her purity only in rare instances and with rare individuals does there seem to be any guiding light from within jennie had not sought to hold herself dear innate feeling in her made for selfsacrifice she could not be readily corrupted by the worlds selfish lessons on how to preserve oneself from the evil to come it is in such supreme moments that growth is greatest it comes as with a vast surge this feeling of strength and sufficiency we may still tremble the fear of doing wretchedly may linger but we grow flashes of inspiration come to guide the soul in nature there is no outside when we are cast from a group or a condition we have still the companionship of all that is nature is not ungenerous its winds and stars are fellows with you let the soul be but gentle and receptive and this vast truth will come home not in set phrases perhaps but as a feeling a comfort which after all is the last essence of knowledge in the universe peace is wisdom jennie had hardly turned from the door when she was overtaken by bass give me your grip he said and then seeing that she was dumb with unutterable feeling he added i think i know where i can get you a room he led the way to the southern part of the city where they were not known and up to the door of an old lady whose parlor clock had been recently purchased from the instalment firm by whom he was now employed she was not well off he knew and had a room to rent is that room of yours still vacant he asked yes she said looking at jennie i wish youd let my sister have it were moving away and she cant go yet the old lady expressed her willingness and jennie was soon temporarily installed dont worry now said bass who felt rather sorry for her thisll blow over ma said i should tell you not to worry come up tomorrow when hes gone jennie said she would and after giving her further oral encouragement he arranged with the old lady about board and took his leave its all right now he said encouragingly as he went out youll come out all right dont worry ive got to go back but ill come around in the morning he went away and the bitter stress of it blew lightly over his head for he was thinking that jennie had made a mistake this was shown by the manner in which he had asked her questions as they had walked together and that in the face of her sad and doubtful mood whatd you want to do that for and didnt you ever think what you were doing he persisted please dont ask me tonight jennie had said which put an end to the sharpest form of his queries she had no excuse to offer and no complaint to make if any blame attached very likely it was hers his own misfortune and the familys and her sacrifice were alike forgotten left alone in her strange abode jennie gave way to her saddened feelings the shock and shame of being banished from her home overcame her and she wept although of a naturally longsuffering and uncomplaining disposition the catastrophic windup of all her hopes was too much for her what was this element in life that could seize and overwhelm one as does a great wind why this sudden intrusion of death to shatter all that had seemed most promising in life as she thought over the past a very clear recollection of the details of her long relationship with brander came back to her and for all her suffering she could only feel a loving affection for him after all he had not deliberately willed her any harm his kindness his generosity these things had been real he had been essentially a good man and she was sorry more for his sake than for her own that his end had been so untimely these cogitations while not at all reassuring at least served to pass the night away and the next morning bass stopped on his way to work to say that mrs gerhardt wished her to come home that same evening gerhardt would not be present and they could talk it over she spent the day lonesomely enough but when night fell her spirits brightened and at a quarter of eight she set out there was not much of comforting news to tell her gerhardt was still in a direfully angry and outraged mood he had already decided to throw up his place on the following saturday and go to youngstown any place was better than columbus after this he could never expect to hold up his head here again its memories were odious he would go away now and if he succeeded in finding work the family should follow a decision which meant the abandoning of the little home he was not going to try to meet the mortgage on the house he could not hope to at the end of the week gerhardt took his leave jennie returned home and for a time at least there was a restoration of the old order a condition which of course could not endure bass saw it jennies trouble and its possible consequences weighed upon him disagreeably columbus was no place to stay youngstown was no place to go if they should all move away to some larger city it would be much better he pondered over the situation and hearing that a manufacturing boom was on in cleveland he thought it might be wise to try his luck there if he succeeded the others might follow if gerhardt still worked on in youngstown as he was now doing and the family came to cleveland it would save jennie from being turned out in the streets bass waited a little while before making up his mind but finally announced his purpose i believe ill go up to cleveland he said to his mother one evening as she was getting supper why she asked looking up uncertainly she was rather afraid that bass would desert her i think i can get work there he returned we oughtnt to stay in this darned old town dont swear she returned reprovingly oh i know he said but its enough to make any one swear weve never had anything but rotten luck here im going to go and maybe if i get anything we can all move wed be better off if wed get some place where people dont know us we cant be anything here mrs gerhardt listened with a strong hope for a betterment of their miserable life creeping into her heart if bass would only do this if he would go and get work and come to her rescue as a strong bright young son might what a thing it would be they were in the rapids of a life which was moving toward a dreadful calamity if only something would happen do you think you could get something to do she asked interestedly i ought to he said ive never looked for a place yet that i didnt get it other fellows have gone up there and done all right look at the millers he shoved his hands into his pockets and looked out the window do you think you could get along until i try my hand up there he asked i guess we could she replied papas at work now and we have some money that that she hesitated to name the source so ashamed was she of their predicament yes i know said bass grimly we wont have to pay any rent here before fall and then well have to give it up anyhow she added she was referring to the mortgage on the house which fell due the next september and which unquestionably could not be met if we could move away from here before then i guess we could get along ill do it said bass determinedly ill go accordingly he threw up his place at the end of the month and the day after he left for cleveland chapter xi the incidents of the days that followed relating as they did peculiarly to jennie were of an order which the morality of our day has agreed to taboo certain processes of the allmother the great artificing wisdom of the power that works and weaves in silence and in darkness when viewed in the light of the established opinion of some of the little individuals created by it are considered very vile we turn our faces away from the creation of life as if that were the last thing that man should dare to interest himself in openly it is curious that a feeling of this sort should spring up in a world whose very essence is generative the vast process dual and where wind water soil and light alike minister to the fruition of that which is all that we are although the whole earth not we alone is moved by passions hymeneal and everything terrestrial has come into being by the one common road yet there is that ridiculous tendency to close the eyes and turn away the head as if there were something unclean in nature itself conceived in iniquity and born in sin is the unnatural interpretation put upon the process by the extreme religionist and the world by its silence gives assent to a judgment so marvelously warped surely there is something radically wrong in this attitude the teachings of philosophy and the deductions of biology should find more practical application in the daily reasoning of man no process is vile no condition is unnatural the accidental variation from a given social practice does not necessarily entail sin no poor little earthling caught in the enormous grip of chance and so swerved from the established customs of men could possibly be guilty of that depth of vileness which the attitude of the world would seem to predicate so inevitably jennie was now to witness the unjust interpretation of that wonder of nature which but for branders death might have been consecrated and hallowed as one of the ideal functions of life although herself unable to distinguish the separateness of this from every other normal process of life yet was she made to feel by the actions of all about her that degradation was her portion and sin the foundation as well as the condition of her state almost not quite it was sought to extinguish the affection the consideration the care which afterward the world would demand of her for her child almost not quite was the budding and essential love looked upon as evil although her punishment was neither the gibbet nor the jail of a few hundred years before yet the ignorance and immobility of the human beings about her made it impossible for them to see anything in her present condition but a vile and premeditated infraction of the social code the punishment of which was ostracism all she could do now was to shun the scornful gaze of men and to bear in silence the great change that was coming upon her strangely enough she felt no useless remorse no vain regrets her heart was pure and she was conscious that it was filled with peace sorrow there was it is true but only a mellow phase of it a vague uncertainty and wonder which would sometimes cause her eyes to fill with tears you have heard the wooddove calling in the lone stillness of the summertime you have found the unheeded brooklet singing and babbling where no ear comes to hear under dead leaves and snowbanks the delicate arbutus unfolds its simple blossom answering some heavenly call for color so too this other flower of womanhood jennie was left alone but like the wooddove she was a voice of sweetness in the summertime going about her household duties she was content to wait without a murmur the fulfilment of that process for which after all she was but the sacrificial implement when her duties were lightest she was content to sit in quiet meditation the marvel of life holding her as in a trance when she was hardest pressed to aid her mother she would sometimes find herself quietly singing the pleasure of work lifting her out of herself always she was content to face the future with a serene and unfaltering courage it is not so with all women nature is unkind in permitting the minor type to bear a child at all the larger natures in their maturity welcome motherhood see in it the immense possibilities of racial fulfilment and find joy and satisfaction in being the handmaiden of so immense a purpose jennie a child in years was potentially a woman physically and mentally but not yet come into rounded conclusions as to life and her place in it the great situation which had forced her into this anomalous position was from one point of view a tribute to her individual capacity it proved her courage the largeness of her sympathy her willingness to sacrifice for what she considered a worthy cause that it resulted in an unexpected consequence which placed upon her a larger and more complicated burden was due to the fact that her sense of selfprotection had not been commensurate with her emotions there were times when the prospective coming of the child gave her a sense of fear and confusion because she did not know but that the child might eventually reproach her but there was always that saving sense of eternal justice in life which would not permit her to be utterly crushed to her way of thinking people were not intentionally cruel vague thoughts of sympathy and divine goodness permeated her soul life at worst or best was beautiful had always been so these thoughts did not come to her all at once but through the months during which she watched and waited it was a wonderful thing to be a mother even under these untoward conditions she felt that she would love this child would be a good mother to it if life permitted that was the problem what would life permit there were many things to be done clothes to be made certain provisions of hygiene and diet to be observed one of her fears was that gerhardt might unexpectedly return but he did not the old family doctor who had nursed the various members of the gerhardt family through their multitudinous ailments doctor ellwanger was taken into consultation and he gave sound and practical advice despite his lutheran upbringing the practice of medicine in a large and kindly way had led him to the conclusion that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of in our philosophies and in our small neighborhood relationships so it is he observed to mrs gerhardt when she confided to him nervously what the trouble was well you mustnt worry these things happen in more places than you think if you knew as much about life as i do and about your neighbors you would not cry your girl will be all right she is very healthy she can go away somewhere afterward and people will never know why should you worry about what your neighbors think it is not so uncommon as you imagine mrs gerhardt marveled he was such a wise man it gave her a little courage as for jennie she listened to his advice with interest and without fear she wanted things not so much for herself as for her child and she was anxious to do whatever she was told the doctor was curious to know who the father was when informed he lifted his eyes indeed he commented that ought to be a bright baby there came the final hour when the child was ushered into the world it was doctor ellwanger who presided assisted by the mother who having brought forth six herself knew exactly what to do there was no difficulty and at the first cry of the newborn infant there awakened in jennie a tremendous yearning toward it this was her child it was weak and feeble a little girl and it needed her care she took it to her breast when it had been bathed and swaddled with a tremendous sense of satisfaction and joy this was her child her little girl she wanted to live to be able to work for it and rejoiced even in her weakness that she was so strong doctor ellwanger predicted a quick recovery he thought two weeks would be the outside limit of her need to stay in bed as a matter of fact in ten days she was up and about as vigorous and healthy as ever she had been born with strength and with that nurturing quality which makes the ideal mother the great crisis had passed and now life went on much as before the children outside of bass were too young to understand fully and had been deceived by the story that jennie was married to senator brander who had died they did not know that a child was coming until it was there the neighbors were feared by mrs gerhardt for they were ever watchful and really knew all jennie would never have braved this local atmosphere except for the advice of bass who having secured a place in cleveland some time before had written that he thought when she was well enough it would be advisable for the whole family to seek a new start in cleveland things were flourishing there once away they would never hear of their present neighbors and jennie could find something to do so she stayed at home chapter xii bass was no sooner in cleveland than the marvel of that growing city was sufficient to completely restore his equanimity of soul and to stir up new illusions as to the possibility of rehabilitation for himself and his family if only they could come here he thought if only they could all get work and do right here was no evidence of any of their recent troubles no acquaintances who could suggest by their mere presence the troubles of the past all was business all activity the very turning of the corner seemed to rid one of old times and crimes it was as if a new world existed in every block he soon found a place in a cigar store and after working a few weeks he began to write home the cheering ideas he had in mind jennie ought to come as soon as she was able and then if she found something to do the others might follow there was plenty of work for girls of her age she could live in the same house with him temporarily or maybe they could take one of the fifteendollaramonth cottages that were for rent there were big general furnishing houses where one could buy everything needful for a small house on very easy monthly terms his mother could come and keep house for them they would be in a clean new atmosphere unknown and untalked about they could start life all over again they could be decent honorable prosperous filled with this hope and the glamor which new scenes and new environment invariably throw over the unsophisticated mind he wrote a final letter in which he suggested that jennie should come at once this was when the baby was six months old there were theaters here he said and beautiful streets vessels from the lakes came into the heart of the city it was a wonderful city and growing very fast it was thus that the new life appealed to him the effect which all this had upon mrs gerhardt jennie and the rest of the family was phenomenal mrs gerhardt long weighed upon by the misery which jennies error had entailed was for taking measures for carrying out this plan at once so buoyant was her natural temperament that she was completely carried away by the glory of cleveland and already saw fulfilled therein not only her own desires for a nice home but the prosperous advancement of her children of course they could get work she said bass was right she had always wanted gerhardt to go to some large city but he would not now it was necessary and they would go and become better off than they ever had been and gerhardt did take this view of the situation in answer to his wifes letter he wrote that it was not advisable for him to leave his place but if bass saw a way for them it might be a good thing to go he was the more ready to acquiesce in the plan for the simple reason that he was half distracted with the worry of supporting the family and of paying the debts already outstanding every week he laid by five dollars out of his salary which he sent in the form of a postal order to mrs gerhardt three dollars he paid for board and fifty cents he kept for spending money church dues a little tobacco and occasionally a glass of beer every week he put a dollar and a half in a little iron bank against a rainy day his room was a bare corner in the topmost loft of the mill to this he would ascend after sitting alone on the doorstep of the mill in this lonely foresaken neighborhood until nine oclock of an evening and here amid the odor of machinery wafted up from the floor below by the light of a single tallow candle he would conclude his solitary day reading his german paper folding his hands and thinking kneeling by an open window in the shadow of the night to say his prayers and silently stretching himself to rest long were the days dreary the prospect still he lifted his hands in utmost faith to god praying that his sins might be forgiven and that he might be vouchsafed a few more years of comfort and of happy family life so the momentous question was finally decided there was the greatest longing and impatience among the children and mrs gerhardt shared their emotions in a suppressed way jennie was to go first as bass had suggested later on they would all follow when the hour came for jennies departure there was great excitement in the household how long you going to be fore you send for us was marthas inquiry several times repeated tell bass to hurry up said the eager george i want to go to cleveland i want to go to cleveland veronica was caught singing to herself listen to her exclaimed george sarcastically aw you hush up was her displeased rejoinder when the final hour came however it required all of jennies strength to go through with the farewells though everything was being done in order to bring them together again under better conditions she could not help feeling depressed her little one now six months old was being left behind the great world was to her one undiscovered bourne it frightened her you mustnt worry ma she found courage enough to say ill be all right ill write you just as soon as i get there it wont be so very long but when it came to bending over her baby for the last time her courage went out like a blown lamp stooping over the cradle in which the little one was resting she looked into its face with passionate motherly yearning is it going to be a good little girl she cooed then she caught it up into her arms and hugging it closely to her neck and bosom she buried her face against its little body mrs gerhardt saw that she was trembling come now she said coaxingly you mustnt carry on so she will be all right with me ill take care of her if youre going to act this way youd better not try to go at all jennie lifted her head her blue eyes wet with tears and handed the little one to her mother i cant help it she said half crying half smiling quickly she kissed her mother and the children then she hurried out as she went down the street with george she looked back and bravely waved her hand mrs gerhardt responded noticing how much more like a woman she looked it had been necessary to invest some of her money in new clothes to wear on the train she had selected a neat readymade suit of brown which fitted her nicely she wore the skirt of this with a white shirtwaist and a sailor hat with a white veil wound around it in such fashion that it could be easily drawn over her face as she went farther and farther away mrs gerhardt followed her lovingly with her glance and when she disappeared from view she said tenderly through her own tears im glad she looked so nice anyhow chapter xiii bass met jennie at the depot in cleveland and talked hopefully of the prospects the first thing is to get work he began while the jingling sounds and the changing odors which the city thrust upon her were confusing and almost benumbing her senses get something to do it doesnt matter what so long as you get something if you dont get more than three or four dollars a week it will pay the rent then with what george can earn when he comes and what pop sends we can get along all right itll be better than being down in that hole he concluded yes said jennie vaguely her mind so hypnotized by the new display of life about her that she could not bring it forcibly to bear upon the topic under discussion i know what you mean ill get something she was much older now in understanding if not in years the ordeal through which she had so recently passed had aroused in her a clearer conception of the responsibilities of life her mother was always in her mind her mother and the children in particular martha and veronica must have a better opportunity to do for themselves than she had had they should be dressed better they ought to be kept longer in school they must have more companionship more opportunity to broaden their lives cleveland like every other growing city at this time was crowded with those who were seeking employment new enterprises were constantly springing up but those who were seeking to fulfil the duties they provided were invariably in excess of the demand a stranger coming to the city might walk into a small position of almost any kind on the very day he arrived and he might as readily wander in search of employment for weeks and even months bass suggested the shops and department stores as a first field in which to inquire the factories and other avenues of employment were to be her second choice dont pass a place though he had cautioned her if you think theres any chance of getting anything to do go right in what must i say asked jennie nervously tell them you want work you dont care what you do to begin with in compliance with this advice jennie set out the very first day and was rewarded by some very chilly experiences wherever she went no one seemed to want any help she applied at the stores the factories the little shops that lined the outlying thoroughfares but was always met by a rebuff as a last resource she turned to housework although she had hoped to avoid that and studying the want columns she selected four which seemed more promising than the others to these she decided to apply one had already been filled when she arrived but the lady who came to the door was so taken by her appearance that she invited her in and questioned her as to her ability i wish you had come a little earlier she said i like you better than i do the girl i have taken leave me your address anyhow jennie went away smiling at her reception she was not quite so youthful looking as she had been before her recent trouble but the thinner cheeks and the slightly deeper eyes added to the pensiveness and delicacy of her countenance she was a model of neatness her clothes all newly cleaned and ironed before leaving home gave her a fresh and inviting appearance there was growth coming to her in the matter of height but already in appearance and intelligence she looked to be a young woman of twenty best of all she was of that naturally sunny disposition which in spite of toil and privation kept her always cheerful any one in need of a servantgirl or house companion would have been delighted to have had her the second place at which she applied was a large residence in euclid avenue it seemed far too imposing for anything she might have to offer in the way of services but having come so far she decided to make the attempt the servant who met her at the door directed her to wait a few moments and finally ushered her into the boudoir of the mistress of the house on the second floor the latter a mrs bracebridge a prepossessing brunette of the conventionally fashionable type had a keen eye for feminine values and was impressed rather favorably with jennie she talked with her a little while and finally decided to try her in the general capacity of maid i will give you four dollars a week and you can sleep here if you wish said mrs bracebridge jennie explained that she was living with her brother and would soon have her family with her oh very well replied her mistress do as you like about that only i expect you to be here promptly she wished her to remain for the day and to begin her duties at once and jennie agreed mrs bracebridge provided her a dainty cap and apron and then spent some little time in instructing her in her duties her principal work would be to wait on her mistress to brush her hair and to help her dress she was also to answer the bell wait on the table if need be and do any other errand which her mistress might indicate mrs bracebridge seemed a little hard and formal to her prospective servant but for all that jennie admired the dash and go and the obvious executive capacity of her employer at eight oclock that evening jennie was dismissed for the day she wondered if she could be of any use in such a household and marveled that she had got along as well as she had her mistress had set her to cleaning her jewelry and boudoir ornaments as an opening task and though she had worked steadily and diligently she had not finished by the time she left she hurried away to her brothers apartment delighted to be able to report that she had found a situation now her mother could come to cleveland now she could have her baby with her now they could really begin that new life which was to be so much better and finer and sweeter than anything they had ever had before at basss suggestion jennie wrote her mother to come at once and a week or so later a suitable house was found and rented mrs gerhardt with the aid of the children packed up the simple belongings of the family including a single vanload of furniture and at the end of a fortnight they were on their way to the new home mrs gerhardt always had had a keen desire for a really comfortable home solid furniture upholstered and trimmed a thick soft carpet of some warm pleasing color plenty of chairs settees pictures a lounge and a piano she had wanted these nice things all her life but her circumstances had never been good enough for her hopes to be realized still she did not despair some day maybe before she died these things would be added to her and she would be happy perhaps her chance was coming now arrived at cleveland this feeling of optimism was encouraged by the sight of jennies cheerful face bass assured her that they would get along all right he took them out to the house and george was shown the way to go back to the depot and have the freight looked after mrs gerhardt had still fifty dollars left out of the money which senator brander had sent to jennie and with this a way of getting a little extra furniture on the instalment plan was provided bass had already paid the first months rent and jennie had spent her evenings for the last few days in washing the windows and floors of this new house and in getting it into a state of perfect cleanliness now when the first night fell they had two new mattresses and comfortables spread upon a clean floor a new lamp purchased from one of the nearby stores a single box borrowed by jennie from a grocery store for cleaning purposes upon which mrs gerhardt could sit and some sausages and bread to stay them until morning they talked and planned for the future until nine oclock came when all but jennie and her mother retired these two talked on the burden of responsibilities resting on the daughter mrs gerhardt had come to feel in a way dependent upon her in the course of a week the entire cottage was in order with a halfdozen pieces of new furniture a new carpet and some necessary kitchen utensils the most disturbing thing was the need of a new cookingstove the cost of which added greatly to the bill the younger children were entered at the public school but it was decided that george must find some employment both jennie and her mother felt the injustice of this keenly but knew no way of preventing the sacrifice we will let him go to school next year if we can said jennie auspiciously as the new life seemed to have begun the closeness with which their expenses were matching their income was an everpresent menace bass originally very generous in his propositions soon announced that he felt four dollars a week for his room and board to be a sufficient contribution from himself jennie gave everything she earned and protested that she did not stand in need of anything so long as the baby was properly taken care of george secured a place as an overgrown cashboy and brought in two dollars and fifty cents a week all of which at first he gladly contributed later on he was allowed the fifty cents for himself as being meet and just gerhardt from his lonely post of labor contributed five dollars by mail always arguing that a little money ought to be saved in order that his honest debts back in columbus might be paid out of this total income of fifteen dollars a week all of these individuals had to be fed and clothed the rent paid coal purchased and the regular monthly instalment of three dollars paid on the outstanding furniture bill of fifty dollars how it was done those comfortable individuals who frequently discuss the social aspects of poverty might well trouble to inform themselves rent coal and light alone consumed the goodly sum of twenty dollars a month food another unfortunately necessary item used up twentyfive more clothes instalments dues occasional items of medicine and the like were met out of the remaining eleven dollars how the ardent imagination of the comfortable reader can guess it was done however and for a time the hopeful members considered that they were doing fairly well during this period the little family presented a picture of honorable and patient toil which was interesting to contemplate every day mrs gerhardt who worked like a servant and who received absolutely no compensation either in clothes amusements or anything else arose in the morning while the others slept and built the fire then she took up the task of getting the breakfast often as she moved about noiselessly in her thin worn slippers cushioned with pieces of newspaper to make them fit she looked in on jennie bass and george wrapped in their heavy slumbers and with that divine sympathy which is born in heaven she wished that they did not need to rise so early or to work so hard sometimes she would pause before touching her beloved jennie gaze at her white face so calm in sleep and lament that life had not dealt more kindly with her then she would lay her hand gently upon her shoulder and whisper jennie jennie until the weary sleeper would wake when they arose breakfast was always ready when they returned at night supper was waiting each of the children received a due share of mrs gerhardts attention the little baby was closely looked after by her she protested that she needed neither clothes nor shoes so long as one of the children would run errands for her jennie of all the children fully understood her mother she alone strove with the fullness of a perfect affection to ease her burden ma you let me do this now ma ill tend to that you go sit down ma these were the everyday expressions of the enduring affection that existed between them always there was perfect understanding between jennie and her mother and as the days passed this naturally widened and deepened jennie could not bear to think of her as being always confined to the house daily she thought as she worked of that humble home where her mother was watching and waiting how she longed to give her those comforts which she had always craved chapter xiv the days spent in the employ of the bracebridge household were of a broadening character this great house was a school to jennie not only in the matter of dress and manners but as formulating a theory of existence mrs bracebridge and her husband were the last word in the matter of selfsufficiency taste in the matter of appointments care in the matter of dress good form in the matter of reception entertainment and the various usages of social life now and then apropos of nothing save her own mood mrs bracebridge would indicate her philosophy of life in an epigram life is a battle my dear if you gain anything you will have to fight for it in my judgment it is silly not to take advantage of any aid which will help you to be what you want to be this while applying a faint suggestion of rouge most people are born silly they are exactly what they are capable of being i despise lack of taste it is the worst crime most of these worldlywise counsels were not given directly to jennie she overheard them but to her quiet and reflective mind they had their import like seeds fallen upon good ground they took root and grew she began to get a faint perception of hierarchies and powers they were not for her perhaps but they were in the world and if fortune were kind one might better ones state she worked on wondering however just how better fortune might come to her who would have her to wife knowing her history how could she ever explain the existence of her child her child her child the one transcendent gripping theme of joy and fear if she could only do something for it sometime somehow for the first winter things went smoothly enough by the closest economy the children were clothed and kept in school the rent paid and the instalments met once it looked as though there might be some difficulty about the continuance of the home life and that was when gerhardt wrote that he would be home for christmas the mill was to close down for a short period at that time he was naturally anxious to see what the new life of his family at cleveland was like mrs gerhardt would have welcomed his return with unalloyed pleasure had it not been for the fear she entertained of his creating a scene jennie talked it over with her mother and mrs gerhardt in turn spoke of it to bass whose advice was to brave it out dont worry he said he wont do anything about it ill talk to him if he says anything the scene did occur but it was not so unpleasant as mrs gerhardt had feared gerhardt came home during the afternoon while bass jennie and george were at work two of the younger children went to the train to meet him when he entered mrs gerhardt greeted him affectionately but she trembled for the discovery which was sure to come her suspense was not for long gerhardt opened the front bedroom door only a few minutes after he arrived on the white counterpane of the bed was a pretty child sleeping he could not but know on the instant whose it was but he pretended ignorance whose child is that he questioned its jennies said mrs gerhardt weakly when did that come here not so very long ago answered the mother nervously i guess she is here too he declared contemptuously refusing to pronounce her name a fact which he had already anticipated shes working in a family returned his wife in a pleading tone shes doing so well now she had no place to go let her alone gerhardt had received a light since he had been away certain inexplicable thoughts and feelings had come to him in his religious meditations in his prayers he had admitted to the allseeing that he might have done differently by his daughter yet he could not make up his mind how to treat her for the future she had committed a great sin it was impossible to get away from that when jennie came home that night a meeting was unavoidable gerhardt saw her coming and pretended to be deeply engaged in a newspaper mrs gerhardt who had begged him not to ignore jennie entirely trembled for fear he would say or do something which would hurt her feelings she is coming now she said crossing to the door of the front room where he was sitting but gerhardt refused to look up speak to her anyhow was her last appeal before the door opened but he made no reply when jennie came in her mother whispered he is in the front room jennie paled put her thumb to her lip and stood irresolute not knowing how to meet the situation has he seen jennie paused as she realized from her mothers face and nod that gerhardt knew of the childs existence go ahead said mrs gerhardt its all right he wont say anything jennie finally went to the door and seeing her father his brow wrinkled as if in serious but not unkindly thought she hesitated but made her way forward papa she said unable to formulate a definite sentence gerhardt looked up his grayishbrown eyes a study under their heavy sandy lashes at the sight of his daughter he weakened internally but with the selfadjusted armor of resolve about him he showed no sign of pleasure at seeing her all the forces of his conventional understanding of morality and his naturally sympathetic and fatherly disposition were battling within him but as in so many cases where the average mind is concerned convention was temporarily the victor yes he said wont you forgive me papa i do he returned grimly she hesitated a moment and then stepped forward for what purpose he well understood there he said pushing her gently away as her lips barely touched his grizzled cheek it had been a frigid meeting when jennie went out into the kitchen after this very trying ordeal she lifted her eyes to her waiting mother and tried to make it seem as though all had been well but her emotional disposition got the better of her did he make up to you her mother was about to ask but the words were only half out of her mouth before her daughter sank down into one of the chairs close to the kitchen table and laying her head on her arm burst forth into soft convulsive inaudible sobs now now said mrs gerhardt there now dont cry what did he say it was some time before jennie recovered herself sufficiently to answer her mother tried to treat the situation lightly i wouldnt feel bad she said hell get over it its his way chapter xv the return of gerhardt brought forward the child question in all its bearings he could not help considering it from the standpoint of a grandparent particularly since it was a human being possessed of a soul he wondered if it had been baptized then he inquired no not yet said his wife who had not forgotten this duty but had been uncertain whether the little one would be welcome in the faith no of course not sneered gerhardt whose opinion of his wifes religious devotion was not any too great such carelessness such irreligion that is a fine thing he thought it over a few moments and felt that this evil should be corrected at once it should be baptized he said why dont she take it and have it baptized mrs gerhardt reminded him that some one would have to stand godfather to the child and there was no way to have the ceremony performed without confessing the fact that it was without a legitimate father gerhardt listened to this and it quieted him for a few moments but his religion was something which he could not see put in the background by any such difficulty how would the lord look upon quibbling like this it was not christian and it was his duty to attend to the matter it must be taken forthwith to the church jennie himself and his wife accompanying it as sponsors or if he did not choose to condescend thus far to his daughter he must see that it was baptized when she was not present he brooded over this difficulty and finally decided that the ceremony should take place on one of these weekdays between christmas and new years when jennie would be at her work this proposal he broached to his wife and receiving her approval he made his next announcement it has no name he said jennie and her mother had talked over this very matter and jennie had expressed a preference for vesta now her mother made bold to suggest it as her own choice how would vesta do gerhardt heard this with indifference secretly he had settled the question in his own mind he had a name in store left over from the halcyon period of his youth and never opportunely available in the case of his own children wilhelmina of course he had no idea of unbending in the least toward his small granddaughter he merely liked the name and the child ought to be grateful to get it with a faroff gingery air he brought forward this first offering upon the altar of natural affection for offering it was after all that is nice he said forgetting his indifference but how would wilhelmina do mrs gerhardt did not dare cross him when he was thus unconsciously weakening her womans tact came to the rescue we might give her both names she compromised it makes no difference to me he replied drawing back into the shell of opposition from which he had been inadvertently drawn just so she is baptized jennie heard of this with pleasure for she was anxious that the child should have every advantage religious or otherwise that it was possible to obtain she took great pains to starch and iron the clothes it was to wear on the appointed day gerhardt sought out the minister of the nearest lutheran church a roundheaded thickset theologian of the most formal type to whom he stated his errand your grandchild inquired the minister yes said gerhardt her father is not here so replied the minister looking at him curiously gerhardt was not to be disturbed in his purpose he explained that he and his wife would bring her the minister realizing the probable difficulty did not question him further the church cannot refuse to baptize her so long as you as grandparent are willing to stand sponsor for her he said gerhardt came away hurt by the shadow of disgrace in which he felt himself involved but satisfied that he had done his duty now he would take the child and have it baptized and when that was over his present responsibility would cease when it came to the hour of the baptism however he found that another influence was working to guide him into greater interest and responsibility the stern religion with which he was enraptured its insistence upon a higher law was there and he heard again the precepts which had helped to bind him to his own children is it your intention to educate this child in the knowledge and love of the gospel asked the blackgowned minister as they stood before him in the silent little church whither they had brought the infant he was reading from the form provided for such occasions gerhardt answered yes and mrs gerhardt added her affirmative do you engage to use all necessary care and diligence by prayerful instruction admonition example and discipline that this child may renounce and avoid everything that is evil and that she may keep gods will and commandments as declared in his sacred word a thought flashed through gerhardts mind as the words were uttered of how it had fared with his own children they too had been thus sponsored they too had heard his solemn pledge to care for their spiritual welfare he was silent we do prompted the minister we do repeated gerhardt and his wife weakly do you now dedicate this child by the rite of baptism unto the lord who brought it we do and finally if you can conscientiously declare before god that the faith to which you have assented is your faith and that the solemn promises you have made are the serious resolutions of your heart please to announce the same in the presence of god by saying yes yes they replied i baptize thee wilhelmina vesta concluded the minister stretching out his hand over her in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost let us pray gerhardt bent his gray head and followed with humble reverence the beautiful invocation which followed almighty and everlasting god we adore thee as the great parent of the children of men as the father of our spirits and the former of our bodies we praise thee for giving existence to this infant and for preserving her until this day we bless thee that she is called to virtue and glory that she has now been dedicated to thee and brought withinthe pale of the christian church we thank thee that by the gospel of the son she is furnished with everything necessary to her spiritual happiness that it supplies light for her mind and comfort for her heart encouragement and power to discharge her duty and the precious hope of mercy and immortality to sustain and make her faithful and we beseech thee o most merciful god that this child may be enlightened and sanctified from her early years by the holy spirit and be everlastingly saved by thy mercy direct and bless thy servants who are intrusted with the care of her in the momentous work of her education inspire them with just conception of the absolute necessity of religious instruction and principles forbid that they should ever forget that this offspring belongs to thee and that if through their criminal neglect or bad example thy reasonable creature be lost thou wilt require it at their hands give them a deep sense of the divinity of her nature of the worth of her soul of the dangers to which she will be exposed of the honor and felicity to which she is capable of ascending with thy blessing and of the ruin in this world and the misery in the world to come which springs from wicked passion and conduct give them grace to check the first risings of forbidden inclinations in her breast to be her defense against the temptations incident to childhood and youth and as she grows up to enlarge her understanding and to lead her to an acquaintance with thee and with jesus christ whom thou hast sent give them grace to cultivate in her heart a supreme reverence and love for thee a grateful attachment to the gospel of thy son her saviour a due regard for all its ordinances and institutions a temper of kindness and goodwill to all mankind and an invincible love of sincerity and truth help them to watch continually over her with tender solicitude to be studious that by their conversation and deportment her heart may not be corrupted and at all times to set before her such an example that she may safely tread in their footsteps if it please thee to prolong her days on earth grant that she may prove an honor and a comfort to her parents and friends be useful in the world and find in thy providence an unfailing defense and support whether she live let her live to thee or whether she die let her die to thee and at the great day of account may she and her parents meet each other with rapture and rejoice together in thy redeeming love through jesus christ forever and ever amen as this solemn admonition was read a feeling of obligation descended upon the grandfather of this little outcast a feeling that he was bound to give the tiny creature lying on his wifes arm the care and attention which god in his sacrament had commanded he bowed his head in utmost reverence and when the service was concluded and they left the silent church he was without words to express his feelings religion was a consuming thing with him god was a person a dominant reality religion was not a thing of mere words or of interesting ideas to be listened to on sunday but a strong vital expression of the divine will handed down from a time when men were in personal contact with god its fulfilment was a matter of joy and salvation with him the one consolation of a creature sent to wander in a vale whose explanation was not here but in heaven slowly gerhardt walked on and as he brooded on the words and the duties which the sacrament involved the shade of lingering disgust that had possessed him when he had taken the child to church disappeared and a feeling of natural affection took its place however much the daughter had sinned the infant was not to blame it was a helpless puling tender thing demanding his sympathy and his love gerhardt felt his heart go out to the little child and yet he could not yield his position all in a moment that is a nice man he said of the minister to his wife as they walked along rapidly softening in his conception of his duty yes he was agreed mrs gerhardt timidly its a goodsized little church he continued yes gerhardt looked around him at the street the houses the show of brisk life on this sunshiny winters day and then finally at the child that his wife was carrying she must be heavy he said in his characteristic german let me take her mrs gerhardt who was rather weary did not refuse there he said as he looked at her and then fixed her comfortably upon his shoulder let us hope she proves worthy of all that has been done today mrs gerhardt listened and the meaning in his voice interpreted itself plainly enough the presence of the child in the house might be the cause of recurring spells of depression and unkind words but there would be another and greater influence restraining him there would always be her soul to consider he would never again be utterly unconscious of her soul chapter xvi during the remainder of gerhardts stay he was shy in jennies presence and endeavored to act as though he were unconscious of her existence when the time came for parting he even went away without bidding her goodby telling his wife she might do that for him but after he was actually on his way back to youngstown he regretted the omission i might have bade her goodby he thought to himself as the train rumbled heavily along but it was too late for the time being the affairs of the gerhardt family drifted jennie continued her work with mrs bracebridge sebastian fixed himself firmly in his clerkship in the cigar store george was promoted to the noble sum of three dollars and then threefifty it was a narrow humdrum life the family led coal groceries shoes and clothing were the uppermost topics of their conversation every one felt the stress and strain of trying to make ends meet that which worried jennie most and there were many things which weighed upon her sensitive soul was the outcome of her own life not so much for herself as for her baby and the family she could not really see where she fitted in who would have me she asked herself over and over how was she to dispose of vesta in the event of a new love affair such a contingency was quite possible she was young goodlooking and men were inclined to flirt with her or rather to attempt it the bracebridges entertained many masculine guests and some of them had made unpleasant overtures to her my dear youre a very pretty girl said one old rake of fiftyodd when she knocked at his door one morning to give him a message from his hostess i beg your pardon she said confusedly and colored indeed youre quite sweet and you neednt beg my pardon id like to talk to you some time he attempted to chuck her under the chin but jennie hurried away she would have reported the matter to her mistress but a nervous shame deterred her why would men always be doing this she thought could it be because there was something innately bad about her an inward corruption that attracted its like it is a curious characteristic of the nondefensive disposition that it is like a honeyjar to flies nothing is brought to it and much is taken away around a soft yielding unselfish disposition men swarm naturally they sense this generosity this nonprotective attitude from afar a girl like jennie is like a comfortable fire to the average masculine mind they gravitate to it seek its sympathy yearn to possess it hence she was annoyed by many unwelcome attentions one day there arrived from cincinnati a certain lester kane the son of a wholesale carriage builder of great trade distinction in that city and elsewhere throughout the country who was wont to visit this house frequently in a social way he was a friend of mrs bracebridge more than of her husband for the former had been raised in cincinnati and as a girl had visited at his fathers house she knew his mother his brother and sisters and to all intents and purposes socially had always been considered one of the family lesters coming tomorrow henry jennie heard mrs bracebridge tell her husband i had a wire from him this noon hes such a scamp im going to give him the big east front room upstairs be sociable and pay him some attention his father was so good to me i know it said her husband calmly i like lester hes the biggest one in that family but hes too indifferent he doesnt care enough i know but hes so nice i do think hes one of the nicest men i ever knew ill be decent to him dont i always do pretty well by your people yes pretty well oh i dont know about that he replied dryly when this notable person arrived jennie was prepared to see some one of more than ordinary importance and she was not disappointed there came into the receptionhall to greet her mistress a man of perhaps thirtysix years of age above the medium in height cleareyed firmjawed athletic direct and vigorous he had a deep resonant voice that carried clearly everywhere people somehow used to stop and listen whether they knew him or not he was simple and abrupt in his speech oh there you are he began im glad to see you again hows mr bracebridge hows fannie he asked his questions forcefully wholeheartedly and his hostess answered with an equal warmth im glad to see you lester she said george will take your things upstairs come up into my room its more comfy how are grandpa and louise he followed her up the stairs and jennie who had been standing at the head of the stairs listening felt the magnetic charm of his personality it seemed why she could hardly say that a real personage had arrived the house was cheerier the attitude of her mistress was much more complaisant everybody seemed to feel that something must be done for this man jennie went about her work but the impression persisted his name ran in her mind lester kane and he was from cincinnati she looked at him now and then on the sly and felt for the first time in her life an interest in a man on his own account he was so big so handsome so forceful she wondered what his business was at the same time she felt a little dread of him once she caught him looking at her with a steady incisive stare she quailed inwardly and took the first opportunity to get out of his presence another time he tried to address a few remarks to her but she pretended that her duties called her away she knew that often his eyes were on her when her back was turned and it made her nervous she wanted to run away from him although there was no very definite reason why she should do so as a matter of fact this man so superior to jennie in wealth education and social position felt an instinctive interest in her unusual personality like the others he was attracted by the peculiar softness of her disposition and her preeminent femininity there was that about her which suggested the luxury of love he felt as if somehow she could be reached why he could not have said she did not bear any outward marks of her previous experience there were no evidences of coquetry about her but still he felt that he might he was inclined to make the venture on his first visit but business called him away he left after four days and was absent from cleveland for three weeks jennie thought he was gone for good and she experienced a queer sense of relief as well as of regret then suddenly he returned he came apparently unexpectedly explaining to mrs bracebridge that business interests again demanded his presence in cleveland as he spoke he looked at jennie sharply and she felt as if somehow his presence might also concern her a little on this second visit she had various opportunities of seeing him at breakfast where she sometimes served at dinner when she could see the guests at the table from the parlor or sittingroom and at odd times when he came to mrs bracebridges boudoir to talk things over they were very friendly why dont you settle down lester and get married jennie heard her say to him the second day he was there you know its time i know he replied but im in no mood for that i want to browse around a little while yet yes i know about your browsing you ought to be ashamed of yourself your father is really worried he chuckled amusedly father doesnt worry much about me he has got all he can attend to to look after the business jennie looked at him curiously she scarcely understood what she was thinking but this man drew her if she had realized in what way she would have fled his presence then and there now he was more insistent in his observation of her addressed an occasional remark to her engaged her in brief magnetic conversations she could not help answering him he was pleasing to her once he came across her in the hall on the second floor searching in a locker for some linen they were all alone mrs bracebridge having gone out to do some morning shopping and the other servants being below stairs on this occasion he made short work of the business he approached her in a commanding unhesitating and thoroughly determined way i want to talk to you he said where do you live i i she stammered and blanched perceptibly i live out on lorrie street what number he questioned as though she were compelled to tell him she quailed and shook inwardly thirteen fourteen she replied mechanically he looked into her big softblue eyes with his dark vigorous brown ones a flash that was hypnotic significant insistent passed between them you belong to me he said ive been looking for you when can i see you oh you mustnt she said her fingers going nervously to her lips i cant see you i i oh i mustnt mustnt i look here he took her arm and drew her slightly closer you and i might as well understand each other right now i like you do you like me say she looked at him her eyes wide filled with wonder with fear with a growing terror i dont know she gasped her lips dry do you he fixed her grimly firmly with his eyes i dont know look at me he said yes she replied he pulled her to him quickly ill talk to you later he said and put his lips masterfully to hers she was horrified stunned like a bird in the grasp of a cat but through it all something tremendously vital and insistent was speaking to her he released her with a short laugh we wont do any more of this here but remember you belong to me he said as he turned and walked nonchalantly down the hall jennie in sheer panic ran to her mistresss room and locked the door behind her chapter xvii the shock of this sudden encounter was so great to jennie that she was hours in recovering herself at first she did not understand clearly just what had happened out of clear sky as it were this astonishing thing had taken place she had yielded herself to another man why why she asked herself and yet within her own consciousness there was an answer though she could not explain her own emotions she belonged to him temperamentally and he belonged to her there is a fate in love and a fate in fight this strong intellectual bear of a man son of a wealthy manufacturer stationed so far as material conditions were concerned in a world immensely superior to that in which jennie moved was nevertheless instinctively magnetically and chemically drawn to this poor servingmaid she was his natural affinity though he did not know it the one woman who answered somehow the biggest need of his nature lester kane had known all sorts of women rich and poor the highly bred maidens of his own class the daughters of the proletariat but he had never yet found one who seemed to combine for him the traits of an ideal woman sympathy kindliness of judgment youth and beauty yet this ideal remained fixedly seated in the back of his brain when the right woman appeared he intended to take her he had the notion that for purposes of marriage he ought perhaps to find this woman on his own plane for purposes of temporary happiness he might take her from anywhere leaving marriage of course out of the question he had no idea of making anything like a serious proposal to a servantgirl but jennie was different he had never seen a servant quite like her and she was ladylike and lovely without appearing to know it why this girl was a rare flower why shouldnt he try to seize her let us be just to lester kane let us try to understand him and his position not every mind is to be estimated by the weight of a single folly not every personality is to be judged by the drag of a single passion we live in an age in which the impact of materialized forces is wellnigh irresistible the spiritual nature is overwhelmed by the shock the tremendous and complicated development of our material civilization the multiplicity and variety of our social forms the depth subtlety and sophistry of our imaginative impressions gathered remultiplied and disseminated by such agencies as the railroad the express and the postoffice the telephone the telegraph the newspaper and in short the whole machinery of social intercourse these elements of existence combine to produce what may be termed a kaleidoscopic glitter a dazzling and confusing phantasmagoria of life that wearies and stultifies the mental and moral nature it induces a sort of intellectual fatigue through which we see the ranks of the victims of insomnia melancholia and insanity constantly recruited our modern brainpan does not seem capable as yet of receiving sorting and storing the vast army of facts and impressions which present themselves daily the white light of publicity is too white we are weighed upon by too many things it is as if the wisdom of the infinite were struggling to beat itself into finite and cupbig minds lester kane was the natural product of these untoward conditions his was a naturally observing mind rabelaisian in its strength and tendencies but confused by the multiplicity of things the vastness of the panorama of life the glitter of its details the unsubstantial nature of its forms the uncertainty of their justification born a catholic he was no longer a believer in the divine inspiration of catholicism raised a member of the social elect he had ceased to accept the fetish that birth and station presuppose any innate superiority brought up as the heir to a comfortable fortune and expected to marry in his own sphere he was by no means sure that he wanted marriage on any terms of course the conjugal state was an institution it was established yes certainly but what of it the whole nation believed in it true but other nations believed in polygamy there were other questions that bothered him such questions as the belief in a single deity or ruler of the universe and whether a republican monarchial or aristocratic form of government were best in short the whole body of things material social and spiritual had come under the knife of his mental surgery and been left but half dissected life was not proved to him not a single idea of his unless it were the need of being honest was finally settled in all other things he wavered questioned procrastinated leaving to time and to the powers back of the universe the solution of the problems that vexed him yes lester kane was the natural product of a combination of elements religious commercial social modified by that pervading atmosphere of liberty in our national life which is productive of almost uncounted freedom of thought and action thirtysix years of age and apparently a man of vigorous aggressive and sound personality he was nevertheless an essentially animalman pleasantly veneered by education and environment like the hundreds of thousands of irishmen who in his fathers day had worked on the railroad tracks dug in the mines picked and shoveled in the ditches and carried up bricks and mortar on the endless structures of a new land he was strong hairy axiomatic and witty do you want me to come back here next year he had asked of brother ambrose when in his seventeenth year that ecclesiastical member was about to chastise him for some schoolboy misdemeanor the other stared at him in astonishment your father will have to look after that he replied well my father wont look after it lester returned if you touch me with that whip ill take things into my own hands im not committing any punishable offenses and im not going to be knocked around any more words unfortunately did not avail in this case but a good vigorous irishamerican wrestle did in which the whip was broken and the discipline of the school so far impaired that he was compelled to take his clothes and leave after that he looked his father in the eye and told him that he was not going to school any more im perfectly willing to jump in and work he explained theres nothing in a classical education for me let me go into the office and i guess ill pick up enough to carry me through old archibald kane keen singleminded of unsullied commercial honor admired his sons determination and did not attempt to coerce him come down to the office he said perhaps there is something you can do entering upon a business life at the age of eighteen lester had worked faithfully rising in his fathers estimation until now he had come to be in a way his personal representative whenever there was a contract to be entered upon an important move to be decided or a representative of the manufactory to be sent anywhere to consummate a deal lester was the agent selected his father trusted him implicitly and so diplomatic and earnest was he in the fulfilment of his duties that this trust had never been impaired business is business was a favorite axiom with him and the very tone in which he pronounced the words was a reflex of his character and personality there were molten forces in him flames which burst forth now and then in spite of the fact that he was sure that he had them under control one of these impulses was a taste for liquor of which he was perfectly sure he had the upper hand he drank but very little he thought and only in a social way among friends never to excess another weakness lay in his sensual nature but here again he believed that he was the master if he chose to have irregular relations with women he was capable of deciding where the danger point lay if men were only guided by a sense of the brevity inherent in all such relationships there would not be so many troublesome consequences growing out of them finally he flattered himself that he had a grasp upon a right method of living a method which was nothing more than a quiet acceptance of social conditions as they were tempered by a little personal judgment as to the right and wrong of individual conduct not to fuss and fume not to cry out about anything not to be mawkishly sentimental to be vigorous and sustain your personality intact such was his theory of life and he was satisfied that it was a good one as to jennie his original object in approaching her had been purely selfish but now that he had asserted his masculine prerogatives and she had yielded at least in part he began to realize that she was no common girl no toy of the passing hour there is a time in some mens lives when they unconsciously begin to view feminine youth and beauty not so much in relation to the ideal of happiness but rather with regard to the social conventions by which they are environed must it be they ask themselves in speculating concerning the possibility of taking a maiden to wife that i shall be compelled to swallow the whole social code make a covenant with society sign a pledge of abstinence and give to another a life interest in all my affairs when i know too well that i am but taking to my arms a variable creature like myself whose wishes are apt to become insistent and burdensome in proportion to the decrease of her beauty and interest these are the men who unwilling to risk the manifold contingencies of an authorized connection are led to consider the advantages of a lessbinding union a temporary companionship they seek to seize the happiness of life without paying the cost of their indulgence later on they think the more definite and conventional relationship may be established without reproach or the necessity of radical readjustment lester kane was past the youthful love period and he knew it the innocence and unsophistication of younger ideals had gone he wanted the comfort of feminine companionship but he was more and more disinclined to give up his personal liberty in order to obtain it he would not wear the social shackles if it were possible to satisfy the needs of his heart and nature and still remain free and unfettered of course he must find the right woman and in jennie he believed that he had discovered her she appealed to him on every side he had never known anybody quite like her marriage was not only impossible but unnecessary he had only to say come and she must obey it was her destiny lester thought the matter over calmly dispassionately he strolled out to the shabby street where she lived he looked at the humble roof that sheltered her her poverty her narrow and straitened environment touched his heart ought he not to treat her generously fairly honorably then the remembrance of her marvelous beauty swept over him and changed his mood no he must possess her if he could today quickly as soon as possible it was in that frame of mind that he returned to mrs bracebridges home from his visit to lorrie street chapter xviii jennie was now going through the agony of one who has a varied and complicated problem to confront her baby her father her brothers and sisters all rose up to confront her what was this thing that she was doing was she allowing herself to slip into another wretched unsanctified relationship how was she to explain to her family about this man he would not marry her that was sure if he knew all about her he would not marry her anyhow a man of his station and position yet here she was parleying with him what ought she to do she pondered over the problem until evening deciding first that it was best to run away but remembering painfully that she had told him where she lived then she resolved that she would summon up her courage and refuse him tell him she couldnt wouldnt have anything to do with him this last solution of the difficulty seemed simple enough in his absence and she would find work where he could not follow her up so easily it all seemed simple enough as she put on her things in the evening to go home her aggressive lover however was not without his own conclusion in this matter since leaving jennie he had thought concisely and to the point he came to the decision that he must act at once she might tell her family she might tell mrs bracebridge she might leave the city he wanted to know more of the conditions which surrounded her and there was only one way to do that talk to her he must persuade her to come and live with him she would he thought she admitted that she liked him that soft yielding note in her character which had originally attracted him seemed to presage that he could win her without much difficulty if he wished to try he decided to do so anyhow for truly he desired her greatly at halfpast five he returned to the bracebridge home to see if she were still there at six he had an opportunity to say to her unobserved i am going to walk home with you wait for me at the next corner will you yes she said a sense of compulsion to do his bidding seizing her she explained to herself afterward that she ought to talk to him that she must tell him finally of her decision not to see him again and this was as good an opportunity as any at halfpast six he left the house on a pretext a forgotten engagement and a little after seven he was waiting for her in a closed carriage near the appointed spot he was calm absolutely satisfied as to the result and curiously elated beneath a sturdy shockproof exterior it was as if he breathed some fragrant perfume soft grateful entrancing a few minutes after eight he saw jennie coming along the flare of the gaslamp was not strong but it gave sufficient light for his eyes to make her out a wave of sympathy passed over him for there was a great appeal in her personality he stepped out as she neared the corner and confronted her come he said and get in this carriage with me ill take you home no she replied i dont think i ought to come with me ill take you home its a better way to talk once more that sense of dominance on his part that power of compulsion she yielded feeling all the time that she should not he called out to the cabman anywhere for a little while when she was seated beside him he began at once listen to me jennie i want you tell me something about yourself i have to talk to you she replied trying to stick to her original line of defense about what he inquired seeking to fathom her expression in the half light i cant go on this way she murmured nervously i cant act this way you dont know how it all is i shouldnt have done what i did this morning i mustnt see you any more really i mustnt you didnt do what you did this morning he remarked paradoxically seizing on that one particular expression i did that and as for seeing me any more im going to see you he seized her hand you dont know me but i like you im crazy about you thats all you belong to me now listen im going to have you are you going to come to me no no no she replied in an agonized voice i cant do anything like that mr kane please listen to me it cant be you dont know oh you dont know i cant do what you want i dont want to i couldnt even if i wanted to you dont know how things are but i dont want to do anything wrong i mustnt i cant i wont oh no no no please let me go home he listened to this troubled feverish outburst with sympathy with even a little pity what do you mean by you cant he asked curiously oh i cant tell you she replied please dont ask me you oughtnt to know but i mustnt see you any more it wont do any good but you like me he retorted oh yes yes i do i cant help that but you mustnt come near me any more please dont he turned his proposition over in his mind with the solemnity of a judge he knew that this girl liked him loved him really brief as their contact had been and he was drawn to her perhaps not irrevocably but with exceeding strength what prevented her from yielding especially since she wanted to he was curious see here jennie he replied i hear what you say i dont know what you mean by cant if you want to you say you like me why cant you come to me youre my sort we will get along beautifully together youre suited to me temperamentally id like to have you with me what makes you say you cant come i cant she replied i cant i dont want to i oughtnt oh please dont ask me any more you dont know i cant tell you why she was thinking of her baby the man had a keen sense of justice and fair play above all things he wanted to be decent in his treatment of people in this case he intended to be tender and considerate and yet he must win her he turned this over in his mind listen to me he said finally still holding her hand i may not want you to do anything immediately i want you to think it over but you belong to me you say you care for me you admitted that this morning i know you do now why should you stand out against me i like you and i can do a lot of things for you why not let us be good friends now then we can talk the rest of this over later but i mustnt do anything wrong she insisted i dont want to please dont come near me any more i cant do what you want now look here he said you dont mean that why did you say you liked me have you changed your mind look at me she had lowered her eyes look at me you havent have you oh no no no she half sobbed swept by some force beyond her control well then why stand out against me i love you i tell you im crazy about you thats why i came back this time it was to see you was it asked jennie surprised yes it was and i would have come again and again if necessary i tell you im crazy about you ive got to have you now tell me youll come with me no no no she pleaded i cant i must work i want to work i dont want to do anything wrong please dont ask me you mustnt you must let me go really you must i cant do what you want tell me jennie he said changing the subject what does your father do hes a glassblower here in cleveland no he works in youngstown is your mother alive yes sir you live with her yes sir he smiled at the sir dont say sir to me sweet he pleaded in his gruff way and dont insist on the mr kane im not mister to you any more you belong to me little girl me and he pulled her close to him please dont mr kane she pleaded oh please dont i cant i cant you mustnt but he sealed her lips with his own listen to me jennie he repeated using his favorite expression i tell you you belong to me i like you better every moment i havent had a chance to know you im not going to give you up youve got to come to me eventually and im not going to have you working as a ladys maid you cant stay in that place except for a little while im going to take you somewhere else and im going to leave you some money do you hear you have to take it at the word money she quailed and withdrew her hand no no no she repeated no i wont take it yes you will give it to your mother im not trying to buy you i know what you think but im not i want to help you i want to help your family i know where you live i saw the place today how many are there of you six she answered faintly the families of the poor he thought well you take this from me he insisted drawing a purse from his coat and ill see you very soon again theres no escape sweet no no she protested i wont i dont need it no you mustnt ask me he insisted further but she was firm and finally he put the money away one thing is sure jennie youre not going to escape me he said soberly youll have to come to me eventually dont you know you will your own attitude shows that im not going to leave you alone oh if you knew the trouble youre causing me im not causing you any real trouble am i he asked surely not yes i can never do what you want you will you will he exclaimed eagerly the bare thought of this prize escaping him heightening his passion youll come to me and he drew her close in spite of all her protests there he said when after the struggle that mystic something between them spoke again and she relaxed tears were in her eyes but he did not see them dont you see how it is you like me too i cant she repeated with a sob her evident distress touched him youre not crying little girl are you he asked she made no answer im sorry he went on ill not say anything more tonight were almost at your home im leaving tomorrow but ill see you again yes i will sweet i cant give you up now ill do anything in reason to make it easy for you but i cant do you hear she shook her head heres where you get out he said as the carriage drew up near the corner he could see the evening lamp gleaming behind the gerhardt cottage curtains goodby he said as she stepped out goodby she murmured remember he said this is just the beginning oh no no she pleaded he looked after her as she walked away the beauty he exclaimed jennie stepped into the house weary discouraged ashamed what had she done there was no denying that she had compromised herself irretrievably he would come back he would come back and he had offered her money that was the worst of all chapter xix the inconclusive nature of this interview exciting as it was did not leave any doubt in either lester kanes or jennies mind certainly this was not the end of the affair kane knew that he was deeply fascinated this girl was lovely she was sweeter than he had had any idea of her hesitancy her repeated protests her gentle no no no moved him as music might depend upon it this girl was for him and he would get her she was too sweet to let go what did he care about what his family or the world might think it was curious that kane held the wellfounded idea that in time jennie would yield to him physically as she had already done spiritually just why he could not say something about her a warm womanhood a guileless expression of countenance intimated a sympathy toward sex relationship which had nothing to do with hard brutal immorality she was the kind of a woman who was made for a man one man all her attitude toward sex was bound up with love tenderness service when the one man arrived she would love him and she would go to him that was jennie as lester understood her he felt it she would yield to him because he was the one man on jennies part there was a great sense of complication and of possible disaster if he followed her of course he would learn all she had not told him about brander because she was still under the vague illusion that in the end she might escape when she left him she knew that he would come back she knew in spite of herself that she wanted him to do so yet she felt that she must not yield she must go on leading her straitened humdrum life this was her punishment for having made a mistake she had made her bed and she must lie on it the kane family mansion at cincinnati to which lester returned after leaving jennie was an imposing establishment which contrasted strangely with the gerhardt home it was a great rambling twostory affair done after the manner of the french chateaux but in red brick and brownstone it was set down among flowers and trees in an almost parklike inclosure and its very stones spoke of a splendid dignity and of a refined luxury old archibald kane the father had amassed a tremendous fortune not by grabbing and browbeating and unfair methods but by seeing a big need and filling it early in life he had realized that america was a growing country there was going to be a big demand for vehicles wagons carriages drays and he knew that some one would have to supply them having founded a small wagon industry he had built it up into a great business he made good wagons and he sold them at a good profit it was his theory that most men were honest he believed that at bottom they wanted honest things and if you gave them these they would buy of you and come back and buy again and again until you were an influential and rich man he believed in the measure heaped full and running over all through his life and now in his old age he enjoyed the respect and approval of every one who knew him archibald kane you would hear his competitors say ah there is a fine man shrewd but honest hes a big man this man was the father of two sons and three daughters all healthy all goodlooking all blessed with exceptional minds but none of them so generous and forceful as their longliving and bighearted sire robert the eldest a man forty years of age was his fathers righthand man in financial matters having a certain hard incisiveness which fitted him for the somewhat sordid details of business life he was of medium height of a rather spare build with a high forehead slightly inclined to baldness bright liquidblue eyes an eagle nose and thin firm even lips he was a man of few words rather slow to action and of deep thought he sat close to his father as vicepresident of the big company which occupied two whole blocks in an outlying section of the city he was a strong man a coming man as his father well knew lester the second boy was his fathers favorite he was not by any means the financier that robert was but he had a larger vision of the subtleties that underlie life he was softer more human more goodnatured about everything and strangely enough old archibald admired and trusted him he knew he had the bigger vision perhaps he turned to robert when it was a question of some intricate financial problem but lester was the most loved as a son then there was amy thirtytwo years of age married handsome the mother of one child a boy imogene twentyeight also married but as yet without children and louise twentyfive single the bestlooking of the girls but also the coldest and most critical she was the most eager of all for social distinction the most vigorous of all in her love of family prestige the most desirous that the kane family should outshine every other she was proud to think that the family was so well placed socially and carried herself with an air and a hauteur which was sometimes amusing sometimes irritating to lester he liked her in a way she was his favorite sister but he thought she might take herself with a little less seriousness and not do the family standing any harm mrs kane the mother was a quiet refined woman sixty years of age who having come up from comparative poverty with her husband cared but little for social life but she loved her children and her husband and was naively proud of their position and attainments it was enough for her to shine only in their reflected glory a good woman a good wife and a good mother lester arrived at cincinnati early in the evening and drove at once to his home an old irish servitor met him at the door ah mr lester he began joyously sure im glad to see you back ill take your coat yes yes its been fine weather were having yes yes the familys all well sure your sister amy is just after leavin the house with the boy your mothers upstairs in her room yes yes lester smiled cheerily and went up to his mothers room in this which was done in white and gold and overlooked the garden to the south and east sat mrs kane a subdued graceful quiet woman with smoothly laid gray hair she looked up when the door opened laid down the volume that she had been reading and rose to greet him there you are mother he said putting his arms around her and kissing her how are you oh im just about the same lester how have you been fine i was up with the bracebridges for a few days again i had to stop off in cleveland to see parsons they all asked after you how is minnie just the same she doesnt change any that i can see shes just as interested in entertaining as she ever was shes a bright girl remarked his mother recalling mrs bracebridge as a girl in cincinnati i always liked her shes so sensible she hasnt lost any of that i can tell you replied lester significantly mrs kane smiled and went on to speak of various family happenings imogenes husband was leaving for st louis on some errand roberts wife was sick with a cold old zwingle the yard watchman at the factory who had been with mr kane for over forty years had died her husband was going to the funeral lester listened dutifully albeit a trifle absently lester as he walked down the hall encountered louise smart was the word for her she was dressed in a beaded black silk dress fitting close to her form with a burst of rubies at her throat which contrasted effectively with her dark complexion and black hair her eyes were black and piercing oh there you are lester she exclaimed when did you get in be careful how you kiss me im going out and im all fixed even to the powder on my nose oh you bear lester had gripped her firmly and kissed her soundly she pushed him away with her strong hands i didnt brush much of it off he said you can always dust more on with that puff of yours he passed on to his own room to dress for dinner dressing for dinner was a custom that had been adopted by the kane family in the last few years guests had become so common that in a way it was a necessity and louise in particular made a point of it tonight robert was coming and a mr and mrs burnett old friends of his father and mother and so of course the meal would be a formal one lester knew that his father was around somewhere but he did not trouble to look him up now he was thinking of his last two days in cleveland and wondering when he would see jennie again chapter xx as lester came downstairs after making his toilet he found his father in the library reading hello lester he said looking up from his paper over the top of his glasses and extending his hand where do you come from cleveland replied his son shaking hands heartily and smiling robert tells me youve been to new york yes i was there how did you find my old friend arnold just about the same returned lester he doesnt look any older i suppose not said archibald kane genially as if the report were a compliment to his own hardy condition hes been a temperate man a fine old gentleman he led the way back to the sittingroom where they chatted over business and home news until the chime of the clock in the hall warned the guests upstairs that dinner had been served lester sat down in great comfort amid the splendors of the great louis quinze diningroom he liked this homey home atmosphere his mother and father and his sisters the old family friends so he smiled and was exceedingly genial louise announced that the leverings were going to give a dance on tuesday and inquired whether he intended to go you know i dont dance he returned dryly why should i go dont dance wont dance you mean youre getting too lazy to move if robert is willing to dance occasionally i think you might roberts got it on me in lightness lester replied airily and politeness retorted louise be that as it may said lester dont try to stir up a fight louise observed robert sagely after dinner they adjourned to the library and robert talked with his brother a little on business there were some contracts coming up for revision he wanted to see what suggestions lester had to make louise was going to a party and the carriage was now announced so you are not coming she asked a trifle complainingly too tired said lester lightly make my excuses to mrs knowles letty pace asked about you the other night louise called back from the door kind replied lester im greatly obliged shes a nice girl lester put in his father who was standing near the open fire i only wish you would marry her and settle down youd have a good wife in her shes charming testified mrs kane what is this asked lester jocularly a conspiracy you know im not strong on the matrimonial business and i well know it replied his mother semiseriously i wish you were lester changed the subject he really could not stand for this sort of thing any more he told himself and as he thought his mind wandered back to jennie and her peculiar oh no no there was someone that appealed to him that was a type of womanhood worth while not sophisticated not selfseeking not watched over and set like a mantrap in the path of men but a sweet little girl sweet as a flower who was without anybody apparently to watch over her that night in his room he composed a letter which he dated a week later because he did not want to appear too urgent and because he could not again leave cincinnati for at least two weeks my dear jennie although it has been a week and i have said nothing i have not forgotten you believe me was the impression i gave of myself very bad i will make it better from now on for i love you little girl i really do there is a flower on my table which reminds me of you very much white delicate beautiful your personality lingering with me is just that you are the essence of everything beautiful to me it is in your power to strew flowers in my path if you will but what i want to say here is that i shall be in cleveland on the th and i shall expect to see you i arrive thursday night and i want you to meet me in the ladies parlor of the dornton at noon friday will you you can lunch with me you see i respect your suggestion that i should not call i will not on condition these separations are dangerous to good friendship write me that you will i throw myself on your generosity but i cant take no for an answer not now with a world of affection lester kane he sealed the letter and addressed it shes a remarkable girl in her way he thought she really is chapter xxi the arrival of this letter coming after a week of silence and after she had had a chance to think moved jennie deeply what did she want to do what ought she to do how did she truly feel about this man did she sincerely wish to answer his letter if she did so what should she say heretofore all her movements even the one in which she had sought to sacrifice herself for the sake of bass in columbus had not seemed to involve any one but herself now there seemed to be others to consider her family above all her child the little vesta was now eighteen months of age she was an interesting child her large blue eyes and light hair giving promise of a comeliness which would closely approximate that of her mother while her mential traits indicated a clear and intelligent mind mrs gerhardt had become very fond of her gerhardt had unbended so gradually that his interest was not even yet clearly discernible but he had a distinct feeling of kindliness toward her and this readjustment of her fathers attitude had aroused in jennie an ardent desire to so conduct herself that no pain should ever come to him again any new folly on her part would not only be base ingratitude to her father but would tend to injure the prospects of her little one her life was a failure she fancied but vestas was a thing apart she must do nothing to spoil it she wondered whether it would not be better to write lester and explain everything she had told him that she did not wish to do wrong suppose she went on to inform him that she had a child and beg him to leave her in peace would he obey her she doubted it did she really want him to take her at her word the need of making this confession was a painful thing to jennie it caused her to hesitate to start a letter in which she tried to explain and then to tear it up finally fate intervened in the sudden homecoming of her father who had been seriously injured by an accident at the glassworks in youngstown where he worked it was on a wednesday afternoon in the latter part of august when a letter came from gerhardt but instead of the customary fatherly communication written in german and inclosing the regular weekly remittance of five dollars there was only a brief note written by another hand and explaining that the day before gerhardt had received a severe burn on both hands due to the accidental overturning of a dipper of molten glass the letter added that he would be home the next morning what do you think of that exclaimed william his mouth wide open poor papa said veronica tears welling up in her eyes mrs gerhardt sat down clasped her hands in her lap and stared at the floor now what to do she nervously exclaimed the possibility that gerhardt was disabled for life opened long vistas of difficulties which she had not the courage to contemplate bass came home at halfpast six and jennie at eight the former heard the news with an astonished face gee thats tough isnt it he exclaimed did the letter say how bad he was hurt no replied mrs gerhardt well i wouldnt worry about it said bass easily it wont do any good well get along somehow i wouldnt worry like that if i were you the truth was he wouldnt because his nature was wholly different life did not rest heavily upon his shoulders his brain was not large enough to grasp the significance and weigh the results of things i know said mrs gerhardt endeavoring to recover herself i cant help it though to think that just when we were getting along fairly well this new calamity should be added it seems sometimes as if we were under a curse we have so much bad luck when jennie came her mother turned to her instinctively here was her one stay whats the matter ma asked jennie as she opened the door and observed her mothers face what have you been crying about mrs gerhardt looked at her and then turned half away pas had his hands burned put in bass solemnly hell be home tomorrow jennie turned and stared at him his hands burned she exclaimed yes said bass how did it happen a pot of glass was turned over jennie looked at her mother and her eyes dimmed with tears instinctively she ran to her and put her arms around her now dont you cry ma she said barely able to control herself dont you worry i know how you feel but well get along dont cry now then her own lips lost their evenness and she struggled long before she could pluck up courage to contemplate this new disaster and now without volition upon her part there leaped into her consciousness a new and subtly persistent thought what about lesters offer of assistance now what about his declaration of love somehow it came back to her his affection his personality his desire to help her his sympathy so like that which brander had shown when bass was in jail was she doomed to a second sacrifice did it really make any difference wasnt her life a failure already she thought this over as she looked at her mother sitting there so silent haggard and distraught what a pity she thought that her mother must always suffer wasnt it a shame that she could never have any real happiness i wouldnt feel so badly she said after a time maybe pa isnt burned so badly as we think did the letter say hed be home in the morning yes said mrs gerhardt recovering herself they talked more quietly from now on and gradually as the details were exhausted a kind of dumb peace settled down upon the household one of us ought to go to the train to meet him in the morning said jennie to bass i will i guess mrs bracebridge wont mind no said bass gloomily you mustnt i can go he was sour at this new fling of fate and he looked his feelings he stalked off gloomily to his room and shut himself in jennie and her mother saw the others off to bed and then sat out in the kitchen talking i dont see whats to become of us now said mrs gerhardt at last completely overcome by the financial complications which this new calamity had brought about she looked so weak and helpless that jennie could hardly contain herself dont worry mamma dear she said softly a peculiar resolve coming into her heart the world was wide there was comfort and ease in it scattered by others with a lavish hand surely surely misfortune could not press so sharply but that they could live she sat down with her mother the difficulties of the future seeming to approach with audible and ghastly steps what do you suppose will become of us now repeated her mother who saw how her fanciful conception of this cleveland home had crumbled before her eyes why said jennie who saw clearly and knew what could be done it will be all right i wouldnt worry about it something will happen well get something she realized as she sat there that fate had shifted the burden of the situation to her she must sacrifice herself there was no other way bass met his father at the railway station in the morning he looked very pale and seemed to have suffered a great deal his cheeks were slightly sunken and his bony profile appeared rather gaunt his hands were heavily bandaged and altogether he presented such a picture of distress that many stopped to look at him on the way home from the station by chops he said to bass that was a burn i got i thought once i couldnt stand the pain any longer such pain i had such pain by chops i will never forget it he related just how the accident had occurred and said that he did not know whether he would ever be able to use his hands again the thumb on his right hand and the first two fingers on the left had been burned to the bone the latter had been amputated at the first joint the thumb he might save but his hands would be in danger of being stiff by chops he added just at the time when i needed the money most too bad too bad when they reached the house and mrs gerhardt opened the door the old millworker conscious of her voiceless sympathy began to cry mrs gerhardt sobbed also even bass lost control of himself for a moment or two but quickly recovered the other children wept until bass called a halt on all of them dont cry now he said cheeringly whats the use of crying it isnt so bad as all that youll be all right again we can get along basss words had a soothing effect temporarily and now that her husband was home mrs gerhardt recovered her composure though his hands were bandaged the mere fact that he could walk and was not otherwise injured was some consolation he might recover the use of his hands and be able to undertake light work again anyway they would hope for the best when jennie came home that night she wanted to run to her father and lay the treasury of her services and affection at his feet but she trembled lest he might be as cold to her as formerly gerhardt too was troubled never had he completely recovered from the shame which his daughter had brought upon him although he wanted to be kindly his feelings were so tangled that he hardly knew what to say or do papa said jennie approaching him timidly gerhardt looked confused and tried to say something natural but it was unavailing the thought of his helplessness the knowledge of her sorrow and of his own responsiveness to her affection it was all too much for him he broke down again and cried helplessly forgive me papa she pleaded im so sorry oh im so sorry he did not attempt to look at her but in the swirl of feeling that their meeting created he thought that he could forgive and he did i have prayed he said brokenly it is all right when he recovered himself he felt ashamed of his emotion but a new relationship of sympathy and of understanding had been established from that time although there was always a great reserve between them gerhardt tried not to ignore her completely and she endeavored to show him the simple affection of a daughter just as in the old days but while the household was again at peace there were other cares and burdens to be faced how were they to get along now with five dollars taken from the weekly budget and with the cost of gerhardts presence added bass might have contributed more of his weekly earnings but he did not feel called upon to do it and so the small sum of nine dollars weekly must meet as best it could the current expenses of rent food and coal to say nothing of incidentals which now began to press very heavily gerhardt had to go to a doctor to have his hands dressed daily george needed a new pair of shoes either more money must come from some source or the family must beg for credit and suffer the old tortures of want the situation crystallized the halfformed resolve in jennies mind lesters letter had been left unanswered the day was drawing near should she write he would help them had he not tried to force money on her she finally decided that it was her duty to avail herself of this proffered assistance she sat down and wrote him a brief note she would meet him as he had requested but he would please not come to the house she mailed the letter and then waited with mingled feelings of trepidation and thrilling expectancy the arrival of the fateful day chapter xxii the fatal friday came and jennie stood face to face with this new and overwhelming complication in her modest scheme of existence there was really no alternative she thought her own life was a failure why go on fighting if she could make her family happy if she could give vesta a good education if she could conceal the true nature of this older story and keep vesta in the background perhaps perhaps well rich men had married poor girls before this and lester was very kind he certainly liked her at seven oclock she went to mrs bracebridges at noon she excused herself on the pretext of some work for her mother and left the house for the hotel lester leaving cincinnati a few days earlier than he expected had failed to receive her reply he arrived at cleveland feeling sadly out of tune with the world he had a lingering hope that a letter from jennie might be awaiting him at the hotel but there was no word from her he was a man not easily wrought up but tonight he felt depressed and so went gloomily up to his room and changed his linen after supper he proceeded to drown his dissatisfaction in a game of billiards with some friends from whom he did not part until he had taken very much more than his usual amount of alcoholic stimulant the next morning he arose with a vague idea of abandoning the whole affair but as the hours elapsed and the time of his appointment drew near he decided that it might not be unwise to give her one last chance she might come accordingly when it still lacked a quarter of an hour of the time he went down into the parlor great was his delight when he beheld her sitting in a chair and waiting the outcome of her acquiescence he walked briskly up a satisfied gratified smile on his face so you did come after all he said gazing at her with the look of one who has lost and recovered a prize what do you mean by not writing me i thought from the way you neglected me that you had made up your mind not to come at all i did write she replied where to the address you gave me i wrote three days ago that explains it it came too late you should have written me before how have you been oh all right she replied you dont look it he said you look worried whats the trouble jennie nothing gone wrong out at your house has there it was a fortuitous question he hardly knew why lie had asked it yet it opened the door to what she wanted to say my fathers sick she replied whats happened to him he burned his hands at the glassworks weve been terribly worried it looks as though he would not be able to use them any more she paused looking the distress she felt and he saw plainly that she was facing a crisis thats too bad he said that certainly is when did this happen oh almost three weeks ago now it certainly is bad come in to lunch though i want to talk with you ive been wanting to get a better understanding of your family affairs ever since i left he led the way into the diningroom and selected a secluded table he tried to divert her mind by asking her to order the luncheon but she was too worried and too shy to do so and he had to make out the menu by himself then he turned to her with a cheering air now jennie he said i want you to tell me all about your family i got a little something of it last time but i want to get it straight your father you said was a glassblower by trade now he cant work any more at that thats obvious yes she said how many other children are there six are you the oldest no my brother sebastian is hes twentytwo and what does he do hes a clerk in a cigar store do you know how much he makes i think its twelve dollars she replied thoughtfully and the other children martha and veronica dont do anything yet theyre too young my brother george works at wilsons hes a cashboy he gets three dollars and a half and how much do you make i make four he stopped figuring up mentally just what they had to live on how much rent do you pay he continued twelve dollars how old is your mother shes nearly fifty now he turned a fork in his hands back and forth he was thinking earnestly to tell you the honest truth i fancied it was something like that jennie he said ive been thinking about you a lot now i know theres only one answer to your problem and it isnt such a bad one if youll only believe me he paused for an inquiry but she made none her mind was running on her own difficulties dont you want to know he inquired yes she answered mechanically its me he replied you have to let me help you i wanted to last time now you have to do you hear i thought i wouldnt she said simply i knew what you thought he replied thats all over now im going to tend to that family of yours and ill do it right now while i think of it he drew out his purse and extracted several ten and twentydollar bills two hundred and fifty dollars in all i want you to take this he said its just the beginning i will see that your family is provided for from now on here give me your hand oh no she said not so much dont give me all that yes he replied dont argue here give me your hand she put it out in answer to the summons of his eyes and he shut her fingers on the money pressing them gently at the same time i want you to have it sweet i love you little girl im not going to see you suffer nor any one belonging to you her eyes looked a dumb thankfulness and she bit her lips i dont know how to thank you she said you dont need to he replied the thanks are all the other way believe me he paused and looked at her the beauty of her face holding him she looked at the table wondering what would come next how would you like to leave what youre doing and stay at home he asked that would give you your freedom day times i couldnt do that she replied papa wouldnt allow it he knows i ought to work thats true enough he said but theres so little in what youre doing good heavens four dollars a week i would be glad to give you fifty times that sum if i thought there was any way in which you could use it he idly thrummed the cloth with his fingers i couldnt she said i hardly know how to use this theyll suspect ill have to tell mamma from the way she said it he judged there must be some bond of sympathy between her and her mother which would permit of a confidence such as this he was by no means a hard man and the thought touched him but he would not relinquish his purpose theres only one thing to be done as far as i can see he went on very gently youre not suited for the kind of work youre doing youre too refined i object to it give it up and come with me down to new york ill take good care of you i love you and want you as far as your family is concerned you wont have to worry about them any more you can take a nice home for them and furnish it in any style you please wouldnt you like that he paused and jennies thoughts reverted quickly to her mother her dear mother all her life long mrs gerhardt had been talking of this very thing a nice home if they could just have a larger house with good furniture and a yard filled with trees how happy she would be in such a home she would be free of the care of rent the discomfort of poor furniture the wretchedness of poverty she would be so happy she hesitated there while his keen eye followed her in spirit and he saw what a power he had set in motion it had been a happy inspiration the suggestion of a decent home for the family he waited a few minutes longer and then said well wouldnt you better let me do that it would be very nice she said but it cant be done now i couldnt leave home papa would want to know all about where i was going i wouldnt know what to say why couldnt you pretend that you are going down to new york with mrs bracebridge he suggested there couldnt be any objection to that could there not if they didnt find out she said her eyes opening in amazement but if they should they wont he replied calmly theyre not watching mrs bracebridges affairs plenty of mistresses take their maids on long trips why not simply tell them youre invited to go have to go and then go do you think i could she inquired certainly he replied what is there peculiar about that she thought it over and the plan did seem feasible then she looked at this man and realized that relationship with him meant possible motherhood for her again the tragedy of giving birth to a child ah she could not go through that a second time at least under the same conditions she could not bring herself to tell him about vesta but she must voice this insurmountable objection i she said formulating the first word of her sentence and then stopping yes he said i what i she paused again he loved her shy ways her sweet hesitating lips what is it jennie he asked helpfully youre so delicious cant you tell me her hand was on the table he reached over and laid his strong brown one on top of it i couldnt have a baby she said finally and looked down he gazed at her and the charm of her frankness her innate decency under conditions so anomalous her simple unaffected recognition of the primal facts of life lifted her to a plane in his esteem which she had not occupied until that moment youre a great girl jennie he said youre wonderful but dont worry about that it can be arranged you dont need to have a child unless you want to and i dont want you to he saw the question written in her wondering shamed face its so he said you believe me dont you you think i know dont you yes she faltered well i do but anyway i wouldnt let any trouble come to you ill take you away besides i dont want any children there wouldnt be any satisfaction in that proposition for me at this time id rather wait but there wont be dont worry yes she said faintly not for worlds could she have met his eyes look here jennie he said after a time you care for me dont you you dont think id sit here and plead with you if i didnt care for you im crazy about you and thats the literal truth youre like wine to me i want you to come with me i want you to do it quickly i know how difficult this family business is but you can arrange it come with me down to new york well work out something later ill meet your family well pretend a courtship anything you like only come now you dont mean right away do you she asked startled yes tomorrow if possible monday sure you can arrange it why if mrs bracebridge asked you youd go fast enough and no one would think anything about it isnt that so yes she admitted slowly well then why not now its always so much harder to work out a falsehood she replied thoughtfully i know it but you can come wont you wont you wait a little while she pleaded its so very sudden im afraid not a day sweet that i can help cant you see how i feel look in my eyes will you yes she replied sorrowfully and yet with a strange thrill of affection i will chapter xxiii the business of arranging for this sudden departure was really not so difficult as it first appeared jennie proposed to tell her mother the whole truth and there was nothing to say to her father except that she was going with mrs bracebridge at the latters request he might question her but he really could not doubt before going home that afternoon she accompanied lester to a department store where she was fitted out with a trunk a suitcase and a traveling suit and hat lester was very proud of his prize when we get to new york i am going to get you some real things he told her i am going to show you what you can be made to look like he had all the purchased articles packed in the trunk and sent to his hotel then he arranged to have jennie come there and dress monday for the trip which began in the afternoon when she came home mrs gerhardt who was in the kitchen received her with her usual affectionate greeting have you been working very hard she asked you look tired no she said im not tired it isnt that i just dont feel good whats the trouble oh i have to tell you something mamma its so hard she paused looking inquiringly at her mother and then away why what is it asked her mother nervously so many things had happened in the past that she was always on the alert for some new calamity you havent lost your place have you no replied jennie with an effort to maintain her mental poise but im going to leave it no exclaimed her mother why im going to new york her mothers eyes opened widely why when did you decide to do that she inquired today you dont mean it yes i do mamma listen ive got something i want to tell you you know how poor we are there isnt any way we can make things come out right i have found some one who wants to help us he says he loves me and he wants me to go to new york with him monday ive decided to go oh jennie exclaimed her mother surely not you wouldnt do anything like that after all thats happened think of your father ive thought it all out went on jennie firmly its really for the best hes a good man i know he is he has lots of money he wants me to go with him and id better go he will take a new house for us when we come back and help us to get along no one will ever have me as a wife you know that it might as well be this way he loves me and i love him why shouldnt i go does he know about vesta asked her mother cautiously no said jennie guiltily i thought id better not tell him about her she oughtnt to be brought into it if i can help it im afraid youre storing up trouble for yourself jennie said her mother dont you think he is sure to find it out some time i thought maybe that she could be kept here suggested jennie until shes old enough to go to school then maybe i could send her somewhere she might assented her mother but dont you think it would be better to tell him now he wont think any the worse of you it isnt that its her said jennie passionately i dont want her to be brought into it her mother shook her head where did you meet him she inquired at mrs bracebridges how long ago oh its been almost two months now and you never said anything about him protested mrs gerhardt reproachfully i didnt know that he cared for me this way said jennie defensively why didnt you wait and let him come out here first asked her mother it will make things so much easier you cant go and not have your father find out i thought id say i was going with mrs bracebridge papa cant object to my going with her no agreed her mother thoughtfully the two looked at each other in silence mrs gerhardt with her imaginative nature endeavored to formulate some picture of this new and wonderful personality that had come into jennies life he was wealthy he wanted to take jennie he wanted to give them a good home what a story and he gave me this put in jennie who with some instinctive psychic faculty had been following her mothers mood she opened her dress at the neck and took out the two hundred and fifty dollars she placed the money in her mothers hands the latter stared at it wideeyed here was the relief for all her woes food clothes rent coal all done up in one small package of green and yellow bills if there were plenty of money in the house gerhardt need not worry about his burned hands george and martha and veronica could be clothed in comfort and made happy jennie could dress better there would be a future education for vesta do you think he might ever want to marry you asked her mother finally i dont know replied jennie he might i know he loves me well said her mother after a long pause if youre going to tell your father youd better do it right away hell think its strange as it is jennie realized that she had won her mother had acquiesced from sheer force of circumstances she was sorry but somehow it seemed to be for the best ill help you out with it her mother had concluded with a little sigh the difficulty of telling this lie was very great for mrs gerhardt but she went through the falsehood with a seeming nonchalance which allayed gerhardts suspicions the children were also told and when after the general discussion jennie repeated the falsehood to her father it seemed natural enough how long do you think youll be gone he inquired about two or three weeks she replied thats a nice trip he said i came through new york in it was a small place then compared to what it is now secretly he was pleased that jennie should have this fine chance her employer must like her when monday came jennie bade her parents goodby and left early going straight to the dornton where lester awaited her so you came he said gaily greeting her as she entered the ladies parlor yes she said simply you are my niece he went on i have engaged h room for you near mine ill call for the key and you go dress when youre ready ill have the trunk sent to the depot the train leaves at one oclock she went to her room and dressed while he fidgeted about read smoked and finally knocked at her door she replied by opening to him fully clad you look charming he said with a smile she looked down for she was nervous and distraught the whole process of planning lying nerving herself to carry out her part had been hard on her she looked tired and worried not grieving are you he asked seeing how things stood noo she replied come now sweet you mustnt feel this way its coming out all right he took her in his arms and kissed her and they strolled down the hall he was astonished to see how well she looked in even these simple clothes the best she had ever had they reached the depot after a short carriage ride the accommodations had been arranged for before hand and kane had allowed just enough time to make the train when they settled themselves in a pullman stateroom it was with a keen sense of satisfaction on his part life looked rosy jennie was beside him he had succeeded in what he had started out to do so might it always be as the train rolled out of the depot and the long reaches of the fields succeeded jennie studied them wistfully there were the forests leafless and bare the wide brown fields wet with the rains of winter the low farmhouses sitting amid flat stretches of prairie their low roofs making them look as if they were hugging the ground the train roared past little hamlets with cottages of white and yellow and drab their roofs blackened by frost and rain jennie noted one in particular which seemed to recall the old neighborhood where they used to live at columbus she put her handkerchief to her eyes and began silently to cry i hope youre not crying are you jennie said lester looking up suddenly from the letter he had been reading come come he went on as he saw a faint tremor shaking her this wont do you have to do better than this youll never get along if you act that way she made no reply and the depth of her silent grief filled him with strange sympathies dont cry he continued soothingly everything will be all right i told you that you neednt worry about anything jennie made a great effort to recover herself and began to dry her eyes you dont want to give way like that he continued it doesnt do you any good i know how you feel about leaving home but tears wont help it any it isnt as if you were going away for good you know besides youll be going back shortly you care for me dont you sweet im something yes she said and managed to smile back at him lester returned to his correspondence and jennie fell to thinking of vesta it troubled her to realize that she was keeping this secret from one who was already very dear to her she knew that she ought to tell lester about the child but she shrank from the painful necessity perhaps later on she might find the courage to do it ill have to tell him something she thought with a sudden upwelling of feeling as regarded the seriousness of this duty if i dont do it soon and i should go and live with him and he should find it out he would never forgive me he might turn me out and then where would i go i have no home now what would i do with vesta she turned to contemplate him a premonitory wave of terror sweeping over her but she only saw that imposing and comfortloving soul quietly reading his letters his smoothly shaved red cheek and comfortable head and body looking anything but militant or like an avenging nemesis she was just withdrawing her gaze when he looked up well have you washed all your sins away he inquired merrily she smiled faintly at the allusion the touch of fact in it made it slightly piquant i expect so she replied he turned to some other topic while she looked out of the window the realization that one impulse to tell him had proved unavailing dwelling in her mind ill have to do it shortly she thought and consoled herself with the idea that she would surely find courage before long their arrival in new york the next day raised the important question in lesters mind as to where he should stop new york was a very large place and he was not in much danger of encountering people who would know him but he thought it just as well not to take chances accordingly he had the cabman drive them to one of the more exclusive apartment hotels where he engaged a suite of rooms and they settled themselves for a stay of two or three weeks this atmosphere into which jennie was now plunged was so wonderful so illuminating that she could scarcely believe this was the same world that she had inhabited before kane was no lover of vulgar display the appointments with which he surrounded himself were always simple and elegant he knew at a glance what jennie needed and bought for her with discrimination and care and jennie a woman took a keen pleasure in the handsome gowns and pretty fripperies that he lavished upon her could this be really jennie gerhardt the washerwomans daughter she asked herself as she gazed in her mirror at the figure of a girl clad in blue velvet with yellow french lace at her throat and upon her arms could these be her feet clad in soft shapely shoes at ten dollars a pair these her hands adorned with flashing jewels what wonderful good fortune she was enjoying and lester had promised that her mother would share in it tears sprang to her eyes at the thought the dear mother how she loved her it was lesters pleasure in these days to see what he could do to make her look like some one truly worthy of im he exercised his most careful judgment and the result surprised even himself people turned in the halls in the diningrooms and on the street to gaze at jennie a stunning woman that man has with him was a frequent comment despite her altered state jennie did not lose her judgment of life or her sense of perspective or proportion she felt as though life were tentatively loaning her something which would be taken away after a time there was no pretty vanity in her bosom lester realized this as he watched her youre a big woman in your way he said youll amount to something life hasnt given you much of a deal up to now he wondered how he could justify this new relationship to his family should they chance to hear about it if he should decide to take a home in chicago or st louis there was such a thought running in his mind could he maintain it secretly did he want to he was half persuaded that he really truly loved her as the time drew near for their return he began to counsel her as to her future course of action you ought to find some way of introducing me as an acquaintance to your father he said it will ease matters up i think ill call then if you tell him youre going to marry me hell think nothing of it jennie thought of vesta and trembled inwardly but perhaps her father could be induced to remain silent lester had made the wise suggestion that she should retain the clothes she had worn in cleveland in order that she might wear them home when she reached there there wont be any trouble about this other stuff he said ill have it cared for until we make some other arrangement it was all very simple and easy he was a master strategist jennie had written her mother almost daily since she had been east she had inclosed little separate notes to be read by mrs gerhardt only in one she explained lesters desire to call and urged her mother to prepare the way by telling her father that she had met some one who liked her she spoke of the difficulty concerning vesta and her mother at once began to plan a campaign o have gerhardt hold his peace there must be no hitch now jennie must be given an opportunity to better herself when she returned there was great rejoicing of course she could not go back to her work but mrs gerhardt explained that mrs bracebridge had given jennie a few weeks vacation in order that she might look for something better something at which he could make more money chapter xxiv the problem of the gerhardt family and its relationship to himself comparatively settled kane betook himself to cincinnati and to his business duties he was heartily interested in the immense plant which occupied two whole blocks in the outskirts of the city and its conduct and development was as much a problem and a pleasure to him as to either his father or his brother he liked to feel that he was a vital part of this great and growing industry when he saw freight cars going by on the railroads labelled the kane manufacturing company cincinnati or chanced to notice displays of the companys products in the windows of carriage sales companies in the different cities he was conscious of a warm glow of satisfaction it was something to be a factor in an institution so stable so distinguished so honestly worth while this was all very well but now kane was entering upon a new phase of his personal existence in a word there was jennie he was conscious as he rode toward his home city that he was entering on a relationship which might involve disagreeable consequences he was a little afraid of his fathers attitude above all there was his brother robert robert was cold and conventional in character an excellent business man irreproachable in both his public and in his private life never overstepping the strict boundaries of legal righteousness he was neither warmhearted nor generous in fact he would turn any trick which could be speciously or at best necessitously recommended to his conscience how he reasoned lester did not know he could not follow the ramifications of a logic which could combine hard business tactics with moral rigidity but somehow his brother managed to do it hes got a scotch presbyterian conscience mixed with an asiatic perception of the main chance lester once told somebody and he had the situation accurately measured nevertheless he could not rout his brother from his positions nor defy him for he had the public conscience with him he was in line with convention practically and perhaps sophisticatedly the two brothers were outwardly friendly inwardly they were far apart robert liked lester well enough personally but he did not trust his financial judgment and temperamentally they did not agree as to how life and its affairs should be conducted lester had a secret contempt for his brothers chill persistent chase of the almighty dollar robert was sure that lesters easygoing ways were reprehensible and bound to create trouble sooner or later in the business they did not quarrel much there was not so much chance with the old gentleman still in charge but there were certain minor differences constantly cropping up which showed which way the wind blew lester was for building up trade through friendly relationship concessions personal contact and favors robert was for pulling everything tight cutting down the cost of production and offering such financial inducements as would throttle competition the old manufacturer always did his best to pour oil on these troubled waters but he foresaw an eventual clash one or the other would have to get out or perhaps both if only you two boys could agree he used to say another thing which disturbed lester was his fathers attitude on the subject of marriage lesters marriage to be specific archibald kane never ceased to insist on the fact that lester ought to get married and that he was making a big mistake in putting it off all the other children save louise were safely married why not his favorite son it was doing him injury morally socially commercially that he was sure of the world expects it of a man in your position his father had argued from time to time it makes for social solidity and prestige you ought to pick out a good woman and raise a family where will you be when you get to my time of life if you havent any children any home well if the right woman came along said lester i suppose id marry her but she hasnt come along what do you want me to do take anybody no not anybody of course but there are lots of good women you can surely find some one if you try theres that pace girl what about her you used to like her i wouldnt drift on this way lester it cant come to any good his son would only smile there father let it go now ill come around some time no doubt ive got to be thirsty when im led to water the old gentleman gave over time and again but it was a sore point with him he wanted his son to settle down and be a real man of affairs the fact that such a situation as this might militate against any permanent arrangement with jennie was obvious even to lester at this time he thought out his course of action carefully of course he would not give jennie up whatever the possible consequences but he must be cautious he must take no unnecessary risks could he bring her to cincinnati what a scandal if it were ever found out could he install her in a nice home somewhere near the city the family would probably eventually suspect something could he take her along on his numerous business journeys this first one to new york had been successful would it always be so he turned the question over in his mind the very difficulty gave it zest perhaps st louis or pittsburg or chicago would be best after all he went to these places frequently and particularly to chicago he decided finally that it should be chicago if he could arrange it he could always make excuses to run up there and it was only a nights ride yes chicago was best the very size and activity of the city made concealment easy after two weeks stay at cincinnati lester wrote jennie that he was coming to cleveland soon and she answered that she thought it would be all right for him to call and see her her father had been told about him she had felt it unwise to stay about the house and so had secured a position in a store at four dollars a week he smiled as he thought of her working and yet the decency and energy of it appealed to him shes all right he said shes the best ive come across yet he ran up to cleveland the following saturday and calling at her place of business he made an appointment to see her that evening he was anxious that his introduction as her beau should be gotten over with as quickly as possible when he did call the shabbiness of the house and the manifest poverty of the family rather disgusted him but somehow jennie seemed as sweet to him as ever gerhardt came in the frontroom after he had been there a few minutes and shook hands with him as did also mrs gerhardt but lester paid little attention to them the old german appeared to him to be merely commonplace the sort of man who was hired by hundreds in common capacities in his fathers factory after some desultory conversation lester suggested to jennie that they should go for a drive jennie put on her hat and together they departed as a matter of fact they went to an apartment which he had hired for the storage of her clothes when she returned at eight in the evening the family considered it nothing amiss chapter xxv a month later jennie was able to announce that lester intended to marry her his visits had of course paved the way for this and it seemed natural enough only gerhardt seemed a little doubtful he did not know just how this might be perhaps it was all right lester seemed a fine enough man in all conscience and really after brander why not if a united states senator could fall in love with jennie why not a business man there was just one thing the child has she told him about vesta he asked his wife no said mrs gerhardt not yet not yet not yet always something underhanded do you think he wants her if he knows thats what comes of such conduct in the first place now she has to slip around like a thief the child cannot even have an honest name gerhardt went back to his newspaper reading and brooding his life seemed a complete failure to him and he was only waiting to get well enough to hunt up another job as watchman he wanted to get out of this mess of deception and dishonesty a week or two later jennie confided to her mother that lester had written her to join him in chicago he was not feeling well and could not come to cleveland the two women explained to gerhardt that jennie was going away to be married to mr kane gerhardt flared up at this and his suspicions were again aroused but he could do nothing but grumble over the situation it would lead to no good end of that he was sure when the day came for jennies departure she had to go without saying farewell to her father he was out looking for work until late in the afternoon and before he had returned she had been obliged to leave for the station i will write a note to him when i get there she said she kissed her baby over and over lester will take a better house for us soon she went on hopefully he wants us to move the night train bore her to chicago the old life had ended and the new one had begun the curious fact should be recorded here that although lesters generosity had relieved the stress upon the family finances the children and gerhardt were actually none the wiser it was easy for mrs gerhardt to deceive her husband as to the purchase of necessities and she had not as yet indulged in any of the fancies which an enlarged purse permitted fear deterred her but after jennie had been in chicago for a few days she wrote to her mother saying that lester wanted them to take a new home this letter was shown to gerhardt who had been merely biding her return to make a scene he frowned but somehow it seemed an evidence of regularity if he had not married her why should he want to help them perhaps jennie was well married after all perhaps she really had been lifted to a high station in life and was now able to help the family gerhardt almost concluded to forgive her everything once and for all the end of it was that a new house was decided upon and jennie returned to cleveland to help her mother move together they searched the streets for a nice quiet neighborhood and finally found one a house of nine rooms with a yard which rented for thirty dollars was secured and suitably furnished there were comfortable fittings for the diningroom and sittingroom a handsome parlor set and bedroom sets complete for each room the kitchen was supplied with every convenience and there was even a bathroom a luxury the gerhardts had never enjoyed before altogether the house was attractive though plain and jennie was happy to know that her family could be comfortable in it when the time came for the actual moving mrs gerhardt was fairly beside herself with joy for was not this the realization of her dreams all through the long years of her life she had been waiting and now it had come a new house new furniture plenty of room things finer than she had ever even imagined think of it her eyes shone as she looked at the new beds and tables and bureaus and whatnots dear dear isnt this nice she exclaimed isnt it beautiful jennie smiled and tried to pretend satisfaction without emotion but there were tears in her eyes she was so glad for her mothers sake she could have kissed lesters feet for his goodness to her family the day the furniture was moved in mrs gerhardt martha and veronica were on hand to clean and arrange things at the sight of the large rooms and pretty yard bare enough in winter but giving promise of a delightful greenness in spring and the array of new furniture standing about in excelsior the whole family fell into a fever of delight such beauty such spaciousness george rubbed his feet over the new carpets and bass examined the quality of the furniture critically swell was his comment mrs gerhardt roved to and fro like a person in a dream she could not believe that these bright bedrooms this beautiful parlor this handsome diningroom were actually hers gerhardt came last of all although he tried hard not to show it he too could scarcely refrain from enthusiastic comment the sight of an opalglobed chandelier over the diningroom table was the finishing touch gas yet he said he looked grimly around under his shaggy eyebrows at the new carpets under his feet the long oak extension table covered with a white cloth and set with new dishes at the pictures on the walls the bright clean kitchen he shook his head by chops its fine he said its very nice yes its very nice we want to be careful now not to break anything its so easy to scratch things up and then its all over yes even gerhardt was satisfied chapter xxvi it would be useless to chronicle the events of the three years that followed events and experiences by which the family grew from an abject condition of want to a state of comparative selfreliance based of course on the obvious prosperity of jennie and the generosity through her of her distant husband lester was seen now and then a significant figure visiting cleveland and sometimes coming out to the house where he occupied with jennie the two best rooms of the second floor there were hurried trips on her part in answer to telegraph massages to chicago to st louis to new york one of his favorite pastimes was to engage quarters at the great resorts hot springs mt clemens saratoga and for a period of a week or two at a stretch enjoy the luxury of living with jennie as his wife there were other times when he would pass through cleveland only for the privilege of seeing her for a day all the time he was aware that he was throwing on her the real burden of a rather difficult situation but he did not see how he could remedy it at this time he was not sure as yet that he really wanted to they were getting along fairly well the attitude of the gerhardt family toward this condition of affairs was peculiar at first in spite of the irregularity of it it seemed natural enough jennie said she was married no one had seen her marriage certificate but she said so and she seemed to carry herself with the air of one who holds that relationship still she never went to cincinnati where his family lived and none of his relatives ever came near her then too his attitude in spite of the money which had first blinded them was peculiar he really did not carry himself like a married man he was so indifferent there were weeks in which she appeared to receive only perfunctory notes there were times when she would only go away for a few days to meet him then there were the long periods in which she absented herself the only worthwhile testimony toward a real relationship and that in a way unnatural bass who had grown to be a young man of twentyfive with some business judgment and a desire to get out in the world was suspicious he had come to have a pretty keen knowledge of life and intuitively he felt that things were not right george nineteen who had gained a slight foothold in a wallpaper factory and was looking forward to a career in that field was also restless he felt that something was wrong martha seventeen was still in school as were william and veronica each was offered an opportunity to study indefinitely but there was unrest with life they knew about jennies child the neighbors were obviously drawing conclusions for themselves they had few friends gerhardt himself finally concluded that there was something wrong but he had let himself into this situation and was not in much of a position now to raise an argument he wanted to ask her at times proposed to make her do better if he could but the worst had already been done it depended on the man now he knew that things were gradually nearing a state where a general upheaval would have taken place had not life stepped in with one of its fortuitous solutions mrs gerhardts health failed although stout and formerly of a fairly active disposition she had of late years become decidedly sedentary in her habits and grown weak which coupled with a mind naturally given to worry and weighed upon as it had been by a number of serious and disturbing ills seemed now to culminate in a slow but very certain case of systemic poisoning she became decidedly sluggish in her motions wearied more quickly at the few tasks left for her to do and finally complained to jennie that it was very hard for her to climb stairs im not feeling well she said i think im going to be sick jennie now took alarm and proposed to take her to some nearby wateringplace but mrs gerhardt wouldnt go i dont think it would do any good she said she sat about or went driving with her daughter but the fading autumn scenery depressed her i dont like to get sick in the fall she said the leaves coming down make me think i am never going to get well oh ma how you talk said jennie but she felt frightened nevertheless how much the average home depends upon the mother was seen when it was feared the end was near bass who had thought of getting married and getting out of this atmosphere abandoned the idea temporarily gerhardt shocked and greatly depressed hung about like one expectant of and greatly awed by the possibility of disaster jennie too inexperienced in death to feel that she could possibly lose her mother felt as if somehow her living depended on her hoping in spite of all opposing circumstances she hung about a white figure of patience waiting and serving the end came one morning after a month of illness and several days of unconsciousness during which silence reigned in the house and all the family went about on tiptoe mrs gerhardt passed away with her dying gaze fastened on jennies face for the last few minutes of consciousness that life vouchsafed her jennie stared into her eyes with a yearning horror oh mamma mamma she cried oh no no gerhardt came running in from the yard and throwing himself down by the bedside wrung his bony hands in anguish i should have gone first he cried i should have gone first the death of mrs gerhardt hastened the final breaking up of the family bass was bent on getting married at once having had a girl in town for some time martha whose views of life had broadened and hardened was anxious to get out also she felt that a sort of stigma attached to the home to herself in fact so long as she remained there martha looked to the public schools as a source of income she was going to be a teacher gerhardt alone scarcely knew which way to turn he was again at work as a night watchman jennie found him crying one day alone in the kitchen and immediately burst into tears herself now papa she pleaded it isnt as bad as that you will always have a home you know that as long as i have anything you can come with me no no he protested he really did not want to go with her it isnt that he continued my whole life comes to nothing it was some little time before bass george and martha finally left but one by one they got out leaving jennie her father veronica and william and one other jennies child of course lester knew nothing of vestas parentage and curiously enough he had never seen the little girl during the short periods in which he deigned to visit the house two or three days at most mrs gerhardt took good care that vesta was kept in the background there was a playroom on the top floor and also a bedroom there and concealment was easy lester rarely left his rooms he even had his meals served to him in what might have been called the livingroom of the suite he was not at all inquisitive or anxious to meet any one of the other members of the family he was perfectly willing to shake hands with them or to exchange a few perfunctory words but perfunctory words only it was generally understood that the child must not appear and so it did not there is an inexplicable sympathy between old age and childhood an affinity which is as lovely as it is pathetic during that first year in lorrie street when no one was looking gerhardt often carried vesta about on his shoulders and pinched her soft red cheeks when she got old enough to walk he it was who with a towel fastened securely under her arms led her patiently around the room until she was able to take a few steps of her own accord when she actually reached the point where she could walk he was the one who coaxed her to the effort shyly grimly but always lovingly by some strange leading of fate this stigma on his familys honor this blotch on conventional morality had twined its helpless baby fingers about the tendons of his heart he loved this little outcast ardently hopefully she was the one bright ray in a narrow gloomy life and gerhardt early took upon himself the responsibility of her education in religious matters was it not he who had insisted that the infant should be baptized say our father he used to demand of the lisping infant when he had her alone with him ow fowvaw was her vowellike interpretation of his words who art in heaven ooh ah in aven repeated the child why do you teach her so early pleaded mrs gerhardt overhearing the little ones struggles with stubborn consonants and vowels because i want she should learn the christian faith returned gerhardt determinedly she ought to know her prayers if she dont begin now she never will know them mrs gerhardt smiled many of her husbands religious idiosyncrasies were amusing to her at the same time she liked to see this sympathetic interest he was taking in the childs upbringing if he were only not so hard so narrow at times he made himself a torment to himself and to every one else on the earliest bright morning of returning spring he was wont to take her for her first little journeys in the world come now he would say we will go for a little walk walk chirped vesta yes walk echoed gerhardt mrs gerhardt would fasten on one of her little hoods for in these days jennie kept vestas wardrobe beautifully replete taking her by the hand gerhardt would issue forth satisfied to drag first one foot and then the other in order to accommodate his gait to her toddling steps one beautiful may day when vesta was four years old they started on one of their walks everywhere nature was budding and bourgeoning the birds twittering their arrival from the south the insects making the best of their brief span of life sparrows chirped in the road robins strutted upon the grass bluebirds built in the eaves of the cottages gerhardt took a keen delight in pointing out the wonders of nature to vesta and she was quick to respond every new sight and sound interested her ooh ooh exclaimed vesta catching sight of a low flashing touch of red as a robin lighted upon a twig nearby her hand was up and her eyes were wide open yes said gerhardt as happy as if he himself had but newly discovered this marvelous creature robin bird robin say robin wobin said vesta yes robin he answered it is going to look for a worm now we will see if we cannot find its nest i think i saw a nest in one of these trees he plodded peacefully on seeking to rediscover an old abandoned nest that he had observed on a former walk here it is he said at last coming to a small and leafless tree in which a winterbeaten remnant of a home was still clinging here come now see and he lifted the baby up at arms length see said gerhardt indicating the wisp of dead grasses with his free hand nest that is a birds nest see ooh repeated vesta imitating his pointing finger with one of her own ness ooh yes said gerhardt putting her down again that was a wrens nest they have all gone now they will not come any more still further they plodded he unfolding the simple facts of life she wondering with the wide wonder of a child when they had gone a block or two he turned slowly about as if the end of the world had been reached we must be going back he said and so she had come to her fifth year growing in sweetness intelligence and vivacity gerhardt was fascinated by the questions she asked the puzzles she pronounced such a girl he would exclaim to his wife what is it she doesnt want to know where is god what does he do where does he keep his feet she asks me i gotta laugh sometimes from rising in the morning to dress her to laying her down at night after she had said her prayers she came to be the chief solace and comfort of his days without vesta gerhardt would have found his life hard indeed to bear chapter xxvii for three years now lester had been happy in the companionship of jennie irregular as the connection might be in the eyes of the church and of society it had brought him peace and comfort and he was perfectly satisfied with the outcome of the experiment his interest in the social affairs of cincinnati was now practically nil and he had consistently refused to consider any matrimonial proposition which had himself as the object he looked on his fathers business organization as offering a real chance for himself if he could get control of it but he saw no way of doing so roberts interests were always in the way and if anything the two brothers were farther apart than ever in their ideas and aims lester had thought once or twice of entering some other line of business or of allying himself with another carriage company but he did not feel that ha could conscientiously do this lester had his salary fifteen thousand a year as secretary and treasurer of the company his brother was vicepresident and about five thousand from some outside investments he had not been so lucky or so shrewd in speculation as robert had been aside from the principal which yielded his five thousand he had nothing robert on the other hand was unquestionably worth between three and four hundred thousand dollars in addition to his future interest in the business which both brothers shrewdly suspected would be divided somewhat in their favor robert and lester would get a fourth each they thought their sisters a sixth it seemed natural that kane senior should take this view seeing that the brothers were actually in control and doing the work still there was no certainty the old gentleman might do anything or nothing the probabilities were that he would be very fair and liberal at the same time robert was obviously beating lester in the game of life what did lester intend to do about it there comes a time in every thinking mans life when he pauses and takes stock of his condition when he asks himself how it fares with his individuality as a whole mental moral physical material this time comes after the first heedless flights of youth have passed when the initiative and more powerful efforts have been made and he begins to feel the uncertainty of results and final values which attaches itself to everything there is a deadening thought of uselessness which creeps into many mens minds the thought which has been best expressed by the preacher in ecclesiastes yet lester strove to be philosophical what difference does it make he used to say to himself whether i live at the white house or here at home or at the grand pacific but in the very question was the implication that there were achievements in life which he had failed to realize in his own career the white house represented the rise and success of a great public character his home and the grand pacific were what had come to him without effort he decided for the time being it was about the period of the death of jennies mother that he would make some effort to rehabilitate himself he would cut out idling these numerous trips with jennie had cost him considerable time he would make some outside investments if his brother could find avenues of financial profit so could he he would endeavor to assert his authority he would try to make himself of more importance in the business rather than let robert gradually absorb everything should he forsake jennie that thought also came to him she had no claim on him she could make no protest somehow he did not see how it could be done it seemed cruel useless above all though he disliked to admit it it would be uncomfortable for himself he liked her loved her perhaps in a selfish way he didnt see how he could desert her very well just at this time he had a really serious difference with robert his brother wanted to sever relations with an old and well established paint company in new york which had manufactured paints especially for the house and invest in a new concern in chicago which was growing and had a promising future lester knowing the members of the eastern firm their reliability their long and friendly relations with the house was in opposition his father at first seemed to agree with lester but robert argued out the question in his cold logical way his blue eyes fixed uncompromisingly upon his brothers face we cant go on forever he said standing by old friends just because father here has dealt with them or you like them we must have a change the business must be stiffened up were going to have more and stronger competition its just as father feels about it said lester at last i have no deep feeling in the matter it wont hurt me one way or the other you say the house is going to profit eventually ive stated the arguments on the other side im inclined to think robert is right said archibald kane calmly most of the things he has suggested so far have worked out lester colored well we wont have any more discussion about it then he said he rose and strolled out of the office the shock of this defeat coming at a time when he was considering pulling himself together depressed lester considerably it wasnt much but it was a straw and his fathers remark about his brothers business acumen was even more irritating he was beginning to wonder whether his father would discriminate in any way in the distribution of the property had he heard anything about his entanglement with jennie had he resented the long vacations he had taken from business it did not appear to lester that he could be justly chargeable with either incapacity or indifference so far as the company was concerned he had done his work well he was still the investigator of propositions put up to the house the student of contracts the trusted adviser of his father and mother but he was being worsted where would it end he thought about this but could reach no conclusion later in this same year robert came forward with a plan for reorganization in the executive department of the business he proposed that they should build an immense exhibition and storage warehouse on michigan avenue in chicago and transfer a portion of their completed stock there chicago was more central than cincinnati buyers from the west and country merchants could be more easily reached and dealt with there it would be a big advertisement for the house a magnificent evidence of its standing and prosperity kane senior and lester immediately approved of this both saw its advantages robert suggested that lester should undertake the construction of the new buildings it would probably be advisable for him to reside in chicago a part of the time the idea appealed to lester even though it took him away from cincinnati largely if not entirely it was dignified and not unrepresentative of his standing in the company he could live in chicago and he could have jennie with him the scheme he had for taking an apartment could now be arranged without difficulty he voted yes robert smiled im sure well get good results from this all around he said as construction work was soon to begin lester decided to move to chicago immediately he sent word for jennie to meet him and together they selected an apartment on the north side a very comfortable suite of rooms on a side street near the lake and he had it fitted up to suit his taste he figured that living in chicago he could pose as a bachelor he would never need to invite his friends to his rooms there were his offices where he could always be found his clubs and the hotels to his way of thinking the arrangement was practically ideal of course jennies departure from cleveland brought the affairs of the gerhardt family to a climax probably the home would be broken up but gerhardt himself took the matter philosophically he was an old man and it did not matter much where he lived bass martha and george were already taking care of themselves veronica and william were still in school but some provision could be made for boarding them with a neighbor the one real concern of jennie and gerhardt was vesta it was gerhardts natural thought that jennie must take the child with her what else should a mother do have you told him yet he asked her when the day of her contemplated departure had been set no but im going to soon she assured him always soon he said he shook his head his throat swelled its too bad he went on its a great sin god will punish you im afraid the child needs some one im getting old otherwise i would keep her there is no one here all day now to look after her right as she should be again he shook his head i know said jennie weakly im going to fix it now im going to have her live with me soon i wont neglect her you know that but the childs name he insisted she should have a name soon in another year she goes to school people will want to know who she is it cant go on forever like this jennie understood well enough that it couldnt she was crazy about her baby the heaviest cross she had to bear was the constant separations and the silence she was obliged to maintain about vestas very existence it did seem unfair to the child and yet jennie did not see clearly how she could have acted otherwise vesta had good clothes everything she needed she was at least comfortable jennie hoped to give her a good education if only she had told the truth to lester in the first place now it was almost too late and yet she felt that she had acted for the best finally she decided to find some good woman or family in chicago who would take charge of vesta for a consideration in a swedish colony to the west of la salle avenue she came across an old lady who seemed to embody all the virtues she required cleanliness simplicity honesty she was a widow doing work by the day but she was glad to make an arrangement by which she should give her whole time to vesta the latter was to go to kindergarten when a suitable one should be found she was to have toys and kindly attention and mrs olsen was to inform jennie of any change in the childs health jennie proposed to call every day and she thought that sometimes when lester was out of town vesta might be brought to the apartment she had had her with her at cleveland and he had never found out anything the arrangements completed jennie returned at the first opportunity to cleveland to take vesta away gerhardt who had been brooding over his approaching loss appeared most solicitous about her future she should grow up to be a fine girl he said you should give her a good education she is so smart he spoke of the advisability of sending her to a lutheran school and church but jennie was not so sure of that time and association with lester had led her to think that perhaps the public school was better than any private institution she had no particular objection to the church but she no longer depended upon its teachings as a guide in the affairs of life why should she the next day it was necessary for jennie to return to chicago vesta excited and eager was made ready for the journey gerhardt had been wandering about restless as a lost spirit while the process of dressing was going on now that the hour had actually struck he was doing his best to control his feelings he could see that the fiveyearold child had no conception of what it meant to him she was happy and selfinterested chattering about the ride and the train be a good little girl he said lifting her up and kissing her see that you study your catechism and say your prayers and you wont forget the grandpa what he tried to go on but his voice failed him jennie whose heart ached for her father choked back her emotion there she said if id thought you were going to act like that she stopped go said gerhardt manfully go it is best this way and he stood solemnly by as they went out of the door then he turned back to his favorite haunt the kitchen and stood there staring at the floor one by one they were leaving him mrs gerhardt bass martha jennie vesta he clasped his hands together after his oldtime fashion and shook his head again and again so it is so it is he repeated they all leave me all my life goes to pieces chapter xxviii during the three years in which jennie and lester had been associated there had grown up between them a strong feeling of mutual sympathy and understanding lester truly loved her in his own way it was a strong selfsatisfying determined kind of way based solidly on a big natural foundation but rising to a plane of genuine spiritual affinity the yielding sweetness of her character both attracted and held him she was true and good and womanly to the very center of her being he had learned to trust her to depend upon her and the feeling had but deepened with the passing of the years on her part jennie had sincerely deeply truly learned to love this man at first when he had swept her off her feet overawed her soul and used her necessity as a chain wherewith to bind her to him she was a little doubtful a little afraid of him although she had always liked him now however by living with him by knowing him better by watching his moods she had come to love him he was so big so vocal so handsome his point of view and opinions of anything and everything were so positive his pet motto hew to the line let the chips fall where they may had clung in her brain as something immensely characteristic apparently he was not afraid of anything god man or devil he used to look at her holding her chin between the thumb and fingers of his big brown hand and say youre sweet all right but you need courage and defiance you havent enough of those things and her eyes would meet his in dumb appeal never mind he would add you have other things and then he would kiss her one of the most appealing things to lester was the simple way in which she tried to avoid exposure of her various social and educational shortcomings she could not write very well and once he found a list of words he had used written out on a piece of paper with the meanings opposite he smiled but he liked her better for it another time in the southern hotel in st louis he watched her pretending a loss of appetite because she thought that her lack of table manners was being observed by nearby diners she could not always be sure of the right forks and knives and the strangelooking dishes bothered her how did one eat asparagus and artichokes why dont you eat something he asked goodnaturedly youre hungry arent you not very you must be listen jennie i know what it is you mustnt feel that way your manners are all right i wouldnt bring you here if they werent your instincts are all right dont be uneasy id tell you quick enough when there was anything wrong his brown eyes held a friendly gleam she smiled gratefully i do feel a little nervous at times she admitted dont he repeated youre all right dont worry ill show you and he did by degrees jennie grew into an understanding of the usages and customs of comfortable existence all that the gerhardt family had ever had were the bare necessities of life now she was surrounded with whatever she wanted trunks clothes toilet articles the whole varied equipment of comfort and while she liked it all it did not upset her sense of proportion and her sense of the fitness of things there was no element of vanity in her only a sense of joy in privilege and opportunity she was grateful to lester for all that he had done and was doing for her if only she could hold him always the details of getting vesta established once adjusted jennie settled down into the routine of home life lester busy about his multitudinous affairs was in and out he had a suite of rooms reserved for himself at the grand pacific which was then the exclusive hotel of chicago and this was his ostensible residence his luncheon and evening appointments were kept at the union club an early patron of the telephone he had one installed in the apartment so that he could reach jennie quickly and at any time he was home two or three nights a week sometimes oftener he insisted at first on jennie having a girl of general housework but acquiesced in the more sensible arrangement which she suggested later of letting some one come in to do the cleaning she liked to work around her own home her natural industry and love of order prompted this feeling lester liked his breakfast promptly at eight in the morning he wanted dinner served nicely at seven silverware cut glass imported china all the little luxuries of life appealed to him he kept his trunks and wardrobe at the apartment during the first few months everything went smoothly he was in the habit of taking jennie to the theater now and then and if he chanced to run across an acquaintance he always introduced her as miss gerhardt when he registered her as his wife it was usually under an assumed name where there was no danger of detection he did not mind using his own signature thus far there had been no difficulty or unpleasantness of any kind the trouble with this situation was that it was crisscrossed with the danger and consequent worry which the deception in regard to vesta had entailed as well as with jennies natural anxiety about her father and the disorganized home jennie feared as veronica hinted that she and william would go to live with martha who was installed in a boardinghouse in cleveland and that gerhardt would be left alone he was such a pathetic figure to her with his injured hands and his one ability that of being a watchman that she was hurt to think of his being left alone would he come to her she knew that he would not feeling as he did at present would lester have him she was not sure of that if he came vesta would have to be accounted for so she worried the situation in regard to vesta was really complicated owing to the feeling that she was doing her daughter a great injustice jennie was particularly sensitive in regard to her anxious to do a thousand things to make up for the one great duty that she could not perform she daily paid a visit to the home of mrs olsen always taking with her toys candy or whatever came into her mind as being likely to interest and please the child she liked to sit with vesta and tell her stories of fairy and giant which kept the little girl wideeyed at last she went so far as to bring her to the apartment when lester was away visiting his parents and she soon found it possible during his several absences to do this regularly after that as time went on and she began to know his habits she became more bold although bold is scarcely the word to use in connection with jennie she became venturesome much as a mouse might she would risk vestas presence on the assurance of even short absences two or three days she even got into the habit of keeping a few of vestas toys at the apartment so that she could have something to play with when she came during these several visits from her child jennie could not but realize the lovely thing life would be were she only an honored wife and a happy mother vesta was a most observant little girl she could by her innocent childish questions give a hundred turns to the dagger of selfreproach which was already planted deeply in jennies heart can i come to live with you was one of her simplest and most frequently repeated questions jennie would reply that mamma could not have her just yet but that very soon now just as soon as she possibly could vesta should come to stay always dont you know just when vesta would ask no dearest not just when very soon now you wont mind waiting a little while dont you like mrs olsen yes replied vesta but then she aint got any nice things now shes just got old things and jennie stricken to the heart would take vesta to the toy shop and load her down with a new assortment of playthings of course lester was not in the least suspicious his observation of things relating to the home were rather casual he went about his work and his pleasures believing jennie to be the soul of sincerity and goodnatured service and it never occurred to him that there was anything underhanded in her actions once he did come home sick in the afternoon and found her absent an absence which endured from two oclock to five he was a little irritated and grumbled on her return but his annoyance was as nothing to her astonishment and fright when she found him there she blanched at the thought of his suspecting something and explained as best she could she had gone to see her washerwoman she was slow about her marketing she didnt dream he was there she was sorry too that her absence had lost her an opportunity to serve him it showed her what a mess she was likely to make of it all it happened that about three weeks after the above occurrence lester had occasion to return to cincinnati for a week and during this time jennie again brought vesta to the flat for four days there was the happiest goings on between the mother and child nothing would have come of this little reunion had it not been for an oversight on jennies part the farreaching effects of which she could only afterward regret this was the leaving of a little toy lamb under the large leather divan in the front room where lester was wont to lie and smoke a little bell held by a thread of blue ribbon was fastened about its neck and this tinkled feebly whenever it was shaken vesta with the unaccountable freakishness of children had deliberately dropped it behind the divan an action which jennie did not notice at the time when she gathered up the various playthings after vestas departure she overlooked it entirely and there it rested its innocent eyes still staring upon the sunlit regions of toyland when lester returned that same evening when he was lying on the divan quietly enjoying his cigar and his newspaper he chanced to drop the former fully lighted wishing to recover it before it should do any damage he leaned over and looked under the divan the cigar was not in sight so he rose and pulled the lounge out a move which revealed to him the little lamb still standing where vesta had dropped it he picked it up turning it over and over and wondering how it had come there a lamb it must belong to some neighbors child in whom jennie had taken an interest he thought he would have to go and tease her about this accordingly he held the toy jovially before him and coming out into the diningroom where jennie was working at the sideboard he exclaimed in a mock solemn voice where did this come from jennie who was totally unconscious of the existence of this evidence of her duplicity turned and was instantly possessed with the idea that he had suspected all and was about to visit his just wrath upon her instantly the blood flamed in her cheeks and as quickly left them why why she stuttered its a little toy i bought i see it is he returned genially her guilty tremor not escaping his observation but having at the same time no explicable significance to him its frisking around a mighty lone sheepfold he touched the little bell at its throat while jennie stood there unable to speak it tinkled feebly and then he looked at her again his manner was so humorous that she could tell he suspected nothing however it was almost impossible for her to recover her selfpossession whats ailing you he asked nothing she replied you look as though a lamb was a terrible shock to you i forgot to take it out from there that was all she went on blindly it looks as though it has been played with enough he added more seriously and then seeing that the discussion was evidently painful to her he dropped it the lamb had not furnished him the amusement that he had expected lester went back into the front room stretched himself out and thought it over why was she nervous what was there about a toy to make her grow pale surely there was no harm in her harboring some youngster of the neighborhood when she was alone having it come in and play why should she be so nervous he thought it over but could come to no conclusion nothing more was said about the incident of the toy lamb time might have wholly effaced the impression from lesters memory had nothing else intervened to arouse his suspicions but a mishap of any kind seems invariably to be linked with others which follow close upon its heels one evening when lester happened to be lingering about the flat later than usual the door bell rang and jennie being busy in the kitchen lester went himself to open the door he was greeted by a middleaged lady who frowned very nervously upon him and inquired in broken swedish accents for jennie wait a moment said lester and stepping to the rear door he called her jennie came and seeing who the visitor was she stepped nervously out in the hall and closed the door after her the action instantly struck lester as suspicious he frowned and determined to inquire thoroughly into the matter a moment later jennie reappeared her face was white and her fingers seemed to be nervously seeking something to seize upon whats the trouble he inquired the irritation he had felt the moment before giving his voice a touch of gruffness ive got to go out for a little while she at last managed to reply very well he assented unwillingly but you can tell me whats the trouble with you cant you where do you have to go i i began jennie stammering i have yes he said grimly i have to go on an errand she stumbled on i i cant wait ill tell you when i come back lester please dont ask me now she looked vainly at him her troubled countenance still marked by preoccupation and anxiety to get away and lester who had never seen this look of intense responsibility in her before was moved and irritated by it thats all right he said but whats the use of all this secrecy why cant you come out and tell whats the matter with you whats the use of this whispering behind doors where do you have to go he paused checked by his own harshness and jennie who was intensely wrought up by the information she had received as well as the unwonted verbal castigation she was now enduring rose to an emotional state never reached by her before i will lester i will she exclaimed only not now i havent time ill tell you everything when i come back please dont stop me now she hurried to the adjoining chamber to get her wraps and lester who had even yet no clear conception of what it all meant followed her stubbornly to the door see here he exclaimed in his vigorous brutal way youre not acting right whats the matter with you i want to know he stood in the doorway his whole frame exhibiting the pugnacity and settled determination of a man who is bound to be obeyed jennie troubled and driven to bay turned at last its my child lester she exclaimed its dying i havent time to talk oh please dont stop me ill tell you everything when i come back your child he exclaimed what the hell are you talking about i couldnt help it she returned i was afraid i should have told you long ago i meant to only only oh let me go now and ill tell you all when i come back he stared at her in amazement then he stepped aside unwilling to force her any further for the present well go ahead he said quietly dont you want some one to go along with you no she replied mrs olsen is right here ill go with her she hurried forth whitefaced and he stood there pondering could this be the woman he had thought he knew why she had been deceiving him for years jennie the whitefaced the simple he choked a little as he muttered well ill be damned chapter xxix the reason why jennie had been called was nothing more than one of those infantile seizures the coming and result of which no man can predict two hours beforehand vesta had been seriously taken with membranous croup only a few hours before and the development since had been so rapid that the poor old swedish mother was half frightened to death herself and hastily despatched a neighbor to say that vesta was very ill and mrs kane was to come at once this message delivered as it was in a very nervous manner by one whose only object was to bring her had induced the soulracking fear of death in jennie and caused her to brave the discovery of lester in the manner described jennie hurried on anxiously her one thought being to reach her child before the arm of death could interfere and snatch it from her her mind weighed upon by a legion of fears what if it should already be too late when she got there what if vesta already should be no more instinctively she quickened her pace and as the street lamps came and receded in the gloom she forgot all the sting of lesters words all fear that he might turn her out and leave her alone in a great city with a little child to care for and remembered only the fact that her vesta was very ill possibly dying and that she was the direct cause of the childs absence from her that perhaps but for the want of her care and attention vesta might be well tonight if i can only get there she kept saying to herself and then with that frantic unreason which is the chief characteristic of the instinctdriven mother i might have known that god would punish me for my unnatural conduct i might have known i might have known when she reached the gate she fairly sped up the little walk and into the house where vesta was lying pale quiet and weak but considerably better several swedish neighbors and a middleaged physician were in attendance all of whom looked at her curiously as she dropped beside the childs bed and spoke to her jennies mind had been made up she had sinned and sinned grievously against her daughter but now she would make amends so far as possible lester was very dear to her but she would no longer attempt to deceive him in anything even if he left her she felt an agonized stab a pain at the thought she must still do the one right thing vesta must not be an outcast any longer her mother must give her a home where jennie was there must vesta be sitting by the bedside in this humble swedish cottage jennie realized the fruitlessness of her deception the trouble and pain it had created in her home the months of suffering it had given her with lester the agony it had heaped upon her this night and to what end the truth had been discovered anyhow she sat there and meditated not knowing what next was to happen while vesta quieted down and then went soundly to sleep lester after recovering from the first heavy import of this discovery asked himself some perfectly natural questions who was the father of the child how old was it how did it chance to be in chicago and who was taking care of it he could ask but he could not answer he knew absolutely nothing curiously now as he thought his first meeting with jennie at mrs bracebridges came back to him what was it about her then that had attracted him what made him think after a few hours observation that he could seduce her to do his will what was it moral looseness or weakness or what there must have been art in the sorry affair the practised art of the cheat and in deceiving such a confiding nature as his she had done even more than practise deception she had been ungrateful now the quality of ingratitude was a very objectionable thing to lester the last and most offensive trait of a debased nature and to be able to discover a trace of it in jennie was very disturbing it is true that she had not exhibited it in any other way before quite to the contrary but nevertheless he saw strong evidences of it now and it made him very bitter in his feeling toward her how could she be guilty of any such conduct toward him had he not picked her up out of nothing so to speak and befriended her he moved from his chair in this silent room and began to pace slowly to and fro the weightiness of this subject exercising to the full his power of decision she was guilty of a misdeed which he felt able to condemn the original concealment was evil the continued deception more lastly there was the thought that her love after all had been divided part for him part for the child a discovery which no man in his position could contemplate with serenity he moved irritably as he thought of it shoved his hands in his pockets and walked to and fro across the floor that a man of lesters temperament should consider himself wronged by jennie merely because she had concealed a child whose existence was due to conduct no more irregular than was involved later in the yielding of herself to him was an example of those inexplicable perversions of judgment to which the human mind in its capacity of keeper of the honor of others seems permanently committed lester aside from his own personal conduct for men seldom judge with that in the balance had faith in the ideal that a woman should reveal herself completely to the one man with whom she is in love and the fact that she had not done so was a grief to him he had asked her once tentatively about her past she begged him not to press her that was the time she should have spoken of any child now he shook his head his first impulse after he had thought the thing over was to walk out and leave her at the same time he was curious to hear the end of this business he did put on his hat and coat however and went out stopping at the first convenient saloon to get a drink he took a car and went down to the club strolling about the different rooms and chatting with several people whom he encountered he was restless and irritated and finally after three hours of meditation he took a cab and returned to his apartment the distraught jennie sitting by her sleeping child was at last made to realize by its peaceful breathing that all danger was over there was nothing more that she could do for vesta and now the claims of the home that she had deserted began to reassert themselves the promise to lester and the need of being loyal to her duties unto the very end lester might possibly be waiting for her it was just probable that he wished to hear the remainder of her story before breaking with her entirely although anguished and frightened by the certainty as she deemed it of his forsaking her she nevertheless felt that it was no more than she deserved a just punishment for all her misdoings when jennie arrived at the flat it was after eleven and the hall light was already out she first tried the door and then inserted her key no one stirred however and opening the door she entered in the expectation of seeing lester sternly confronting her he was not there however the burning gas had merely been an oversight on his part she glanced quickly about but seeing only the empty room she came instantly to the other conclusion that he had forsaken her and so stood there a meditative helpless figure gone she thought at this moment his footsteps sounded on the stairs he came in with his derby hat pulled low over his broad forehead close to his sandy eyebrows and with his overcoat buttoned up closely about his neck he took off the coat without looking at jennie and hung it on the rack then he deliberately took off his hat and hung that up also when he was through he turned to where she was watching him with wide eyes i want to know about this thing now from beginning to end he began whose child is that jennie wavered a moment as one who might be going to take a leap in the dark then opened her lips mechanically and confessed its senator branders senator brander echoed lester the familiar name of the dead but still famous statesman ringing with shocking and unexpected force in his ears how did you come to know him we used to do his washing for him she rejoined simply my mother and i lester paused the baldness of the statements issuing from her sobering even his rancorous mood senator branders child he thought to himself so that great representative of the interests of the common people was the undoer of her a selfconfessed washerwomans daughter a fine tragedy of low life all this was how long ago was this he demanded his face the picture of a darkling mood its been nearly six years now she returned he calculated the time that had elapsed since he had known her and then continued how old is the child shes a little over five lester moved a little the need for serious thought made his tone more peremptory but less bitter where have you been keeping her all this time she was at home until you went to cincinnati last spring i went down and brought her then was she there the times i came to cleveland yes said jennie but i didnt let her come out anywhere where you could see her i thought you said you told your people that you were married he exclaimed wondering how this relationship of the child to the family could have been adjusted i did she replied but i didnt want to tell you about her they thought all the time i intended to well why didnt you because i was afraid afraid of what i didnt know what was going to become of me when i went with you lester i didnt want to do her any harm if i could help it i was ashamed afterward when you said you didnt like children i was afraid afraid id leave you yes he stopped the simplicity of her answers removing a part of the suspicion of artful duplicity which had originally weighed upon him after all there was not so much of that in it as mere wretchedness of circumstance and cowardice of morals what a family she must have what queer nonmoral natures they must have to have brooked any such a combination of affairs didnt you know that youd be found out in the long run he at last demanded surely you might have seen that you couldnt raise her that way why didnt you tell me in the first place i wouldnt have thought anything of it then i know she said i wanted to protect her where is she now he asked jennie explained she stood there the contradictory aspect of these questions and of his attitude puzzling even herself she did try to explain them after a time but all lester could gain was that she had blundered along without any artifice at all a condition that was so manifest that had he been in any other position than that he was he might have pitied her as it was the revelation concerning brander was hanging over him and he finally returned to that you say your mother used to do washing for him how did you come to get in with him jennie who until now had borne his questions with unmoving pain winced at this he was now encroaching upon the period that was by far the most distressing memory of her life what he had just asked seemed to be a demand upon her to make everything clear i was so young lester she pleaded i was only eighteen i didnt know i used to go to the hotel where he was stopping and get his laundry and at the end of the week id take it to him again she paused and as he took a chair looking as if he expected to hear the whole story she continued we were so poor he used to give me money to give to my mother i didnt know she paused again totally unable to go on and he seeing that it would be impossible for her to explain without prompting took up his questioning again eliciting by degrees the whole pitiful story brander had intended to marry her he had written to her but before he could come to her he died the confession was complete it was followed by a period of five minutes in which lester said nothing at all he put his arm on the mantel and stared at the wall while jennie waited not knowing what would follow not wishing to make a single plea the clock ticked audibly lesters face betrayed no sign of either thought or feeling he was now quite calm quite sober wondering what he should do jennie was before him as the criminal at the bar he the righteous the moral the pure of heart was in the judgment seat now to sentence her to make up his mind what course of action he should pursue it was a disagreeable tangle to be sure something that a man of his position and wealth really ought not to have anything to do with this child the actuality of it put an almost unbearable face upon the whole matter and yet he was not quite prepared to speak he turned after a time the silvery tinkle of the french clock on the mantel striking three and causing him to become aware of jennie pale uncertain still standing as she had stood all this while better go to bed he said at last and fell again to pondering this difficult problem but jennie continued to stand there wideeyed expectant ready to hear at any moment his decision as to her fate she waited in vain however after a long time of musing he turned and went to the clothesrack near the door better go to bed he said indifferently im going out she turned instinctively feeling that even in this crisis there was some little service that she might render but he did not see her he went out vouchsafing no further speech she looked after him and as his footsteps sounded on the stair she felt as if she were doomed and hearing her own deathknell what had she done what would he do now she stood there a dissonance of despair and when the lower door clicked moved her hand out of the agony of her suppressed hopelessness gone she thought gone in the light of a late dawn she was still sitting there pondering her state far too urgent for idle tears chapter xxx the sullen philosophic lester was not so determined upon his future course of action as he appeared to be stern as was his mood he did not see after all exactly what grounds he had for complaint and yet the childs existence complicated matters considerably he did not like to see the evidence of jennies previous misdeeds walking about in the shape of a human being but as a matter of fact he admitted to himself that long ago he might have forced jennies story out of her if he had gone about it in earnest she would not have lied he knew that at the very outset he might have demanded the history of her past he had not done so well now it was too late the one thing it did fix in his mind was that it would be useless to ever think of marrying her it couldnt be done not by a man in his position the best solution of the problem was to make reasonable provision for jennie and then leave her he went to his hotel with his mind made up but he did not actually say to himself that he would do it at once it is an easy thing for a man to theorize in a situation of this kind quite another to act our comforts appetites and passions grow with usage and jennie was not only a comfort but an appetite with him almost four years of constant association had taught him so much about her and himself that he was not prepared to let go easily or quickly it was too much of a wrench he could think of it bustling about the work of a great organization during the daytime but when night came it was a different matter he could be lonely too he discovered much to his surprise and it disturbed him one of the things that interested him in this situation was jennies early theory that the intermingling of vesta with him and her in this new relationship would injure the child just how did she come by that feeling he wanted to know his place in the world was better than hers yet it dawned on him after a time that there might have been something in her point of view she did not know who he was or what he would do with her he might leave her shortly being uncertain she wished to protect her baby that wasnt so bad then again he was curious to know what the child was like the daughter of a man like senator brander might be somewhat of an infant he was a brilliant man and jennie was a charming woman he thought of this and while it irritated him it aroused his curiosity he ought to go back and see the child he was really entitled to a view of it but he hesitated because of his own attitude in the beginning it seemed to him that he really ought to quit and here he was parleying with himself the truth was that he couldnt these years of living with jennie had made him curiously dependent upon her who had ever been so close to him before his mother loved him but her attitude toward him had not so much to do with real love as with ambition his father well his father was a man like himself all of his sisters were distinctly wrapped up in their own affairs robert and he were temperamentally uncongenial with jennie he had really been happy he had truly lived she was necessary to him the longer he stayed away from her the more he wanted her he finally decided to have a straightout talk with her to arrive at some sort of understanding she ought to get the child and take care of it she must understand that he might eventually want to quit she ought to be made to feel that a definite change had taken place though no immediate break might occur that same evening he went out to the apartment jennie heard him enter and her heart began to flutter then she took her courage in both hands and went to meet him theres just one thing to be done about this as far as i can see began lester with characteristic directness get the child and bring her here where you can take care of her theres no use leaving her in the hands of strangers i will lester said jennie submissively i always wanted to very well then youd better do it at once he took an evening newspaper out of his pocket and strolled toward one of the front windows then he turned to her you and i might as well understand each other jennie he went on i can see how this thing came about it was a piece of foolishness on my part not to have asked you before and made you tell me it was silly for you to conceal it even if you didnt want the childs life mixed with mine you might have known that it couldnt be done thats neither here nor there though now the thing that i want to point out is that one cant live and hold a relationship such as ours without confidence you and i had that i thought i dont see my way clear to ever hold more than a tentative relationship with you on this basis the thing is too tangled theres too much cause for scandal i know said jennie now i dont propose to do anything hasty for my part i dont see why things cant go on about as they are certainly for the present but i want you to look the facts in the face jennie sighed i know lester she said i know he went to the window and stared out there were some trees in the yard where the darkness was settling he wondered how this would really come out for he liked a home atmosphere should he leave the apartment and go to his club youd better get the dinner he suggested after a time turning toward her irritably but he did not feel so distant as he looked it was a shame that life could not be more decently organized he strolled back to his lounge and jennie went about her duties she was thinking of vesta of her ungrateful attitude toward lester of his final decision never to marry her so that was how one dream had been wrecked by folly she spread the table lighted the pretty silver candles made his favorite biscuit put a small leg of lamb in the oven to roast and washed some lettuceleaves for a salad she had been a diligent student of a cookbook for some time and she had learned a good deal from her mother all the time she was wondering how the situation would work out he would leave her eventually no doubt of that he would go away and marry some one else oh well she thought finally he is not going to leave me right away that is something and i can bring vesta here she sighed as she carried the things to the table if life would only give her lester and vesta together but that hope was over chapter xxxi there was peace and quiet for some time after this storm jennie went the next day and brought vesta away with her the joy of the reunion between mother and child made up for many other worries now i can do by her as i ought she thought and three or four times during the day she found herself humming a little song lester came only occasionally at first he was trying to make himself believe that he ought to do something toward reforming his life toward bringing about that eventual separation which he had suggested he did not like the idea of a child being in this apartment particularly that particular child he fought his way through a period of calculated neglect and then began to return to the apartment more regularly in spite of all its drawbacks it was a place of quiet peace and very notable personal comfort during the first days of lesters return it was difficult for jennie to adjust matters so as to keep the playful nervous almost uncontrollable child from annoying the staid emphatic commercialminded man jennie gave vesta a severe talking to the first night lester telephoned that he was coming telling her that he was a very badtempered man who didnt like children and that she mustnt go near him you mustnt talk she said you mustnt ask questions let mamma ask you what you want and dont reach ever vesta agreed solemnly but her childish mind hardly grasped the full significance of the warning lester came at seven jennie who had taken great pains to array vesta as attractively as possible had gone into her bedroom to give her own toilet a last touch vesta was supposedly in the kitchen as a matter of fact she had followed her mother to the door of the sittingroom where now she could be plainly seen lester hung up his hat and coat then turning he caught his first glimpse the child looked very sweet he admitted that at a glance she was arrayed in a bluedotted white flannel dress with a soft roll collar and cuffs and the costume was completed by white stockings and shoes her corncolored ringlets hung gaily about her face blue eyes rosy lips rosy cheeks completed the picture lester stared almost inclined to say something but restrained himself vesta shyly retreated when jennie came out he commented on the fact that vesta had arrived rather sweetlooking child he said do you have much trouble in making her mind not much she returned jennie went on to the diningroom and lester overheard a scrap of their conversation who are he asked vesta sh thats your uncle lester didnt i tell you you mustnt talk are he your uncle no dear dont talk now run into the kitchen are he only my uncle yes now run along all right in spite of himself lester had to smile what might have followed if the child had been homely misshapen peevish or all three can scarcely be conjectured had jennie been less tactful even in the beginning he might have obtained a disagreeable impression as it was the natural beauty of the child combined with the mothers gentle diplomacy in keeping her in the background served to give him that fleeting glimpse of innocence and youth which is always pleasant the thought struck him that jennie had been the mother of a child all these years she had been separated from it for months at a time she had never even hinted at its existence and yet her affection for vesta was obviously great its queer he said shes a peculiar woman one morning lester was sitting in the parlor reading his paper when he thought he heard something stir he turned and was surprised to see a large blue eye fixed upon him through the crack of a neighboring door the effect was most disconcerting it was not like the ordinary eye which under such embarrassing circumstances would have been immediately withdrawn it kept its position with deliberate boldness he turned his paper solemnly and looked again there was the eye he turned it again still was the eye present he crossed his legs and looked again now the eye was gone this little episode unimportant in itself was yet informed with the saving grace of comedy a thing to which lester was especially responsive although not in the least inclined to relax his attitude of aloofness he found his mind in the minutest degree tickled by the mysterious appearance the corners of his mouth were animated by a desire to turn up he did not give way to the feeling and stuck by his paper but the incident remained very clearly in his mind the young wayfarer had made her first really important impression upon him not long after this lester was sitting one morning at breakfast calmly eating his chop and conning his newspaper when he was aroused by another visitation this time not quite so simple jennie had given vesta her breakfast and set her to amuse herself alone until lester should leave the house jennie was seated at the table pouring out the coffee when vesta suddenly appeared very businesslike in manner and marched through the room lester looked up and jennie colored and arose what is it vesta she inquired following her by this time however vesta had reached the kitchen secured a little broom and returned a droll determination lighting her face i want my little broom she exclaimed and marched sedately past at which manifestation of spirit lester again twitched internally this time allowing the slightest suggestion of a smile to play across his mouth the final effect of this intercourse was gradually to break down the feeling of distaste lester had for the child and to establish in its place a sort of tolerant recognition of her possibilities as a human being the developments of the next six months were of a kind to further relax the strain of opposition which still existed in lesters mind although not at all resigned to the somewhat tainted atmosphere in which he was living he yet found himself so comfortable that he could not persuade himself to give it up it was too much like a bed of down jennie was too worshipful the condition of unquestioned liberty so far as all his old social relationships were concerned coupled with the privilege of quiet simplicity and affection in the home was too inviting he lingered on and began to feel that perhaps it would be just as well to let matters rest as they were during this period his friendly relations with the little vesta insensibly strengthened he discovered that there was a real flavor of humor about vestas doings and so came to watch for its development she was forever doing something interesting and although jennie watched over her with a care that was in itself a revelation to him nevertheless vesta managed to elude every effort to suppress her and came straight home with her remarks once for example she was sawing away at a small piece of meat upon her large plate with her big knife when lester remarked to jennie that it might be advisable to get her a little breakfast set she can hardly handle these knives yes said vesta instantly i need a little knife my hand is just so very little she held it up jennie who never could tell what was to follow reached over and put it down while lester with difficulty restrained a desire to laugh another morning not long after she was watching jennie put the lumps of sugar in lesters cup when she broke in with i want two lumps in mine mamma no dearest replied jennie you dont need any in yours you have milk to drink uncle lester has two she protested yes returned jennie but youre only a little girl besides you mustnt say anything like that at the table it isnt nice uncle lester eats too much sugar was her immediate rejoinder at which that fine gourmet smiled broadly i dont know about that he put in for the first time deigning to answer her directly that sounds like the fox and grapes to me vesta smiled back at him and now that the ice was broken she chattered on unrestrainedly one thing led to another and at last lester felt as though in a way the little girl belonged to him he was willing even that she should share in such opportunities as his position and wealth might make possible provided of course that he stayed with jennie and that they worked out some arrangement which would not put him hopelessly out of touch with the world which was back of him and which he had to keep constantly in mind chapter xxxii the following spring the showrooms and warehouse were completed and lester removed his office to the new building heretofore he had been transacting all his business affairs at the grand pacific and the club from now on he felt himself to be firmly established in chicago as if that was to be his future home a large number of details were thrown upon him the control of a considerable office force and the handling of various important transactions it took away from him the need of traveling that duty going to amys husband under the direction of robert the latter was doing his best to push his personal interests not only through the influence he was bringing to bear upon his sisters but through his reorganization of the factory several men whom lester was personally fond of were in danger of elimination but lester did not hear of this and kane senior was inclined to give robert a free hand age was telling on him he was glad to see some one with a strong policy come up and take charge lester did not seem to mind apparently he and robert were on better terms than ever before matters might have gone on smoothly enough were it not for the fact that lesters private life with jennie was not a matter which could be permanently kept under cover at times he was seen driving with her by people who knew him in a social and commercial way he was for brazening it out on the ground that he was a single man and at liberty to associate with anybody he pleased jennie might be any young woman of good family in whom he was interested he did not propose to introduce her to anybody if he could help it and he always made it a point to be a fast traveler in driving in order that others might not attempt to detain and talk to him at the theater as has been said she was simply miss gerhardt the trouble was that many of his friends were also keen observers of life they had no quarrel to pick with lesters conduct only he had been seen in other cities in times past with this same woman she must be some one whom he was maintaining irregularly well what of it wealth and youthful spirits must have their fling rumors came to robert who however kept his own counsel if lester wanted to do this sort of thing well and good but there must come a time when there would be a showdown this came about in one form about a year and a half after lester and jennie had been living in the north side apartment it so happened that during a stretch of inclement weather in the fall lester was seized with a mild form of grip when he felt the first symptoms he thought that his indisposition would be a matter of short duration and tried to overcome it by taking a hot bath and a liberal dose of quinine but the infection was stronger than he counted on by morning he was flat on his back with a severe fever and a splitting headache his long period of association with jennie had made him incautious policy would have dictated that he should betake himself to his hotel and endure his sickness alone as a matter of fact he was very glad to be in the house with her he had to call up the office to say that he was indisposed and would not be down for a day or so then he yielded himself comfortably to her patient ministrations jennie of course was delighted to have lester with her sick or well she persuaded him to see a doctor and have him prescribe she brought him potions of hot lemonade and bathed his face and hands in cold water over and over later when he was recovering she made him appetizing cups of beeftea or gruel it was during this illness that the first real contretemps occurred lesters sister louise who had been visiting friends in st paul and who had written him that she might stop off to see him on her way decided upon an earlier return than she had originally planned while lester was sick at his apartment she arrived in chicago calling up the office and finding that he was not there and would not be down for several days she asked where he could be reached i think he is at his rooms in the grand pacific said an incautious secretary hes not feeling well louise a little disturbed telephoned to the grand pacific and was told that mr kane had not been there for several days did not as a matter of fact occupy his rooms more than one or two days a week piqued by this she telephoned his club it so happened that at the club there was a telephone boy who had called up the apartment a number of times for lester himself he had not been cautioned not to give its number as a matter of fact it had never been asked for by any one else when louise stated that she was lesters sister and was anxious to find him the boy replied i think he lives at schiller place whose address is that youre giving inquired a passing clerk mr kanes well dont be giving out addresses dont you know that yet the boy apologized but louise had hung up the receiver and was gone about an hour later curious as to this third residence of her brother louise arrived at schiller place ascending the steps it was a twoapartment house she saw the name of kane on the door leading to the second floor ringing the bell she was opened to by jennie who was surprised to see so fashionably attired a young woman this is mr kanes apartment i believe began louise condescendingly as she looked in at the open door behind jennie she was a little surprised to meet a young woman but her suspicions were as yet only vaguely aroused yes replied jennie hes sick i believe im his sister may i come in jennie had she had time to collect her thoughts would have tried to make some excuse but louise with the audacity of her birth and station swept past before jennie could say a word once inside louise looked about her inquiringly she found herself in the sittingroom which gave into the bedroom where lester was lying vesta happened to be playing in one corner of the room and stood up to eye the newcomer the open bedroom showed lester quite plainly lying in bed a window to the left of him his eyes closed oh there you are old fellow exclaimed louise whats ailing you she hurried on lester who at the sound of her voice had opened his eyes realized in an instant how things were he pulled himself up on one elbow but words failed him why hello louise he finally forced himself to say where did you come from st paul i came back sooner than i thought she answered lamely a sense of something wrong irritating her i had a hard time finding you too whos your she was about to say pretty housekeeper but turned to find jennie dazedly gathering up certain articles in the adjoining room and looking dreadfully distraught lester cleared his throat hopelessly his sister swept the place with an observing eye it took in the home atmosphere which was both pleasing and suggestive there was a dress of jennies lying across a chair in a familiar way which caused miss kane to draw herself up warily she looked at her brother who had a rather curious expression in his eyes he seemed slightly nonplussed but cool and defiant you shouldnt have come out here said lester finally before louise could give vent to the rising question in her mind why shouldnt i she exclaimed angered at the brazen confession youre my brother arent you why should you have any place that i couldnt come well i like that and from you to me listen louise went on lester drawing himself up further on one elbow you know as much about life as i do there is no need of our getting into an argument i didnt know you were coming or i would have made other arrangements other arrangements indeed she sneered i should think as much the idea she was greatly irritated to think that she had fallen into this trap it was really disgraceful of lester i wouldnt be so haughty about it he declared his color rising im not apologizing to you for my conduct im saying i would have made other arrangements which is a very different thing from begging your pardon if you dont want to be civil you neednt why lester kane she exclaimed her cheeks flaming i thought better of you honestly i did i should think you would be ashamed of yourself living here in open she paused without using the word and our friends scattered all over the city its terrible i thought you had more sense of decency and consideration decency nothing he flared i tell you im not apologizing to you if you dont like this you know what you can do oh she exclaimed this from my own brother and for the sake of that creature whose child is that she demanded savagely and yet curiously never mind its not mine if it were it wouldnt make any difference i wish you wouldnt busy yourself about my affairs jennie who had been moving about the diningroom beyond the sittingroom heard the cutting references to herself she winced with pain dont flatter yourself i wont any more retorted louise i should think though that you of all men would be above anything like this and that with a woman so obviously beneath you why i thought she was she was again going to add your housekeeper but she was interrupted by lester who was angry to the point of brutality never mind what you thought she was he growled shes better than some who do the socalled superior thinking i know what you think its neither here nor there i tell you im doing this and i dont care what you think i have to take the blame dont bother about me well i wont i assure you she flung back its quite plain that your family means nothing to you but if you had any sense of decency lester kane you would never let your sister be trapped into coming into a place like this im disgusted thats all and so will the others be when they hear of it she turned on her heel and walked scornfully out a withering look being reserved for jennie who had unfortunately stepped near the door of the diningroom vesta had disappeared jennie came in a little while later and closed the door she knew of nothing to say lester his thick hair pushed back from his vigorous face leaned back moodily on his pillow what a devilish trick of fortune he thought now she would go home and tell it to the family his father would know and his mother robert imogene amy all would hear he would have no explanation to make she had seen he stared at the wall meditatively meanwhile jennie moving about her duties also found food for reflection so this was her real position in another womans eyes now she could see what the world thought this family was as aloof from her as if it lived on another planet to his sisters and brothers his father and mother she was a bad woman a creature far beneath him socially far beneath him mentally and morally a creature of the streets and she had hoped somehow to rehabilitate herself in the eyes of the world it cut her as nothing before had ever done the thought tore a great gaping wound in her sensibilities she was really low and vile in her louises eyes in the worlds eyes basically so in lesters eyes how could it be otherwise she went about numb and still but the ache of defeat and disgrace was under it all oh if she could only see some way to make herself right with the world to live honorably to be decent how could that possibly be brought about it ought to be she knew that but how chapter xxxiii outraged in her family pride louise lost no time in returning to cincinnati where she told the story of her discovery embellished with many details according to her she was met at the door by a sillylooking whitefaced woman who did not even offer to invite her in when she announced her name but stood there looking just as guilty as a person possibly could lester also had acted shamefully having outbrazened the matter to her face when she had demanded to know whose the child was he had refused to tell her it isnt mine was all he would say oh dear oh dear exclaimed mrs kane who was the first to hear the story my son my lester how could he have done it and such a creature exclaimed louise emphatically as though the words needed to be reiterated to give them any shadow of reality i went there solely because i thought i could help him continued louise i thought when they said he was indisposed that he might be seriously ill how should i have known poor lester exclaimed her mother to think he would come to anything like that mrs kane turned the difficult problem over in her mind and having no previous experiences whereby to measure it telephoned for old archibald who came out from the factory and sat through the discussion with a solemn countenance so lester was living openly with a woman of whom they had never heard he would probably be as defiant and indifferent as his nature was strong the standpoint of parental authority was impossible lester was a centralized authority in himself and if any overtures for a change of conduct were to be made they would have to be very diplomatically executed archibald kane returned to the manufactory sore and disgusted but determined that something ought to be done he held a consultation with robert who confessed that he had heard disturbing rumors from time to time but had not wanted to say anything mrs kane suggested that robert might go to chicago and have a talk with lester he ought to see that this thing if continued is going to do him irreparable damage said mr kane he cannot hope to carry it off successfully nobody can he ought to marry her or he ought to quit i want you to tell him that for me all well and good said robert but whos going to convince him im sure i dont want the job i hope to said old archibald eventually but youd better go up and try anyhow it cant do any harm he might come to his senses i dont believe it replied robert hes a strong man you see how much good talk does down here still ill go if it will relieve your feelings any mother wants it yes yes said his father distractedly better go accordingly robert went without allowing himself to anticipate any particular measure of success in this adventure he rode pleasantly into chicago confident in the reflection that he had all the powers of morality and justice on his side upon roberts arrival the third morning after louises interview he called up the warerooms but lester was not there he then telephoned to the house and tactfully made an appointment lester was still indisposed but he preferred to come down to the office and he did he met robert in his cheerful nonchalant way and together they talked business for a time then followed a pregnant silence well i suppose you know what brought me up here began robert tentatively i think i could make a guess at it lester replied they were all very much worried over the fact that you were sick mother particularly youre not in any danger of having a relapse are you i think not louise said there was some sort of a peculiar menage she ran into up here youre not married are you no the young woman louise saw is just robert waved his hand expressively lester nodded i dont want to be inquisitive lester i didnt come up for that im simply here because the family felt that i ought to come mother was so very much distressed that i couldnt do less than see you for her sake he paused and lester touched by the fairness and respect of his attitude felt that mere courtesy at least made some explanation due i dont know that anything i can say will help matters much he replied thoughtfully theres really nothing to be said i have the woman and the family has its objections the chief difficulty about the thing seems to be the bad luck in being found out he stopped and robert turned over the substance of this worldly reasoning in his mind lester was very calm about it he seemed as usual to be most convincingly sane youre not contemplating marrying her are you queried robert hesitatingly i hadnt come to that answered lester coolly they looked at each other quietly for a moment and then robert turned his glance to the distant scene of the city its useless to ask whether you are seriously in love with her i suppose ventured robert i dont know whether id be able to discuss that divine afflatus with you or not returned lester with a touch of grim humor i have never experienced the sensation myself all i know is that the lady is very pleasing to me well its all a question of your own wellbeing and the familys lester went on robert after another pause morality doesnt seem to figure in it anyway at least you and i cant discuss that together your feelings on that score naturally relate to you alone but the matter of your own personal welfare seems to me to be substantial enough ground to base a plea on the familys feelings and pride are also fairly important fathers the kind of a man who sets more store by the honor of his family than most men you know that as well as i do of course i know how father feels about it returned lester the whole business is as clear to me as it is to any of you though offhand i dont see just whats to be done about it these matters arent always of a days growth and they cant be settled in a day the girls here to a certain extent im responsible that she is here while im not willing to go into details theres always more in these affairs than appears on the court calendar of course i dont know what your relations with her have been returned robert and im not curious to know but it does look like a bit of injustice all around dont you think unless you intend to marry her this last was put forth as a feeler i might be willing to agree to that too was lesters baffling reply if anything were to be gained by it the point is the woman is here and the family is in possession of the fact now if there is anything to be done i have to do it there isnt anybody else who can act for me in this matter lester lapsed into a silence and robert rose and paced the floor coming back after a time to say you say you havent any idea of marrying her or rather you havent come to it i wouldnt lester it seems to me you would be making the mistake of your life from every point of view i dont want to orate but a man of your position has so much to lose you cant afford to do it aside from family considerations you have too much at stake youd be simply throwing your life away he paused with his right hand held out before him as was customary when he was deeply in earnest and lester felt the candor and simplicity of this appeal robert was not criticizing him now he was making an appeal to him and this was somewhat different the appeal passed without comment however and then robert began on a new tack this time picturing old archibalds fondness for lester and the hope he had always entertained that he would marry some welltodo cincinnati girl catholic if agreeable to him but at least worthy of his station and mrs kane felt the same way surely lester must realize that i know just how all of them feel about it lester interrupted at last but i dont see that anythings to be done right now you mean that you dont think it would be policy for you to give her up just at present i mean that shes been exceptionally good to me and that im morally under obligations to do the best i can by her what that may be i cant tell to live with her inquired robert coolly certainly not to turn her out bag and baggage if she has been accustomed to live with me replied lester robert sat down again as if he considered his recent appeal futile cant family reasons persuade you to make some amicable arrangements with her and let her go not without due consideration of the matter no you dont think you could hold out some hope that the thing will end quickly something that would give me a reasonable excuse for softening down the pain of it to the family i would be perfectly willing to do anything which would take away the edge of this thing for the family but the truths the truth and i cant see any room for equivocation between you and me as ive said before these relationships are involved with things which make it impossible to discuss them unfair to me unfair to the woman no one can see how they are to be handled except the people that are in them and even they cant always see id be a damned dog to stand up here and give you my word to do anything except the best i can lester stopped and now robert rose and paced the floor again only to come back after a time and say you dont think theres anything to be done just at present not at present very well then i expect i might as well be going i dont know that theres anything else we can talk about wont you stay and take lunch with me i think i might manage to get down to the hotel if youll stay no thank you answered robert i believe i can make that one oclock train for cincinnati ill try anyhow they stood before each other now lester pale and rather flaccid robert clear waxlike wellknit and shrewd and one could see the difference time had already made robert was the clean decisive man lester the man of doubts robert was the spirit of business energy and integrity embodied lester the spirit of commercial selfsufficiency looking at life with an uncertain eye together they made a striking picture which was none the less powerful for the thoughts that were now running through their minds well said the older brother after a time i dont suppose there is anything more i can say i had hoped to make you feel just as we do about this thing but of course you are your own best judge of this if you dont see it now nothing i could say would make you it strikes me as a very bad move on your part though lester listened he said nothing but his face expressed an unchanged purpose robert turned for his hat and they walked to the office door together ill put the best face i can on it said robert and walked out chapter xxxiv in this world of ours the activities of animal life seem to be limited to a plane or circle as if that were an inherent necessity to the creatures of a planet which is perforce compelled to swing about the sun a fish for instance may not pass out of the circle of the seas without courting annihilation a bird may not enter the domain of the fishes without paying for it dearly from the parasites of the flowers to the monsters of the jungle and the deep we see clearly the circumscribed nature of their movements the emphatic manner in which life has limited them to a sphere and we are content to note the ludicrous and invariably fatal results which attend any effort on their part to depart from their environment in the case of man however the operation of this theory of limitations has not as yet been so clearly observed the laws governing our social life are not so clearly understood as to permit of a clear generalization still the opinions pleas and judgments of society serve as boundaries which are none the less real for being intangible when men or women err that is pass out from the sphere in which they are accustomed to move it is not as if the bird had intruded itself into the water or the wild animal into the haunts of man annihilation is not the immediate result people may do no more than elevate their eyebrows in astonishment laugh sarcastically lift up their hands in protest and yet so well defined is the sphere of social activity that he who departs from it is doomed born and bred in this environment the individual is practically unfitted for any other state he is like a bird accustomed to a certain density of atmosphere and which cannot live comfortably at either higher or lower level lester sat down in his easychair by the window after his brother had gone and gazed ruminatively out over the flourishing city yonder was spread out before him life with its concomitant phases of energy hope prosperity and pleasure and here he was suddenly struck by a wind of misfortune and blown aside for the time being his prospects and purposes dissipated could he continue as cheerily in the paths he had hitherto pursued would not his relations with jennie be necessarily affected by this sudden tide of opposition was not his own home now a thing of the past so far as his old easygoing relationship was concerned all the atmosphere of unstained affection would be gone out of it now that hearty look of approval which used to dwell in his fathers eye would it be there any longer robert his relations with the manufactory everything that was a part of his old life had been affected by this sudden intrusion of louise its unfortunate was all that he thought to himself and therewith turned from what he considered senseless brooding to the consideration of what if anything was to be done im thinking id take a run up to mt clemens tomorrow or thursday anyhow if i feel strong enough he said to jennie after he had returned im not feeling as well as i might a few days will do me good he wanted to get off by himself and think jennie packed his bag for him at the given time and he departed but he was in a sullen meditative mood during the week that followed he had ample time to think it all over the result of his cogitations being that there was no need of making a decisive move at present a few weeks more one way or the other could not make any practical difference neither robert nor any other member of the family was at all likely to seek another conference with him his business relations would necessarily go on as usual since they were coupled with the welfare of the manufactory certainly no attempt to coerce him would be attempted but the consciousness that he was at hopeless variance with his family weighed upon him bad business he meditated bad business but he did not change for the period of a whole year this unsatisfactory state of affairs continued lester did not go home for six months then an important business conference demanding his presence he appeared and carried it off quite as though nothing important had happened his mother kissed him affectionately if a little sadly his father gave him his customary greeting a hearty handshake robert louise amy imogene concertedly though without any verbal understanding agreed to ignore the one real issue but the feeling of estrangement was there and it persisted hereafter his visits to cincinnati were as few and far between as he could possibly make them chapter xxxv in the meantime jennie had been going through a moral crisis of her own for the first time in her life aside from the family attitude which had afflicted her greatly she realized what the world thought of her she was bad she knew that she had yielded on two occasions to the force of circumstances which might have been fought out differently if only she had had more courage if she did not always have this haunting sense of fear if she could only make up her mind to do the right thing lester would never marry her why should he she loved him but she could leave him and it would be better for him probably her father would live with her if she went back to cleveland he would honor her for at last taking a decent stand yet the thought of leaving lester was a terrible one to her he had been so good as for her father she was not sure whether he would receive her or not after the tragic visit of louise she began to think of saving a little money laying it aside as best she could from her allowance lester was generous and she had been able to send home regularly fifteen dollars a week to maintain the family as much as they had lived on before without any help from the outside she spent twenty dollars to maintain the table for lester required the best of everything fruits meats desserts liquors and what not the rent was fiftyfive dollars with clothes and extras a varying sum lester gave her fifty dollars a week but somehow it had all gone she thought how she might economize but this seemed wrong better go without taking anything if she were going was the thought that came to her it was the only decent thing to do she thought over this week after week after the advent of louise trying to nerve herself to the point where she could speak or act lester was consistently generous and kind but she felt at times that he himself might wish it he was thoughtful abstracted since the scene with louise it seemed to her that he had been a little different if she could only say to him that she was not satisfied with the way she was living and then leave but he himself had plainly indicated after his discovery of vesta that her feelings on that score could not matter so very much to him since he thought the presence of the child would definitely interfere with his ever marrying her it was her presence he wanted on another basis and he was so forceful she could not argue with him very well she decided if she went it would be best to write a letter and tell him why then maybe when he knew how she felt he would forgive her and think nothing more about it the condition of the gerhardt family was not improving since jennie had left martha had married after several years of teaching in the public schools of cleveland she had met a young architect and they were united after a short engagement martha had been always a little ashamed of her family and now when this new life dawned she was anxious to keep the connection as slight as possible she barely notified the members of the family of the approaching marriage jennie not at all and to the actual ceremony she invited only bass and george gerhardt veronica and william resented the slight gerhardt ventured upon no comment he had had too many rebuffs but veronica was angry she hoped that life would give her an opportunity to pay her sister off william of course did not mind particularly he was interested in the possibilities of becoming an electrical engineer a career which one of his schoolteachers had pointed out to him as being attractive and promising jennie heard of marthas marriage after it was all over a note from veronica giving her the main details she was glad from one point of view but realized that her brothers and sisters were drifting away from her a little while after marthas marriage veronica and william went to reside with george a break which was brought about by the attitude of gerhardt himself ever since his wifes death and the departure of the other children he had been subject to moods of profound gloom from which he was not easily aroused life it seemed was drawing to a close for him although he was only sixtyfive years of age the earthly ambitions he had once cherished were gone forever he saw sebastian martha and george out in the world practically ignoring him contributing nothing at all to a home which should never have taken a dollar from jennie veronica and william were restless they objected to leaving school and going to work apparently preferring to live on money which gerhardt had long since concluded was not being come by honestly he was now pretty well satisfied as to the true relations of jennie and lester at first he had believed them to be married but the way lester had neglected jennie for long periods the humbleness with which she ran at his beck and call her fear of telling him about vesta somehow it all pointed to the same thing she had not been married at home gerhardt had never had sight of her marriage certificate since she was away she might have been married but he did not believe it the real trouble was that gerhardt had grown intensely morose and crotchety and it was becoming impossible for young people to live with him veronica and william felt it they resented the way in which he took charge of the expenditures after martha left he accused them of spending too much on clothes and amusements he insisted that a smaller house should be taken and he regularly sequestered a part of the money which jennie sent for what purpose they could hardly guess as a matter of fact gerhardt was saving as much as possible in order to repay jennie eventually he thought it was sinful to go on in this way and this was his one method out side of his meager earnings to redeem himself if his other children had acted rightly by him he felt that he would not now be left in his old age the recipient of charity from one who despite her other good qualities was certainly not leading a righteous life so they quarreled it ended one winter month when george agreed to receive his complaining brother and sister on condition that they should get something to do gerhardt was nonplussed for a moment but invited them to take the furniture and go their way his generosity shamed them for the moment they even tentatively invited him to come and live with them but this he would not do he would ask the foreman of the mill he watched for the privilege of sleeping in some outoftheway garret he was always liked and trusted and this would save him a little money so in a fit of pique he did this and there was seen the spectacle of an old man watching through a dreary season of nights in a lonely trafficless neighborhood while the city pursued its gaiety elsewhere he had a wee small corner in the topmost loft of a warehouse away from the tear and grind of the factory proper here gerhardt slept by day in the afternoon he would take a little walk strolling toward the business center or out along the banks of the cuyahoga or the lake as a rule his hands were below his back his brow bent in meditation he would even talk to himself a little an occasional by chops or so it is being indicative of his dreary mood at dusk he would return taking his stand at the lonely gate which was his post of duty his meals he secured at a nearby workingmens boardinghouse such as he felt he must have the nature of the old germans reflections at this time were of a peculiarly subtle and somber character what was this thing life what did it all come to after the struggle and the worry and the grieving where does it all go to people die you hear nothing more from them his wife now she had gone where had her spirit taken its flight yet he continued to hold some strongly dogmatic convictions he believed there was a hell and that people who sinned would go there how about mrs gerhardt how about jennie he believed that both had sinned woefully he believed that the just would be rewarded in heaven but who were the just mrs gerhardt had not had a bad heart jennie was the soul of generosity take his son sebastian sebastian was a good boy but he was cold and certainly indifferent to his father take martha she was ambitious but obviously selfish somehow the children outside of jennie seemed selfcentered bass walked off when he got married and did nothing more for anybody martha insisted that she needed all she made to live on george had contributed for a little while but had finally refused to help out veronica and william had been content to live on jennies money so long as he would allow it and yet they knew it was not right his very existence was it not a commentary on the selfishness of his children and he was getting so old he shook his head mystery of mysteries life was truly strange and dark and uncertain still he did not want to go and live with any of his children actually they were not worthy of him none but jennie and she was not good so he grieved this woeful condition of affairs was not made known to jennie for some time she had been sending her letters to martha but on her leaving jennie had been writing directly to gerhardt after veronicas departure gerhardt wrote to jennie saying that there was no need of sending any more money veronica and william were going to live with george he himself had a good place in a factory and would live there a little while he returned her a moderate sum that he had saved one hundred and fifteen dollars with the word that he would not need it jennie did not understand but as the others did not write she was not sure but what it might be all right her father was so determined but by degrees however a sense of what it really must mean overtook her a sense of something wrong and she worried hesitating between leaving lester and going to see about her father whether she left him or not would he come with her not here certainly if she were married yes possibly if she were alone probably yet if she did not get some work which paid well they would have a difficult time it was the same old problem what could she do nevertheless she decided to act if she could get five or six dollars a week they could live this hundred and fifteen dollars which gerhardt had saved would tide them over the worst difficulties perhaps chapter xxxvi the trouble with jennies plan was that it did not definitely take into consideration lesters attitude he did care for her in an elemental way but he was hedged about by the ideas of the conventional world in which he had been reared to say that he loved her well enough to take her for better or worse to legalize her anomalous position and to face the world bravely with the fact that he had chosen a wife who suited him was perhaps going a little too far but he did really care for her and he was not in a mood at this particular time to contemplate parting with her for good lester was getting along to that time of life when his ideas of womanhood were fixed and not subject to change thus far on his own plane and within the circle of his own associates he had met no one who appealed to him as did jennie she was gentle intelligent gracious a handmaiden to his every need and he had taught her the little customs of polite society until she was as agreeable a companion as he cared to have he was comfortable he was satisfied why seek further but jennies restlessness increased day by day she tried writing out her views and started a half dozen letters before she finally worded one which seemed partially at least to express her feelings it was a long letter for her and it ran as follows lester dear when you get this i wont be here and i want you not to think harshly of me until you have read it all i am taking vesta and leaving and i think it is really better that i should lester i ought to do it you know when you met me we were very poor and my condition was such that i didnt think any good man would ever want me when you came along and told me you loved me i was hardly able to think just what i ought to do you made me love you lester in spite of myself you know i told you that i oughtnt to do anything wrong any more and that i wasnt good but somehow when you were near me i couldnt think just right and i didnt see just how i was to get away from you papa was sick at home that time and there was hardly anything in the house to eat we were all doing so poorly my brother george didnt have good shoes and mamma was so worried i have often thought lester if mamma had not been compelled to worry so much she might be alive today i thought if you liked me and i really liked you i love you lester maybe it wouldnt make so much difference about me you know you told me right away you would like to help my family and i felt that maybe that would be the right thing to do we were so terribly poor lester dear i am ashamed to leave you this way it seems so mean but if you knew how i have been feeling these days you would forgive me oh i love you lester i do i do but for months past ever since your sister came i felt that i was doing wrong and that i oughtnt to go on doing it for i know how terribly wrong it is it was wrong for me ever to have anything to do with senator brander but i was such a girl then i hardly knew what i was doing it was wrong of me not to tell you about vesta when i first met you though i thought i was doing right when i did it it was terribly wrong of me to keep her here all that time concealed lester but i was afraid of you then afraid of what you would say and do when your sister louise came it all came over me somehow clearly and i have never been able to think right about it since it cant be right lester but i dont blame you i blame myself i dont ask you to marry me lester i know how you feel about me and how you feel about your family and i dont think it would be right they would never want you to do it and it isnt right that i should ask you at the same time i know i oughtnt to go on living this way vesta is getting along where she understands everything she thinks you are her really truly uncle i have thought of it all so much i have thought a number of times that i would try to talk to you about it but you frighten me when you get serious and i dont seem to be able to say what i want to so i thought if i could just write you this and then go you would understand you do lester dont you you wont be angry with me i know its for the best for you and for me i ought to do it please forgive me lester please and dont think of me any more i will get along but i love you oh yes i do and i will never be grateful enough for all you have done for me i wish you all the luck that can come to you please forgive me lester i love you yes i do i love you jennie p s i expect to go to cleveland with papa he needs me he is all alone but dont come for me lester its best that you shouldnt she put this in an envelope sealed it and having hidden it in her bosom for the time being awaited the hour when she could conveniently take her departure it was several days before she could bring herself to the actual execution of the plan but one afternoon lester having telephoned that he would not be home for a day or two she packed some necessary garments for herself and vesta in several trunks and sent for an expressman she thought of telegraphing her father that she was coming but seeing he had no home she thought it would be just as well to go and find him george and veronica had not taken all the furniture the major portion of it was in storage so gerhard t had written she might take that and furnish a little home or flat she was ready for the end waiting for the expressman when the door opened and in walked lester for some unforeseen reason he had changed his mind he was not in the least psychic or intuitional but on this occasion his feelings had served him a peculiar turn he had thought of going for a days duckshooting with some friends in the kankakee marshes south of chicago but had finally changed his mind he even decided to go out to the house early what prompted this he could not have said as he neared the house he felt a little peculiar about coming home so early then at the sight of the two trunks standing in the middle of the room he stood dumfounded what did it mean jennie dressed and ready to depart and vesta in a similar condition he stared in amazement his brown eyes keen in inquiry where are you going he asked why why she began falling back i was going away where to i thought i would go to cleveland she replied what for why why i meant to tell you lester that i didnt think i ought to stay here any longer this way i didnt think it was right i thought id tell you but i couldnt i wrote you a letter a letter he exclaimed what the deuce are you talking about where is the letter there she said mechanically pointing to a small centertable where the letter lay conspicuous on a large book and you were really going to leave me jennie with just a letter said lester his voice hardening a little as he spoke i swear to heaven you are beyond me whats the point he tore open the envelope and looked at the beginning better send vesta from the room he suggested she obeyed then she came back and stood there pale and wideeyed looking at the wall at the trunks and at him lester read the letter thoughtfully he shifted his position once or twice then dropped the paper on the floor well ill tell you jennie he said finally looking at her curiously and wondering just what he was going to say here again was his chance to end this relationship if he wished he couldnt feel that he did wish it seeing how peacefully things were running they had gone so far together it seemed ridiculous to quit now he truly loved her there was no doubt of that still he did not want to marry her could not very well she knew that her letter said as much you have this thing wrong he went on slowly i dont know what comes over you at times but you dont view the situation right ive told you before that i cant marry you not now anyhow there are too many big things involved in this which you dont know anything about i love you you know that but my family has to be taken into consideration and the business you cant see the difficulties raised on these scores but i can now i dont want you to leave me i care too much about you i cant prevent you of course you can go if you want to but i dont think you ought to want to you dont really do you sit down a minute jennie who had been counting on getting away without being seen was now thoroughly nonplussed to have him begin a quiet argument a plea as it were it hurt her he lester pleading with her and she loved him so she went over to him and he took her hand now listen he said theres really nothing to be gained by your leaving me at present where did you say you were going to cleveland she replied well how did you expect to get along i thought id take papa if hed come with me hes alone now and get something to do maybe well what can you do jennie different from what you ever have done you wouldnt expect to be a ladys maid again would you or clerk in a store i thought i might get some place as a housekeeper she suggested she had been counting up her possibilities and this was the most promising idea that had occurred to her no no he grumbled shaking his head theres nothing to that theres nothing in this whole move of yours except a notion why you wont be any better off morally than you are right now you cant undo the past it doesnt make any difference anyhow i cant marry you now i might in the future but i cant tell anything about that and i dont want to promise anything youre not going to leave me though with my consent and if you were going i wouldnt have you dropping back into any such thing as youre contemplating ill make some provision for you you dont really want to leave me do you jennie against lesters strong personality and vigorous protest jennies own conclusions and decisions went to pieces just the pressure of his hand was enough to upset her now she began to cry dont cry jennie he said this thing may work out better than you think let it rest for a while take off your things youre not going to leave me any more are you nooo she sobbed he took her in his lap let things rest as they are he went on its a curious world things cant be adjusted in a minute they may work out im putting up with some things myself that i ordinarily wouldnt stand for he finally saw her restored to comparative calmness smiling sadly through her tears now you put those things away he said genially pointing to the trunks besides i want you to promise me one thing whats that asked jennie no more concealment of anything do you hear no more thinking things out for yourself and acting without my knowing anything about it if you have anything on your mind i want you to come out with it im not going to eat you talk to me about whatever is troubling you ill help you solve it or if i cant at least there wont be any concealment between us i know lester she said earnestly looking him straight in the eyes i promise ill never conceal anything any more truly i wont ive been afraid but i wont be now you can trust me that sounds like what you ought to be he replied i know you will and he let her go a few days later and in consequence of this agreement the future of gerhardt came up for discussion jennie had been worrying about him for several days now it occurred to her that this was something to talk over with lester accordingly she explained one night at dinner what had happened in cleveland i know he is very unhappy there all alone she said and i hate to think of it i was going to get him if i went back to cleveland now i dont know what to do about it why dont you send him some money he inquired he wont take any more money from me lester she explained he thinks im not good not acting right he doesnt believe im married he has pretty good reason hasnt he said lester calmly i hate to think of him sleeping in a factory hes so old and lonely whats the matter with the rest of the family in cleveland wont they do anything for him wheres your brother bass i think maybe they dont want him hes so cross she said simply i hardly know what to suggest in that case smiled lester the old gentleman oughtnt to be so fussy i know she said but hes old now and he has had so much trouble lester ruminated for a while toying with his fork ill tell you what ive been thinking jennie he said finally theres no use living this way any longer if were going to stick it out ive been thinking that we might take a house out in hyde park its something of a run from the office but im not much for this apartment life you and vesta would be better off for a yard in that case you might bring your father on to live with us he couldnt do any harm pottering about indeed he might help keep things straight oh that would just suit papa if hed come she replied he loves to fix things and hed cut the grass and look after the furnace but he wont come unless hes sure im married i dont know how that could be arranged unless you could show the old gentleman a marriage certificate he seems to want something that cant be produced very well a steady job hed have running the furnace of a country house he added meditatively jennie did not notice the grimness of the jest she was too busy thinking what a tangle she had made of her life gerhardt would not come now even if they had a lovely home to share with him and yet he ought to be with vesta again she would make him happy she remained lost in a sad abstraction until lester following the drift of her thoughts said i dont see how it can be arranged marriage certificate blanks arent easily procurable its bad business a criminal offense to forge one i believe i wouldnt want to be mixed up in that sort of thing oh i dont want you to do anything like that lester im just sorry papa is so stubborn when he gets a notion you cant change him suppose we wait until we get settled after moving he suggested then you can go to cleveland and talk to him personally you might be able to persuade him he liked her attitude toward her father it was so decent that he rather wished he could help her carry out her scheme while not very interesting gerhardt was not objectionable to lester and if the old man wanted to do the odd jobs around a big place why not chapter xxxvii the plan for a residence in hyde park was not long in taking shape after several weeks had passed and things had quieted down again lester invited jennie to go with him to south hyde park to look for a house on the first trip they found something which seemed to suit admirably an oldtime home of eleven large rooms set in a lawn fully two hundred feet square and shaded by trees which had been planted when the city was young it was ornate homelike peaceful jennie was fascinated by the sense of space and country although depressed by the reflection that she was not entering her new home under the right auspices she had vaguely hoped that in planning to go away she was bringing about a condition under which lester might have come after her and married her now all that was over she had promised to stay and she would have to make the best of it she suggested that they would never know what to do with so much room but he waved that aside we will very likely have people in now and then he said we can furnish it up anyhow and see how it looks he had the agent make out a fiveyear lease with an option for renewal and set at once the forces to work to put the establishment in order the house was painted and decorated the lawn put in order and everything done to give the place a trim and satisfactory appearance there was a large comfortable library and sittingroom a big diningroom a handsome receptionhall a parlor a large kitchen servingroom and in fact all the groundfloor essentials of a comfortable home on the second floor were bedrooms baths and the maids room it was all very comfortable and harmonious and jennie took an immense pride and pleasure in getting things in order immediately after moving in jennie with lesters permission wrote to her father asking him to come to her she did not say that she was married but left it to be inferred she descanted on the beauty of the neighborhood the size of the yard and the manifold conveniences of the establishment it is so very nice she added you would like it papa vesta is here and goes to school every day wont you come and stay with us its so much better than living in a factory and i would like to have you so gerhardt read this letter with a solemn countenance was it really true would they be taking a larger house if they were not permanently united after all these years and all this lying could he have been mistaken well it was high time but should he go he had lived alone this long time now should he go to chicago and live with jennie her appeal did touch him but somehow he decided against it that would be too generous an acknowledgment of the fact that there had been fault on his side as well as on hers jennie was disappointed at gerhardts refusal she talked it over with lester and decided that she would go on to cleveland and see him accordingly she made the trip hunted up the factory a great rumbling furniture concern in one of the poorest sections of the city and inquired at the office for her father the clerk directed her to a distant warehouse and gerhardt was informed that a lady wished to see him he crawled out of his humble cot and came down curious as to who it could be when jennie saw him in his dusty baggy clothes his hair gray his eye brows shaggy coming out of the dark door a keen sense of the pathetic moved her again poor papa she thought he came toward her his inquisitorial eye softened a little by his consciousness of the affection that had inspired her visit what are you come for he asked cautiously i want you to come home with me papa she pleaded yearningly i dont want you to stay here any more i cant think of you living alone any longer so he said nonplussed that brings you yes she replied wont you dont stay here i have a good bed he explained by way of apology for his state i know she replied but we have a good home now and vesta is there wont you come lester wants you to tell me one thing he demanded are you married yes she replied lying hopelessly i have been married a long time you can ask lester when you come she could scarcely look him in the face but she managed somehow and he believed her well he said it is time wont you come papa she pleaded he threw out his hands after his characteristic manner the urgency of her appeal touched him to the quick yes i come he said and turned but she saw by his shoulders what was happening he was crying now papa she pleaded for answer he walked back into the dark warehouse to get his things chapter xxxviii gerhardt having become an inmate of the hyde park home at once bestirred himself about the labors which he felt instinctively concerned him he took charge of the furnace and the yard outraged at the thought that good money should be paid to any outsider when he had nothing to do the trees he declared to jennie were in a dreadful condition if lester would get him a pruning knife and a saw he would attend to them in the spring in germany they knew how to care for such things but these americans were so shiftless then he wanted tools and nails and in time all the closets and shelves were put in order he found a lutheran church almost two miles away and declared that it was better than the one in cleveland the pastor of course was a heavensent son of divinity and nothing would do but that vesta must go to church with him regularly jennie and lester settled down into the new order of living with some misgivings certain difficulties were sure to arise on the north side it had been easy for jennie to shun neighbors and say nothing now they were occupying a house of some pretensions their immediate neighbors would feel it their duty to call and jennie would have to play the part of an experienced hostess she and lester had talked this situation over it might as well be understood here he said that they were husband and wife vesta was to be introduced as jennies daughter by her first marriage her husband a mr stover her mothers maiden name having died immediately after the childs birth lester of course was the stepfather this particular neighborhood was so far from the fashionable heart of chicago that lester did not expect to run into many of his friends he explained to jennie the ordinary formalities of social intercourse so that when the first visitor called jennie might be prepared to receive her within a fortnight this first visitor arrived in the person of mrs jacob stendahl a woman of considerable importance in this particular section she lived five doors from jennie the houses of the neighborhood were all set in spacious lawns and drove up in her carriage on her return from her shopping one afternoon is mrs kane in she asked of jeannette the new maid i think so mam answered the girl wont you let me have your card the card was given and taken to jennie who looked at it curiously when jennie came into the parlor mrs stendahl a tall dark inquisitivelooking woman greeted her most cordially i thought i would take the liberty of intruding on you she said most winningly i am one of your neighbors i live on the other side of the street some few doors up perhaps you have seen the house the one with the white stone gateposts oh yes indeed replied jennie i know it well mr kane and i were admiring it the first day we came out here i know of your husband of course by reputation my husband is connected with the wilkes frog and switch company jennie bowed her head she knew that the latter concern must be something important and profitable from the way in which mrs stendahl spoke of it we have lived here quite a number of years and i know how you must feel coming as a total stranger to a new section of the city i hope you will find time to come in and see me some afternoon i shall be most pleased my regular reception day is thursday indeed i shall answered jennie a little nervously for the ordeal was a trying one i appreciate your goodness in calling mr kane is very busy as a rule but when he is at home i am sure he would be most pleased to meet you and your husband you must both come over some evening replied mrs stendahl we lead a very quiet life my husband is not much for social gatherings but we enjoy our neighborhood friends jennie smiled her assurances of goodwill she accompanied mrs stendahl to the door and shook hands with her im so glad to find you so charming observed mrs stendahl frankly oh thank you said jennie flushing a little im sure i dont deserve so much praise well now i will expect you some afternoon goodby and she waved a gracious farewell that wasnt so bad thought jennie as she watched mrs stendahl drive away she is very nice i think ill tell lester about her among the other callers were a mr and mrs carmichael burke a mrs hanson field and a mrs timothy ballinger all of whom left cards or stayed to chat a few minutes jennie found herself taken quite seriously as a woman of importance and she did her best to support the dignity of her position and indeed she did exceptionally well she was most hospitable and gracious she had a kindly smile and a manner wholly natural she succeeded in making a most favorable impression she explained to her guests that she had been living on the north side until recently that her husband mr kane had long wanted to have a home in hyde park that her father and daughter were living here and that lester was the childs stepfather she said she hoped to repay all these nice attentions and to be a good neighbor lester heard about these calls in the evening for he did not care to meet these people jennie came to enjoy it in a mild way she liked making new friends and she was hoping that something definite could be worked out here which would make lester look upon her as a good wife and an ideal companion perhaps some day he might really want to marry her first impressions are not always permanent as jennie was soon to discover the neighborhood had accepted her perhaps a little too hastily and now rumors began to fly about a mrs sommerville calling on mrs craig one of jennies near neighbors intimated that she knew who lester was oh yes indeed you know my dear she went on his reputation is just a little she raised her eyebrows and her hand at the same time you dont say commented her friend curiously he looks like such a staid conservative person oh no doubt in a way he is went on mrs sommerville his family is of the very best there was some young woman he went with so my husband tells me i dont know whether this is the one or not but she was introduced as a miss gorwood or some such name as that when they were living together as husband and wife on the north side tst tst tst clicked mrs craig with her tongue at this astonishing news you dont tell me come to think of it it must be the same woman her fathers name is gerhardt gerhardt exclaimed mrs sommerville yes thats the name it seems to me that there was some earlier scandal in connection with her at least there was a child whether he married her afterward or not i dont know anyhow i understand his family will not have anything to do with her how very interesting exclaimed mrs craig and to think he should have married her afterward if he really did im sure you cant tell with whom youre coming in contact these days can you its so true life does get badly mixed at times she appears to be a charming woman delightful exclaimed mrs craig quite naive i was really taken with her well it may be went on her guest that this isnt the same woman after all i may be mistaken oh i hardly think so gerhardt she told me they had been living on the north side then im sure its the same person how curious that you should speak of her it is indeed went on mrs craig who was speculating as to what her attitude toward jennie should be in the future other rumors came from other sources there were people who had seen jennie and lester out driving on the north side who had been introduced to her as miss gerhardt who knew what the kane family thought of course her present position the handsome house the wealth of lester the beauty of vesta all these things helped to soften the situation she was apparently too circumspect too much the good wife and mother too really nice to be angry with but she had a past and that had to be taken into consideration an opening bolt of the coming storm fell upon jennie one day when vesta returning from school suddenly asked mamma who was my papa his name was stover dear replied her mother struck at once by the thought that there might have been some criticism that some one must have been saying something why do you ask where was i born continued vesta ignoring the last inquiry and interested in clearing up her own identity in columbus ohio pet why anita ballinger said i didnt have any papa and that you werent ever married when you had me she said i wasnt a really truly girl at all just a nobody she made me so mad i slapped her jennies face grew rigid she sat staring straight before her mrs ballinger had called and jennie had thought her peculiarly gracious and helpful in her offer of assistance and now her little daughter had said this to vesta where did the child hear it you mustnt pay any attention to her dearie said jennie at last she doesnt know your papa was mr stover and you were born in columbus you mustnt fight other little girls of course they say nasty things when they fight sometimes things they dont really mean just let her alone and dont go near her any more then she wont say anything to you it was a lame explanation but it satisfied vesta for the time being ill slap her if she tries to slap me she persisted you mustnt go near her pet do you hear then she cant try to slap you returned her mother just go about your studies and dont mind her she cant quarrel with you if you dont let her vesta went away leaving jennie brooding over her words the neighbors were talking her history was becoming common gossip how had they found out it is one thing to nurse a single thrust another to have the wound opened from time to time by additional stabs one day jennie having gone to call on mrs hanson field who was her immediate neighbor met a mrs williston baker who was there taking tea mrs baker knew of the kanes of jennies history on the north side and of the attitude of the kane family she was a thin vigorous intellectual woman somewhat on the order of mrs bracebridge and very careful of her social connections she had always considered mrs field a woman of the same rigid circumspectness of attitude and when she found jennie calling there she was outwardly calm but inwardly irritated this is mrs kane mrs baker said mrs field introducing her guests with a smiling countenance mrs baker looked at jennie ominously mrs lester kane she inquired yes replied mrs fields indeed she went on freezingly ive heard a great deal about mrs accenting the word mrs lester kane she turned to mrs field ignoring jennie completely and started an intimate conversation in which jennie could have no possible share jennie stood helplessly by unable to formulate a thought which would be suitable to so trying a situation mrs baker soon announced her departure although she had intended to stay longer i cant remain another minute she said i promised mrs neil that i would stop in to see her today im sure ive bored you enough already as it is she walked to the door not troubling to look at jennie until she was nearly out of the room then she looked in her direction and gave her a frigid nod we meet such curious people now and again she observed finally to her hostess as she swept away mrs field did not feel able to defend jennie for she herself was in no notable social position and was endeavoring like every other middleclass woman of means to get along she did not care to offend mrs williston baker who was socially so much more important than jennie she came back to where jennie was sitting smiling apologetically but she was a little bit flustered jennie was out of countenance of course presently she excused herself and went home she had been cut deeply by the slight offered her and she felt that mrs field realized that she had made a mistake in ever taking her up there would be no additional exchange of visits there that she knew the old hopeless feeling came over her that her life was a failure it couldnt be made right or if it could it wouldnt be lester was not inclined to marry her and put her right time went on and matters remained very much as they were to look at this large house with its smooth lawn and well grown trees its vines clambering about the pillars of the veranda and interlacing themselves into a transparent veil of green to see gerhardt pottering about the yard vesta coming home from school lester leaving in the morning in his smart trap one would have said that here is peace and plenty no shadow of unhappiness hangs over this charming home and as a matter of fact existence with lester and jennie did run smoothly it is true that the neighbors did not call any more or only a very few of them and there was no social life to speak of but the deprivation was hardly noticed there was so much in the home life to please and interest vesta was learning to play the piano and to play quite well she had a good ear for music jennie was a charming figure in blue lavender and olivegreen housegowns as she went about her affairs sewing dusting getting vesta off to school and seeing that things generally were put to rights gerhardt busied himself about his multitudinous duties for he was not satisfied unless he had his hands into all the domestic economies of the household one of his selfimposed tasks was to go about the house after lester or the servants turning out the gasjets or electriclight bulbs which might accidentally have been left burning that was a sinful extravagance again lesters expensive clothes which he carelessly threw aside after a few months use were a source of woe to the thrifty old german moreover he grieved over splendid shoes discarded because of a few wrinkles in the leather or a slightly run down heel or sole gerhardt was for having them repaired but lester answered the old mans querulous inquiry as to what was wrong with them shoes by saying that they werent comfortable any more such extravagance gerhardt complained to jennie such waste no good can come of anything like that it will mean want one of these days he cant help it papa jennie excused thats the way he was raised ha a fine way to be raised these americans they know nothing of economy they ought to live in germany awhile then they would know what a dollar can do lester heard something of this through jennie but he only smiled gerhardt was amusing to him another grievance was lesters extravagant use of matches he had the habit of striking a match holding it while he talked instead of lighting his cigar and then throwing it away sometimes he would begin to light a cigar two or three minutes before he would actually do so tossing aside match after match there was a place out in one corner of the veranda where he liked to sit of a spring or summer evening smoking and throwing away halfburned matches jennie would sit with him and a vast number of matches would be lit and flung out on the lawn at one time while engaged in cutting the grass gerhardt found to his horror not a handful but literally boxes of halfburned matchsticks lying unconsumed and decaying under the fallen blades he was discouraged to say the least he gathered up this damning evidence in a newspaper and carried it back into the sittingroom where jennie was sewing see here what i find he demanded just look at that that man he has no more sense of economy than a than a the right term failed him he sits and smokes and this is the way he uses matches five cents a box they cost five cents how can a man hope to do well and carry on like that i like to know look at them jennie looked she shook her head lester is extravagant she said gerhardt carried them to the basement at least they should be burned in the furnace he would have used them as lighters for his own pipe sticking them in the fire to catch a blaze only old newspapers were better and he had stacks of these another evidence of his lord and masters wretched spendthrift disposition it was a sad world to work in almost everything was against him still he fought as valiantly as he could against waste and shameless extravagance his own economies were rigid he would wear the same suit of black cut down from one of lesters expensive investments of years before every sunday for a couple of years lesters shoes by a little stretch of the imagination could be made to seem to fit and these he wore his old ties also the black ones they were fine if he could have cut down lesters shirts he would have done so he did make over the underwear with the friendly aid of the cooks needle lesters socks of course were just right there was never any expense for gerhardts clothing the remaining stock of lesters discarded clothing shoes shirts collars suits ties and what not he would store away for weeks and months and then in a sad and gloomy frame of mind he would call in a tailor or an oldshoe man or a ragman and dispose of the lot at the best price he could he learned that all secondhand clothes men were sharks that there was no use in putting the least faith in the protests of any rag dealer or oldshoe man they all lied they all claimed to be very poor when as a matter of fact they were actually rolling in wealth gerhardt had investigated these stories he had followed them up he had seen what they were doing with the things he sold them scoundrels he declared they offer me ten cents for a pair of shoes and then i see them hanging out in front of their places marked two dollars such robbery my god they could afford to give me a dollar jennie smiled it was only to her that he complained for he could expect no sympathy from lester so far as his own meager store of money was concerned he gave the most of it to his beloved church where he was considered to be a model of propriety honesty faith in fact the embodiment of all the virtues and so for all the ill winds that were beginning to blow socially jennie was now leading the dream years of her existence lester in spite of the doubts which assailed him at times as to the wisdom of his career was invariably kind and considerate and he seemed to enjoy his home life everything all right she would ask when he came in of an evening sure he would answer and pinch her chin or cheek she would follow him in while jeannette always alert would take his coat and hat in the wintertime they would sit in the library before the big gratefire in the spring summer or fall lester preferred to walk out on the porch one corner of which commanded a sweeping view of the lawn and the distant street and light his beforedinner cigar jennie would sit on the side of his chair and stroke his head your hair is not getting the least bit thin lester arent you glad she would say or oh see how your brow is wrinkled now you mustnt do that you didnt change your tie mister this morning why didnt you i laid one out for you oh i forgot he would answer or he would cause the wrinkles to disappear or laughingly predict that he would soon be getting bald if he wasnt so now in the drawingroom or library before vesta and gerhardt she was not less loving though a little more circumspect she loved odd puzzles like pigs in clover the spiders hole baby billiards and the like lester shared in these simple amusements he would work by the hour if necessary to make a difficult puzzle come right jennie was clever at solving these mechanical problems sometimes she would have to show him the right method and then she would be immensely pleased with herself at other times she would stand behind him watching her chin on his shoulder her arms about his neck he seemed not to mind indeed he was happy in the wealth of affection she bestowed her cleverness her gentleness her tact created an atmosphere which was immensely pleasing above all her youth and beauty appealed to him it made him feel young and if there was one thing lester objected to it was the thought of drying up into an aimless old age i want to keep young or die young was one of his pet remarks and jennie came to understand she was glad that she was so much younger now for his sake another pleasant feature of the home life was lesters steadily increasing affection for vesta the child would sit at the big table in the library in the evening conning her books while jennie would sew and gerhardt would read his interminable list of german lutheran papers it grieved the old man that vesta should not be allowed to go to a german lutheran parochial school but lester would listen to nothing of the sort well not have any thickheaded german training in this he said to jennie when she suggested that gerhardt had complained the public schools are good enough for any child you tell him to let her alone there were really some delightful hours among the four lester liked to take the little sevenyearold schoolgirl between his knees and tease her he liked to invert the socalled facts of life to propound its paradoxes and watch how the childs budding mind took them whats water he would ask and being informed that it was what we drink he would stare and say thats so but what is it dont they teach you any better than that well it is what we drink isnt it persisted vesta the fact that we drink it doesnt explain what it is he would retort you ask your teacher what water is and then he would leave her with this irritating problem troubling her young soul food china her dress anything was apt to be brought back to its chemical constituents and he would leave her to struggle with these dark suggestions of something else back of the superficial appearance of things until she was actually in awe of him she had a way of showing him how nice she looked before she started to school in the morning a habit that arose because of his constant criticism of her appearance he wanted her to look smart he insisted on a big bow of blue ribbon for her hair he demanded that her shoes be changed from low quarter to high boots with the changing character of the seasons and that her clothing be carried out on a color scheme suited to her complexion and disposition that childs light and gay by disposition dont put anything somber on her he once remarked jennie had come to realize that he must be consulted in this and would say run to your papa and show him how you look vesta would come and turn briskly around before him saying see yes youre all right go on and on she would go he grew so proud of her that on sundays and some weekdays when they drove he would always have her in between them he insisted that jennie send her to dancingschool and gerhardt was beside himself with rage and grief such irreligion he complained to jennie such devils folderol now she goes to dance what for to make a nogood out of her a creature to be ashamed of oh no papa replied jennie it isnt as bad as that this is an awful nice school lester says she has to go lester lester that man a fine lot he knows about what is good for a child a cardplayer a whiskydrinker now hush papa i wont have you talk like that jennie would reply warmly hes a good man and you know it yes yes a good man in some things maybe not in this no he went away groaning when lester was near he said nothing and vesta could wind him around her finger oh you she would say pulling at his arm or rubbing his grizzled cheek there was no more fight in gerhardt when vesta did this he lost control of himself something welled up and choked his throat yes i know how you do he would exclaim vesta would tweak his ear stop now he would say that is enough it was noticeable however that she did not have to stop unless she herself willed it gerhardt adored the child and she could do anything with him he was always her devoted servitor chapter xxxix during this period the dissatisfaction of the kane family with lesters irregular habit of life grew steadily stronger that it could not help but become an open scandal in the course of time was sufficiently obvious to them rumors were already going about people seemed to understand in a wise way though nothing was ever said directly kane senior could scarcely imagine what possessed his son to fly in the face of conventions in this manner if the woman had been some one of distinction some sorceress of the stage or of the world of art or letters his action would have been explicable if not commendable but with this creature of very ordinary capabilities as louise had described her this puttyfaced nobody he could not possibly understand it lester was his son his favorite son it was too bad that he had not settled down in the ordinary way look at the women in cincinnati who knew him and liked him take letty pace for instance why in the name of common sense had he not married her she was good looking sympathetic talented the old man grieved bitterly and then by degrees he began to harden it seemed a shame that lester should treat him so it wasnt natural or justifiable or decent archibald kane brooded over it until he felt that some change ought to be enforced but just what it should be he could not say lester was his own boss and he would resent any criticism of his actions apparently nothing could be done certain changes helped along an approaching denouement louise married not many months after her very disturbing visit to chicago and then the home property was fairly empty except for visiting grandchildren lester did not attend the wedding though he was invited for another thing mrs kane died making a readjustment of the family will necessary lester came home on this occasion grieved to think he had lately seen so little of his mother that he had caused her so much pain but he had no explanation to make his father thought at the time of talking to him but put it off because of his obvious gloom he went back to chicago and there were more months of silence after mrs kanes death and louises marriage the father went to live with robert for his three grandchildren afforded him his greatest pleasure in his old age the business except for the final adjustment which would come after his death was in roberts hands the latter was consistently agreeable to his sisters and their husbands and to his father in view of the eventual control he hoped to obtain he was not a sycophant in any sense of the word but a shrewd cold business man far shrewder than his brother gave him credit for he was already richer than any two of the other children put together but he chose to keep his counsel and to pretend modesty of fortune he realized the danger of envy and preferred a spartan form of existence putting all the emphasis on inconspicuous but very ready and very hard cash while lester was drifting robert was working working all the time roberts scheme for eliminating his brother from participation in the control of the business was really not very essential for his father after long brooding over the details of the chicago situation had come to the definite conclusion that any large share of his property ought not to go to lester obviously lester was not so strong a man as he had thought him to be of the two brothers lester might be the bigger intellectually or sympathetically artistically and socially there was no comparison but robert got commercial results in a silent effective way if lester was not going to pull himself together at this stage of the game when would he better leave his property to those who would take care of it archibald kane thought seriously of having his lawyer revise his will in such a way that unless lester should reform he would be cut off with only a nominal income but he decided to give lester one more chance to make a plea in fact that he should abandon his false way of living and put himself on a sound basis before the world it wasnt too late he really had a great future would he deliberately choose to throw it away old archibald wrote lester that he would like to have a talk with him at his convenience and within the lapse of thirtysix hours lester was in cincinnati i thought id have one more talk with you lester on a subject thats rather difficult for me to bring up began the elder kane you know what im referring to yes i know replied lester calmly i used to think when i was much younger that my sons matrimonial ventures would never concern me but i changed my views on that score when i got a little farther along i began to see through my business connections how much the right sort of a marriage helps a man and then i got rather anxious that my boys should marry well i used to worry about you lester and im worrying yet this recent connection youve made has caused me no end of trouble it worried your mother up to the very last it was her one great sorrow dont you think you have gone far enough with it the scandal has reached down here what it is in chicago i dont know but it cant be a secret that cant help the house in business there it certainly cant help you the whole thing has gone on so long that you have injured your prospects all around and yet you continue why do you i suppose because i love her lester replied you cant be serious in that said his father if you had loved her youd have married her in the first place surely you wouldnt take a woman and live with her as you have with this woman for years disgracing her and yourself and still claim that you love her you may have a passion for her but it isnt love how do you know i havent married her inquired lester coolly he wanted to see how his father would take to that idea youre not serious the old gentleman propped himself up on his arms and looked at him no im not replied lester but i might be i might marry her impossible exclaimed his father vigorously i cant believe it i cant believe a man of your intelligence would do a thing like that lester where is your judgment why youve lived in open adultery with her for years and now you talk of marrying her why in heavens name if you were going to do anything like that didnt you do it in the first place disgrace your parents break your mothers heart injure the business become a public scandal and then marry the cause of it i dont believe it old archibald got up dont get excited father said lester quickly we wont get anywhere that way i say i might marry her shes not a bad woman and i wish you wouldnt talk about her as you do youve never seen her you know nothing about her i know enough insisted old archibald determinedly i know that no good woman would act as she has done why man shes after your money what else could she want its as plain as the nose on your face father said lester his voice lowering ominously why do you talk like that you never saw the woman you wouldnt know her from adams off ox louise comes down here and gives an excited report and you people swallow it whole she isnt as bad as you think she is and i wouldnt use the language youre using about her if i were you youre doing a good woman an injustice and you wont for some reason be fair fair fair interrupted archibald talk about being fair is it fair to me to your family to your dead mother to take a woman of the streets and live with her is it stop now father exclaimed lester putting up his hand i warn you i wont listen to talk like that youre talking about the woman that im living with that i may marry i love you but i wont have you saying things that arent so she isnt a woman of the streets you know as well as you know anything that i wouldnt take up with a woman of that kind well have to discuss this in a calmer mood or i wont stay here im sorry im awfully sorry but i wont listen to any such language as that old archibald quieted himself in spite of his opposition he respected his sons point of view he sat back in his chair and stared at the floor how was he to handle this thing he asked himself are you living in the same place he finally inquired no weve moved out to hyde park ive taken a house out there i hear theres a child is that yours no have you any children of your own no well thats a gods blessing lester merely scratched his chin and you insist you will marry her archibald went on i didnt say that replied his son i said i might might might exclaimed his father his anger bubbling again what a tragedy you with your prospects your outlook how do you suppose i can seriously contemplate entrusting any share of my fortune to a man who has so little regard for what the world considers as right and proper why lester this carriage business your family your personal reputation appear to be as nothing at all to you i cant understand what has happened to your pride it seems like some wild impossible fancy its pretty hard to explain father and i cant do it very well i simply know that im in this affair and that im bound to see it through it may come out all right i may not marry her i may im not prepared now to say what ill do youll have to wait ill do the best i can old archibald merely shook his head disapprovingly youve made a bad mess of this lester he said finally surely you have but i suppose you are determined to go your way nothing that i have said appears to move you not now father im sorry well i warn you then that unless you show some consideration for the dignity of your family and the honor of your position it will make a difference in my will i cant go on countenancing this thing and not be a party to it morally and every other way i wont do it you can leave her or you can marry her you certainly ought to do one or the other if you leave her everything will be all right you can make any provision for her you like i have no objection to that ill gladly pay whatever you agree to you will share with the rest of the children just as i had planned if you marry her it will make a difference now do as you please but dont blame me i love you im your father im doing what i think is my bounden duty now you think that over and let me know lester sighed he saw how hopeless this argument was he felt that his father probably meant what he said but how could he leave jennie and justify himself to himself would his father really cut him off surely not the old gentleman loved him even now he could see it lester felt troubled and distressed this attempt at coercion irritated him the idea he lester kane being made to do such a thing to throw jennie down he stared at the floor old archibald saw that he had let fly a telling bullet well said lester finally theres no use of our discussing it any further now thats certain isnt it i cant say what ill do ill have to take time and think i cant decide this offhand the two looked at each other lester was sorry for the worlds attitude and for his fathers keen feeling about the affair kane senior was sorry for his son but he was determined to see the thing through he wasnt sure whether he had converted lester or not but he was hopeful maybe he would come around yet goodby father said lester holding out his hand i think ill try and make that twoten train there isnt anything else you wanted to see me about no the old man sat there after lester had gone thinking deeply what a twisted career what an end to great possibilities what a foolhardy persistence in evil and error he shook his head robert was wiser he was the one to control a business he was cool and conservative if lester were only like that he thought and thought it was a long time before he stirred and still in the bottom of his heart his erring son continued to appeal to him chapter xl lester returned to chicago he realized that he had offended his father seriously how seriously he could not say in all his personal relations with old archibald he had never seen him so worked up but even now lester did not feel that the breach was irreparable he hardly realized that it was necessary for him to act decisively if he hoped to retain his fathers affection and confidence as for the world at large what did it matter how much people talked or what they said he was big enough to stand alone but was he people turn so quickly from weakness or the shadow of it to get away from failure even the mere suspicion of it that seems to be a subconscious feeling with the average man and woman we all avoid nonsuccess as though we fear that it may prove contagious lester was soon to feel the force of this prejudice one day lester happened to run across berry dodge the millionaire head of dodge holbrook kingsbury a firm that stood in the drygoods world where the kane company stood in the carriage world dodge had been one of lesters best friends he knew him as intimately as he knew henry bracebridge of cleveland and george knowles of cincinnati he visited at his handsome home on the north shore drive and they met constantly in a business and social way but since lester had moved out to hyde park the old intimacy had lapsed now they came face to face on michigan avenue near the kane building why lester im glad to see you again said dodge he extended a formal hand and seemed just a little cool i hear youve gone and married since i saw you no nothing like that replied lester easily with the air of one who prefers to be understood in the way of the world sense why so secret about it if you have asked dodge attempting to smile but with a wry twist to the corners of his mouth he was trying to be nice and to go through a difficult situation gracefully we fellows usually make a fuss about that sort of thing you ought to let your friends know well said lester feeling the edge of the social blade that was being driven into him i thought id do it in a new way im not much for excitement in that direction anyhow it is a matter of taste isnt it said dodge a little absently youre living in the city of course in hyde park thats a pleasant territory how are things otherwise and he deftly changed the subject before waving him a perfunctory farewell lester missed at once the inquiries which a man like dodge would have made if he had really believed that he was married under ordinary circumstances his friend would have wanted to know a great deal about the new mrs kane there would have been all those little familiar touches common to people living on the same social plane dodge would have asked lester to bring his wife over to see them would have definitely promised to call nothing of the sort happened and lester noticed the significant omission it was the same with the burnham moores the henry aldriches and a score of other people whom he knew equally well apparently they all thought that he had married and settled down they were interested to know where he was living and they were rather disposed to joke him about being so very secretive on the subject but they were not willing to discuss the supposed mrs kane he was beginning to see that this move of his was going to tell against him notably one of the worst stabs it was the cruelest because in a way it was the most unintentional he received from an old acquaintance will whitney at the union club lester was dining there one evening and whitney met him in the main readingroom as he was crossing from the cloakroom to the cigarstand the latter was a typical society figure tall lean smoothfaced immaculately garbed a little cynical and tonight a little the worse for liquor hi lester he called out whats this talk about a menage of yours out in hyde park say youre going some how are you going to explain all this to your wife when you get married i dont have to explain it replied lester irritably why should you be so interested in my affairs youre not living in a stone house are you say ha ha thats pretty good now isnt it you didnt marry that little beauty you used to travel around with on the north side did you eh now ha ha well i swear you married you didnt now did you cut it out whitney said lester roughly youre talking wild pardon lester said the other aimlessly but sobering i beg your pardon remember im just a little warm eight whiskysours straight in the other room there pardon ill talk to you some time when im all right see lester eh ha ha im a little loose thats right well so long ha ha lester could not get over that cacophonous ha ha it cut him even though it came from a drunken mans mouth that little beauty you used to travel with on the north side you didnt marry her did you he quoted whitneys impertinences resentfully george but this was getting a little rough he had never endured anything like this before he lester kane it set him thinking certainly he was paying dearly for trying to do the kind thing by jennie chapter xli but worse was to follow the american public likes gossip about wellknown people and the kanes were wealthy and socially prominent the report was that lester one of its principal heirs had married a servant girl he an heir to millions could it be possible what a piquant morsel for the newspapers very soon the paragraphs began to appear a small society paper called the south side budget referred to him anonymously as the son of a famous and wealthy carriage manufacturer of cincinnati and outlined briefly what it knew of the story of mrs it went on sagely not so much is known except that she once worked in a wellknown cleveland society family as a maid and was before that a workinggirl in columbus ohio after such a picturesque loveaffair in high society who shall say that romance is dead lester saw this item he did not take the paper but some kind soul took good care to see that a copy was marked and mailed to him it irritated him greatly for he suspected at once that it was a scheme to blackmail him but he did not know exactly what to do about it he preferred of course that such comments should cease but he also thought that if he made any effort to have them stopped he might make matters worse so he did nothing naturally the paragraph in the budget attracted the attention of other newspapers it sounded like a good story and one sunday editor more enterprising than the others conceived the notion of having this romance written up a fullpage sunday story with a scarehead such as sacrifices millions for his servant girl love pictures of lester jennie the house at hyde park the kane manufactory at cincinnati the warehouse on michigan avenue certainly such a display would make a sensation the kane company was not an advertiser in any daily or sunday paper the newspaper owed him nothing if lester had been forewarned he might have put a stop to the whole business by putting an advertisement in the paper or appealing to the publisher he did not know however and so was without power to prevent the publication the editor made a thorough job of the business local newspaper men in cincinnati cleveland and columbus were instructed to report by wire whether anything of jennies history was known in their city the bracebridge family in cleveland was asked whether jennie had ever worked there a garbled history of the gerhardts was obtained from columbus jennies residence on the north side for several years prior to her supposed marriage was discovered and so the whole story was nicely pieced together it was not the idea of the newspaper editor to be cruel or critical but rather complimentary all the bitter things such as the probable illegitimacy of vesta the suspected immorality of lester and jennie in residing together as man and wife the real grounds of the wellknown objections of his family to the match were ignored the idea was to frame up a romeo and juliet story in which lester should appear as an ardent selfsacrificing lover and jennie as a poor and lovely workinggirl lifted to great financial and social heights by the devotion of her millionaire lover an exceptional newspaper artist was engaged to make scenes depicting the various steps of the romance and the whole thing was handled in the most approved yellowjournal style there was a picture of lester obtained from his cincinnati photographer for a consideration jennie had been surreptitiously snapped by a staff artist while she was out walking and so apparently out of a clear sky the story appeared highly complimentary running over with sugary phrases but with all the dark sad facts looming up in the background jennie did not see it at first lester came across the page accidentally and tore it out he was stunned and chagrined beyond words to think the damned newspaper would do that to a private citizen who was quietly minding his own business he thought he went out of the house the better to conceal his deep inward mortification he avoided the more populous parts of the town particularly the downtown section and rode far out on cottage grove avenue to the open prairie he wondered as the trolleycar rumbled along what his friends were thinking dodge and burnham moore and henry aldrich and the others this was a smash indeed the best he could do was to put a brave face on it and say nothing or else wave it off with an indifferent motion of the hand one thing was sure he would prevent further comment he returned to the house calmer his selfpoise restored but he was eager for monday to come in order that he might get in touch with his lawyer mr watson but when he did see mr watson it was soon agreed between the two men that it would be foolish to take any legal action it was the part of wisdom to let the matter drop but i wont stand for anything more concluded lester ill attend to that said the lawyer consolingly lester got up its amazing this damned country of ours he exclaimed a man with a little money hasnt any more privacy than a public monument a man with a little money said mr watson is just like a cat with a bell around its neck every rat knows exactly where it is and what it is doing thats an apt simile assented lester bitterly jennie knew nothing of this newspaper story for several days lester felt that he could not talk it over and gerhardt never read the wicked sunday newspapers finally one of jennies neighborhood friends less tactful than the others called her attention to the fact of its appearance by announcing that she had seen it jennie did not understand at first a story about me she exclaimed you and mr kane yes replied her guest your love romance jennie colored swiftly why i hadnt seen it she said are you sure it was about us why of course laughed mrs stendahl how could i be mistaken i have the paper over at the house ill send marie over with it when i get back you look very sweet in your picture jennie winced i wish you would she said weakly she was wondering where they had secured her picture what the article said above all she was dismayed to think of its effect upon lester had he seen the article why had he not spoken to her about it the neighbors daughter brought over the paper and jennies heart stood still as she glanced at the titlepage there it all was uncompromising and direct how dreadfully conspicuous the headline this millionaire fell in love with this ladys maid which ran between a picture of lester on the left and jennie on the right there was an additional caption which explained how lester son of the famous carriage family of cincinnati had sacrificed great social opportunity and distinction to marry his hearts desire below were scattered a number of other pictures lester addressing jennie in the mansion of mrs bracebridge lester standing with her before an imposing and conventionallooking parson lester driving with her in a handsome victoria jennie standing beside the window of an imposing mansion the fact that it was a mansion being indicated by most sumptuouslooking hangings and gazing out on a very modest workingmans cottage pictured in the distance jennie felt as though she must die for very shame she did not so much mind what it meant to her but lester lester how must he feel and his family now they would have another club with which to strike him and her she tried to keep calm about it to exert emotional control but again the tears would rise only this time they were tears of opposition to defeat she did not want to be hounded this way she wanted to be let alone she was trying to do right now why couldnt the world help her instead of seeking to push her down chapter xlii the fact that lester had seen this page was made perfectly clear to jennie that evening for he brought it home himself having concluded after mature deliberation that he ought to he had told her once that there was to be no concealment between them and this thing coming so brutally to disturb their peace was nevertheless a case in point he had decided to tell her not to think anything of it that it did not make much difference though to him it made all the difference in the world the effect of this chill history could never be undone the wise and they included all his social world and many who were not of it could see just how he had been living the article which accompanied the pictures told how he had followed jennie from cleveland to chicago how she had been coy and distant and that he had to court her a long time to win her consent this was to explain their living together on the north side lester realized that this was an asinine attempt to sugarcoat the true story and it made him angry still he preferred to have it that way rather than in some more brutal vein he took the paper out of his pocket when he arrived at the house spreading it on the library table jennie who was close by watched him for she knew what was coming heres something that will interest you jennie he said dryly pointing to the array of text and pictures ive already seen it lester she said wearily mrs stendahl showed it to me this afternoon i was wondering whether you had rather highflown description of my attitude isnt it i didnt know i was such an ardent romeo im awfully sorry lester said jennie reading behind the dry face of humor the serious import of this affair to him she had long since learned that lester did not express his real feeling his big ills in words he was inclined to jest and make light of the inevitable the inexorable this light comment merely meant this matter cannot be helped so we will make the best of it oh dont feel badly about it he went on it isnt anything which can be adjusted now they probably meant well enough we just happen to be in the limelight i understand said jennie coming over to him im sorry though anyway dinner was announced a moment later and the incident was closed but lester could not dismiss the thought that matters were getting in a bad way his father had pointed it out to him rather plainly at the last interview and now this newspaper notoriety had capped the climax he might as well abandon his pretension to intimacy with his old world it would have none of him or at least the more conservative part of it would not there were a few bachelors a few gay married men some sophisticated women single and married who saw through it all and liked him just the same but they did not make society he was virtually an outcast and nothing could save him but to reform his ways in other words he must give up jennie once and for all but he did not want to do this the thought was painful to him objectionable in every way jennie was growing in mental acumen she was beginning to see things quite as clearly as he did she was not a cheap ambitious climbing creature she was a big woman and a good one it would be a shame to throw her down and besides she was goodlooking he was fortysix and she was twentynine and she looked twentyfour or five it is an exceptional thing to find beauty youth compatibility intelligence your own point of view softened and charmingly emotionalized in another he had made his bed as his father had said he had better lie on it it was only a little while after this disagreeable newspaper incident that lester had word that his father was quite ill and failing it might be necessary for him to go to cincinnati at any moment pressure of work was holding him pretty close when the news came that his father was dead lester of course was greatly shocked and grieved and he returned to cincinnati in a retrospective and sorrowful mood his father had been a great character to him a fine and interesting old gentleman entirely aside from his relationship to him as his son he remembered him now dandling him upon his knee as a child telling him stories of his early life in ireland and of his subsequent commercial struggle when he was a little older impressing the maxims of his business career and his commercial wisdom on him as he grew to manhood old archibald had been radically honest it was to him that lester owed his instincts for plain speech and direct statement of fact never lie was archibalds constant reiterated statement never try to make a thing look different from what it is to you its the breath of life truth its the basis of real worth while commercial success it will make a notable character of any one who will stick to it lester believed this he admired his father intensely for his rigid insistence on truth and now that he was really gone he felt sorry he wished he might have been spared to be reconciled to him he half fancied that old archibald would have liked jennie if he had known her he did not imagine that he would ever have had the opportunity to straighten things out although he still felt that archibald would have liked her when he reached cincinnati it was snowing a windy blustery snow the flakes were coming down thick and fast the traffic of the city had a muffled sound when he stepped down from the train he was met by amy who was glad to see him in spite of all their past differences of all the girls she was the most tolerant lester put his arms about her and kissed her it seems like old times to see you amy he said your coming to meet me this way hows the family i suppose theyre all here well poor father his time had to come still he lived to see everything that he wanted to see i guess he was pretty well satisfied with the outcome of his efforts yes replied amy and since mother died he was very lonely they rode up to the house in kindly good feeling chatting of old times and places all the members of the immediate family and the various relatives were gathered in the old family mansion lester exchanged the customary condolences with the others realizing all the while that his father had lived long enough he had had a successful life and had fallen like a ripe apple from the tree lester looked at him where he lay in the great parlor in his black coffin and a feeling of the oldtime affection swept over him he smiled at the cleancut determined conscientious face the old gentleman was a big man all the way through he said to robert who was present we wont find a better figure of a man soon we will not said his brother solemnly after the funeral it was decided to read the will at once louises husband was anxious to return to buffalo lester was compelled to be in chicago a conference of the various members of the family was called for the second day after the funeral to be held at the offices of messrs knight keatley obrien counselors of the late manufacturer as lester rode to the meeting he had the feeling that his father had not acted in any way prejudicial to his interests it had not been so very long since they had had their last conversation he had been taking his time to think about things and his father had given him time he always felt that he had stood well with the old gentleman except for his alliance with jennie his business judgment had been valuable to the company why should there be any discrimination against him he really did not think it possible when they reached the offices of the law firm mr obrien a short fussy albeit comfortablelooking little person greeted all the members of the family and the various heirs and assigns with a hearty handshake he had been personal counsel to archibald kane for twenty years he knew his whims and idiosyncrasies and considered himself very much in the light of a father confessor he liked all the children lester especially now i believe we are all here he said finally extracting a pair of large horn readingglasses from his coat pocket and looking sagely about very well we might as well proceed to business i will just read the will without any preliminary remarks he turned to his desk picked up a paper lying upon it cleared his throat and began it was a peculiar document in some respects for it began with all the minor bequests first small sums to old employees servants and friends it then took up a few institutional bequests and finally came to the immediate family beginning with the girls imogene as a faithful and loving daughter was left a sixth of the stock of the carriage company and a fourth of the remaining properties of the deceased which roughly aggregated the estate not her share about eight hundred thousand dollars amy and louise were provided for in exactly the same proportion the grandchildren were given certain little bonuses for good conduct when they should come of age then it took up the cases of robert and lester owing to certain complications which have arisen in the affairs of my son lester it began i deem it my duty to make certain conditions which shall govern the distribution of the remainder of my property to wit onefourth of the stock of the kane manufacturing company and onefourth of the remainder of my various properties real personal moneys stocks and bonds to go to my beloved son robert in recognition of the faithful performance of his duty and onefourth of the stock of the kane manufacturing company and the remaining fourth of my various properties real personal moneys stocks and bonds to be held in trust by him for the benefit of his brother lester until such time as such conditions as may hereinafter be set forth shall have been complied with and it is my wish and desire that my children shall concur in his direction of the kane manufacturing company and of such other interests as are entrusted to him until such time as he shall voluntarily relinquish such control or shall indicate another arrangement which shall be better lester swore under his breath his cheeks changed color but he did not move he was not inclined to make a show it appeared that he was not even mentioned separately the conditions hereinafter set forth dealt very fully with his case however though they were not read aloud to the family at the time mr obrien stating that this was in accordance with their fathers wish lester learned immediately afterward that he was to have ten thousand a year for three years during which time he had the choice of doing either one of two things first he was to leave jennie if he had not already married her and so bring his life into moral conformity with the wishes of his father in this event lesters share of the estate was to be immediately turned over to him secondly he might elect to marry jennie if he had not already done so in which case the ten thousand a year specifically set aside to him for three years was to be continued for life but for his life only jennie was not to have anything of it after his death the ten thousand in question represented the annual interest on two hundred shares of l s and m s stock which were also to be held in trust until his decision had been reached and their final disposition effected if lester refused to marry jennie or to leave her he was to have nothing at all after the three years were up at lesters death the stock on which his interest was drawn was to be divided pro rata among the surviving members of the family if any heir or assign contested the will his or her share was thereby forfeited entirely it was astonishing to lester to see how thoroughly his father had taken his case into consideration he half suspected on reading these conditions that his brother robert had had something to do with the framing of them but of course he could not be sure robert had not given any direct evidence of enmity who drew this will he demanded of obrien a little later well we all had a hand in it replied obrien a little shamefacedly it was a very difficult document to draw up you know mr kane there was no budging your father he was adamant he has come very near defeating his own wishes in some of these clauses of course you know we had nothing to do with its spirit that was between you and him i hated very much to have to do it oh i understand all that said lester dont let that worry you mr obrien was very grateful during the reading of the will lester had sat as stolid as an ox he got up after a time as did the others assuming an air of nonchalance robert amy louise and imogene all felt shocked but not exactly not unqualifiedly regretful certainly lester had acted very badly he had given his father great provocation i think the old gentleman has been a little rough in this said robert who had been sitting next him i certainly did not expect him to go as far as that so far as i am concerned some other arrangement would have been satisfactory lester smiled grimly it doesnt matter he said imogene amy and louise were anxious to be consolatory but they did not know what to say lester had brought it all on himself i dont think papa acted quite right lester ventured amy but lester waved her away almost gruffly i can stand it he said he figured out as he stood there what his income would be in case he refused to comply with his fathers wishes two hundred shares of l s and m s in open market were worth a little over one thousand each they yielded from five to six per cent sometimes more sometimes less at this rate he would have ten thousand a year not more the family gathering broke up each going his way and lester returned to his sisters house he wanted to get out of the city quickly gave business as an excuse to avoid lunching with any one and caught the earliest train back to chicago as he rode he meditated so this was how much his father really cared for him could it really be so he lester kane ten thousand a year for only three years and then longer only on condition that he married jennie ten thousand a year he thought and that for three years good lord any smart clerk can earn that to think he should have done that to me chapter xliii this attempt at coercion was the one thing which would definitely set lester in opposition to his family at least for the time being he had realized clearly enough of late that he had made a big mistake first in not having married jennie thus avoiding scandal and in the second place in not having accepted her proposition at the time when she wanted to leave him there were no two ways about it he had made a mess of this business he could not afford to lose his fortune entirely he did not have enough money of his own jennie was unhappy he could see that why shouldnt she be he was unhappy did he want to accept the shabby ten thousand a year even if he were willing to marry her finally did he want to lose jennie to have her go out of his life once and for all he could not make up his mind the problem was too complicated when lester returned to his home after the funeral jennie saw at once that something was amiss with him something beyond a sons natural grief for his fathers death was weighing upon his spirits what was it she wondered she tried to draw near to him sympathetically but his wounded spirit could not be healed so easily when hurt in his pride he was savage and sullen he could have struck any man who irritated him she watched him interestedly wishing to do something for him but he would not give her his confidence he grieved and she could only grieve with him days passed and now the financial situation which had been created by his fathers death came up for careful consideration the factory management had to be reorganized robert would have to be made president as his father wished lesters own relationship to the business would have to come up for adjudication unless he changed his mind about jennie he was not a stockholder as a matter of fact he was not anything to continue to be secretary and treasurer it was necessary that he should own at least one share of the companys stock would robert give him any would amy louise or imogene would they sell him any would the other members of the family care to do anything which would infringe on roberts prerogatives under the will they were all rather unfriendly to lester at present and he realized that he was facing a ticklish situation the solution was to get rid of jennie if he did that he would not need to be begging for stock if he didnt he was flying in the face of his fathers last will and testament he turned the matter over in his mind slowly and deliberately he could quite see how things were coming out he must abandon either jennie or his prospects in life what a dilemma despite roberts assertion that so far as he was concerned another arrangement would have been satisfactory he was really very well pleased with the situation his dreams were slowly nearing completion robert had long had his plans perfected not only for a thorough reorganization of the company proper but for an extension of the business in the direction of a combination of carriage companies if he could get two or three of the larger organizations in the east and west to join with him selling costs could be reduced overproduction would be avoided and the general expenses could be materially scaled down through a new york representative he had been picking up stock in outside carriage companies for some time and he was almost ready to act in the first place he would have himself elected president of the kane company and since lester was no longer a factor he could select amys husband as vicepresident and possibly some one other than lester as secretary and treasurer under the conditions of the will the stock and other properties set aside temporarily for lester in the hope that he would come to his senses were to be managed and voted by robert his father had meant obviously that he robert should help him coerce his brother he did not want to appear mean but this was such an easy way it gave him a righteous duty to perform lester must come to his senses or he must let robert run the business to suit himself lester attending to his branch duties in chicago foresaw the drift of things he realized now that he was permanently out of the company a branch manager at his brothers sufferance and the thought irritated him greatly nothing had been said by robert to indicate that such a change had taken place things went on very much as before but roberts suggestions were now obviously law lester was really his brothers employee at so much a year it sickened his soul there came a time after a few weeks when he felt as if he could not stand this any longer hitherto he had been a free and independent agent the approaching annual stockholders meeting which hitherto had been a oneman affair and a formality his father doing all the voting would be now a combination of voters his brother presiding his sisters very likely represented by their husbands and he not there at all it was going to be a great comedown but as robert had not said anything about offering to give or sell him any stock which would entitle him to sit as a director or hold any official position in the company he decided to write and resign that would bring matters to a crisis it would show his brother that he felt no desire to be under obligations to him in any way or to retain anything which was not his and gladly so by right of ability and the desire of those with whom he was associated if he wanted to move back into the company by deserting jennie he would come in a very different capacity from that of branch manager he dictated a simple straightforward business letter saying dear robert i know the time is drawing near when the company must be reorganized under your direction not having any stock i am not entitled to sit as a director or to hold the joint position of secretary and treasurer i want you to accept this letter as formal notice of my resignation from both positions and i want to have your directors consider what disposition should be made of this position and my services i am not anxious to retain the branchmanagership as a branchmanagership merely at the same time i do not want to do anything which will embarrass you in your plans for the future you see by this that i am not ready to accept the proposition laid down in fathers will at least not at present i would like a definite understanding of how you feel in this matter will you write and let me know yours lester robert sitting in his office at cincinnati considered this letter gravely it was like his brother to come down to brass tacks if lester were only as cautious as he was straightforward and direct what a man he would be but there was no guile in the man no subtlety he would never do a snaky thing and robert knew in his own soul that to succeed greatly one must you have to be ruthless at times you have to be subtle robert would say to himself why not face the facts to yourself when you are playing for big stakes he would for one and he did robert felt that although lester was a tremendously decent fellow and his brother he wasnt pliable enough to suit his needs he was too outspoken too inclined to take issue if lester yielded to his fathers wishes and took possession of his share of the estate he would become necessarily an active partner in the affairs of the company lester would be a barrier in roberts path did robert want this decidedly he did not he much preferred that lester should hold fast to jennie for the present at least and so be quietly shelved by his own act after long consideration robert dictated a politic letter he hadnt made up his mind yet just what he wanted to do he did not know what his sisters husbands would like a consultation would have to be held for his part he would be very glad to have lester remain as secretary and treasurer if it could be arranged perhaps it would be better to let the matter rest for the present lester cursed what did robert mean by beating around the bush he knew well enough how it could be arranged one share of stock would be enough for lester to qualify robert was afraid of him that was the basic fact well he would not retain any branchmanagership depend on that he would resign at once lester accordingly wrote back saying that he had considered all sides and had decided to look after some interests of his own for the time being if robert could arrange it he would like to have some one come on to chicago and take over the branch agency thirty days would be time enough in a few days came a regretful reply saying that robert was awfully sorry but that if lester was determined he did not want to interfere with any plans he might have in view imogenes husband jefferson midgely had long thought he would like to reside in chicago he could undertake the work for the time being lester smiled evidently robert was making the best of a very subtle situation robert knew that he lester could sue and tie things up and also that he would be very loath to do so the newspapers would get hold of the whole story this matter of his relationship to jennie was in the air anyhow he could best solve the problem by leaving her so it all came back to that chapter xliv for a man of lesters years he was now fortysix to be tossed out in the world without a definite connection even though he did have a present income including this new ten thousand of fifteen thousand a year was a disturbing and discouraging thing he realized now that unless he made some very fortunate and profitable arrangements in the near future his career was virtually at an end of course he could marry jennie that would give him the ten thousand for the rest of his life but it would also end his chance of getting his legitimate share of the kane estate again he might sell out the seventyfive thousand dollars worth of moderate interestbearing stocks which now yielded him about five thousand and try a practical investment of some kind say a rival carriage company but did he want to jump in at this stage of the game and begin a running fight on his fathers old organization moreover it would be a hard row to hoe there was the keenest rivalry for business as it was with the kane company very much in the lead lesters only available capital was his seventyfive thousand dollars did he want to begin in a picayune obscure way it took money to get a foothold in the carriage business as things were now the trouble with lester was that while blessed with a fine imagination and considerable insight he lacked the ruthless narrowminded insistence on his individual superiority which is a necessary element in almost every great business success to be a forceful figure in the business world means as a rule that you must be an individual of one idea and that idea the godgiven one that life has destined you for a tremendous future in the particular field you have chosen it means that one thing a cake of soap a new canopener a safety razor or speedaccelerator must seize on your imagination with tremendous force burn as a raging flame and make itself the beall and endall of your existence as a rule a man needs poverty to help him to this enthusiasm and youth the thing he has discovered and with which he is going to busy himself must be the door to a thousand opportunities and a thousand joys happiness must be beyond or the fire will not burn as brightly as it might the urge will not be great enough to make a great success lester did not possess this indispensable quality of enthusiasm life had already shown him the greater part of its socalled joys he saw through the illusions that are so often and so noisily labeled pleasure money of course was essential and he had already had money enough to keep him comfortably did he want to risk it he looked about him thoughtfully perhaps he did certainly he could not comfortably contemplate the thought of sitting by and watching other people work for the rest of his days in the end he decided that he would bestir himself and look into things he was as he said to himself in no hurry he was not going to make a mistake he would first give the trade the people who were identified with v he manufacture and sale of carriages time to realize that he was out of the kane company for the time being anyhow and open to other connections so he announced that he was leaving the kane company and going to europe ostensibly for a rest he had never been abroad and jennie too would enjoy it vesta could be left at home with gerhardt and a maid and he and jennie would travel around a bit seeing what europe had to show he wanted to visit venice and badenbaden and the great wateringplaces that had been recommended to him cairo and luxor and the parthenon had always appealed to his imagination after he had had his outing he could come back and seriously gather up the threads of his intentions the spring after his father died he put his plan into execution he had wound up the work of the warerooms and with a pleasant deliberation had studied out a tour he made jennie his confidante and now having gathered together their traveling comforts they took a steamer from new york to liverpool after a few weeks in the british isles they went to egypt from there they came back through greece and italy into austria and switzerland and then later through france and paris to germany and berlin lester was diverted by the novelty of the experience and yet he had an uncomfortable feeling that he was wasting his time great business enterprises were not built by travelers and he was not looking for health jennie on the other hand was transported by what she saw and enjoyed the new life to the full before luxor and karnak places which jennie had never dreamed existed she learned of an older civilization powerful complex complete millions of people had lived and died here believing in other gods other forms of government other conditions of existence for the first time in her life jennie gained a clear idea of how vast the world is now from this point of view of decayed greece of fallen rome of forgotten egypt she saw how pointless are our minor difficulties our minor beliefs her fathers lutheranism it did not seem so significant any more and the social economy of columbus ohio rather pointless perhaps her mother had worried so of what people her neighbors thought but here were dead worlds of people some bad some good lester explained that their differences in standards of morals were due sometimes to climate sometimes to religious beliefs and sometimes to the rise of peculiar personalities like mohammed lester liked to point out how small conventions bulked in this the larger world and vaguely she began to see admitting that she had been bad locally it was important perhaps but in the sum of civilization in the sum of big forces what did it all amount to they would be dead after a little while she and lester and all these people did anything matter except goodness goodness of heart what else was there that was real chapter xlv it was while traveling abroad that lester came across first at the carlton in london and later at shepheards in cairo the one girl before jennie whom it might have been said he truly admired letty pace he had not seen her for a long time and she had been mrs malcolm gerald for nearly four years and a charming widow for nearly two years more malcolm gerald had been a wealthy man having amassed a fortune in banking and stockbrokering in cincinnati and he had left mrs malcolm gerald very well off she was the mother of one child a little girl who was safely in charge of a nurse and maid at all times and she was invariably the picturesque center of a group of admirers recruited from every capital of the civilized world letty gerald was a talented woman beautiful graceful artistic a writer of verse an omnivorous reader a student of art and a sincere and ardent admirer of lester kane in her day she had truly loved him for she had been a wise observer of men and affairs and lester had always appealed to her as a real man he was so sane she thought so calm he was always intolerant of sham and she liked him for it he was inclined to wave aside the petty little frivolities of common society conversation and to talk of simple and homely things many and many a time in years past they had deserted a dance to sit out on a balcony somewhere and talk while lester smoked he had argued philosophy with her discussed books described political and social conditions in other cities in a word he had treated her like a sensible human being and she had hoped and hoped and hoped that he would propose to her more than once she had looked at his big solid head with its short growth of hardy brown hair and wished that she could stroke it it was a hard blow to her when he finally moved away to chicago at that time she knew nothing of jennie but she felt instinctively that her chance of winning him was gone then malcolm gerald always an ardent admirer proposed for something like the sixtyfifth time and she took him she did not love him but she was getting along and she had to marry some one he was fortyfour when he married her and he lived only four years just long enough to realize that he had married a charming tolerant broadminded woman then he died of pneumonia and mrs gerald was a rich widow sympathetic attractive delightful in her knowledge of the world and with nothing to do except to live and to spend her money she was not inclined to do either indifferently she had long since had her ideal of a man established by lester these whippersnappers of counts earls lords barons whom she met in one social world and another for her friendship and connections had broadened notably with the years did not interest her a particle she was terribly weary of the superficial veneer of the titled fortunehunter whom she met abroad a good judge of character a student of men and manners a natural reasoner along sociologic and psychologic lines she saw through them and through the civilization which they represented i could have been happy in a cottage with a man i once knew out in cincinnati she told one of her titled women friends who had been an american before her marriage he was the biggest cleanest sanest fellow if he had proposed to me i would have married him if i had had to work for a living myself was he so poor asked her friend indeed he wasnt he was comfortably rich but that did not make any difference to me it was the man i wanted it would have made a difference in the long run said the other you misjudge me replied mrs gerald i waited for him for a number of years and i know lester had always retained pleasant impressions and kindly memories of letty pace or mrs gerald as she was now he had been fond of her in a way very fond why hadnt he married her he had asked himself that question time and again she would have made him an ideal wife his father would have been pleased everybody would have been delighted instead he had drifted and drifted and then he had met jennie and somehow after that he did not want her any more now after six years of separation he met her again he knew she was married she was vaguely aware he had had some sort of an affair she had heard that he had subsequently married the woman and was living on the south side she did not know of the loss of his fortune she ran across him first in the carlton one june evening the windows were open and the flowers were blooming everywhere odorous with that sense of new life in the air which runs through the world when spring comes back for the moment she was a little beside herself something choked in her throat but she collected herself and extended a graceful arm and hand why lester kane she exclaimed how do you do i am so glad and this is mrs kane charmed im sure it seems truly like a breath of spring to see you again i hope youll excuse me mrs kane but im delighted to see your husband im ashamed to say how many years it is lester since i saw you last i feel quite old when i think of it why lester think its been all of six or seven years and ive been married and had a child and poor mr gerald has died and oh dear i dont know what all hasnt happened to me you dont look it commented lester smiling he was pleased to see her again for they had been good friends she liked him still that was evident and he truly liked her jennie smiled she was glad to see this old friend of lesters this woman trailing a magnificent yellow lace train over pale motherofpearl satin her round smooth arms bare to the shoulder her corsage cut low and a dark red rose blowing at her waist seemed to her the ideal of what a woman should be she liked looking at lovely women quite as much as lester she enjoyed calling his attention to them and teasing him in the mildest way about their charms wouldnt you like to run and talk to her lester instead of to me she would ask when some particularly striking or beautiful woman chanced to attract her attention lester would examine her choice critically for he had come to know that her judge of feminine charms was excellent oh im pretty well off where i am he would retort looking into her eyes or jestingly im not as young as i used to be or id get in tow of that run on was her comment ill wait for you what would you do if i really should why lester i wouldnt do anything youd come back to me maybe wouldnt you care you know id care but if you felt that you wanted to i wouldnt try to stop you i wouldnt expect to be all in all to one man unless he wanted me to be where do you get those ideas jennie he asked her once curious to test the breadth of her philosophy oh i dont know why theyre so broad so goodnatured so charitable theyre not common thats sure why i dont think we ought to be selfish lester i dont know why some women think differently i know but a man and a woman ought to want to live together or they ought not to dont you think it doesnt make so much difference if a man goes off for a little while just so long as he doesnt stay if he wants to come back at all lester smiled but he respected her for the sweetness of her point of view he had to tonight when she saw this woman so eager to talk to lester she realized at once that they must have a great deal in common to talk over whereupon she did a characteristic thing wont you excuse me for a little while she asked smiling i left some things uncared for in our rooms ill be back she went away remaining in her room as long as she reasonably could and lester and letty fell to discussing old times in earnest he recounted as much of his experiences as he deemed wise and letty brought the history of her life up to date now that youre safely married lester she said daringly ill confess to you that you were the one man i always wanted to have propose to me and you never did maybe i never dared he said gazing into her superb black eyes and thinking that perhaps she might know that he was not married he felt that she had grown more beautiful in every way she seemed to him now to be an ideal society figureperfection itself gracious natural witty the type of woman who mixes and mingles well meeting each newcomer upon the plane best suited to him or her yes you thought i know what you thought your real thought just left the table tut tut my dear not so fast you dont know what i thought anyhow i allow you some credit shes charming jennie has her good points he replied simply and are you happy oh fairly so yes i suppose im happy as happy as any one can be who sees life as it is you know im not troubled with many illusions not any i think kind sir if i know you very likely not any letty but sometimes i wish i had a few i think i would be happier and i too lester really i look on my life as a kind of failure you know in spite of the fact that im almost as rich as croesus not quite i think he had some more than i have what talk from you you with your beauty and talent and money good heavens and what can i do with it travel talk shoo away silly fortunehunters oh dear sometimes i get so tired letty looked at lester in spite of jennie the old feeling came back why should she have been cheated of him they were as comfortable together as old married people or young lovers jennie had had no better claim she looked at him and her eyes fairly spoke he smiled a little sadly here comes my wife he said well have to brace up and talk of other things youll find her interesting really yes i know she replied and turned on jennie a radiant smile jennie felt a faint sense of misgiving she thought vaguely that this might be one of lesters old flames this was the kind of woman he should have chosen not her she was suited to his station in life and he would have been as happy perhaps happier was he beginning to realize it then she put away the uncomfortable thought pretty soon she would be getting jealous and that would be contemptible mrs gerald continued to be most agreeable in her attitude toward the kanes she invited them the next day to join her on a drive through rotten row there was a dinner later at claridges and then she was compelled to keep some engagement which was taking her to paris she bade them both an affectionate farewell and hoped that they would soon meet again she was envious in a sad way of jennies good fortune lester had lost none of his charm for her if anything he seemed nicer more considerate more wholesome she wished sincerely that he were free and lester subconsciously perhaps was thinking the same thing no doubt because of the fact that she was thinking of it he had been led over mentally all of the things which might have happened if he had married her they were so congenial now philosophically artistically practically there was a natural flow of conversation between them all the time like two old comrades among men she knew everybody in his social sphere which was equally hers but jennie did not they could talk of certain subtle characteristics of life in a way which was not possible between him and jennie for the latter did not have the vocabulary her ideas did not flow as fast as those of mrs gerald jennie had actually the deeper more comprehensive sympathetic and emotional note in her nature but she could not show it in light conversation actually she was living the thing she was and that was perhaps the thing which drew lester to her just now and often in situations of this kind she seemed at a disadvantage and she was it seemed to lester for the time being as if mrs gerald would perhaps have been a better choice after all certainly as good and he would not now have this distressing thought as to his future they did not see mrs gerald again until they reached cairo in the gardens about the hotel they suddenly encountered her or rather lester did for he was alone at the time strolling and smoking well this is good luck he exclaimed where do you come from madrid if you please i didnt know i was coming until last thursday the ellicotts are here i came over with them you know i wondered where you might be then i remembered that you said you were going to egypt where is your wife in her bath i fancy at this moment this warm weather makes jennie take to water i was thinking of a plunge myself they strolled about for a time letty was in light blue silk with a blue and white parasol held daintily over her shoulder and looked very pretty oh dear she suddenly ejaculated i wonder sometimes what i am to do with myself i cant loaf always this way i think ill go back to the states to live why dont you what good would it do me i dont want to get married i havent any one to marry now that i want she glanced at lester significantly then looked away oh youll find some one eventually he said somewhat awkwardly you cant escape for long not with your looks and money oh lester hush all right have it otherwise if you want im telling you do you still dance she inquired lightly thinking of a ball which was to be given at the hotel that evening he had danced so well a few years before do i look it now lester you dont mean to say that you have gone and abandoned that last charming art i still love to dance doesnt mrs kane no she doesnt care to at least she hasnt taken it up come to think of it i suppose that is my fault i havent thought of dancing in some time it occurred to him that he hadnt been going to functions of any kind much for some time the opposition his entanglement had generated had put a stop to that come and dance with me tonight your wife wont object its a splendid floor i saw it this morning ill have to think about that replied lester im not much in practice dancing will probably go hard with me at my time of life oh hush lester replied mrs gerald you make me feel old dont talk so sedately mercy alive youd think you were an old man i am in experience my dear pshaw that simply makes us more attractive replied his old flame chapter xlvi that night after dinner the music was already sounding in the ballroom of the great hotel adjacent to the palmgardens when mrs gerald found lester smoking on one of the verandas with jennie by his side the latter was in white satin and white slippers her hair lying a heavy enticing mass about her forehead and ears lester was brooding over the history of egypt its successive tides or waves of rather weakbodied people the thin narrow strip of soil along either side of the nile that had given these successive waves of population sustenance the wonder of heat and tropic life and this hotel with its modern conveniences and fashionable crowd set down among ancient soulweary almost despairing conditions he and jennie had looked this morning on the pyramids they had taken a trolley to the sphinx they had watched swarms of ragged halfclad curiously costumed men and boys moving through narrow smelly albeit brightly colored lanes and alleys it all seems such a mess to me jennie had said at one place they are so dirty and oily i like it but somehow they seem tangled up like a lot of worms lester chuckled youre almost right but climate does it heat the tropics life is always mushy and sensual under these conditions they cant help it oh i know that i dont blame them theyre just queer tonight he was brooding over this the moon shining down into the grounds with an exuberant sensuous luster well at last ive found you mrs gerald exclaimed i couldnt get down to dinner after all our party was so late getting back ive made your husband agree to dance with me mrs kane she went on smilingly she like lester and jennie was under the sensuous influence of the warmth the spring the moonlight there were rich odors abroad floating subtly from groves and gardens from the remote distance camelbells were sounding and exotic cries ayah and oosh oosh as though a drove of strange animals were being rounded up and driven through the crowded streets youre welcome to him replied jennie pleasantly he ought to dance i sometimes wish i did you ought to take lessons right away then replied lester genially ill do my best to keep you company im not as light on my feet as i was once but i guess i can get around oh i dont want to dance that badly smiled jennie but you two go on im going upstairs in a little while anyway why dont you come sit in the ballroom i cant do more than a few rounds then we can watch the others said lester rising no i think ill stay here its so pleasant you go take him mrs gerald lester and letty strolled away they made a striking pair mrs gerald in dark winecolored silk covered with glistening black beads her shapely arms and neck bare and a flashing diamond of great size set just above her forehead in her dark hair her lips were red and she had an engaging smile showing an even row of white teeth between wide full friendly lips lesters strong vigorous figure was well set off by his evening clothes he looked distinguished that is the woman he should have married said jennie to herself as he disappeared she fell into a reverie going over the steps of her past life sometimes it seemed to her now as if she had been living in a dream at other times she felt as though she were in that dream yet life sounded in her ears much as this night did she heard its cries she knew its largemass features but back of it were subtleties that shaded and changed one into the other like the shifting of dreams why had she been so attractive to men why had lester been so eager to follow her could she have prevented him she thought of her life in columbus when she carried coal tonight she was in egypt at this great hotel the chatelaine of a suite of rooms surrounded by every luxury lester still devoted to her he had endured so many things for her why was she so wonderful brander had said so lester had told her so still she felt humble out of place holding handfuls of jewels that did not belong to her again she experienced that peculiar feeling which had come over her the first time she went to new york with lester namely that this fairy existence could not endure her life was fated something would happen she would go back to simple things to a side street a poor cottage to old clothes and then as she thought of her home in chicago and the attitude of his friends she knew it must be so she would never be received even if he married her and she could understand why she could look into the charming smiling face of this woman who was now with lester and see that she considered her very nice perhaps but not of lesters class she was saying to herself now no doubt as she danced with lester that he needed some one like her he needed some one who had been raised in the atmosphere of the things to which he had been accustomed he couldnt very well expect to find in her jennie the familiarity with the appreciation of the niceties to which he had always been accustomed she understood what they were her mind had awakened rapidly to details of furniture clothing arrangement decorations manner forms customs but she was not to the manner born if she went away lester would return to his old world the world of the attractive wellbred clever woman who now hung upon his arm the tears came into jennies eyes she wished for the moment that she might die it would be better so meanwhile lester was dancing with mrs gerald or sitting out between the waltzes talking over old times old places and old friends as he looked at letty he marveled at her youth and beauty she was more developed than formerly but still as slender and shapely as diana she had strength too in this smooth body of hers and her black eyes were liquid and lusterful i swear letty he said impulsively youre really more beautiful than ever youre exquisite youve grown younger instead of older you think so she smiled looking up into his face you know i do or i wouldnt say so im not much on philandering oh lester you bear cant you allow a woman just a little coyness dont you know we all love to sip our praise and not be compelled to swallow it in one great mouthful whats the point he asked what did i say oh nothing youre such a bear youre such a big determined straightforward boy but never mind i like you thats enough isnt it it surely is he said they strolled into the garden as the music ceased and he squeezed her arm softly he couldnt help it she made him feel as if he owned her she wanted him to feel that way she said to herself as they sat looking at the lanterns in the gardens that if ever he were free and would come to her she would take him she was almost ready to take him anyhow only he probably wouldnt he was so straightlaced so considerate he wouldnt like so many other men she knew do a mean thing he couldnt finally lester rose and excused himself he and jennie were going farther up the nile in the morning toward karnak and thebes and the waterwashed temples at phylae they would have to start at an unearthly early hour and he must get to bed when are you going home asked mrs gerald ruefully in september have you engaged your passage yes we sail from hamburg on the ninth the fulda i may be going back in the fall laughed letty dont be surprised if i crowd in on the same boat with you im very unsettled in my mind come along for goodness sake replied lester i hope you do ill see you tomorrow before we leave he paused and she looked at him wistfully cheer up he said taking her hand you never can tell what life will do we sometimes find ourselves right when we thought we were all wrong he was thinking that she was sorry to lose him and he was sorry that she was not in a position to have what she wanted as for himself he was saying that here was one solution that probably he would never accept yet it was a solution why had he not seen this years before and yet she wasnt as beautiful then as she is now nor as wise nor as wealthy maybe maybe but he couldnt be unfaithful to jennie nor wish her any bad luck she had had enough without his willing and had borne it bravely chapter xlvii the trip home did bring another week with mrs gerald for after mature consideration she had decided to venture to america for a while chicago and cincinnati were her destinations and she hoped to see more of lester her presence was a good deal of a surprise to jennie and it started her thinking again she could see what the point was if she were out of the way mrs gerald would marry lester that was certain as it was well the question was a complicated one letty was lesters natural mate so far as birth breeding and position went and yet jennie felt instinctively that on the large human side lester preferred her perhaps time would solve the problem in the mean time the little party of three continued to remain excellent friends when they reached chicago mrs gerald went her way and jennie and lester took up the customary thread of their existence on his return from europe lester set to work in earnest to find a business opening none of the big companies made him any overtures principally because he was considered a strong man who was looking for a control in anything he touched the nature of his altered fortunes had not been made public all the little companies that he investigated were having a handtomouth existence or manufacturing a product which was not satisfactory to him he did find one company in a small town in northern indiana which looked as though it might have a future it was controlled by a practical builder of wagons and carriages such as lesters father had been in his day who however was not a good business man he was making some small money on an investment of fifteen thousand dollars and a plant worth say twentyfive thousand lester felt that something could be done here if proper methods were pursued and business acumen exercised it would be slow work there would never be a great fortune in it not in his lifetime he was thinking of making an offer to the small manufacturer when the first rumors of a carriage trust reached him robert had gone ahead rapidly with his scheme for reorganizing the carriage trade he showed his competitors how much greater profits could be made through consolidation than through a mutually destructive rivalry so convincing were his arguments that one by one the big carriage manufacturing companies fell into line within a few months the deal had been pushed through and robert found himself president of the united carriage and wagon manufacturers association with a capital stock of ten million dollars and with assets aggregating nearly threefourths of that sum at a forced sale he was a happy man while all this was going forward lester was completely in the dark his trip to europe prevented him from seeing three or four minor notices in the newspapers of some of the efforts that were being made to unite the various carriage and wagon manufactories he returned to chicago to learn that jefferson midgely imogenes husband was still in full charge of the branch and living in evanston but because of his quarrel with his family he was in no position to get the news direct accident brought it fast enough however and that rather irritatingly the individual who conveyed this information was none other than mr henry bracebridge of cleveland into whom he ran at the union club one evening after he had been in the city a month i hear youre out of the old company bracebridge remarked smiling blandly yes said lester im out what are you up to now oh i have a deal of my own under consideration im thinking something of handling an independent concern surely you wont run counter to your brother he has a pretty good thing in that combination of his combination i hadnt heard of it said lester ive just got back from europe well you want to wake up lester replied bracebridge hes got the biggest thing in your line i thought you knew all about it the lymanwinthrop company the myerbrooks company the woods company in fact five or six of the big companies are all in your brother was elected president of the new concern i dare say he cleaned up a couple of millions out of the deal lester stared his glance hardened a little well thats fine for robert im glad of it bracebridge could see that he had given him a vital stab well so long old man he exclaimed when youre in cleveland look us up you know how fond my wife is of you i know replied lester byby he strolled away to the smokingroom but the news took all the zest out of his private venture where would he be with a shabby little wagon company and his brother president of a carriage trust good heavens robert could put him out of business in a year why he himself had dreamed of such a combination as this now his brother had done it it is one thing to have youth courage and a fighting spirit to meet the blows with which fortune often afflicts the talented it is quite another to see middle age coming on your principal fortune possibly gone and avenue after avenue of opportunity being sealed to you on various sides jennies obvious social insufficiency the quality of newspaper reputation which had now become attached to her his fathers opposition and death the loss of his fortune the loss of his connection with the company his brothers attitude this trust all combined in a way to dishearten and discourage him he tried to keep a brave face and he had succeeded thus far he thought admirably but this last blow appeared for the time being a little too much he went home the same evening that he heard the news sorely disheartened jennie saw it she realized it as a matter of fact all during the evening that he was away she felt blue and despondent herself when he came home she saw what it was something had happened to him her first impulse was to say what is the matter lester but her next and sounder one was to ignore it until he was ready to speak if ever she tried not to let him see that she saw coming as near as she might affectionately without disturbing him vesta is so delighted with herself today she volunteered by way of diversion she got such nice marks in school thats good he replied solemnly and she dances beautifully these days she showed me some of her new dances tonight you havent any idea how sweet she looks im glad of it he grumbled i always wanted her to be perfect in that its time she was going into some good girls school i think and papa gets in such a rage i have to laugh she teases him about it the little imp she offered to teach him to dance tonight if he didnt love her so hed box her ears i can see that said lester smiling him dancing thats pretty good shes not the least bit disturbed by his storming either good for her said lester he was very fond of vesta who was now quite a girl so jennie tripped on until his mood was modified a little and then some inkling of what had happened came out it was when they were retiring for the night roberts formulated a pretty big thing in a financial way since weve been away he volunteered what is it asked jennie all ears oh hes gotten up a carriage trust its something which will take in every manufactory of any importance in the country bracebridge was telling me that robert was made president and that they have nearly eight millions in capital you dont say replied jennie well then you wont want to do much with your new company will you no theres nothing in that just now he said later on i fancy it may be all right ill wait and see how this thing comes out you never can tell what a trust like that will do jennie was intensely sorry she had never heard lester complain before it was a new note she wished sincerely that she might do something to comfort him but she knew that her efforts were useless oh well she said there are so many interesting things in this world if i were you i wouldnt be in a hurry to do anything lester you have so much time she didnt trust herself to say anything more and he felt that it was useless to worry why should he after all he had an ample income that was absolutely secure for two years yet he could have more if he wanted it only his brother was moving so dazzlingly onward while he was standing still perhaps drifting would be the better word it did seem a pity worst of all he was beginning to feel a little uncertain of himself chapter xlviii lester had been doing some pretty hard thinking but so far he had been unable to formulate any feasible plan for his reentrance into active life the successful organization of roberts carriage trade trust had knocked in the head any further thought on his part of taking an interest in the small indiana wagon manufactory he could not be expected to sink his sense of pride and place and enter a petty campaign for business success with a man who was so obviously his financial superior he had looked up the details of the combination and he found that bracebridge had barely indicated how wonderfully complete it was there were millions in the combine it would have every little manufacturer by the throat should he begin now in a small way and pike along in the shadow of his giant brother he couldnt see it it was too ignominious he would be running around the country trying to fight a new trust with his own brother as his tolerant rival and his own rightful capital arrayed against him it couldnt be done better sit still for the time being something else might show up if not well he had his independent income and the right to come back into the kane company if he wished did he wish the question was always with him it was while lester was in this mood drifting that he received a visit from samuel e ross a real estate dealer whose great wooden signs might be seen everywhere on the windy stretches of prairie about the city lester had seen ross once or twice at the union club where he had been pointed out as a daring and successful real estate speculator and he had noticed his rather conspicuous offices at la salle and washington streets ross was a magneticlooking person of about fifty years of age tall blackbearded blackeyed an arched widenostriled nose and hair that curled naturally almost electrically lester was impressed with his lithe catlike figure and his long thin impressive white hands mr ross had a real estate proposition to lay before mr kane of course mr kane knew who he was and mr ross admitted fully that he knew all about mr kane recently in conjunction with mr norman yale of the wholesale grocery firm of yale simpson rice he had developed yalewood mr kane knew of that yes mr kane knew of that only within six weeks the last lots in the ridgewood section of yalewood had been closed out at a total profit of fortytwo per cent he went over a list of other deals in real estate which he had put through all wellknown properties he admitted frankly that there were failures in the business he had had one or two himself but the successes far outnumbered the bad speculations as every one knew now lester was no longer connected with the kane company he was probably looking for a good investment and mr ross had a proposition to lay before him lester consented to listen and mr ross blinked his catlike eyes and started in the idea was that he and lester should enter into a onedeal partnership covering the purchase and development of a fortyacre tract of land lying between fiftyfifth seventyfirst halstead streets and ashland avenue on the southwest side there were indications of a genuine real estate boom there healthy natural and permanent the city was about to pave fiftyfifth street there was a plan to extend the halstead street car line far below its present terminus the chicago burlington quincy which ran near there would be glad to put a passenger station on the property the initial cost of the land would be forty thousand dollars which they would share equally grading paving lighting tree planting surveying would cost roughly an additional twentyfive thousand there would be expenses for advertising say ten per cent of the total investment for two years or perhaps three a total of nineteen thousand five hundred or twenty thousand dollars all told they would stand to invest jointly the sum of ninetyfive thousand or possibly one hundred thousand dollars of which lesters share would be fifty thousand then mr ross began to figure on the profits the character of the land its salability and the likelihood of a rise in value could be judged by the property adjacent the sales that had been made north of fiftyfifth street and east of halstead take for instance the mortimer plot at halstead and fiftyfifth streets on the southeast corner here was a piece of land that in was held at fortyfive dollars an acre in it had risen to five hundred dollars an acre as attested by its sale to a mr john l slosson at that time in three years later it had been sold to mr mortimer for one thousand per acre precisely the figure at which this tract was now offered it could be parceled out into lots fifty by one hundred feet at five hundred dollars per lot was there any profit in that lester admitted that there was ross went on somewhat boastfully to explain just how real estate profits were made it was useless for any outsider to rush into the game and imagine that he could do in a few weeks or years what trained real estate speculators like himself had been working on for a quarter of a century there was something in prestige something in taste something in psychic apprehension supposing that they went into the deal he ross would be the presiding genius he had a trained staff he controlled giant contractors he had friends in the tax office in the water office and in the various other city departments which made or marred city improvements if lester would come in with him he would make him some money how much he would not say exactly fifty thousand dollars at the lowest one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand in all likelihood would lester let him go into details and explain just how the scheme could be worked out after a few days of quiet cogitation lester decided to accede to mr rosss request he would look into this thing chapter xlix the peculiarity of this particular proposition was that it had the basic elements of success mr ross had the experience and the judgment which were quite capable of making a success of almost anything he undertook he was in a field which was entirely familiar he could convince almost any able man if he could get his ear sufficiently long to lay his facts before him lester was not convinced at first although generally speaking he was interested in real estate propositions he liked land he considered it a sound investment providing you did not get too much of it he had never invested in any or scarcely any solely because he had not been in a realm where real estate propositions were talked of as it was he was landless and in a way jobless he rather liked mr ross and his way of doing business it was easy to verify his statements and he did verify them in several particulars there were his signs out on the prairie stretches and here were his ads in the daily papers it seemed not a bad way at all in his idleness to start and make some money the trouble with lester was that he had reached the time where he was not as keen for details as he had formerly been all his work in recent years in fact from the very beginning had been with large propositions the purchasing of great quantities of supplies the placing of large orders the discussion of things which were wholesale and which had very little to do with the minor details which make up the special interests of the smaller traders of the world in the factory his brother robert had figured the pennies and nickels of laborcost had seen to it that all the little leaks were shut off lester had been left to deal with larger things and he had consistently done so when it came to this particular proposition his interest was in the wholesale phases of it not the petty details of selling he could not help seeing that chicago was a growing city and that land values must rise what was now farout prairie property would soon in the course of a few years be well builtup suburban residence territory scarcely any land that could be purchased now would fall in value it might drag in sales or increase but it couldnt fall ross convinced him of this he knew it of his own judgment to be true the several things on which he did not speculate sufficiently were the life or health of mr ross the chance that some obnoxious neighborhood growth would affect the territory he had selected as residence territory the fact that difficult money situations might reduce real estate values in fact bring about a flurry of real estate liquidation which would send prices crashing down and cause the failure of strong promoters even such promoters for instance as mr samuel e ross for several months he studied the situation as presented by his new guide and mentor and then having satisfied himself that he was reasonably safe decided to sell some of the holdings which were netting him a beggarly six per cent and invest in this new proposition the first cash outlay was twenty thousand dollars for the land which was taken over under an operative agreement between himself and ross this was run indefinitely so long as there was any of this land left to sell the next thing was to raise twelve thousand five hundred dollars for improvements which he did and then to furnish some twentyfive hundred dollars more for taxes and unconsidered expenses items which had come up in carrying out the improvement work which had been planned it seemed that hard and soft earth made a difference in grading costs that trees would not always flourish as expected that certain members of the city water and gas departments had to be seen and fixed before certain other improvements could be effected mr ross attended to all this but the cost of the proceedings was something which had to be discussed and lester heard it all after the land was put in shape about a year after the original conversation it was necessary to wait until spring for the proper advertising and booming of the new section and this advertising began to call at once for the third payment lester disposed of an additional fifteen thousand dollars worth of securities in order to follow this venture to its logical and profitable conclusion up to this time he was rather pleased with his venture ross had certainly been thorough and businesslike in his handling of the various details the land was put in excellent shape it was given a rather attractive title inwood although as lester noted there was precious little wood anywhere around there but ross assured him that people looking for a suburban residence would be attracted by the name seeing the vigorous efforts in treeplanting that had been made to provide for shade in the future they would take the will for the deed lester smiled the first chill wind that blew upon the infant project came in the form of a rumor that the international packing company one of the big constituent members of the packing house combination at halstead and thirtyninth streets had determined to desert the old group and lay out a new packing area for itself the papers explained that the company intended to go farther south probably below fiftyfifth street and west of ashland avenue this was the territory that was located due west of lesters property and the mere suspicion that the packing company might invade the territory was sufficient to blight the prospects of any budding real estate deal ross was beside himself with rage he decided after quick deliberation that the best thing to do would be to boom the property heavily by means of newspaper advertising and see if it could not be disposed of before any additional damage was likely to be done to it he laid the matter before lester who agreed that this would be advisable they had already expended six thousand dollars in advertising and now the additional sum of three thousand dollars was spent in ten days to make it appear that in wood was an ideal residence section equipped with every modern convenience for the homelover and destined to be one of the most exclusive and beautiful suburbs of the city it was no go a few lots were sold but the rumor that the international packing company might come was persistent and deadly from any point of view save that of a foreign population neighborhood the enterprise was a failure to say that lester was greatly disheartened by this blow is to put it mildly practically fifty thousand dollars twothirds of all his earthly possessions outside of his stipulated annual income was tied up here and there were taxes to pay repairs to maintain actual depreciation in value to face he suggested to ross that the area might be sold at its cost value or a loan raised on it and the whole enterprise abandoned but that experienced real estate dealer was not so sanguine he had had one or two failures of this kind before he was superstitious about anything which did not go smoothly from the beginning if it didnt go it was a hoodoo a black shadow and he wanted no more to do with it other real estate men as he knew to his cost were of the same opinion some three years later the property was sold under the sheriffs hammer lester having put in fifty thousand dollars all told recovered a trifle more than eighteen thousand and some of his wise friends assured him that he was lucky in getting off so easily chapter l while the real estate deal was in progress mrs gerald decided to move to chicago she had been staying in cincinnati for a few months and had learned a great deal as to the real facts of lesters irregular mode of life the question whether or not he was really married to jennie remained an open one the garbled details of jennies early years the fact that a chicago paper had written him up as a young millionaire who was sacrificing his fortune for love of her the certainty that robert had practically eliminated him from any voice in the kane company all came to her ears she hated to think that lester was making such a sacrifice of himself he had let nearly a year slip by without doing anything in two more years his chance would be gone he had said to her in london that he was without many illusions was jennie one did he really love her or was he just sorry for her letty wanted very much to find out for sure the house that mrs gerald leased in chicago was a most imposing one on drexel boulevard im going to take a house in your town this winter and i hope to see a lot of you she wrote to lester im awfully bored with life here in cincinnati after europe its so well you know i saw mrs knowles on saturday she asked after you you ought to know that you have a loving friend in her her daughter is going to marry jimmy severance in the spring lester thought of her coming with mingled feelings of pleasure and uncertainty she would be entertaining largely of course would she foolishly begin by attempting to invite him and jennie surely not she must know the truth by this time her letter indicated as much she spoke of seeing a lot of him that meant that jennie would have to be eliminated he would have to make a clean breast of the whole affair to letty then she could do as she pleased about their future intimacy seated in lettys comfortable boudoir one afternoon facing a vision of loveliness in pale yellow he decided that he might as well have it out with her she would understand just at this time he was beginning to doubt the outcome of the real estate deal and consequently he was feeling a little blue and as a concomitant a little confidential he could not as yet talk to jennie about his troubles you know lester said letty by way of helping him to his confession the maid had brought tea for her and some brandy and soda for him and departed that i have been hearing a lot of things about you since ive been back in this country arent you going to tell me all about yourself you know i have your real interests at heart what have you been hearing letty he asked quietly oh about your fathers will for one thing and the fact that youre out of the company and some gossip about mrs kane which doesnt interest me very much you know what i mean arent you going to straighten things out so that you can have what rightfully belongs to you it seems to me such a great sacrifice lester unless of course you are very much in love are you she asked archly lester paused and deliberated before replying i really dont know how to answer that last question letty he said sometimes i think that i love her sometimes i wonder whether i do or not im going to be perfectly frank with you i was never in such a curious position in my life before you like me so much and i well i dont say what i think of you he smiled but anyhow i can talk to you frankly im not married i thought as much she said as he paused and im not married because i have never been able to make up my mind just what to do about it when i first met jennie i thought her the most entrancing girl i had ever laid eyes on that speaks volumes for my charms at that time interrupted his visavis dont interrupt me if you want to hear this he smiled tell me one thing she questioned and then i wont was that in cleveland yes so i heard she assented there was something about her so love at first sight again interpolated letty foolishly her heart was hurting her i know are you going to let me tell this pardon me lester i cant help a twinge or two well anyhow i lost my head i thought she was the most perfect thing under the sun even if she was a little out of my world this is a democratic country i thought that i could just take her and then well you know that is where i made my mistake i didnt think that would prove as serious as it did i never cared for any other woman but you before and ill be frank i didnt know whether i wanted to marry you i thought i didnt want to marry any woman i said to myself that i could just take jennie and then after a while when things had quieted down some we could separate she would be well provided for i wouldnt care very much she wouldnt care you understand yes i understand replied his confessor well you see letty it hasnt worked out that way shes a woman of a curious temperament she possesses a world of feeling and emotion shes not educated in the sense in which we understand that word but she has natural refinement and tact shes a good housekeeper shes an ideal mother shes the most affectionate creature under the sun her devotion to her mother and father was beyond words her love for her daughter shes hers not mine is perfect she hasnt any of the graces of the smart society woman she isnt quick at repartee she cant join in any rapidfire conversation she thinks rather slowly i imagine some of her big thoughts never come to the surface at all but you can feel that she is thinking and that she is feeling you pay her a lovely tribute lester said letty i ought to he replied shes a good woman letty but for all that i have said i sometimes think that its only sympathy thats holding me dont be too sure she said warningly yes but ive gone through with a great deal the thing for me to have done was to have married her in the first place there have been so many entanglements since so much rowing and discussion that ive rather lost my bearings this will of fathers complicates matters i stand to lose eight hundred thousand if i marry her really a great deal more now that the company has been organized into a trust i might better say two millions if i dont marry her i lose everything outright in about two more years of course i might pretend that i have separated from her but i dont care to lie i cant work it out that way without hurting her feelings and shes been the soul of devotion right down in my heart at this minute i dont know whether i want to give her up honestly i dont know what the devil to do lester looked lit a cigar in a faroff speculative fashion and looked out of the window was there ever such a problem questioned letty staring at the floor she rose after a few moments of silence and put her hands on his round solid head her yellow silken housegown faintly scented touched his shoulders poor lester she said you certainly have tied yourself up in a knot but its a gordian knot my dear and it will have to be cut why dont you discuss this whole thing with her just as you have with me and see how she feels about it it seems such an unkind thing to do he replied you must take some action lester dear she insisted you cant just drift you are doing yourself such a great injustice frankly i cant advise you to marry her and im not speaking for myself in that though ill take you gladly even if you did forsake me in the first place ill be perfectly honest whether you ever come to me or not i love you and always shall love you i know it said lester getting up he took her hands in his and studied her face curiously then he turned away letty paused to get her breath his action discomposed her but youre too big a man lester to settle down on ten thousand a year she continued youre too much of a social figure to drift you ought to get back into the social and financial world where you belong all thats happened wont injure you if you reclaim your interest in the company you can dictate your own terms and if you tell her the truth she wont object im sure if she cares for you as you think she does she will be glad to make this sacrifice im positive of that you can provide for her handsomely of course it isnt the money that jennie wants said lester gloomily well even if it isnt she can live without you and she can live better for having an ample income she will never want if i can help it he said solemnly you must leave her she urged with a new touch of decisiveness you must every day is precious with you lester why dont you make up your mind to act at once today for that matter why not not so fast he protested this is a ticklish business to tell you the truth i hate to do it it seems so brutal so unfair im not one to run around and discuss my affairs with other people ive refused to talk about this to any one heretofore my father my mother any one but somehow you have always seemed closer to me than any one else and since i met you this time i have felt as though i ought to explain i have really wanted to i care for you i dont know whether you understand how that can be under the circumstances but i do youre nearer to me intellectually and emotionally than i thought you were dont frown you want the truth dont you well there you have it now explain me to myself if you can i dont want to argue with you lester she said softly laying her hand on his arm i merely want to love you i understand quite well how it has all come about im sorry for myself im sorry for you im sorry she hesitated for mrs kane shes a charming woman i like her i really do but she isnt the woman for you lester she really isnt you need another type it seems so unfair for us two to discuss her in this way but really it isnt we all have to stand on our merits and im satisfied if the facts in this case were put before her as you have put them before me she would see just how it all is and agree she cant want to harm you why lester if i were in her position i would let you go i would truly i think you know that i would any good woman would it would hurt me but id do it it will hurt her but shell do it now mark you my words she will i think i understand her as well as you do better for i am a woman oh she said pausing i wish i were in a position to talk to her i could make her understand lester looked at letty wondering at her eagerness she was beautiful magnetic immensely worth while not so fast he repeated i want to think about this i have some time yet she paused a little crestfallen but determined this is the time to act she repeated her whole soul in her eyes she wanted this man and she was not ashamed to let him see that she wanted him well ill think of it he said uneasily then rather hastily he bade her goodby and went away chapter li lester had thought of his predicament earnestly enough and he would have been satisfied to act soon if it had not been that one of those disrupting influences which sometimes complicate our affairs entered into his hyde park domicile gerhardts health began rapidly to fail little by little he had been obliged to give up his various duties about the place finally he was obliged to take to his bed he lay in his room devotedly attended by jennie and visited constantly by vesta and occasionally by lester there was a window not far from his bed which commanded a charming view of the lawn and one of the surrounding streets and through this he would gaze by the hour wondering how the world was getting on without him he suspected that woods the coachman was not looking after the horses and harnesses as well as he should that the newspaper carrier was getting negligent in his delivery of the papers that the furnace man was wasting coal or was not giving them enough heat a score of little petty worries which were nevertheless real enough to him he knew how a house should be kept he was always rigid in his performance of his selfappointed duties and he was so afraid that things would not go right jennie made for him a most imposing and sumptuous dressinggown of basted wool covered with darkblue silk and bought him a pair of soft thick wool slippers to match but he did not wear them often he preferred to lie in bed read his bible and the lutheran papers and ask jennie how things were getting along i want you should go down in the basement and see what that feller is doing hes not giving us any heat he would complain i bet i know what he does he sits down there and reads and then he forgets what the fire is doing until it is almost out the beer is right there where he can take it you should lock it up you dont know what kind of a man he is he may be no good jennie would protest that the house was fairly comfortable that the man was a nice quiet respectablelooking american that if he did drink a little beer it would not matter gerhardt would immediately become incensed that is always the way he declared vigorously you have no sense of economy you are always so ready to let things go if i am not there he is a nice man how do you know he is a nice man does he keep the fire up no does he keep the walks clean if you dont watch him he will be just like the others no good you should go around and see how things are for yourself all right papa she would reply in a genial effort to soothe him i will please dont worry ill lock up the beer dont you want a cup of coffee now and some toast no gerhardt would sigh immediately my stomach it dont do right i dont know how i am going to come out of this dr makin the leading physician of the vicinity and a man of considerable experience and ability called at jennies request and suggested a few simple things hot milk a wine tonic rest but he told jennie that she must not expect too much you know he is quite well along in years now he is quite feeble if he were twenty years younger we might do a great deal for him as it is he is quite well off where he is he may live for some time he may get up and be around again and then he may not we must all expect these things i have never any care as to what may happen to me i am too old myself jennie felt sorry to think that her father might die but she was pleased to think that if he must it was going to be under such comfortable circumstances here at least he could have every care it soon became evident that this was gerhardts last illness and jennie thought it her duty to communicate with her brothers and sisters she wrote bass that his father was not well and had a letter from him saying that he was very busy and couldnt come on unless the danger was an immediate one he went on to say that george was in rochester working for a wholesale wallpaper house the sheffjefferson company he thought martha and her husband had gone to boston her address was a little suburb named belmont just outside the city william was in omaha working for a local electric company veronica was married to a man named albert sheridan who was connected with a wholesale drug company in cleveland she never comes to see me complained bass but ill let her know jennie wrote each one personally from veronica and martha she received brief replies they were very sorry and would she let them know if anything happened george wrote that he could not think of coming to chicago unless his father was very ill indeed but that he would like to be informed from time to time how he was getting along william as he told jennie some time afterward did not get her letter the progress of the old germans malady toward final dissolution preyed greatly on jennies mind for in spite of the fact that they had been so far apart in times past they had now grown very close together gerhardt had come to realize clearly that his outcast daughter was goodness itself at least so far as he was concerned she never quarreled with him never crossed him in any way now that he was sick she was in and out of his room a dozen times in an evening or an afternoon seeing whether he was all right asking how he liked his breakfast or his lunch or his dinner as he grew weaker she would sit by him and read or do her sewing in his room one day when she was straightening his pillow he took her hand and kissed it he was feeling very weak and despondent she looked up in astonishment a lump in her throat there were tears in his eyes youre a good girl jennie he said brokenly youve been good to me ive been hard and cross but im an old man you forgive me dont you oh papa please dont she pleaded tears welling from her eyes you know i have nothing to forgive im the one who has been all wrong no no he said and she sank down on her knees beside him and cried he put his thin yellow hand on her hair there there he said brokenly i understand a lot of things i didnt we get wiser as we get older she left the room ostensibly to wash her face and hands and cried her eyes out was he really forgiving her at last and she had lied to him so she tried to be more attentive but that was impossible but after this reconciliation he seemed happier and more contented and they spent a number of happy hours together just talking once he said to her you know i feel just like i did when i was a boy if it wasnt for my bones i could get up and dance on the grass jennie fairly smiled and sobbed in one breath youll get stronger papa she said youre going to get well then ill take you out driving she was so glad she had been able to make him comfortable these last few years as for lester he was affectionate and considerate well how is it tonight he would ask the moment he entered the house and he would always drop in for a few minutes before dinner to see how the old man was getting along he looks pretty well he would tell jennie hes apt to live some time yet i wouldnt worry vesta also spent much time with her grandfather for she had come to love him dearly she would bring her books if it didnt disturb him too much and recite some of her lessons or she would leave his door open and play for him on the piano lester had bought her a handsome musicbox also which she would sometimes carry to his room and play for him at times he wearied of everything and everybody save jennie he wanted to be alone with her she would sit beside him quite still and sew she could see plainly that the end was only a little way off gerhardt true to his nature took into consideration all the various arrangements contingent upon his death he wished to be buried in the little lutheran cemetery which was several miles farther out on the south side and he wanted the beloved minister of his church to officiate i want everything plain he said just my black suit and those sunday shoes of mine and that black string tie i dont want anything else i will be all right jennie begged him not to talk of it but he would one day at four oclock he had a sudden sinking spell and at five he was dead jennie held his hands watching his labored breathing once or twice he opened his eyes to smile at her i dont mind going he said in this final hour ive done what i could dont talk of dying papa she pleaded its the end he said youve been good to me youre a good woman she heard no other words from his lips the finish which time thus put to this troubled life affected jennie deeply strong in her kindly emotional relationships gerhardt had appealed to her not only as her father but as a friend and counselor she saw him now in his true perspective a hardworking honest sincere old german who had done his best to raise a troublesome family and lead an honest life truly she had been his one great burden and she had never really dealt truthfully with him to the end she wondered now if where he was he could see that she had lied and would he forgive her he had called her a good woman telegrams were sent to all the children bass wired that he was coming and arrived the next day the others wired that they could not come but asked for details which jennie wrote the lutheran minister was called in to say prayers and fix the time of the burial service a fat smug undertaker was commissioned to arrange all the details some few neighborhood friends called those who had remained most faithful and on the second morning following his death the services were held lester accompanied jennie and vesta and bass to the little red brick lutheran church and sat stolidly through the rather dry services he listened wearily to the long discourse on the beauties and rewards of a future life and stirred irritably when reference was made to a hell bass was rather bored but considerate he looked upon his father now much as he would on any other man only jennie wept sympathetically she saw her father in perspective the long years of trouble he had had the days in which he had had to saw wood for a living the days in which he had lived in a factory loft the little shabby house they had been compelled to live in in thirteenth street the terrible days of suffering they had spent in lorrie street in cleveland his grief over her his grief over mrs gerhardt his love and care of vesta and finally these last days oh he was a good man she thought he meant so well they sang a hymn a mighty fortress is our god and then she sobbed lester pulled at her arm he was moved to the dangerline himself by her grief youll have to do better than this he whispered my god i cant stand it ill have to get up and get out jennie quieted a little but the fact that the last visible ties were being broken between her and her father was almost too much at the grave in the cemetery of the redeemer where lester had immediately arranged to purchase a lot they saw the plain coffin lowered and the earth shoveled in lester looked curiously at the bare trees the brown dead grass and the brown soil of the prairie turned up at this simple graveside there was no distinction to this burial plot it was commonplace and shabby a workingmans restingplace but so long as he wanted it it was all right he studied basss keen lean face wondering what sort of a career he was cutting out for himself bass looked to him like some one who would run a cigar store successfully he watched jennie wiping her red eyes and then he said to himself again well there is something to her the womans emotion was so deep so real theres no explaining a good woman he said to himself on the way home through the windswept dusty streets he talked of life in general bass and vesta being present jennie takes things too seriously he said shes inclined to be morbid life isnt as bad as she makes out with her sensitive feelings we all have our troubles and we all have to stand them some more some less we cant assume that any one is so much better or worse off than any one else we all have our share of troubles i cant help it said jennie i feel so sorry for some people jennie always was a little gloomy put in bass he was thinking what a fine figure of a man lester was how beautifully they lived how jennie had come up in the world he was thinking that there must be a lot more to her than he had originally thought life surely did turn out queer at one time he thought jennie was a hopeless failure and no good you ought to try to steel yourself to take things as they come without going to pieces this way said lester finally bass thought so too jennie stared thoughtfully out of the carriage window there was the old house now large and silent without gerhardt just think she would never see him any more they finally turned into the drive and entered the library jeannette nervous and sympathetic served tea jennie went to look after various details she wondered curiously where she would be when she died chapter lii the fact that gerhardt was dead made no particular difference to lester except as it affected jennie he had liked the old german for his many sterling qualities but beyond that he thought nothing of him one way or the other he took jennie to a wateringplace for ten days to help her recover her spirits and it was soon after this that he decided to tell her just how things stood with him he would put the problem plainly before her it would be easier now for jennie had been informed of the disastrous prospects of the realestate deal she was also aware of his continued interest in mrs gerald lester did not hesitate to let jennie know that he was on very friendly terms with her mrs gerald had at first formally requested him to bring jennie to see her but she never had called herself and jennie understood quite clearly that it was not to be now that her father was dead she was beginning to wonder what was going to become of her she was afraid that lester might not marry her certainly he showed no signs of intending to do so by one of those curious coincidences of thought robert also had reached the conclusion that something should be done he did not for one moment imagine that he could directly work upon lester he did not care to try but he did think that some influence might be brought to bear on jennie she was probably amenable to reason if lester had not married her already she must realize full well that he did not intend to do so suppose that some responsible third person were to approach her and explain how things were including of course the offer of an independent income might she not be willing to leave lester and end all this trouble after all lester was his brother and he ought not to lose his fortune robert had things very much in his own hands now and could afford to be generous he finally decided that mr obrien of knight keatley obrien would be the proper intermediary for obrien was suave goodnatured and wellmeaning even if he was a lawyer he might explain to jennie very delicately just how the family felt and how much lester stood to lose if he continued to maintain his connection with her if lester had married jennie obrien would find it out a liberal provision would be made for her say fifty or one hundred thousand or even one hundred and fifty thousand dollars he sent for mr obrien and gave him his instructions as one of the executors of archibald kanes estate it was really the lawyers duty to look into the matter of lesters ultimate decision mr obrien journeyed to chicago on reaching the city he called up lester and found out to his satisfaction that he was out of town for the day he went out to the house in hyde park and sent in his card to jennie she came downstairs in a few minutes quite unconscious of the import of his message he greeted her most blandly this is mrs kane he asked with an interlocutory jerk of his head yes replied jennie i am as you see by my card mr obrien of knight keatley obrien he began we are the attorneys and executors of the late mr kane your ah mr kanes father youll think its rather curious my coming to you but under your husbands fathers will there were certain conditions stipulated which affect you and mr kane very materially these provisions are so important that i think you ought to know about them that is if mr kane hasnt already told you i pardon me but the peculiar nature of them makes me conclude that possibly he hasnt he paused a very questionmark of a man every feature of his face an interrogation i dont quite understand said jennie i dont know anything about the will if theres anything that i ought to know i suppose mr kane will tell me he hasnt told me anything as yet ah breathed mr obrien highly gratified just as i thought now if you will allow me ill go into the matter briefly then you can judge for yourself whether you wish to hear the full particulars wont you sit down they had both been standing jennie seated herself and mr obrien pulled up a chair near to hers now to begin he said i need not say to you of course that there was considerable opposition on the part of mr kanes father to this ah union between yourself and his son i know jennie started to say but checked herself she was puzzled disturbed and a little apprehensive before mr kane senior died he went on he indicated to your ah to mr lester kane that he felt this way in his will he made certain conditions governing the distribution of his property which made it rather hard for his son your ah husband to come into his rightful share ordinarily he would have inherited onefourth of the kane manufacturing company worth today in the neighborhood of a million dollars perhaps more also onefourth of the other properties which now aggregate something like five hundred thousand dollars i believe mr kane senior was really very anxious that his son should inherit this property but owing to the conditions which your ah which mr kanes father made mr lester kane cannot possibly obtain his share except by complying with a with a certain wish which his father had expressed mr obrien paused his eyes moving back and forth side wise in their sockets in spite of the natural prejudice of the situation he was considerably impressed with jennies pleasing appearance he could see quite plainly why lester might cling to her in the face of all opposition he continued to study her furtively as he sat there waiting for her to speak and what was that wish she finally asked her nerves becoming just a little tense under the strain of the silence i am glad you were kind enough to ask me that he went on the subject is a very difficult one for me to introduce very difficult i come as an emissary of the estate i might say as one of the executors under the will of mr kanes father i know how keenly your ah how keenly mr kane feels about it i know how keenly you will probably feel about it but it is one of those very difficult things which cannot be helped which must be got over somehow and while i hesitate very much to say so i must tell you that mr kane senior stipulated in his will that unless unless again his eyes were moving sidewise to and fro he saw fit to separate from ah you he paused to get breath he could not inherit this or any other sum or at least only a very minor income of ten thousand a year and that only on condition that he should marry you he paused again i should add he went on that under the will he was given three years in which to indicate his intentions that time is now drawing to a close he paused half expecting some outburst of feeling from jennie but she only looked at him fixedly her eyes clouded with surprise distress unhappiness now she understood lester was sacrificing his fortune for her his recent commercial venture was an effort to rehabilitate himself to put himself in an independent position the recent periods of preoccupation of subtle unrest and of dissatisfaction over which she had grieved were now explained he was unhappy he was brooding over this prospective loss and he had never told her so his father had really disinherited him mr obrien sat before her troubled himself he was very sorry for her now that he saw the expression of her face still the truth had to come out she ought to know im sorry he said when he saw that she was not going to make any immediate reply that i have been the bearer of such unfortunate news it is a very painful situation that i find myself in at this moment i assure you i bear you no ill will personally of course you understand that the family really bears you no ill will now i hope you believe that as i told your ah as i told mr kane at the time the will was read i considered it most unfair but of course as a mere executive under it and counsel for his father i could do nothing i really think it best that you should know how things stand in order that you may help your your husband he paused significantly if possible to some solution it seems a pity to me as it does to the various other members of his family that he should lose all this money jennie had turned her head away and was staring at the floor she faced him now steadily he mustnt lose it she said it isnt fair that he should i am most delighted to hear you say that mrs mrs kane he went on using for the first time her improbable title as lesters wife without hesitation i may as well be very frank with you and say that i feared you might take this information in quite another spirit of course you know to begin with that the kane family is very clannish mrs kane your ah your husbands mother was a very proud and rather distant woman and his sisters and brothers are rather set in their notions as to what constitute proper family connections they look upon his relationship to you as irregular and pardon me if i appear to be a little cruel as not generally satisfactory as you know there had been so much talk in the last few years that mr kane senior did not believe that the situation could ever be nicely adjusted so far as the family was concerned he felt that his son had not gone about it right in the first place one of the conditions of his will was that if your husband pardon me if his son did not accept the proposition in regard to separating from you and taking up his rightful share of the estate then to inherit anything at all the mere ten thousand a year i mentioned before he must ah he must pardon me i seem a little brutal but not intentionally so marry you jennie winced it was such a cruel thing to say this to her face this whole attempt to live together illegally had proved disastrous at every step there was only one solution to the unfortunate business she could see that plainly she must leave him or he must leave her there was no other alternative lester living on ten thousand dollars a year it seemed silly mr obrien was watching her curiously he was thinking that lester both had and had not made a mistake why had he not married her in the first place she was charming there is just one other point which i wish to make in this connection mrs kane he went on softly and easily i see now that it will not make any difference to you but i am commissioned and in a way constrained to make it i hope you will take it in the manner in which it is given i dont know whether you are familiar with your husbands commercial interests or not no said jennie simply well in order to simplify matters and to make it easier for you should you decide to assist your husband to a solution of this very difficult situation frankly in case you might possibly decide to leave on your own account and maintain a separate establishment of your own i am delighted to say that ah any sum say ah jennie rose and walked dazedly to one of the windows clasping her hands as she went mr obrien rose also well be that as it may in the event of your deciding to end the connection it has been suggested that any reasonable sum you might name fifty seventyfive a hundred thousand dollars mr obrien was feeling very generous toward her would be gladly set aside for your benefit put in trust as it were so that you would have it whenever you needed it you would never want for anything please dont said jennie hurt beyond the power to express herself unable mentally and physically to listen to another word please dont say any more please go away let me alone now please i can go away i will it will be arranged but please dont talk to me any more will you i understand how you feel mrs kane went on mr obrien coming to a keen realization of her sufferings i know exactly believe me i have said all i intend to say it has been very hard for me to do this very hard i regret the necessity you have my card please note the name i will come any time you suggest or you can write me i will not detain you any longer i am sorry i hope you will see fit to say nothing to your husband of my visit it will be advisable that you should keep your own counsel in the matter i value his friendship very highly and i am sincerely sorry jennie only stared at the floor mr obrien went out into the hall to get his coat jennie touched the electric button to summon the maid and jeannette came jennie went back into the library and mr obrien paced briskly down the front walk when she was really alone she put her doubled hands to her chin and stared at the floor the queer design of the silken turkish rug resolving itself into some curious picture she saw herself in a small cottage somewhere alone with vesta she saw lester living in another world and beside him mrs gerald she saw this house vacant and then a long stretch of time and then oh she sighed choking back a desire to cry with her hands she brushed away a hot tear from each eye then she got up it must be she said to herself in thought it must be it should have been so long ago and then oh thank god that papa is dead anyhow he did not live to see this chapter liii the explanation which lester had concluded to be inevitable whether it led to separation or legalization of their hitherto banal condition followed quickly upon the appearance of mr obrien on the day mr obrien called he had gone on a journey to hegewisch a small manufacturing town in wisconsin where he had been invited to witness the trial of a new motor intended to operate elevators with a view to possible investment when he came out to the house interested to tell jennie something about it even in spite of the fact that he was thinking of leaving her he felt a sense of depression everywhere for jennie in spite of the serious and sensible conclusion she had reached was not one who could conceal her feelings easily she was brooding sadly over her proposed action realizing that it was best to leave but finding it hard to summon the courage which would let her talk to him about it she could not go without telling him what she thought he ought to want to leave her she was absolutely convinced that this one course of action separation was necessary and advisable she could not think of him as daring to make a sacrifice of such proportions for her sake even if he wanted to it was impossible it was astonishing to her that he had let things go along as dangerously and silently as he had when he came in jennie did her best to greet him with her accustomed smile but it was a pretty poor imitation everything all right she asked using her customary phrase of inquiry quite he answered how are things with you oh just the same she walked with him to the library and he poked at the open fire with a longhandled poker before turning around to survey the room generally it was five oclock of a january afternoon jennie had gone to one of the windows to lower the shade as she came back he looked at her critically youre not quite your usual self are you he asked sensing something out of the common in her attitude why yes i feel all right she replied but there was a peculiar uneven motion to the movement of her lips a rippling tremor which was unmistakable to him i think i know better than that he said still gazing at her steadily whats the trouble anything happened she turned away from him a moment to get her breath and collect her senses then she faced him again there is something she managed to say i have to tell you something i know you have he agreed half smiling but with a feeling that there was much of grave import back of this what is it she was silent for a moment biting her lips she did not quite know how to begin finally she broke the spell with there was a man here yesterday a mr obrien of cincinnati do you know him yes i know him what did he want he came to talk to me about you and your fathers will she paused for his face clouded immediately why the devil should he be talking to you about my fathers will he exclaimed what did he have to say please dont get angry lester said jennie calmly for she realized that she must remain absolute mistress of herself if anything were to be accomplished toward the resolution of her problem he wanted to tell me what a sacrifice you are making she went on he wished to show me that there was only a little time left before you would lose your inheritance dont you want to act pretty soon dont you want to leave me damn him said lester fiercely what the devil does he mean by putting his nose in my private affairs cant they let me alone he shook himself angrily damn them he exclaimed again this is some of roberts work why should knight keatley obrien be meddling in my affairs this whole business is getting to be a nuisance he was in a boiling rage in a moment as was shown by his darkening skin and sulphurous eyes jennie trembled before his anger she did not know what to say he came to himself sufficiently after a time to add well just what did he tell you he said that if you married me you would only get ten thousand a year that if you didnt and still lived with me you would get nothing at all if you would leave me or i would leave you you would get all of a million and a half dont you think you had better leave me now she had not intended to propound this leading question so quickly but it came out as a natural climax to the situation she realized instantly that if he were really in love with her he would answer with an emphatic no if he didnt care he would hesitate he would delay he would seek to put off the evil day of reckoning i dont see that he retorted irritably i dont see that theres any need for either interference or hasty action what i object to is their coming here and mixing in my private affairs jennie was cut to the quick by his indifference his wrath instead of affection to her the main point at issue was her leaving him or his leaving her to him this recent interference was obviously the chief matter for discussion and consideration the meddling of others before he was ready to act was the terrible thing she had hoped in spite of what she had seen that possibly because of the long time they had lived together and the things which in a way they had endured together he might have come to care for her deeply that she had stirred some emotion in him which would never brook real separation though some seeming separation might be necessary he had not married her of course but then there had been so many things against them now in this final hour anyhow he might have shown that he cared deeply even if he had deemed it necessary to let her go she felt for the time being as if for all that she had lived with him so long she did not understand him and yet in spite of this feeling she knew also that she did he cared in his way he could not care for any one enthusiastically and demonstratively he could care enough to seize her and take her to himself as he had but he could not care enough to keep her if something more important appeared he was debating her fate now she was in a quandary hurt bleeding but for once in her life determined whether he wanted to or not she must not let him make this sacrifice she must leave him if he would not leave her it was not important enough that she should stay there might be but one answer but might he not show affection dont you think you had better act soon she continued hoping that some word of feeling would come from him there is only a little time left isnt there jennie nervously pushed a book to and fro on the table her fear that she would not be able to keep up appearances troubling her greatly it was hard for her to know what to do or say lester was so terrible when he became angry still it ought not to be so hard for him to go now that he had mrs gerald if he only wished to do so and he ought to his fortune was so much more important to him than anything she could be dont worry about that he replied stubbornly his wrath at his brother and his family and obrien still holding him theres time enough i dont know what i want to do yet i like the effrontery of these people but i wont talk any more about it isnt dinner nearly ready he was so injured in his pride that he scarcely took the trouble to be civil he was forgetting all about her and what she was feeling he hated his brother robert for this affront he would have enjoyed wringing the necks of messrs knight keatley obrien singly and collectively the question could not be dropped for good and all and it came up again at dinner after jennie had done her best to collect her thoughts and quiet her nerves they could not talk very freely because of vesta and jeannette but she managed to get in a word or two i could take a little cottage somewhere she suggested softly hoping to find him in a modified mood i would not want to stay here i would not know what to do with a big house like this alone i wish you wouldnt discuss this business any longer jennie he persisted im in no mood for it i dont know that im going to do anything of the sort i dont know what im going to do he was so sour and obstinate because of obrien that she finally gave it up vesta was astonished to see her stepfather usually so courteous in so grim a mood jennie felt a curious sense that she might hold him if she would for he was doubting but she knew also that she should not wish it was not fair to him it was not fair to herself or kind or decent oh yes lester you must she pleaded at a later time i wont talk about it any more but you must i wont let you do anything else there were hours when it came up afterward every day in fact in their boudoir in the library in the diningroom at breakfast but not always in words jennie was worried she was looking the worry she felt she was sure that he should be made to act since he was showing more kindly consideration for her she was all the more certain that he should act soon just how to go about it she did not know but she looked at him longingly trying to help him make up his mind she would be happy she assured herself she would be happy thinking that he was happy once she was away from him he was a good man most delightful in everything perhaps save his gift of love he really did not love her could not perhaps after all that had happened even though she loved him most earnestly but his family had been most brutal in their opposition and this had affected his attitude she could understand that too she could see now how his big strong brain might be working in a circle he was too decent to be absolutely brutal about this thing and leave her too really considerate to look sharply after his own interests as he should or hers but he ought to you must decide lester she kept saying to him from time to time you must let me go what difference does it make i will be all right maybe when this thing is all over you might want to come back to me if you do i will be there im not ready to come to a decision was his invariable reply i dont know that i want to leave you this money is important of course but money isnt everything i can live on ten thousand a year if necessary ive done it in the past oh but youre so much more placed in the world now lester she argued you cant do it look how much it costs to run this house alone and a million and a half of dollars why i wouldnt let you think of losing that ill go myself first where would you think of going if it came to that he asked curiously oh id find some place do you remember that little town of sandwood this side of kenosha i have often thought it would be a pleasant place to live i dont like to think of this he said finally in an outburst of frankness it doesnt seem fair the conditions have all been against this union of ours i suppose i should have married you in the first place im sorry now that i didnt jennie choked in her throat but said nothing anyhow this wont be the last of it if i can help it he concluded he was thinking that the storm might blow over once he had the money and then but he hated compromises and subterfuges it came by degrees to be understood that toward the end of february she should look around at sandwood and see what she could find she was to have ample means he told her everything that she wanted after a time he might come out and visit her occasionally and he was determined in his heart that he would make some people pay for the trouble they had caused him he decided to send for mr obrien shortly and talk things over he wanted for his personal satisfaction to tell him what he thought of him at the same time in the background of his mind moved the shadowy figure of mrs gerald charming sophisticated well placed in every sense of the word he did not want to give her the broad reality of full thought but she was always there he thought and thought perhaps id better he half concluded when february came he was ready to act chapter liv the little town of sandwood this side of kenosha as jennie had expressed it was only a short distance from chicago an hour and fifteen minutes by the local train it had a population of some three hundred families dwelling in small cottages which were scattered over a pleasant area of lakeshore property they were not rich people the houses were not worth more than from three to five thousand dollars each but in most cases they were harmoniously constructed and the surrounding trees green for the entire year gave them a pleasing summery appearance jennie at the time they had passed by there it was an outing taken behind a pair of fast horses had admired the look of a little white church steeple set down among green trees and the gentle rocking of the boats upon the summer water i should like to live in a place like this some time she had said to lester and he had made the comment that it was a little too peaceful for him i can imagine getting to the place where i might like this but not now its too withdrawn jennie thought of that expression afterward it came to her when she thought that the world was trying if she had to be alone ever and could afford it she would like to live in a place like sandwood there she would have a little garden some chickens perhaps a tall pole with a pretty birdhouse on it and flowers and trees and green grass everywhere about if she could have a little cottage in a place like this which commanded a view of the lake she could sit of a summer evening and sew vesta could play about or come home from school she might have a few friends or not any she was beginning to think that she could do very well living alone if it were not for vestas social needs books were pleasant things she was finding that out books like irvings sketch book lambs elia and hawthornes twice told tales vesta was coming to be quite a musician in her way having a keen sense of the delicate and refined in musical composition she had a natural sense of harmony and a love for those songs and instrumental compositions which reflect sentimental and passionate moods and she could sing and play quite well her voice was of course quite untrained she was only fourteen but it was pleasant to listen to she was beginning to show the combined traits of her mother and father jennies gentle speculative turn of mind combined with branders vivacity of spirit and innate executive capacity she could talk to her mother in a sensible way about things nature books dress love and from her developing tendencies jennie caught keen glimpses of the new worlds which vesta was to explore the nature of modern school life its consideration of various divisions of knowledge music science all came to jennie watching her daughter take up new themes vesta was evidently going to be a woman of considerable ability not irritably aggressive but selfconstructive she would be able to take care of herself all this pleased jennie and gave her great hopes for vestas future the cottage which was finally secured at sandwood was only a story and a half in height but it was raised upon red brick piers between which were set green lattices and about which ran a veranda the house was long and narrow its full length some five rooms in a row facing the lake there was a diningroom with windows opening even with the floor a large library with builtin shelves for books and a parlor whose three large windows afforded air and sunshine at all times the plot of ground in which this cottage stood was one hundred feet square and ornamented with a few trees the former owner had laid out flowerbeds and arranged green hardwood tubs for the reception of various hardy plants and vines the house was painted white with green shutters and green shingles it had been lesters idea since this thing must be that jennie might keep the house in hyde park just as it was but she did not want to do that she could not think of living there alone the place was too full of memories at first she did not think she would take anything much with her but she finally saw that it was advisable to do as lester suggested to fit out the new place with a selection of silverware hangings and furniture from the hyde park house you have no idea what you will or may want he said take everything i certainly dont want any of it a lease of the cottage was taken for two years together with an option for an additional five years including the privilege of purchase so long as he was letting her go lester wanted to be generous he could not think of her as wanting for anything and he did not propose that she should his one troublesome thought was what explanation was to be made to vesta he liked her very much and wanted her life kept free of complications why not send her off to a boardingschool until spring he suggested once but owing to the lateness of the season this was abandoned as inadvisable later they agreed that business affairs made it necessary for him to travel and for jennie to move later vesta could be told that jennie had left him for any reason she chose to give it was a trying situation all the more bitter to jennie because she realized that in spite of the wisdom of it indifference to her was involved he really did not care enough as much as he cared the relationship of man and woman which we study so passionately in the hope of finding heaven knows what key to the mystery of existence holds no more difficult or trying situation than this of mutual compatibility broken or disrupted by untoward conditions which in themselves have so little to do with the real force and beauty of the relationship itself these days of final dissolution in which this household so charmingly arranged the scene of so many pleasant activities was literally going to pieces was a period of great trial to both jennie and lester on her part it was one of intense suffering for she was of that stable nature that rejoices to fix itself in a serviceable and harmonious relationship and then stay so for her life was made up of those mystic chords of sympathy and memory which bind up the transient elements of nature into a harmonious and enduring scene one of those chords this home was her home united and made beautiful by her affection and consideration for each person and every object now the time had come when it must cease if she had ever had anything before in her life which had been like this it might have been easier to part with it now though as she had proved jennies affections were not based in any way upon material considerations her love of life and of personality were free from the taint of selfishness she went about among these various rooms selecting this rug that set of furniture this and that ornament wishing all the time with all her heart and soul that it need not be just to think in a little while lester would not come any more of an evening she would not need to get up first of a morning and see that coffee was made for her lord that the table in the diningroom looked just so it had been a habit of hers to arrange a bouquet for the table out of the richest blooming flowers of the conservatory and she had always felt in doing it that it was particularly for him now it would not be necessary any more not for him when one is accustomed to wait for the sound of a certain carriagewheel of an evening grating upon your carriage drive when one is used to listen at eleven twelve and one waking naturally and joyfully to the echo of a certain step on the stair the separation the ending of these things is keen with pain these were the thoughts that were running through jennies brain hour after hour and day after day lester on his part was suffering in another fashion his was not the sorrow of lacerated affection of discarded and despised love but of that painful sense of unfairness which comes to one who knows that he is making a sacrifice of the virtues kindness loyalty affection to policy policy was dictating a very splendid course of action from one point of view free of jennie providing for her admirably he was free to go his way taking to himself the mass of affairs which come naturally with great wealth he could not help thinking of the thousand and one little things which jennie had been accustomed to do for him the hundred and one comfortable and pleasant and delightful things she meant to him the virtues which she possessed were quite dear to his mind he had gone over them time and again now he was compelled to go over them finally to see that she was suffering without making a sign her manner and attitude toward him in these last days were quite the same as they had always been no more no less she was not indulging in private hysterics as another woman might have done she was not pretending a fortitude in suffering she did not feel showing him one face while wishing him to see another behind it she was calm gentle considerate thoughtful of him where he would go and what he would do without irritating him by her inquiries he was struck quite favorably by her ability to take a large situation largely and he admired her there was something to this woman let the world think what it might it was a shame that her life was passed under such a troubled star still a great world was calling him the sound of its voice was in his ears it had on occasion shown him its bared teeth did he really dare to hesitate the last hour came when having made excuses to this and that neighbor when having spread the information that they were going abroad when lester had engaged rooms at the auditorium and the mass of furniture which could not be used had gone to storage that it was necessary to say farewell to this hyde park domicile jennie had visited sandwood in company with lester several times he had carefully examined the character of the place he was satisfied that it was nice but lonely spring was at hand the flowers would be something she was going to keep a gardener and man of all work vesta would be with her very well he said only i want you to be comfortable in the mean time lester had been arranging his personal affairs he had notified messrs knight keatley obrien through his own attorney mr watson that he would expect them to deliver his share of his fathers securities on a given date he had made up his mind that as long as he was compelled by circumstances to do this thing he would do a number of other things equally ruthless he would probably marry mrs gerald he would sit as a director in the united carriage company with his share of the stock it would be impossible to keep him out if he had mrs geralds money he would become a controlling factor in the united traction of cincinnati in which his brother was heavily interested and in the western steel works of which his brother was now the leading adviser what a different figure he would be now from that which he had been during the past few years jennie was depressed to the point of despair she was tremendously lonely this home had meant so much to her when she first came here and neighbors had begun to drop in she had imagined herself on the threshold of a great career that some day possibly lester would marry her now blow after blow had been delivered and the home and dream were a ruin gerhardt was gone jeannette harry ward and mrs frissell had been discharged the furniture for a good part was in storage and for her practically lester was no more she realized clearly that he would not come back if he could do this thing now even considerately he could do much more when he was free and away later immersed in his great affairs he would forget of course and why not she did not fit in had not everything everything illustrated that to her love was not enough in this world that was so plain one needed education wealth training the ability to fight and scheme she did not want to do that she could not the day came when the house was finally closed and the old life was at an end lester traveled with jennie to sandwood he spent some little while in the house trying to get her used to the idea of change it was not so bad he intimated that he would come again soon but he went away and all his words were as nothing against the fact of the actual and spiritual separation when jennie saw him going down the brick walk that afternoon his solid conservative figure clad in a new tweed suit his overcoat on his arm selfreliance and prosperity written all over him she thought that she would die she had kissed lester goodby and had wished him joy prosperity peace then she made an excuse to go to her bedroom vesta came after a time to seek her but now her eyes were quite dry everything had subsided to a dull ache the new life was actually begun for her a life without lester without gerhardt without any one save vesta what curious things have happened to me she thought as she went into the kitchen for she had determined to do at least some of her own work she needed the distraction she did not want to think if it were not for vesta she would have sought some regular outside employment anything to keep from brooding for in that direction lay madness chapter lv the social and business worlds of chicago cincinnati cleveland and other cities saw during the year or two which followed the breaking of his relationship with jennie a curious rejuvenation in the social and business spirit of lester kane he had become rather distant and indifferent to certain personages and affairs while he was living with her but now he suddenly appeared again armed with authority from a number of sources looking into this and that matter with the air of one who has the privilege of power and showing himself to be quite a personage from the point of view of finance and commerce he was older of course it must be admitted that he was in some respects a mentally altered lester up to the time he had met jennie he was full of the assurance of the man who has never known defeat to have been reared in luxury as he had been to have seen only the pleasant side of society which is so persistent and so deluding where money is concerned to have been in the run of big affairs not because one has created them but because one is a part of them and because they are ones birthright like the air one breathes could not help but create one of those illusions of solidarity which is apt to befog the clearest brain it is so hard for us to know what we have not seen it is so difficult for us to feel what we have not experienced like this world of ours which seems so solid and persistent solely because we have no knowledge of the power which creates it lesters world seemed solid and persistent and real enough to him it was only when the storms set in and the winds of adversity blew and he found himself facing the armed forces of convention that he realized he might be mistaken as to the value of his personality that his private desires and opinions were as nothing in the face of a public conviction that he was wrong the race spirit or social avatar the zeitgeist as the germans term it manifested itself as something having a system in charge and the organization of society began to show itself to him as something based on possibly a spiritual or at least superhuman counterpart he could not fly in the face of it he could not deliberately ignore its mandates the people of his time believed that some particular form of social arrangement was necessary and unless he complied with that he could as he saw readily become a social outcast his own father and mother had turned on him his brother and sisters society his friends dear heaven what a todo this action of his had created why even the fates seemed adverse his real estate venture was one of the most fortuitously unlucky things he had ever heard of why were the gods battling on the side of a to him unimportant social arrangement apparently anyhow he had been compelled to quit and here he was vigorous determined somewhat battered by the experience but still forceful and worth while and it was a part of the penalty that he had become measurably soured by what had occurred he was feeling that he had been compelled to do the first ugly brutal thing of his life jennie deserved better of him it was a shame to forsake her after all the devotion she had manifested truly she had played a finer part than he worst of all his deed could not be excused on the grounds of necessity he could have lived on ten thousand a year he could have done without the million and more which was now his he could have done without the society the pleasures of which had always been a lure he could have but he had not and he had complicated it all with the thought of another woman was she as good as jennie that was a question which always rose before him was she as kindly wasnt she deliberately scheming under his very eyes to win him away from the woman who was as good as his wife was that admirable was it the thing a truly big woman would do was she good enough for him after all ought he to marry her ought he to marry any one seeing that he really owed a spiritual if not a legal allegiance to jennie was it worth while for any woman to marry him these things turned in his brain they haunted him he could not shut out the fact that he was doing a cruel and unlovely thing material error in the first place was now being complicated with spiritual error he was attempting to right the first by committing the second could it be done to his own satisfaction would it pay mentally and spiritually would it bring him peace of mind he was thinking thinking all the while he was readjusting his life to the old or perhaps better yet new conditions and he was not feeling any happier as a matter of fact he was feeling worse grim revengeful if he married letty he thought at times it would be to use her fortune as a club to knock other enemies over the head and he hated to think he was marrying her for that he took up his abode at the auditorium visited cincinnati in a distant and aggressive spirit sat in council with the board of directors wishing that he was more at peace with himself more interested in life but he did not change his policy in regard to jennie of course mrs gerald had been vitally interested in lesters rehabilitation she waited tactfully some little time before sending him any word finally she ventured to write to him at the hyde park address as if she did not know where he was asking where are you by this time lester had become slightly accustomed to the change in his life he was saying to himself that he needed sympathetic companionship the companionship of a woman of course social invitations had begun to come to him now that he was alone and that his financial connections were so obviously restored he had made his appearance accompanied only by a japanese valet at several country houses the best sign that he was once more a single man no reference was made by any one to the past on receiving mrs geralds note he decided that he ought to go and see her he had treated her rather shabbily for months preceding his separation from jennie he had not gone near her even now he waited until time brought a phoned invitation to dinner this he accepted mrs gerald was at her best as a hostess at her perfectly appointed dinnertable alboni the pianist was there on this occasion together with adam rascavage the sculptor a visiting scientist from england sir nelson keyes and curiously enough mr and mrs berry dodge whom lester had not met socially in several years mrs gerald and lester exchanged the joyful greetings of those who understand each other thoroughly and are happy in each others company arent you ashamed of yourself sir she said to him when he made his appearance to treat me so indifferently you are going to be punished for this whats the damage he smiled ive been extremely rushed i suppose something like ninety stripes will serve me about right ninety stripes indeed she retorted youre letting yourself off easy what is it they do to evildoers in siam boil them in oil i suppose well anyhow thats more like im thinking of something terrible be sure and tell me when you decide he laughed and passed on to be presented to distinguished strangers by mrs de lincum who aided mrs gerald in receiving the talk was stimulating lester was always at his ease intellectually and this mental atmosphere revived him presently he turned to greet berry dodge who was standing at his elbow dodge was all cordiality where are you now he asked we havent seen you in oh when mrs dodge is waiting to have a word with you lester noticed the change in dodges attitude some time thats sure he replied easily im living at the auditorium i was asking after you the other day you know jackson du bois of course you do we were thinking of running up into canada for some hunting why dont you join us i cant replied lester too many things on hand just now later surely dodge was anxious to continue he had seen lesters election as a director of the c h d obviously he was coming back into the world but dinner was announced and lester sat at mrs geralds right hand arent you coming to pay me a dinner call some afternoon after this asked mrs gerald confidentially when the conversation was brisk at the other end of the table i am indeed he replied and shortly seriously ive been wanting to look you up you understand though how things are now i do ive heard a great deal thats why i want you to come we need to talk together ten days later he did call he felt as if he must talk with her he was feeling bored and lonely his long home life with jennie had made hotel life objectionable he felt as though he must find a sympathetic intelligent ear and where better than here letty was all ears for his troubles she would have pillowed his solid head upon her breast in a moment if that had been possible well he said when the usual fencing preliminaries were over what will you have me say in explanation have you burned your bridges behind you she asked im not so sure he replied gravely and i cant say that im feeling any too joyous about the matter as a whole i thought as much she replied i knew how it would be with you i can see you wading through this mentally lester i have been watching you every step of the way wishing you peace of mind these things are always so difficult but dont you know i am still sure its for the best it never was right the other way it never could be you couldnt afford to sink back into a mere shellfish life you are not organized temperamentally for that any more than i am you may regret what you are doing now but you would have regretted the other thing quite as much and more you couldnt work your life out that way now could you i dont know about that letty really i dont ive wanted to come and see you for a long time but i didnt think that i ought to the fight was outside you know what i mean yes indeed i do she said soothingly its still inside i havent gotten over it i dont know whether this financial business binds me sufficiently or not ill be frank and tell you that i cant say i love her entirely but im sorry and thats something shes comfortably provided for of course she commented rather than inquired everything she wants jennie is of a peculiar disposition she doesnt want much shes retiring by nature and doesnt care for show ive taken a cottage for her at sandwood a little place north of here on the lake and theres plenty of money in trust but of course she knows she can live anywhere she pleases i understand exactly how she feels lester i know how you feel she is going to suffer very keenly for a while we all do when we have to give up the thing we love but we can get over it and we do at least we can live she will it will go hard at first but after a while she will see how it is and she wont feel any the worse toward you jennie will never reproach me i know that he replied im the one who will do the reproaching ill be abusing myself for some time the trouble is with my particular turn of mind i cant tell for the life of me how much of this disturbing feeling of mine is habit the condition that im accustomed to and how much is sympathy i sometimes think im the the most pointless individual in the world i think too much poor lester she said tenderly well i understand for one youre lonely living where you are arent you i am that he replied why not come and spend a few days down at west baden im going there when he inquired next tuesday let me see he replied im not sure that i can he consulted his notebook i could come thursday for a few days why not do that you need company we can walk and talk things out down there will you yes i will he replied she came toward him trailing a lavender lounging robe youre such a solemn philosopher sir she observed comfortably working through all the ramifications of things why do you you were always like that i cant help it he replied its my nature to think well one thing i know and she tweaked his ear gently youre not going to make another mistake through sympathy if i can help it she said daringly youre going to stay disentangled long enough to give yourself a chance to think out what you want to do you must and i wish for one thing youd take over the management of my affairs you could advise me so much better than my lawyer he arose and walked to the window turning to look back at her solemnly i know what you want he said doggedly and why shouldnt i she demanded again approaching him she looked at him pleadingly defiantly yes why shouldnt i you dont know what youre doing he grumbled but he kept on looking at her she stood there attractive as a woman of her age could be wise considerate full of friendship and affection letty he said you ought not to want to marry me im not worth it really im not im too cynical too indifferent it wont be worth anything in the long run it will be worth something to me she insisted i know what you are anyhow i dont care i want you he took her hands then her arms finally he drew her to him and put his arms about her waist poor letty he said im not worth it youll be sorry no ill not she replied i know what im doing i dont care what you think you are worth she laid her cheek on his shoulder i want you if you keep on i venture to say youll have me he returned he bent and kissed her oh she exclaimed and hid her hot face against his breast this is bad business he thought even as he held her within the circle of his arms it isnt what i ought to be doing still he held her and now when she offered her lips coaxingly he kissed her again and again chapter lvi it is difficult to say whether lester might not have returned to jennie after all but for certain influential factors after a time with his control of his portion of the estate firmly settled in his hands and the storm of original feeling forgotten he was well aware that diplomacy if he ignored his natural tendency to fulfil even implied obligations could readily bring about an arrangement whereby he and jennie could be together but he was haunted by the sense of what might be called an important social opportunity in the form of mrs gerald he was compelled to set over against his natural tendency toward jennie a consciousness of what he was ignoring in the personality and fortunes of her rival who was one of the most significant and interesting figures on the social horizon for think as he would these two women were now persistently opposed in his consciousness the one polished sympathetic philosophic schooled in all the niceties of polite society and with the means to gratify her every wish the other natural sympathetic emotional with no schooling in the ways of polite society but with a feeling for the beauty of life and the lovely things in human relationship which made her beyond any question an exceptional woman mrs gerald saw it and admitted it her criticism of lesters relationship with jennie was not that she was not worth while but that conditions made it impolitic on the other hand union with her was an ideal climax for his social aspirations this would bring everything out right he would be as happy with her as he would be with jennie almost and he would have the satisfaction of knowing that this western social and financial world held no more significant figure than himself it was not wise to delay either this latter excellent solution of his material problems and after thinking it over long and seriously he finally concluded that he would not he had already done jennie the irreparable wrong of leaving her what difference did it make if he did this also she was possessed of everything she could possibly want outside of himself she had herself deemed it advisable for him to leave by such figments of the brain in the face of unsettled and disturbing conditions he was becoming used to the idea of a new alliance the thing which prevented an eventual resumption of relationship in some form with jennie was the constant presence of mrs gerald circumstances conspired to make her the logical solution of his mental quandary at this time alone he could do nothing save to make visits here and there and he did not care to do that he was too indifferent mentally to gather about him as a bachelor that atmosphere which he enjoyed and which a woman like mrs gerald could so readily provide united with her it was simple enough their home then wherever it was would be full of clever people he would need to do little save to appear and enjoy it she understood quite as well as any one how he liked to live she enjoyed to meet the people he enjoyed meeting there were so many things they could do together nicely he visited west baden at the same time she did as she suggested he gave himself over to her in chicago for dinners parties drives her house was quite as much his own as hers she made him feel so she talked to him about her affairs showing him exactly how they stood and why she wished him to intervene in this and that matter she did not wish him to be much alone she did not want him to think or regret she came to represent to him comfort forgetfulness rest from care with the others he visited at her house occasionally and it gradually became rumored about that he would marry her because of the fact that there had been so much discussion of his previous relationship letty decided that if ever this occurred it should be a quiet affair she wanted a simple explanation in the papers of how it had come about and then afterward when things were normal again and gossip had subsided she would enter on a dazzling social display for his sake why not let us get married in april and go abroad for the summer she asked once after they had reached a silent understanding that marriage would eventually follow lets go to japan then we can come back in the fall and take a house on the drive lester had been away from jennie so long now that the first severe wave of selfreproach had passed he was still doubtful but he preferred to stifle his misgivings very well he replied almost jokingly only dont let there be any fuss about it do you really mean that sweet she exclaimed looking over at him they had been spending the evening together quietly reading and chatting ive thought about it a long while he replied i dont see why not she came over to him and sat on his knee putting her arms upon his shoulders i can scarcely believe you said that she said looking at him curiously shall i take it back he asked no no its agreed for april now and well go to japan you cant change your mind there wont be any fuss but my what a trousseau i will prepare he smiled a little constrainedly as she tousled his head there was a missing note somewhere in this gamut of happiness perhaps it was because he was getting old chapter lvii in the meantime jennie was going her way settling herself in the markedly different world in which henceforth she was to move it seemed a terrible thing at first this life without lester despite her own strong individuality her ways had become so involved with his that there seemed to be no possibility of disentangling them constantly she was with him in thought and action just as though they had never separated where was he now what was he doing what was he saying how was he looking in the mornings when she woke it was with the sense that he must be beside her at night as if she could not go to bed alone he would come after a while surely ah no of course he would not come dear heaven think of that never any more and she wanted him so again there were so many little trying things to adjust for a change of this nature is too radical to be passed over lightly the explanation she had to make to vesta was of all the most important this little girl who was old enough now to see and think for herself was not without her surmises and misgivings vesta recalled that her mother had been accused of not being married to her father when she was born she had seen the article about jennie and lester in the sunday paper at the time it had appeared it had been shown to her at school but she had had sense enough to say nothing about it feeling somehow that jennie would not like it lesters disappearance was a complete surprise but she had learned in the last two or three years that her mother was very sensitive and that she could hurt her in unexpected ways jennie was finally compelled to tell vesta that lesters fortune had been dependent on his leaving her solely because she was not of his station vesta listened soberly and half suspected the truth she felt terribly sorry for her mother and because of jennies obvious distress she was trebly gay and courageous she refused outright the suggestion of going to a boardingschool and kept as close to her mother as she could she found interesting books to read with her insisted that they go to see plays together played to her on the piano and asked for her mothers criticisms on her drawing and modeling she found a few friends in the excellent sand wood school and brought them home of an evening to add lightness and gaiety to the cottage life jennie through her growing appreciation of vestas fine character became more and more drawn toward her lester was gone but at least she had vesta that prop would probably sustain her in the face of a waning existence there was also her history to account for to the residents of sandwood in many cases where one is content to lead a secluded life it is not necessary to say much of ones past but as a rule something must be said people have the habit of inquiring if they are no more than butchers and bakers by degrees one must account for this and that fact and it was so here she could not say that her husband was dead lester might come back she had to say that she had left him to give the impression that it would be she if any one who would permit him to return this put her in an interesting and sympathetic light in the neighborhood it was the most sensible thing to do she then settled down to a quiet routine of existence waiting what denouement to her life she could not guess sandwood life was not without its charms for a lover of nature and this with the devotion of vesta offered some slight solace there was the beauty of the lake which with its passing boats was a neverending source of joy and there were many charming drives in the surrounding country jennie had her own horse and carryall one of the horses of the pair they had used in hyde park other household pets appeared in due course of time including a collie that vesta named rats she had brought him from chicago as a puppy and he had grown to be a sterling watchdog sensible and affectionate there was also a cat jimmy woods so called after a boy vesta knew and to whom she insisted the cat bore a marked resemblance there was a singing thrush guarded carefully against a roving desire for birdfood on the part of jimmy woods and a jar of goldfish so this little household drifted along quietly and dreamily indeed but always with the undercurrent of feeling which ran so still because it was so deep there was no word from lester for the first few weeks following his departure he was too busy following up the threads of his new commercial connections and too considerate to wish to keep jennie in a state of mental turmoil over communications which under the present circumstances could mean nothing he preferred to let matters rest for the time being then a little later he would write her sanely and calmly of how things were going he did this after the silence of a month saying that he had been pretty well pressed by commercial affairs that he had been in and out of the city frequently which was the truth and that he would probably be away from chicago a large part of the time in the future he inquired after vesta and the condition of affairs generally at sandwood i may get up there one of these days he suggested but he really did not mean to come and jennie knew that he did not another month passed and then there was a second letter from him not so long as the first one jennie had written him frankly and fully telling him just how things stood with her she concealed entirely her own feelings in the matter saying that she liked the life very much and that she was glad to be at sand wood she expressed the hope that now everything was coming out for the best for him and tried to show him that she was really glad matters had been settled you mustnt think of me as being unhappy she said in one place for im not i am sure it ought to be just as it is and i wouldnt be happy if it were any other way lay out your life so as to give yourself the greatest happiness lester she added you deserve it whatever you do will be just right for me i wont mind she had mrs gerald in mind and he suspected as much but he felt that her generosity must be tinged greatly with selfsacrifice and secret unhappiness it was the one thing which made him hesitate about taking that final step the written word and the hidden thought how they conflict after six months the correspondence was more or less perfunctory on his part and at eight it had ceased temporarily one morning as she was glancing over the daily paper she saw among the society notes the following item the engagement of mrs malcolm gerald of drexel boulevard to lester kane second son of the late archibald kane of cincinnati was formally announced at a party given by the prospective bride on tuesday to a circle of her immediate friends the wedding will take place in april the paper fell from her hands for a few minutes she sat perfectly still looking straight ahead of her could this thing be so she asked herself had it really come at last she had known that it must come and yet and yet she had always hoped that it would not why had she hoped had not she herself sent him away had not she herself suggested this very thing in a roundabout way it had come now what must she do stay here as a pensioner the idea was objectionable to her and yet he had set aside a goodly sum to be hers absolutely in the hands of a trust company in la salle street were railway certificates aggregating seventyfive thousand dollars which yielded four thousand five hundred annually the income being paid to her direct could she refuse to receive this money there was vesta to be considered jennie felt hurt through and through by this denouement and yet as she sat there she realized that it was foolish to be angry life was always doing this sort of a thing to her it would go on doing so she was sure of it if she went out in the world and earned her own living what difference would it make to him what difference would it make to mrs gerald here she was walled in this little place leading an obscure existence and there was he out in the great world enjoying life in its fullest and freest sense it was too bad but why cry why her eyes indeed were dry but her very soul seemed to be torn in pieces within her she rose carefully hid the newspaper at the bottom of a trunk and turned the key upon it chapter lviii now that his engagement to mrs gerald was an accomplished fact lester found no particular difficulty in reconciling himself to the new order of things undoubtedly it was all for the best he was sorry for jennie very sorry so was mrs gerald but there was a practical unguent to her grief in the thought that it was best for both lester and the girl he would be happier was so now and jennie would eventually realize that she had done a wise and kindly thing she would be glad in the consciousness that she had acted so unselfishly as for mrs gerald because of her indifference to the late malcolm gerald and because she was realizing the dreams of her youth in getting lester at last even though a little late she was intensely happy she could think of nothing finer than this daily life with him the places they would go the things they would see her first season in chicago as mrs lester kane the following winter was going to be something worth remembering and as for japan that was almost too good to be true lester wrote to jennie of his coming marriage to mrs gerald he said that he had no explanation to make it wouldnt be worth anything if he did make it he thought he ought to marry mrs gerald he thought he ought to let her jennie know he hoped she was well he wanted her always to feel that he had her real interests at heart he would do anything in his power to make life as pleasant and agreeable for her as possible he hoped she would forgive him and would she remember him affectionately to vesta she ought to be sent to a finishing school jennie understood the situation perfectly she knew that lester had been drawn to mrs gerald from the time he met her at the carlton in london she had been angling for him now she had him it was all right she hoped he would be happy she was glad to write and tell him so explaining that she had seen the announcement in the papers lester read her letter thoughtfully there was more between the lines than the written words conveyed her fortitude was a charm to him even in this hour in spite of all he had done and what he was now going to do he realized that he still cared for jennie in a way she was a noble and a charming woman if everything else had been all right he would not be going to marry mrs gerald at all and yet he did marry her the ceremony was performed on april fifteenth at the residence of mrs gerald a roman catholic priest officiating lester was a poor example of the faith he occasionally professed he was an agnostic but because he had been reared in the church he felt that he might as well be married in it some fifty guests intimate friends had been invited the ceremony went off with perfect smoothness there were jubilant congratulations and showers of rice and confetti while the guests were still eating and drinking lester and letty managed to escape by a side entrance into a closed carriage and were off fifteen minutes later there was pursuit pellmell on the part of the guests to the chicago rock island and pacific depot but by that time the happy couple were in their private car and the arrival of the rice throwers made no difference more champagne was opened then the starting of the train ended all excitement and the newly wedded pair were at last safely off well now you have me said lester cheerfully pulling letty down beside him into a seat what of it this of it she exclaimed and hugged him close kissing him fervently in four days they were in san francisco and two days later on board a fast steamship bound for the land of the mikado in the meanwhile jennie was left to brood the original announcement in the newspapers had said that he was to be married in april and she had kept close watch for additional information finally she learned that the wedding would take place on april fifteenth at the residence of the prospective bride the hour being high noon in spite of her feeling of resignation jennie followed it all hopelessly like a child hungry and forlorn looking into a lighted window at christmas time on the day of the wedding she waited miserably for twelve oclock to strike it seemed as though she were really present and looking on she could see in her minds eye the handsome residence the carriages the guests the feast the merriment the ceremony all telepathically and psychologically she received impressions of the private car and of the joyous journey they were going to take the papers had stated that they would spend their honeymoon in japan their honeymoon her lester and mrs gerald was so attractive she could see her now the new mrs kane the only mrs kane that ever was lying in his arms he had held her so once he had loved her yes he had there was a solid lump in her throat as she thought of this oh dear she sighed to herself and clasped her hands forcefully but it did no good she was just as miserable as before when the day was over she was actually relieved anyway the deed was done and nothing could change it vesta was sympathetically aware of what was happening but kept silent she too had seen the report in the newspaper when the first and second day after had passed jennie was much calmer mentally for now she was face to face with the inevitable but it was weeks before the sharp pain dulled to the old familiar ache then there were months before they would be back again though of course that made no difference now only japan seemed so far off and somehow she had liked the thought that lester was near her somewhere in the city the spring and summer passed and now it was early in october one chilly day vesta came home from school complaining of a headache when jennie had given her hot milk a favorite remedy of her mothers and had advised a cold towel for the back of her head vesta went to her room and lay down the following morning she had a slight fever this lingered while the local physician dr emory treated her tentatively suspecting that it might be typhoid of which there were several cases in the village this doctor told jennie that vesta was probably strong enough constitutionally to shake it off but it might be that she would have a severe siege mistrusting her own skill in so delicate a situation jennie sent to chicago for a trained nurse and then began a period of watchfulness which was a combination of fear longing hope and courage now there could be no doubt the disease was typhoid jennie hesitated about communicating with lester who was supposed to be in new york the papers had said that he intended to spend the winter there but when the doctor after watching the case for a week pronounced it severe she thought she ought to write anyhow for no one could tell what would happen lester had been so fond of vesta he would probably want to know the letter sent to him did not reach him for at the time it arrived he was on his way to the west indies jennie was compelled to watch alone by vestas sickbed for although sympathetic neighbors realizing the pathos of the situation were attentive they could not supply the spiritual consolation which only those who truly love us can give there was a period when vesta appeared to be rallying and both the physician and the nurse were hopeful but afterward she became weaker it was said by dr emory that her heart and kidneys had become affected there came a time when the fact had to be faced that death was imminent the doctors face was grave the nurse was noncommittal in her opinion jennie hovered about praying the only prayer that is prayer the fervent desire of her heart concentrated on the one issue that vesta should get well the child had come so close to her during the last few years she understood her mother she was beginning to realize clearly what her life had been and jennie through her had grown to a broad understanding of responsibility she knew now what it meant to be a good mother and to have children if lester had not objected to it and she had been truly married she would have been glad to have others again she had always felt that she owed vesta so much at least a long and happy life to make up to her for the ignominy of her birth and rearing jennie had been so happy during the past few years to see vesta growing into beautiful graceful intelligent womanhood and now she was dying dr emory finally sent to chicago for a physician friend of his who came to consider the case with him he was an old man grave sympathetic understanding he shook his head the treatment has been correct he said her system does not appear to be strong enough to endure the strain some physiques are more susceptible to this malady than others it was agreed that if within three days a change for the better did not come the end was close at hand no one can conceive the strain to which jennies spirit was subjected by this intelligence for it was deemed best that she should know she hovered about whitefaced feeling intensely but scarcely thinking she seemed to vibrate consciously with vestas altering states if there was the least improvement she felt it physically if there was a decline her barometric temperament registered the fact there was a mrs davis a fine motherly soul of fifty stout and sympathetic who lived four doors from jennie and who understood quite well how she was feeling she had cooperated with the nurse and doctor from the start to keep jennies mental state as nearly normal as possible now you just go to your room and lie down mrs kane she would say to jennie when she found her watching helplessly at the bedside or wandering to and fro wondering what to do ill take charge of everything ill do just what you would do lord bless you dont you think i know ive been the mother of seven and lost three dont you think i understand jennie put her head on her big warm shoulder one day and cried mrs davis cried with her i understand she said there there you poor dear now you come with me and she led her to her sleepingroom jennie could not be away long she came back after a few minutes unrested and unrefreshed finally one midnight when the nurse had persuaded her that all would be well until morning anyhow there came a hurried stirring in the sickroom jennie was lying down for a few minutes on her bed in the adjoining room she heard it and arose mrs davis had come in and she and the nurse were conferring as to vestas condition standing close beside her jennie understood she came up and looked at her daughter keenly vestas pale waxen face told the story she was breathing faintly her eyes closed shes very weak whispered the nurse mrs davis took jennies hand the moments passed and after a time the clock in the hall struck one miss murfree the nurse moved to the medicinetable several times wetting a soft piece of cotton cloth with alcohol and bathing vestas lips at the striking of the halfhour there was a stir of the weak body a profound sigh jennie bent forward eagerly but mrs davis drew her back the nurse came and motioned them away respiration had ceased mrs davis seized jennie firmly there there you poor dear she whispered when she began to shake it cant be helped dont cry jennie sank on her knees beside the bed and caressed vestas still warm hand oh no vesta she pleaded not you not you there dear come now soothed the voice of mrs davis cant you leave it all in gods hands cant you believe that everything is for the best jennie felt as if the earth had fallen all ties were broken there was no light anywhere in the immense darkness of her existence chapter lix this added blow from inconsiderate fortune was quite enough to throw jennie back into that state of hypermelancholia from which she had been drawn with difficulty during the few years of comfort and affection which she had enjoyed with lester in hyde park it was really weeks before she could realize that vesta was gone the emaciated figure which she saw for a day or two after the end did not seem like vesta where was the joy and lightness the quickness of motion the subtle radiance of health all gone only this pale lilyhued shell and silence jennie had no tears to shed only a deep insistent pain to feel if only some counselor of eternal wisdom could have whispered to her that obvious and convincing truth there are no dead miss murfree dr emory mrs davis and some others among the neighbors were most sympathetic and considerate mrs davis sent a telegram to lester saying that vesta was dead but being absent there was no response the house was looked after with scrupulous care by others for jennie was incapable of attending to it herself she walked about looking at things which vesta had owned or liked things which lester or she had given her sighing over the fact that vesta would not need or use them any more she gave instructions that the body should be taken to chicago and buried in the cemetery of the redeemer for lester at the time of gerhardts death had purchased a small plot of ground there she also expressed her wish that the minister of the little lutheran church in cottage grove avenue where gerhardt had attended should be requested to say a few words at the grave there were the usual preliminary services at the house the local methodist minister read a portion of the first epistle of paul to the thessalonians and a body of vestas classmates sang nearer my god to thee there were flowers a white coffin a world of sympathetic expressions and then vesta was taken away the coffin was properly incased for transportation put on the train and finally delivered at the lutheran cemetery in chicago jennie moved as one in a dream she was dazed almost to the point of insensibility five of her neighborhood friends at the solicitation of mrs davis were kind enough to accompany her at the graveside when the body was finally lowered she looked at it one might have thought indifferently for she was numb from suffering she returned to sandwood after it was all over saying that she would not stay long she wanted to come back to chicago where she could be near vesta and gerhardt after the funeral jennie tried to think of her future she fixed her mind on the need of doing something even though she did not need to she thought that she might like to try nursing and could start at once to obtain the training which was required she also thought of william he was unmarried and perhaps he might be willing to come and live with her only she did not know where he was and bass was also in ignorance of his whereabouts she finally concluded that she would try to get work in a store her disposition was against idleness she could not live alone here and she could not have her neighbors sympathetically worrying over what was to become of her miserable as she was she would be less miserable stopping in a hotel in chicago and looking for something to do or living in a cottage somewhere near the cemetery of the redeemer it also occurred to her that she might adopt a homeless child there were a number of orphan asylums in the city some three weeks after vestas death lester returned to chicago with his wife and discovered the first letter the telegram and an additional note telling him that vesta was dead he was truly grieved for his affection for the girl had been real he was very sorry for jennie and he told his wife that he would have to go out and see her he was wondering what she would do she could not live alone perhaps he could suggest something which would help her he took the train to sandwood but jennie had gone to the hotel tremont in chicago he went there but jennie had gone to her daughters grave later he called again and found her in when the boy presented his card she suffered an upwelling of feeling a wave that was more intense than that with which she had received him in the olden days for now her need of him was greater lester in spite of the glamor of his new affection and the restoration of his wealth power and dignities had had time to think deeply of what he had done his original feeling of doubt and dissatisfaction with himself had never wholly quieted it did not ease him any to know that he had left jennie comfortably fixed for it was always so plain to him that money was not the point at issue with her affection was what she craved without it she was like a rudderless boat on an endless sea and he knew it she needed him and he was ashamed to think that his charity had not outweighed his sense of selfpreservation and his desire for material advantage today as the elevator carried him up to her room he was really sorry though he knew now that no act of his could make things right he had been to blame from the very beginning first for taking her then for failing to stick by a bad bargain well it could not be helped now the best thing he could do was to be fair to counsel with her to give her the best of his sympathy and advice hello jennie he said familiarly as she opened the door to him in her hotel room his glance taking in the ravages which death and suffering had wrought she was thinner her face quite drawn and colorless her eyes larger by contrast im awfully sorry about vesta he said a little awkwardly i never dreamed anything like that could happen it was the first word of comfort which had meant anything to her since vesta died since lester had left her in fact it touched her that he had come to sympathize for the moment she could not speak tears welled over her eyelids and down upon her cheeks dont cry jennie he said putting his arm around her and holding her head to his shoulder im sorry ive been sorry for a good many things that cant be helped now im intensely sorry for this where did you bury her beside papa she said sobbing too bad he murmured and held her in silence she finally gained control of herself sufficiently to step away from him then wiping her eyes with her handkerchief she asked him to sit down im so sorry he went on that this should have happened while i was away i would have been with you if i had been here i suppose you wont want to live out at sand wood now i cant lester she replied i couldnt stand it where are you thinking of going oh i dont know yet i didnt want to be a bother to those people out there i thought id get a little house somewhere and adopt a baby maybe or get something to do i dont like to be alone that isnt a bad idea he said that of adopting a baby it would be a lot of company for you you know how to go about getting one you just ask at one of these asylums dont you i think theres something more than that he replied thoughtfully there are some formalities i dont know what they are they try to keep control of the child in some way you had better consult with watson and get him to help you pick out your baby and then let him do the rest ill speak to him about it lester saw that she needed companionship badly where is your brother george he asked hes in rochester but he couldnt come bass said he was married she added there isnt any other member of the family you could persuade to come and live with you i might get william but i dont know where he is why not try that new section west of jackson park he suggested if you want a house here in chicago i see some nice cottages out that way you neednt buy just rent until you see how well youre satisfied jennie thought this good advice because it came from lester it was good of him to take this much interest in her affairs she wasnt entirely separated from him after all he cared a little she asked him how his wife was whether he had had a pleasant trip whether he was going to stay in chicago all the while he was thinking that he had treated her badly he went to the window and looked down into dearborn street the world of traffic below holding his attention the great mass of trucks and vehicles the counter streams of hurrying pedestrians seemed like a puzzle so shadows march in a dream it was growing dusk and lights were springing up here and there i want to tell you something jennie said lester finally rousing himself from his fit of abstraction i may seem peculiar to you after all that has happened but i still care for you in my way ive thought of you right along since i left i thought it good business to leave you the way things were i thought i liked letty well enough to marry her from one point of view it still seems best but im not so much happier i was just as happy with you as i ever will be it isnt myself thats important in this transaction apparently the individual doesnt count much in the situation i dont know whether you see what im driving at but all of us are more or less pawns were moved about like chessmen by circumstances over which we have no control i understand lester she answered im not complaining i know its for the best after all life is more or less of a farce he went on a little bitterly its a silly show the best we can do is to hold our personality intact it doesnt appear that integrity has much to do with it jennie did not quite grasp what he was talking about but she knew it meant that he was not entirely satisfied with himself and was sorry for her dont worry over me lester she consoled im all right ill get along it did seem terrible to me for a while getting used to being alone ill be all right now ill get along i want you to feel that my attitude hasnt changed he continued eagerly im interested in what concerns you mrs letty understands that she knows just how i feel when you get settled ill come in and see how youre fixed ill come around here again in a few days you understand how i feel dont you yes i do she said he took her hand turning it sympathetically in his own dont worry he said i dont want you to do that ill do the best i can youre still jennie to me if you dont mind im pretty bad but im not all bad its all right lester i wanted you to do as you did its for the best you probably are happy since now jennie he interrupted then he pressed affectionately her hand her arm her shoulder want to kiss me for old times sake he smiled she put her hands over his shoulders looked long into his eyes then kissed him when their lips met she trembled lester also felt unsteady jennie saw his agitation and tried hard to speak youd better go now she said firmly its getting dark he went away and yet he knew that he wanted above all things to remain she was still the one woman in the world for him and jennie felt comforted even though the separation still existed in all its finality she did not endeavor to explain or adjust the moral and ethical entanglements of the situation she was not like so many endeavoring to put the ocean into a teacup or to tie up the shifting universe in a mess of strings called law lester still cared for her a little he cared for letty too that was all right she had hoped once that he might want her only since he did not was his affection worth nothing she could not think she could not feel that and neither could he chapter lx the drift of events for a period of five years carried lester and jennie still farther apart they settled naturally into their respective spheres without the renewal of the old time relationship which their several meetings at the tremont at first seemed to foreshadow lester was in the thick of social and commercial affairs he walked in paths to which jennies retiring soul had never aspired jennies own existence was quiet and uneventful there was a simple cottage in a very respectable but not showy neighborhood near jackson park on the south side where she lived in retirement with a little fosterchild a chestnuthaired girl taken from the western home for the friendless as her sole companion here she was known as mrs j g stover for she had deemed it best to abandon the name of kane mr and mrs lester kane when resident in chicago were the occupants of a handsome mansion on the lake shore drive where parties balls receptions dinners were given in rapid and at times almost pyrotechnic succession lester however had become in his way a lover of a peaceful and wellentertained existence he had cut from his list of acquaintances and associates a number of people who had been a little doubtful or overfamiliar or indifferent or talkative during a certain period which to him was a memory merely he was a director and in several cases the chairman of a board of directors in nine of the most important financial and commercial organizations of the west the united traction company of cincinnati the western crucible company the united carriage company the second national bank of chicago the first national bank of cincinnati and several others of equal importance he was never a personal factor in the affairs of the united carriage company preferring to be represented by counsel mr dwight l watson but he took a keen interest in its affairs he had not seen his brother robert to speak to him in seven years he had not seen imogene who lived in chicago in three louise amy their husbands and some of their closest acquaintances were practically strangers the firm of knight keatley obrien had nothing whatever to do with his affairs the truth was that lester in addition to becoming a little phlegmatic was becoming decidedly critical in his outlook on life he could not make out what it was all about in distant ages a queer thing had come to pass there had started on its way in the form of evolution a minute cellular organism which had apparently reproduced itself by division had early learned to combine itself with others to organize itself into bodies strange forms of fish animals and birds and had finally learned to organize itself into man man on his part composed as he was of selforganizing cells was pushing himself forward into comfort and different aspects of existence by means of union and organization with other men why heaven only knew here he was endowed with a peculiar brain and a certain amount of talent and he had inherited a certain amount of wealth which he now scarcely believed he deserved only luck had favored him but he could not see that any one else might be said to deserve this wealth any more than himself seeing that his use of it was as conservative and constructive and practical as the next ones he might have been born poor in which case he would have been as well satisfied as the next one not more so why should he complain why worry why speculate the world was going steadily forward of its own volition whether he would or no truly it was and was there any need for him to disturb himself about it there was not he fancied at times that it might as well never have been started at all the one divine faroff event of the poet did not appeal to him as having any basis in fact mrs lester kane was of very much the same opinion jennie living on the south side with her adopted child rose perpetua was of no fixed conclusion as to the meaning of life she had not the incisive reasoning capacity of either mr or mrs lester kane she had seen a great deal suffered a great deal and had read some in a desultory way her mind had never grasped the nature and character of specialized knowledge history physics chemistry botany geology and sociology were not fixed departments in her brain as they were in lesters and lettys instead there was the feeling that the world moved in some strange unstable way apparently no one knew clearly what it was all about people were born and died some believed that the world had been made six thousand years before some that it was millions of years old was it all blind chance or was there some guiding intelligence a god almost in spite of herself she felt there must be something a higher power which produced all the beautiful things the flowers the stars the trees the grass nature was so beautiful if at times life seemed cruel yet this beauty still persisted the thought comforted her she fed upon it in her hours of secret loneliness it has been said that jennie was naturally of an industrious turn she liked to be employed though she thought constantly as she worked she was of matronly proportions in these days not disagreeably large but full bodied shapely and smoothfaced in spite of her cares her eyes were gray and appealing her hair was still of a rich brown but there were traces of gray in it her neighbors spoke of her as sweettempered kindly and hospitable they knew nothing of her history except that she had formerly resided in sandwood and before that in cleveland she was very reticent as to her past jennie had fancied because of her natural aptitude for taking care of sick people that she might get to be a trained nurse but she was obliged to abandon that idea for she found that only young people were wanted she also thought that some charitable organization might employ her but she did not understand the new theory of charity which was then coming into general acceptance and practice namely only to help others to help themselves she believed in giving and was not inclined to look too closely into the credentials of those who asked for help consequently her timid inquiry at one relief agency after another met with indifference if not unqualified rebuke she finally decided to adopt another child for rose perpetuas sake she succeeded in securing a boy four years old who was known as henry henry stover her support was assured for her income was paid to her through a trust company she had no desire for speculation or for the devious ways of trade the care of flowers the nature of children the ordering of a home were more in her province one of the interesting things in connection with this separation once it had been firmly established related to robert and lester for these two since the reading of the will a number of years before had never met robert had thought of his brother often he had followed his success since he had left jennie with interest he read of his marriage to mrs gerald with pleasure he had always considered her an ideal companion for his brother he knew by many signs and tokens that his brother since the unfortunate termination of their fathers attitude and his own peculiar movements to gain control of the kane company did not like him still they had never been so far apart mentally certainly not in commercial judgment lester was prosperous now he could afford to be generous he could afford to make up and after all he had done his best to aid his brother to come to his senses and with the best intentions there were mutual interests they could share financially if they were friends he wondered from time to time if lester would not be friendly with him time passed and then once when he was in chicago he made the friends with whom he was driving purposely turn into the north shore in order to see the splendid mansion which the kanes occupied he knew its location from hearsay and description when he saw it a touch of the old kane home atmosphere came back to him lester in revising the property after purchase had had a conservatory built on one side not unlike the one at home in cincinnati that same night he sat down and wrote lester asking if he would not like to dine with him at the union club he was only in town for a day or two and he would like to see him again there was some feeling he knew but there was a proposition he would like to talk to him about would he come say on thursday on the receipt of this letter lester frowned and fell into a brown study he had never really been healed of the wound that his father had given him he had never been comfortable in his mind since robert had deserted him so summarily he realized now that the stakes his brother had been playing for were big but after all he had been his brother and if he had been in roberts place at the time he would not have done as he had done at least he hoped not now robert wanted to see him he thought once of not answering at all then he thought he would write and say no but a curious desire to see robert again to hear what he had to say to listen to the proposition he had to offer came over him he decided to write yes it could do no harm he knew it could do no good they might agree to let bygones be bygones but the damage had been done could a broken bowl be mended and called whole it might be called whole but what of it was it not broken and mended he wrote and intimated that he would come on the thursday in question robert called up from the auditorium to remind him of the engagement lester listened curiously to the sound of his voice all right he said ill be with you at noon he went downtown and there within the exclusive precincts of the union club the two brothers met and looked at each other again robert was thinner than when lester had seen him last and a little grayer his eyes were bright and steely but there were crowsfeet on either side his manner was quick keen dynamic lester was noticeably of another type solid brusque and indifferent men spoke of lester these days as a little hard roberts keen blue eyes did not disturb him in the least did not affect him in any way he saw his brother just as he was for he had the larger philosophic and interpretative insight but robert could not place lester exactly he could not fathom just what had happened to him in these years lester was stouter not gray for some reason but sandy and ruddy looking like a man who was fairly well satisfied to take life as he found it lester looked at his brother with a keen steady eye the latter shifted a little for he was restless he could see that there was no loss of that mental force and courage which had always been predominant characteristics in lesters makeup i thought id like to see you again lester robert remarked after they had clasped hands in the customary grip its been a long time now nearly eight years hasnt it about that replied lester how are things with you oh about the same youve been fairly well i see never sick said lester a little cold now and then i dont often go to bed with anything hows your wife oh margarets fine and the children we dont see much of ralph and berenice since they married but the others are around more or less i suppose your wife is all right he said hesitatingly it was difficult ground for robert lester eyed him without a change of expression yes he replied she enjoys pretty fair health shes quite well at present they drifted mentally for a few moments while lester inquired after the business and amy louise and imogene he admitted frankly that he neither saw nor heard from them nowadays robert told him what he could the thing that i was thinking of in connection with you lester said robert finally is this matter of the western crucible steel company you havent been sitting there as a director in person i notice but your attorney watson has been acting for you clever man that the management isnt right we all know that we need a practical steel man at the head of it if the thing is ever going to pay properly i have voted my stock with yours right along because the propositions made by watson have been right he agrees with me that things ought to be changed now i have a chance to buy seventy shares held by rossiters widow that with yours and mine would give us control of the company i would like to have you take them though it doesnt make a bit of difference so long as its in the family you can put any one you please in for president and well make the thing come out right lester smiled it was a pleasant proposition watson had told him that roberts interests were cooperating with him lester had long suspected that robert would like to make up this was the olive branch the control of a property worth in the neighborhood of a million and a half thats very nice of you said lester solemnly its a rather liberal thing to do what makes you want to do it now well to tell you the honest truth lester replied robert i never did feel right about that will business i never did feel right about that secretarytreasurership and some other things that have happened i dont want to rake up the past you smile at that but i cant help telling you how i feel ive been pretty ambitious in the past i was pretty ambitious just about the time that father died to get this united carriage scheme under way and i was afraid you might not like it i have thought since that i ought not to have done it but i did i suppose youre not anxious to hear any more about that old affair this other thing though might be handed out as a sort of compensation put in lester quietly not exactly that lester though it may have something of that in it i know these things dont matter very much to you now i know that the time to do things was years ago not now still i thought sincerely that you might be interested in this proposition it might lead to other things frankly i thought it might patch up matters between us were brothers after all yes said lester were brothers he was thinking as he said this of the irony of the situation how much had this sense of brotherhood been worth in the past robert had practically forced him into his present relationship and while jennie had been really the only one to suffer he could not help feeling angry it was true that robert had not cut him out of his onefourth of his fathers estate but certainly he had not helped him to get it and now robert was thinking that this offer of his might mend things it hurt him lester a little it irritated him life was strange i cant see it robert he said finally and determinedly i can appreciate the motive that prompts you to make this offer but i cant see the wisdom of my taking it your opportunity is your opportunity i dont want it we can make all the changes you suggest if you take the stock im rich enough anyhow bygones are bygones im perfectly willing to talk with you from time to time thats all you want this other thing is simply a sop with which to plaster an old wound you want my friendship and so far as im concerned you have that i dont hold any grudge against you i wont robert looked at him fixedly he half smiled he admired lester in spite of all that he had done to him in spite of all that lester was doing to him now i dont know but what youre right lester he admitted finally i didnt make this offer in any petty spirit though i wanted to patch up this matter of feeling between us i wont say anything more about it youre not coming down to cincinnati soon are you i dont expect to replied lester if you do id like to have you come and stay with us bring your wife we could talk over old times lester smiled an enigmatic smile ill be glad to he said without emotion but he remembered that in the days of jennie it was different they would never have receded from their position regarding her well he thought perhaps i cant blame them let it go they talked on about other things finally lester remembered an appointment ill have to leave you soon he said looking at his watch i ought to go too said robert they rose well anyhow he added as they walked toward the cloakroom we wont be absolute strangers in the future will we certainly not said lester ill see you from time to time they shook hands and separated amicably there was a sense of unsatisfied obligation and some remorse in roberts mind as he saw his brother walking briskly away lester was an able man why was it that there was so much feeling between them had been even before jennie had appeared then he remembered his old thoughts about snaky deeds that was what his brother lacked and that only he was not crafty not darkly cruel hence what a world he thought on his part lester went away feeling a slight sense of opposition to but also of sympathy for his brother he was not so terribly bad not different from other men why criticize what would he have done if he had been in roberts place robert was getting along so was he he could see now how it all came about why he had been made the victim why his brother had been made the keeper of the great fortune its the way the world runs he thought what difference does it make i have enough to live on why not let it go at that chapter lxi the days of man under the old dispensation or rather according to that supposedly biblical formula which persists are threescore years and ten it is so ingrained in the raceconsciousness by mouthtomouth utterance that it seems the profoundest of truths as a matter of fact man even under his mortal illusion is organically built to live five times the period of his maturity and would do so if he but knew that it is spirit which endures that age is an illusion and that there is no death yet the racethought gained from what dream of materialism we know not persists and the death of man under the mathematical formula so fearfully accepted is daily registered lester was one of those who believed in this formula he was nearing sixty he thought he had say twenty years more at the utmost to live perhaps not so long well he had lived comfortably he felt that he could not complain if death was coming let it come he was ready at any time no complaint or resistance would issue from him life in most of its aspects was a silly show anyhow he admitted that it was mostly illusion easily proved to be so that it might all be one he sometimes suspected it was very much like a dream in its composition truly sometimes like a very bad dream all he had to sustain him in his acceptance of its reality from hour to hour and day to day was apparent contact with this material proposition and that people meetings of boards of directors individuals and organizations planning to do this and that his wifes social functions letty loved him as a fine grizzled example of a philosopher she admired as jennie had his solid determined phlegmatic attitude in the face of troubled circumstance all the winds of fortune or misfortune could not apparently excite or disturb lester he refused to be frightened he refused to budge from his beliefs and feelings and usually had to be pushed away from them still believing if he were gotten away at all he refused to do anything save as he always said look the facts in the face and fight he could be made to fight easily enough if imposed upon but only in a stubborn resisting way his plan was to resist every effort to coerce him to the last ditch if he had to let go in the end he would when compelled but his views as to the value of not letting go were quite the same even when he had let go under compulsion his views of living were still decidedly material grounded in creature comforts and he had always insisted upon having the best of everything if the furnishings of his home became the least dingy he was for having them torn out and sold and the house done over if he traveled money must go ahead of him and smooth the way he did not want argument useless talk or silly palaver as he called it every one must discuss interesting topics with him or not talk at all letty understood him thoroughly she would chuck him under the chin mornings or shake his solid head between her hands telling him he was a brute but a nice kind of a brute yes yes he would growl i know im an animal i suppose youre a seraphic suggestion of attenuated thought no you hush she would reply for at times he could cut like a knife without really meaning to be unkind then he would pet her a little for in spite of her vigorous conception of life he realized that she was more or less dependent upon him it was always so plain to her that he could get along without her for reasons of kindliness he was trying to conceal this to pretend the necessity of her presence but it was so obvious that he really could dispense with her easily enough now letty did depend upon lester it was something in so shifty and uncertain a world to be near so fixed and determined a quantity as this bearman it was like being close to a warmly glowing lamp in the dark or a bright burning fire in the cold lester was not afraid of anything he felt that he knew how to live and to die it was natural that a temperament of this kind should have its solid material manifestation at every point having his financial affairs well in hand most of his holding being shares of big companies where boards of solemn directors merely approved the strenuous efforts of ambitious executives to make good he had leisure for living he and letty were fond of visiting the various american and european wateringplaces he gambled a little for he found that there was considerable diversion in risking interesting sums on the spin of a wheel or the fortuitous roll of a ball and he took more and more to drinking not in the sense that a drunkard takes to it but as a high liver socially and with all his friends he was inclined to drink the rich drinks when he did not take straight whiskey champagne sparkling burgundy the expensive and effervescent white wines when he drank he could drink a great deal and he ate in proportion nothing must be served but the best soup fish entree roast game dessert everything that made up a showy dinner and he had long since determined that only a highpriced chef was worth while they had found an old cordon bleu louis berdot who had served in the house of one of the great dry goods princes and this man he engaged he cost lester a hundred dollars a week but his reply to any question was that he only had one life to live the trouble with this attitude was that it adjusted nothing improved nothing left everything to drift on toward an indefinite end if lester had married jennie and accepted the comparatively meager income of ten thousand a year he would have maintained the same attitude to the end it would have led him to a stolid indifference to the social world of which now necessarily he was a part he would have drifted on with a few mentally compatible cronies who would have accepted him for what he was a good fellow and jennie in the end would not have been so much better off than she was now one of the changes which was interesting was that the kanes transferred their residence to new york mrs kane had become very intimate with a group of clever women in the eastern four hundred or nine hundred and had been advised and urged to transfer the scene of her activities to new york she finally did so leasing a house in seventyeighth street near madison avenue she installed a novelty for her a complete staff of liveried servants after the english fashion and had the rooms of her house done in correlative periods lester smiled at her vanity and love of show you talk about your democracy he grunted one day you have as much democracy as i have religion and thats none at all why how you talk she denied i am democratic we all run in classes you do im merely accepting the logic of the situation the logic of your grandmother do you call a butler and doorman in red velvet a part of the necessity of the occasion i certainly do she replied maybe not the necessity exactly but the spirit surely why should you quarrel youre the first one to insist on perfection to quarrel if there is any flaw in the order of things you never heard me quarrel oh i dont mean that literally but you demand perfection the exact spirit of the occasion and you know it maybe i do but what has that to do with your democracy i am democratic i insist on it im as democratic in spirit as any woman only i see things as they are and conform as much as possible for comforts sake and so do you dont you throw rocks at my glass house mister master yours is so transparent i can see every move you make inside im democratic and youre not he teased but he approved thoroughly of everything she did she was he sometimes fancied a better executive in her world than he was in his drifting in this fashion wining dining drinking the waters of this curative spring and that traveling in luxurious ease and taking no physical exercise finally altered his body from a vigorous quickmoving wellbalanced organism into one where plethora of substance was clogging every essential function his liver kidneys spleen pancreas every organ in fact had been overtaxed for some time to keep up the process of digestion and elimination in the past seven years he had become uncomfortably heavy his kidneys were weak and so were the arteries of his brain by dieting proper exercise the right mental attitude he might have lived to be eighty or ninety as a matter of fact he was allowing himself to drift into a physical state in which even a slight malady might prove dangerous the result was inevitable and it came it so happened that he and letty had gone to the north cape on a cruise with a party of friends lester in order to attend to some important business decided to return to chicago late in november he arranged to have his wife meet him in new york just before the christmas holidays he wrote watson to expect him and engaged rooms at the auditorium for he had sold the chicago residence some two years before and was now living permanently in new york one late november day after having attended to a number of details and cleared up his affairs very materially lester was seized with what the doctor who was called to attend him described as a cold in the intestines a disturbance usually symptomatic of some other weakness either of the blood or of some organ he suffered great pain and the usual remedies in that case were applied there were bandages of red flannel with a mustard dressing and specifics were also administered he experienced some relief but he was troubled with a sense of impending disaster he had watson cable his wife there was nothing serious about it but he was ill a trained nurse was in attendance and his valet stood guard at the door to prevent annoyance of any kind it was plain that letty could not reach chicago under three weeks he had the feeling that he would not see her again curiously enough not only because he was in chicago but because he had never been spiritually separated from jennie he was thinking about her constantly at this time he had intended to go out and see her just as soon as he was through with his business engagements and before he left the city he had asked watson how she was getting along and had been informed that everything was well with her she was living quietly and looking in good health so watson said lester wished he could see her this thought grew as the days passed and he grew no better he was suffering from time to time with severe attacks of griping pains that seemed to tie his viscera into knots and left him very weak several times the physician administered cocaine with a needle in order to relieve him of useless pain after one of the severe attacks he called watson to his side told him to send the nurse away and then said watson id like to have you do me a favor ask mrs stover if she wont come here to see me youd better go and get her just send the nurse and kozo the valet away for the afternoon or while shes here if she comes at any other time id like to have her admitted watson understood he liked this expression of sentiment he was sorry for jennie he was sorry for lester he wondered what the world would think if it could know of this bit of romance in connection with so prominent a man lester was decent he had made watson prosperous the latter was only too glad to serve him in any way he called a carriage and rode out to jennies residence he found her watering some plants her face expressed her surprise at his unusual presence i come on a rather troublesome errand mrs stover he said using her assumed name your that is mr kane is quite sick at the auditorium his wife is in europe and he wanted to know if i wouldnt come out here and ask you to come and see him he wanted me to bring you if possible could you come with me now why yes said jennie her face a study the children were in school an old swedish housekeeper was in the kitchen she could go as well as not but there was coming back to her in detail a dream she had had several nights before it had seemed to her that she was out on a dark mystic body of water over which was hanging something like a fog or a pall of smoke she heard the water ripple or stir faintly and then out of the surrounding darkness a boat appeared it was a little boat oarless or not visibly propelled and in it were her mother and vesta and some one whom she could not make out her mothers face was pale and sad very much as she had often seen it in life she looked at jennie solemnly sympathetically and then suddenly jennie realized that the third occupant of the boat was lester he looked at her gloomily an expression she had never seen on his face before and then her mother remarked well we must go now the boat began to move a great sense of loss came over her and she cried oh dont leave me mamma but her mother only looked at her out of deep sad still eyes and the boat was gone she woke with a start half fancying that lester was beside her she stretched out her hand to touch his arm then she drew herself up in the dark and rubbed her eyes realizing that she was alone a great sense of depression remained with her and for two days it haunted her then when it seemed as if it were nothing mr watson appeared with his ominous message she went to dress and reappeared looking as troubled as were her thoughts she was very pleasing in her appearance yet a sweet kindly woman well dressed and shapely she had never been separated mentally from lester just as he had never grown entirely away from her she was always with him in thought just as in the years when they were together her fondest memories were of the days when he first courted her in cleveland the days when he had carried her off much as the caveman seized his mate by force now she longed to do what she could for him for this call was as much a testimony as a shock he loved her he loved her after all the carriage rolled briskly through the long streets into the smoky downtown district it arrived at the auditorium and jennie was escorted to lesters room watson had been considerate he had talked little leaving her to her thoughts in this great hotel she felt diffident after so long a period of complete retirement as she entered the room she looked at lester with large gray sympathetic eyes he was lying propped up on two pillows his solid head with its growth of once dark brown hair slightly grayed he looked at her curiously out of his wise old eyes a light of sympathy and affection shining in them weary as they were jennie was greatly distressed his pale face slightly drawn from suffering cut her like a knife she took his hand which was outside the coverlet and pressed it she leaned over and kissed his lips im so sorry lester she murmured im so sorry youre not very sick though are you you must get well lester and soon she patted his hand gently yes jennie but im pretty bad he said i dont feel right about this business i dont seem able to shake it off but tell me how have you been oh just the same dear she replied im all right you mustnt talk like that though youre going to be all right very soon now he smiled grimly do you think so he shook his head for he thought differently sit down dear he went on im not worrying about that i want to talk to you again i want you near me he sighed and shut his eyes for a minute she drew up a chair close beside the bed her face toward his and took his hand it seemed such a beautiful thing that he should send for her her eyes showed the mingled sympathy affection and gratitude of her heart at the same time fear gripped her how ill he looked i cant tell what may happen he went on letty is in europe ive wanted to see you again for some time i was coming out this trip we are living in new york you know youre a little stouter jennie yes im getting old lester she smiled oh that doesnt make any difference he replied looking at her fixedly age doesnt count we are all in that boat its how we feel about life he stopped and stared at the ceiling a slight twinge of pain reminded him of the vigorous seizures he had been through he couldnt stand many more paroxysms like the last one i couldnt go jennie without seeing you again he observed when the slight twinge ceased and he was free to think again ive always wanted to say to you jennie he went on that i havent been satisfied with the way we parted it wasnt the right thing after all i havent been any happier im sorry i wish now for my own peace of mind that i hadnt done it dont say that lester she demurred going over in her mind all that had been between them this was such a testimony to their real union their real spiritual compatibility its all right it doesnt make any difference youve been very good to me i wouldnt have been satisfied to have you lose your fortune it couldnt be that way ive been a lot better satisfied as it is its been hard but dear everything is hard at times she paused no he said it wasnt right the thing wasnt worked out right from the start but that wasnt your fault im sorry i wanted to tell you that im glad im here to do it dont talk that way lester please dont she pleaded its all right you neednt be sorry theres nothing to be sorry for you have always been so good to me why when i think she stopped for it was hard for her to speak she was choking with affection and sympathy she pressed his hands she was recalling the house he took for her family in cleveland his generous treatment of gerhardt all the long ago tokens of love and kindness well ive told you now and i feel better youre a good woman jennie and youre kind to come to me this way i loved you i love you now i want to tell you that it seems strange but youre the only woman i ever did love truly we should never have parted jennie caught her breath it was the one thing she had waited for all these years this testimony it was the one thing that could make everything right this confession of spiritual if not material union now she could live happily now die so oh lester she exclaimed with a sob and pressed his hand he returned the pressure there was a little silence then he spoke again how are the two orphans he asked oh theyre lovely she answered entering upon a detailed description of their diminutive personalities he listened comfortably for her voice was soothing to him her whole personality was grateful to him when it came time for her to go he seemed desirous of keeping her going jennie i can stay just as well as not lester she volunteered ill take a room i can send a note out to mrs swenson it will be all right you neednt do that he said but she could see that he wanted her that he did not want to be alone from that time on until the hour of his death she was not out of the hotel chapter lxii the end came after four days during which jennie was by his bedside almost constantly the nurse in charge welcomed her at first as a relief and company but the physician was inclined to object lester however was stubborn this is my death he said with a touch of grim humor if im dying i ought to be allowed to die in my own way watson smiled at the mans unfaltering courage he had never seen anything like it before there were cards of sympathy calls of inquiry notices in the newspaper robert saw an item in the inquirer and decided to go to chicago imogene called with her husband and they were admitted to lesters room for a few minutes after jennie had gone to hers lester had little to say the nurse cautioned them that he was not to be talked to much when they were gone lester said to jennie imogene has changed a good deal he made no other comment mrs kane was on the atlantic three days out from new york the afternoon lester died he had been meditating whether anything more could be done for jennie but he could not make up his mind about it certainly it was useless to leave her more money she did not want it he had been wondering where letty was and how near her actual arrival might be when he was seized with a tremendous paroxysm of pain before relief could be administered in the shape of an anesthetic he was dead it developed afterward that it was not the intestinal trouble which killed him but a lesion of a major bloodvessel in the brain jennie who had been strongly wrought up by watching and worrying was beside herself with grief he had been a part of her thought and feeling so long that it seemed now as though a part of herself had died she had loved him as she had fancied she could never love any one and he had always shown that he cared for her at least in some degree she could not feel the emotion that expresses itself in tears only a dull ache a numbness which seemed to make her insensible to pain he looked so strong her lester lying there still in death his expression was unchanged defiant determined albeit peaceful word had come from mrs kane that she would arrive on the wednesday following it was decided to hold the body jennie learned from mr watson that it was to be transferred to cincinnati where the paces had a vault because of the arrival of various members of the family jennie withdrew to her own home she could do nothing more the final ceremonies presented a peculiar commentary on the anomalies of existence it was arranged with mrs kane by wire that the body should be transferred to imogenes residence and the funeral held from there robert who arrived the night lester died berry dodge imogenes husband mr midgely and three other citizens of prominence were selected as pallbearers louise and her husband came from buffalo amy and her husband from cincinnati the house was full to overflowing with citizens who either sincerely wished or felt it expedient to call because of the fact that lester and his family were tentatively catholic a catholic priest was called in and the ritual of that church was carried out it was curious to see him lying in the parlor of this alien residence candles at his head and feet burning sepulchrally a silver cross upon his breast caressed by his waxen fingers he would have smiled if he could have seen himself but the kane family was too conventional too set in its convictions to find anything strange in this the church made no objection of course the family was distinguished what more could be desired on wednesday mrs kane arrived she was greatly distraught for her love like jennies was sincere she left her room that night when all was silent and leaned over the coffin studying by the light of the burning candles lesters beloved features tears trickled down her cheeks for she had been happy with him she caressed his cold cheeks and hands poor dear lester she whispered poor brave soul no one told her that he had sent for jennie the kane family did not know meanwhile in the house on south park avenue sat a woman who was enduring alone the pain the anguish of an irreparable loss through all these years the subtle hope had persisted in spite of every circumstance that somehow life might bring him back to her he had come it is true he really had in death but he had gone again where whither her mother whither gerhardt whither vesta had gone she could not hope to see him again for the papers had informed her of his removal to mrs midgelys residence and of the fact that he was to be taken from chicago to cincinnati for burial the last ceremonies in chicago were to be held in one of the wealthy roman catholic churches of the south side st michaels of which the midgelys were members jennie felt deeply about this she would have liked so much to have had him buried in chicago where she could go to the grave occasionally but this was not to be she was never a master of her fate others invariably controlled she thought of him as being taken from her finally by the removal of the body to cincinnati as though distance made any difference she decided at last to veil herself heavily and attend the funeral at the church the paper had explained that the services would be at two in the afternoon then at four the body would be taken to the depot and transferred to the train the members of the family would accompany it to cincinnati she thought of this as another opportunity she might go to the depot a little before the time for the funeral cortege to arrive at the church there appeared at one of its subsidiary entrances a woman in black heavily veiled who took a seat in an inconspicuous corner she was a little nervous at first for seeing that the church was dark and empty she feared lest she had mistaken the time and place but after ten minutes of painful suspense a bell in the church tower began to toll solemnly shortly thereafter an acolyte in black gown and white surplice appeared and lighted groups of candles on either side of the altar a hushed stirring of feet in the choirloft indicated that the service was to be accompanied by music some loiterers attracted by the bell some idle strangers a few acquaintances and citizens not directly invited appeared and took seats jennie watched all this with wondering eyes never in her life had she been inside a catholic church the gloom the beauty of the windows the whiteness of the altar the golden flames of the candles impressed her she was suffused with a sense of sorrow loss beauty and mystery life in all its vagueness and uncertainty seemed typified by this scene as the bell tolled there came from the sacristy a procession of altarboys the smallest an angelic youth of eleven came first bearing aloft a magnificent silver cross in the hands of each subsequent pair of servitors was held a tall lighted candle the priest in black cloth and lace attended by an acolyte on either hand followed the procession passed out the entrance into the vestibule of the church and was not seen again until the choir began a mournful responsive chant the latin supplication for mercy and peace then at this sound the solemn procession made its reappearance there came the silver cross the candles the darkfaced priest reading dramatically to himself as he walked and the body of lester in a great black coffin with silver handles carried by the pallbearers who kept an even pace jennie stiffened perceptibly her nerves responding as though to a shock from an electric current she did not know any of these men she did not know robert she had never seen mr midgely of the long company of notables who followed two by two she recognized only three whom lester had pointed out to her in times past mrs kane she saw of course for she was directly behind the coffin leaning on the arm of a stranger behind her walked mr watson solemn gracious he gave a quick glance to either side evidently expecting to see her somewhere but not finding her he turned his eyes gravely forward and walked on jennie looked with all her eyes her heart gripped by pain she seemed so much a part of this solemn ritual and yet infinitely removed from it all the procession reached the altar rail and the coffin was put down a white shroud bearing the insignia of suffering a black cross was put over it and the great candles were set beside it there were the chanted invocations and responses the sprinkling of the coffin with holy water the lighting and swinging of the censer and then the mumbled responses of the auditors to the lords prayer and to its catholic addition the invocation to the blessed virgin jennie was overawed and amazed but no show of form colorful impression imperial could take away the sting of death the sense of infinite loss to jennie the candles the incense the holy song were beautiful they touched the deep chord of melancholy in her and made it vibrate through the depths of her being she was as a house filled with mournful melody and the presence of death she cried and cried she could see curiously that mrs kane was sobbing convulsively also when it was all over the carriages were entered and the body was borne to the station all the guests and strangers departed and finally when all was silent she arose now she would go to the depot also for she was hopeful of seeing his body put on the train they would have to bring it out on the platform just as they did in vestas case she took a car and a little later she entered the waitingroom of the depot she lingered about first in the concourse where the great iron fence separated the passengers from the tracks and then in the waitingroom hoping to discover the order of proceedings she finally observed the group of immediate relatives waiting mrs kane robert mrs midgely louise amy imogene and the others she actually succeeded in identifying most of them though it was not knowledge in this case but pure instinct and intuition no one had noticed it in the stress of excitement but it was thanksgiving eve throughout the great railroad station there was a hum of anticipation that curious ebullition of fancy which springs from the thought of pleasures to come people were going away for the holiday carriages were at the station entries announcers were calling in stentorian voices the destination of each new train as the time of its departure drew near jennie heard with a desperate ache the description of a route which she and lester had taken more than once slowly and melodiously emphasized detroit toledo cleveland buffalo and new york there were cries of trains for fort wayne columbus pittsburg philadelphia and points east and then finally for indianapolis louisville columbus cincinnati and points south the hour had struck several times jennie had gone to the concourse between the waitingroom and the tracks to see if through the iron grating which separated her from her beloved she could get one last look at the coffin or the great wooden box which held it before it was put on the train now she saw it coming there was a baggage porter pushing a truck into position near the place where the baggage car would stop on it was lester that last shadow of his substance incased in the honors of wood and cloth and silver there was no thought on the part of the porter of the agony of loss which was represented here he could not see how wealth and position in this hour were typified to her mind as a great fence a wall which divided her eternally from her beloved had it not always been so was not her life a patchwork of conditions made and affected by these things which she saw wealth and force which had found her unfit she had evidently been born to yield not seek this panoply of power had been paraded before her since childhood what could she do now but stare vaguely after it as it marched triumphantly by lester had been of it him it respected of her it knew nothing she looked through the grating and once more there came the cry of indianapolis louisville columbus cincinnati and points south a long red train brilliantly lighted composed of baggage cars day coaches a diningcar set with white linen and silver and a half dozen comfortable pullmans rolled in and stopped a great black engine puffing and glowing had it all safely in tow as the baggage car drew near the waiting truck a trainhand in blue looking out of the car called to some one within hey jack give us a hand here theres a stiff outside jennie could not hear all she could see was the great box that was so soon to disappear all she could feel was that this train would start presently and then it would all be over the gates opened the passengers poured out there were robert and amy and louise and midgely all making for the pullman cars in the rear they had said their farewells to their friends no need to repeat them a trio of assistants gave a hand at getting the great wooden case into the car jennie saw it disappear with an acute physical wrench at her heart there were many trunks to be put aboard and then the door of the baggage car half closed but not before the warning bell of the engine sounded there was the insistent calling of all aboard from this quarter and that then slowly the great locomotive began to move its bell was ringing its steam hissing its smokestack throwing aloft a great black plume of smoke that fell back over the cars like a pall the fireman conscious of the heavy load behind flung open a flaming furnace door to throw in coal its light glowed like a golden eye jennie stood rigid staring into the wonder of this picture her face white her eyes wide her hands unconsciously clasped but one thought in her mind they were taking his body away a leaden november sky was ahead almost dark she looked and looked until the last glimmer of the red lamp on the receding sleeper disappeared in the maze of smoke and haze overhanging the tracks of the farstretching yard yes said the voice of a passing stranger gay with the anticipation of coming pleasures were going to have a great time down there remember annie uncle jim is coming and aunt ella jennie did not hear that or anything else of the chatter and bustle around her before her was stretching a vista of lonely years down which she was steadily gazing now what she was not so old yet there were those two orphan children to raise they would marry and leave after a while and then what days and days in endless reiteration and then the end
