chapter my name is david tennant md im a professor of ethics at the university of virginia medical school and if youre watching this tape im dead i took a breath and gathered myself i didnt want to rant id mounted my sony camcorder on a tripod and rotated the lcd screen in order to see myself as i spoke id lost weight over the past weeks my eyes were red with fatigue the orbits shiny and dark i looked more like a hunted criminal than a grieving friend i dont really know where to begin i keep seeing andrew lying on the floor and i know they killed him but im getting ahead of myself you need facts i was born in in los alamos new mexico my father was james howard tennant the nuclear physicist my mother was ann tennant a pediatrician im making this tape in a sober state of mind and im going to deposit it with my attorney as soon as i finish on the understanding that it should be opened if i die for any reason six hours ago my colleague dr andrew fielding was found dead beside his desk the victim of an apparent stroke i cant prove it but i know fielding was murdered for the past two years he and i have been part of a scientific team funded by the national security agency and darpathe government agency that created the internet in the s under the highest security classification that team and its work are known as project trinity i glanced down at the shortbarreled smith wesson in my lap id made sure the pistol wasnt visible on camera but it calmed me to have it within reach reassured i again stared at the glowing red light two years ago peter godin founder of the godin supercomputing corporation had an epiphany much like that mythical moment when an apple dropped onto isaac newtons head it happened in a dream seemingly from nowhere a seventyyearold man visualized the most revolutionary possibility in the history of science when he woke up godin telephoned john skow a deputy director of the nsa in fort meade maryland by six am the two men had drafted and delivered a letter to the president of the united states that letter shook the white house to its foundations i know this because the president was my brothers close friend in college my brother died three years ago but because of him the president knew of my work which is what put me in the middle of all that followed i rubbed the cool metal of the wondering what to tell and what to leave out leave out nothing said a voice in my head my fathers voice fifty years ago hed played his own part in americas secret history and that burden had greatly shortened his days my father died in a haunted man certain that the cold war hed spent his youthful energy to perpetuate would end with the destruction of civilization as it so easily could have leave out nothing the godin memo i continued had the same effect as the letter albert einstein sent president roosevelt at the beginning of world war two outlining the potential for an atomic bomb and the possibility that nazi germany might develop one einsteins letter spurred the manhattan project the secret quest to ensure that america would be the first to possess nuclear weapons peter godins letter resulted in a project of similar scope but infinitely greater ambition project trinity began behind the walls of an nsa front corporation in the research triangle park of north carolina only six people on the planet ever had full knowledge of trinity now that andrew fielding is dead only five remain im one the other four are peter godin john skow ravi nara i bolted to my feet with the in my hand someone was rapping on my front door through thin curtains i saw a federal express truck parked at the foot of my sidewalk what i couldnt see was the space immediately in front of my door who is it i called fedex barked a muffled male voice i need a signature i wasnt expecting a delivery is it a letter or a package letter who from uhh lewis carroll i shivered a package from a dead man only one person would send me a package under the name of the author of alice in wonderland andrew fielding had he sent me something the day before he died fielding had been obsessively searching the trinity labs for weeks now the computers as well as the physical space perhaps hed found something and perhaps whatever it was had got him killed id sensed something strange about fieldings behavior yesterdaynot so easy with a man famed for his eccentricitiesbut by this morning hed seemed to be his old self do you want this thing or not asked the deliveryman i cocked the pistol and edged over to the door id fastened the chain latch when id got home with my left hand i unlocked the door and pulled it open to the length of the chain through the crack i saw the face of a uniformed man in his twenties his hair bound into a short ponytail pass your pad through with the package ill sign and give it back to you its a digital pad i cant give you that keep your hand on it then paranoid he muttered but he stuck a thick orange pad through the crack in the door i grabbed the stylus hanging from the string and scrawled my name on the touchsensitive screen okay the pad disappeared and a fedex envelope was thrust through i took it and tossed it onto the sofa then shut the door and waited until i heard the truck rumble away from the curb i picked up the envelope and glanced at the label lewis carroll had been signed in fieldings spidery hand as i pulled the sheet of paper from the envelope a greasy white granular substance spilled over my fingers the instant my eyes registered the color some part of my brain whispered anthrax the odds of that were low but my best friend had just died under suspicious circumstances a certain amount of paranoia was justified i hurried to the kitchen and scrubbed my hands with dish soap and water then i pulled a black medical bag from my closet inside was the usual pharmacopoeia of the mds home analgesics antibiotics emetics steroid cream i found what i wanted in a snap compartment a blister pack of cipro a powerful broadspectrum antibiotic i swallowed one pill with water from the tap then took a pair of surgical gloves from the bag as a last precaution i tied a dirty tshirt from the hamper around my nose and mouth then i folded the fedex envelope and letter into separate ziploc bags sealed them and laid them on the counter as badly as i wanted to read the letter part of me resisted fielding might have been murdered for what was written on that page even if that werent the case nothing good would come from my reading it i carefully vacuumed the white granules from the carpet in the front room wondering if i could be wrong about fieldings death being murder he and i had worked ourselves into quite a state of suspicion over the past weeks but then we had reason to and the timing was too damn convenient instead of putting the vacuum cleaner back into the closet i walked to the back door and tossed the machine far into the yard i could always buy another one i was still eerily aware of the letter sitting on the kitchen counter i felt like a soldiers wife refusing to open a telegram but i already knew my friend was dead so what did i fear the why answered a voice in my head fielding talking you want to keep your head in the sand its the american national pastime more than a little irritated to find that the dead could he as bothersome as the living i picked up the ziploc containing the letter and carried it to the front room the note was brief and handwritten david we must meet again i finally confronted godin with my suspicions his reaction astounded me i dont want to commit anything to paper but i know im right lu li and i are driving to the blue place on saturday night please join us its close quarters but discreet it may be time for you to contact your late brothers friend again though i wonder if even he can do anything at this point things like this have a momentum greater than individuals greater even than humanity i fear if anything should happen to me dont forget that little gold item i asked you to hold for me one day desperate times mate ill see you saturday there was no signature but below the note was a handdrawn cartoon of a rabbits head and the face of a clock the white rabbit an affectionate nickname given fielding by his cambridge physics students fielding always carried a gold pocket watch and that was the little gold item that he had asked me to hold for him one day we were passing each other in the hallway when he pressed the watch and chain into my hand mind keeping that for an hour old man hed murmured lovely then he was gone an hour later he stopped by my office to pick it up saying he hadnt wanted to take the watch into the mri lab with him where it could have been smashed against the mri unit by the machines enormous magnetic fields but fielding visited the mri lab all the time and hed never given me his pocket watch before and he never did again it must have been in his pocket when he died so what the hell was he up to that day i read the note again lu li and i are driving to the blue place on saturday night lu li was fieldings new chinese wife the blue place had to be code for a beach cabin at nags head on north carolinas outer banks three months ago when fielding asked for a recommendation for his honeymoon id suggested the nags head cabin which was only a few hours away fielding and his wife had loved the place and the englishman had apparently thought of it when he wanted a secure location to discuss his fears my hands were shaking the man who had written this note was now as cold as the morgue table he was living on if indeed he was lying in a morgue no one had been ableor willingto tell me where my friends body would be taken and now the white powder would fielding have put powder in the envelope and neglected to mention it in his letter if he didnt who did who but the person who had murdered him i laid the letter on the sofa stripped off the surgical gloves and rewound the videotape to the point at which id walked out of the frame i had decided to make this tape because i feared i might be killed before i could tell the president what i knew fieldings letter had changed nothing yet as i stared into the lens my mind wandered i was way ahead of fielding on calling my late brothers friend the moment id seen fieldings corpse on the floor of his office i knew i had to call the president but the president was in china still as soon as i got clear of the trinity lab id called the white house from a pay phone in a shoneys restaurant a safe phone fielding had told me about it couldnt be seen by surveillance teams in cars and the restaurants interior geometry made it difficult for a parabolic microphone to eavesdrop from a distance when i said project trinity the white house operator put me through to a man who gruffly asked me to state my business i asked to speak to ewan mccaskell the presidents chief of staff whom id met during my visit to the oval office mccaskell was in china with the president i asked that the president be informed that david tennant needed to speak to him urgently about project trinity and that no one else involved with trinity should be informed the man said my message would be passed on and hung up thirteen hours separated north carolina and beijing that made it tomorrow in china daylight yet four hours had passed since my call and id heard nothing would my message be relayed to china given the critical nature of the summit there was no way to know i did know that if someone at trinity heard about my call first i might wind up as dead as fielding before i talked to the president i hit start on the remote control and spoke again to the camera in the past six months ive gone from feeling like part of a noble scientific effort to questioning whether im even living in the united states ive watched nobel laureates give up all principles in a search for i went still something had passed by one of my front windows a face very close peering inside id seen it through the sheer curtains but i was sure a face framed by shoulderlength hair i had a sense of a womans features but i started to get up then sat back down my teeth were vibrating with an electric pain like aluminum foil crushed between dental fillings my eyelids felt too heavy to hold open not now i thought shoving my hand into my pocket for my prescription bottle jesus not now for six months every member of trinitys inner circle had suffered frightening neurological symptoms no ones symptoms were the same my affliction was narcolepsy narcolepsy and dreams at home i usually gave in to the trancelike sleep but when i needed to fight off a spellat trinity or driving my caronly amphetamines could stop the overwhelming waves i pulled out my prescription bottle and shook it empty id swallowed my last pill yesterday i got my speed from ravi nara trinitys neurologist but nara and i were no longer speaking i tried to rise thinking id call a pharmacy and prescribe my own but that was ridiculous i couldnt even stand a leaden heaviness had settled into my limbs my face felt hot and my eyelids began to fall the prowler was at the window again in my mind i raised my gun and aimed it but then i saw the weapon lying in my lap not even survival instinct could clear the fog filling my brain i looked back at the window the face was gone a womans face i was sure of it would they use a woman to kill me of course they were pragmatists they used what worked something scratched at my doorknob through the thickening haze i fought to aim my gun at the door something slammed against the wood i got my finger on the trigger but as my swimming brain transmitted the instruction to depress it sleep annihilated consciousness like fingers snuffing a candle flame andrew fielding sat alone at his desk furiously smoking a cigarette his hands were shaking from a confrontation with godin it had happened the previous day but fielding had the habit of replaying such scenes in his mind agonizing over how ineffectually he had stated his case murmuring retorts he should have made at the time but had not the argument had been the result of weeks of frustration fielding didnt like arguments not ones outside the realm of physics anyway hed put off the meeting until the last possible moment he pottered around his office pondering one of the central riddles of quantum physics how two particles fired simultaneously from the same source could arrive at the same destination at the same instant even though one had to travel ten times as far as the other it was like two s flying from new york to los angelesone flying direct and the other having to fly south to miami before turning west to los angeles yet both touching down at lax at the same moment the on the direct route flew at the speed of light yet the plane that had to detour over miami still reached la at the same instant which meant that the second plane had flown faster than the speed of light which meant that einsteins theory of special relativity was flawed possibly fielding spent a great deal of time thinking about this problem he lit another cigarette and thought about the letter hed fedexed to david tennant it didnt say enough not nearly but it would have to do until they met at nags head tennant would be working a few steps up the hall from him all afternoon but he might as well be in fiji no square foot of the trinity complex was free of surveillance and recording devices tennant would get the letter this afternoon if no one intercepted it to prevent this fielding had instructed his wife to drop it at a fedex box inside the durham post office beyond the sight line of anyone following her from a distance that was all the spouses usually gotrandom surveillance from carsbut you never knew tennant was fieldings only hope tennant knew the president hed had cocktails in the white house anyway fielding had won the nobel in but hed never been invited to downing street never would be in all likelihood hed shaken hands with the pm at a reception once but that wasnt the same thing not at all he took a drag on the cigarette and looked down at his desk an equation lay there a collapsing wave function unsolvable using presentday mathematics not even the worlds most powerful supercomputers could solve a collapsing wave function there was one machine on the planet that might make headway with the problemat least he believed there wasand if he was right the term supercomputer might soon become as quaint and archaic as abacus but the machine that could solve a collapsing wave function would be capable of a lot more than computing it would be everything peter godin had promised the mandarins in washington and more that more was what scared fielding scared the bloody hell out of him for no one could predict the unintended consequences of bringing such a thing into existence trinity indeed he was thinking of going home early when something flashed in his left eye there was no pain then the visual field in that eye swirled into a blur and an explosion seemed to detonate in the left frontal lobe of his brain a stroke he thought with clinical detachment im having a stroke strangely calm he reached for the telephone to call then remembered that the worlds preeminent neurologist was working in the office four doors down from his own the telephone would be faster than walking he reached for the receiver but the event taking place within his cranium suddenly bloomed to its full destructive power the clot lodged or the blood vessel burst and his left eye went black then a knifelike pain pierced the base of his brain the center of life support functions falling toward the floor fielding thought again of that elusive particle that had traveled faster than the speed of light that had proved einstein wrong by traversing space as though it did not exist he posed a thought experiment if andrew fielding could move as fast as that particle could he reach ravi kara in time to be saved answer no nothing could save him now his last coherent thought was a prayer a silent hope that in the unmapped world of the quantum consciousness existed beyond what humans called death for fielding religion was an illusion but at the dawn of the twentyfirst century project trinity had uncovered hope of a new immortality and it wasnt the rube goldberg monstrosity they were pretending to build a hundred meters from his office door the impact of the floor was like water i jerked awake and grabbed my gun someone was banging the front door taut against the security chain i tried to get to my feet but the dream had disoriented me its lucidity far surpassed anything id experienced to date i actually felt that i had died that i was andrew fielding at the moment of his death dr tennant shouted a womans voice david are you in there my psychiatrist i put my hand to my forehead and tried to fight my way back to reality dr weiss rachel is that you yes unlatch the chain im coming i muttered are you alone yes open the door i stuffed my gun between the couch cushions and stumbled toward the door as i reached for the chain latch it struck me that i had never told my psychiatrist where i lived chapter rachel weiss had jetblack hair olive skin and onyx eyes eleven weeks ago when id arrived at her office for my first session id thought of rebecca from sir walter scotts ivanhoe only in the novel rebecca had a wild unrestrained sort of beauty rachel weiss projected a focused severity that made her physical appearance and clothing irrelevant as though she went out of her way to hide attributes that would cause people to see her as anything other than the remarkable clinician she was what was that she asked pointing to the sofa cushion where id stashed the gun are you selfprescribing again no how did you find my house i know a woman in personnel at uva you missed two consecutive sessions but at least you called ahead to cancel today you leave me sitting there and you dont even call considering your state of mind lately what do you expect me to do rachels eyes went to the video camera oh david youre not back to this again i thought you stopped years ago its not what you think she didnt look convinced five years ago a drunk driver flipped my wifes car into a roadside pond the water wasnt deep but both karen and my daughter zooey drowned before help arrived i was working at the hospital they were brought to after the accident watching the er staff try in vain to resuscitate my fouryearold daughter shattered me i spent hours at home in front of the television endlessly replaying videotapes of zooey learning to walk laughing in karens arms hugging me at her third birthday party my medical practice withered then died and i sank into clinical depression this was the only fact of my personal life i had discussed in detail with my psychiatrist and this only because after three sessions she had told me that shed lost her only child to leukemia one year before she confided this because she believed my disturbing dreams were caused by the tragic loss of my family and she wanted me to know she had felt the same kind of pain rachel too had lost more than her child unable to handle the devastating effects of his sons illness her lawyer husband had left her and returned to new york like me rachel had descended into a pit of depression from which she was lucky to emerge therapy and medication had been her salvation but like my father ive always been fiercely private and i fought my way back to the land of the living alone not a day went by that i didnt miss my wife and daughter but my days of weeping as i replayed old videotapes were over this isnt about karen and zooey i told rachel please close the door she remained in the open doorway car keys in hand clearly wanting to believe me but just as clearly skeptical what is it then work please close the door rachel hesitated then shut the door and stared into my eyes maybe its time you told me about your work this had long been a point of contention between us rachel considered doctor patient confidentiality as sacred as the confessional and my lack of trust offended her she believed my demands for secrecy and warnings of danger hinted at a delusional reality i had constructed to protect my psyche from scrutiny i didnt blame her at the request of the nsa id made my first appointment with her under a false name but ten seconds after we shook hands she recognized my face from the jacket photo of my book she assumed my ruse was the paranoia of a medical celebrity and i did nothing to disabuse her of that notion but after a few weeks my refusal to divulge anything about my workand my obsession with protecting herhad pushed her to suspect that i might be schizophrenic what rachel didnt know was that i had only been allowed to see her after winning a brutal argument with john skow the director of project trinity my narcolepsy had developed as a result of my work at trinity and i wanted professional help to try to understand the accompanying dreams first the nsa flew in a shrink from fort meade a pharmacological psychiatrist whose main patient base was technicians trying to cope with chronic stress or depression he wanted to fill me up with happy pills and find out how to become an internationally published physician like me next they brought in a woman an expert in dealing with the neuroses that develop when people are forced to work for long periods in secrecy her knowledge of dream symbolism was limited to a little historical reading during her residency like her colleague she wanted to start me on a regimen of antidepressants and antipsychotics what i needed was a psychoanalyst experienced in dream analysis and the nsa didnt have one i called some friends at the uva medical school and discovered that rachel weiss the countrys preeminent jungian analyst was based at the duke university medical school less than fifteen miles from the trinity building skow tried to stop me from seeing her but in the end i told him hed have to arrest me to do it and before he tried that hed better call the president who had appointed me to the project somethings happened rachel said what is it have the hallucinations changed again hallucinations i thought bitterly never dreams have they intensified become more personal are you afraid andrew fielding is dead i said in a flat voice rachel blinked whos andrew fielding he was a physicist her eyes widened andrew fielding the physicist is dead it was a measure of fieldings reputation that a medical doctor who knew little about quantum physics would know his name but it didnt surprise me there are sixyearolds whod heard of the white rabbit the man who had largely unraveled the enigma of the dark matter in the universe stood second only to his friend stephen hawking in the astrophysical firmament he died of a stroke i said or so they say so who says people at work you work with andrew fielding i did for the past two years rachel shook her head in amazement you dont think he died of a stroke no did you examine him a cursory exam he collapsed in his office another doctor got to him before he died that doctor said fielding exhibited leftside paralysis and had a blown left pupil but what i dont believe him fielding died too quickly for a stroke within four or five minutes rachel pursed her lips that happens sometimes especially with a severe hemorrhage yes but its comparatively rare and you dont usually see a blown pupil that was true enough but it wasnt what i was thinking i was thinking that rachel was a psychiatrist and as good as she was she hadnt spent sixteen years practicing internal medicine as i had you got a feeling about certain cases certain people a sixth sense fielding had not been my patient but hed told me a lot about his health in two years and a massive hemorrhage didnt feel right to me look i dont know where his body is and i dont think theres going to be an autopsy so why no autopsy rachel broke in because i think he was murdered i thought you said he died in his office he did you think he was murdered at work workplace violence she still didnt get it i mean premeditated murder carefully thought out expertly executed murder but why would someone murder andrew fielding he was an old man wasnt he he was sixtythree recalling fieldings body on the office floor mouth agape sightless eyes staring at the ceiling i felt a sudden compulsion to tell rachel everything but one glance at the window killed the urge a parabolic microphone could be trained on the glass i cant say anything beyond that im sorry you should go rachel she took two steps toward me her face set with purpose im not going anywhere yet look if anyone died while not under a doctors supervision in this state there has to be an autopsy and especially in cases of possible foul play its required by law i laughed at her naivetй there wont be an autopsy not a public one anyway david i really cant say more i shouldnt have said that much i just wanted you to know that its real why cant you say more she held up a small graceful hand no let me answer that because to tell me more would put me in danger right yes she rolled her eyes david from the beginning youve made extraordinary demands about secrecy and ive complied ive told colleagues that the hours you spend in my office are research for your second book rather than what they really are and you know i appreciate that but if im right about fielding anything i tell you now could put your life at risk cant you understand that no ive never understood what sort of work could possibly be so dangerous i shook my head this is like a bad joke she laughed strangely i could tell you but then id have to kill you its classic paranoid thinking do you really believe im making all this up rachel answered with caution i believe that you believe everything youve told me so im still delusional youve got to admit youve been having disturbing hallucinations for some time now some of the recent ones are classic religious delusions but most not i reminded her and im an atheist is that classic no i concede that but youve also refused to get a workup for your narcolepsy or epilepsy or even to get your blood sugar checked for that matter ive been worked up by the foremost neurologist in the world thats being investigated at work by andrew fielding he wasnt an md was he i decided to go one step further im being treated by ravi nara her mouth fell open ravi nara as in the nobel prize for medicine thats him i said with distaste you work with ravi nara yes hes a prick it was nara who said fielding died of a stroke rachel appeared at a loss david i just dont know what to say are you really working with these famous people is that so hard to believe im reasonably famous myself yes but not in the same way what reason would those men have to work together theyre in totally different fields until two years ago they were what does that mean go back to your office rachel i canceled my last patient so i could come here bill me for your lost time she reddened theres no need to insult me please tell me whats going on im tired of hearing nothing but your hallucinations dreams whatever theyre not enough to work with not for your purpose but you and i have different goals we always have youre trying to solve the riddle of david tennant im trying to solve the riddle of my dreams but the answers are bound up in who you are dreams arent independent of the rest of your brain you the ringing telephone cut her off i got up and went into the kitchen to answer it a strange thrumming in my chest the caller could be the president of the united states dr tennant i said from years of habit dr david cried a hysterical female voice with an asian accent it was lu li fieldings chinese wife or widow this is david lu li im sorry i havent called you i searched for fitting words but found only a clichй i cant begin to express the pain i feel at andrews loss a burst of cantonese punctuated with some english flashed down the wire i didnt have to understand it all to know i was hearing a distraught widow on the verge of collapse god only knew what the trinity security people had told lu li or what she had made of it shed come to america only three months ago her immigration fasttracked by the state department which had received a nonetoosubtle motivational call from the white house i know this has been a terrible day i said in a comforting voice but i need you to try to calm down lu li was panting breathe deeply i said trying to decide what approach to take safest to use the corporate cover the nsa had insisted on from the beginning as far as the rest of the research triangle park companies knew the argus optical corporation developed optical computer elements used in government defense projects lu li might know no more than this what have you been told by the company i asked cautiously andy dead lu li cried they say he die of brain bleeding but i know nothing i dont know what to do i saw nothing to be gained by further agitating fieldings widow with theories of murder lu li andrew was sixtythree years old and not in the best of health a stroke isnt an unlikely event in that situation you no understand dr david andy warn me about this my hand tightened on the phone what do you mean another burst of cantonese came down the wire but then lu li settled into halting english andy tell me this could happen he say if something happen to me call dr david david know what to do a deep ache gripped my heart that fielding had put such faith in me what do you want me to do come here please talk to me tell me why this happen to andy i hesitated the nsa was probably listening to this call to go to lu lis house would only put her at greater risk and myself too but what choice did i have i couldnt fail my friend ill be there in twenty minutes thank you thank you david please thank you i hung up and turned to go back to the living room rachel was standing in the kitchen doorway i have to leave i told her i appreciate you coming to check on me i know it was beyond the call of duty im going with you i heard some of that and im going with you out of the question why you have no reason to come youre not part of this she folded her arms across her chest for me its simple okay if youre telling the truth ill find the distraught widow of andrew fielding at the end of a short drive and shell support what youve told me not necessarily i dont know how much fielding confided in her and lu li hardly speaks english andrew fielding didnt teach his own wife english he spoke fluent cantonese plus about eight other languages and shes only been here a few months rachel straightened her skirt with the flats of her hands your resistance tells me that you know my going will expose your story as a delusion anger flashed through me im tempted to let you come just for that but you dont grasp the danger you could die tonight i dont think so i picked up the ziploc bag containing the white powder and the fedex envelope and held it out to her a few minutes ago i received a letter from fielding this powder was in the envelope she shrugged it looks like sand what is it i have no idea but im afraid it might be anthrax or whatever killed fielding she took the package from me i thought at first she was examining the powder but she was reading the label on the fedex envelope this says the sender is lewis carroll thats code fielding couldnt risk putting his name into the fedex computer system the nsa would pick that up immediately he used lewis carroll because his nickname was the white rabbit youve heard that right rachel looked as if she were really thinking about it i cant say that i have wheres this letter i motioned toward the front room in a plastic bag on the couch dont open it she bent over the note and quickly read it its not signed of course not fielding didnt know who might see it that rabbit symbol is his signature she looked at me with disbelief just take me along david if what i see supports what youve told me ill take all your warnings seriously from this point forward no more doubts thats like throwing you into the water to prove there are sharks in it by the time you see them its too late thats always how it is with these kinds of fantasies i went and got my keys off the kitchen counter rachel followed at my heels all right you want to come follow me in your car she shook her head not a chance youd lose me at the first red light your colleagues would tell you its dangerous to accompany a patient while he chases a paranoid fantasy especially a narcoleptic patient my colleagues dont know you as for the narcolepsy you havent killed yourself yet i reached under the sofa cushion brought out my pistol and thrust it into my waistband you dont know me either she studied the butt of the gun then looked into my eyes i think i do and i want to help you if she were only my psychiatrist i would have left her there but during our long sessions we had recognized something in each other an unspoken feeling shared by two people who had experienced great loss even though she thought i might be ill now she cared about me in a way no one else had for a long time to take her with me would be selfish but the simple truth was i didnt want to go alone chapter geli bauer sat within the dark bowels of the trinity building a basement complex lit only by the glow of computer monitors and surveillance screens from here electronic filaments spread out to monitor the people and the physical plant of project trinity but that was only the center of her domain with the touch of a computer key geli could interface with the nsa supercomputers at fort meade and monitor conversations and events on the other side of the globe though she had wielded many kinds of power during her thirtytwo years on earth she had never before felt the rush of knowing that all the world bounded by electronics could be manipulated by the touch of her finger on paper geli worked for godin supercomputing which was based in mountain view california but it was her companys quasigovernmental relationship with the nsa that had lifted her into the stratosphere of power if she deemed a situation an emergency she could stop trains close international airports retask surveillance satellites or lift armed helicopters into the skies over us soil and order them to fire no other modern woman had wielded such powerin some ways her authority rivaled that of her fatherand geli did not intend to give it up on the flatpanel monitor before her glowed a transcript of the conversation between david tennant and an unknown white house functionary recorded at a shoneys restaurant that afternoon but geli was no longer looking at it she was speaking on the headset phone to a member of her security team the man who was watching tennants residence i only heard conversation in the kitchen she said that makes no sense he and dr weiss had to be talking elsewhere maybe they were getting it on wed have heard it weiss looks like a screamer to me its always the quiet ones what do you want me to do get in there and check the mikes geli tapped a key on the pad before her which connected her to a young exdelta operator named thomas corelli who was covering andrew fieldings house what are you hearing thomas normal background noise tv bumps and clatters did you hear mrs fieldings end of the phone call yeah but its hard to understand that chinese accent are you out of sight im parked in the driveway of some outoftown neighbors tennant will be at your location in five minutes he has a woman with him dr rachel weiss stay on this line geli clicked off then said clearly jpeg weiss rachel a digital photograph of rachel weiss appeared on her monitor it was a head shot a telephoto taken as the psychiatrist left the duke university hospital rachel weiss was three years older than geli but geli recognized the type shed known girls like that at boarding school in switzerland strivers most of them jews she would have known weiss was jewish without hearing her name or seeing her file even with fashionably windblown hair rachel weiss looked like she carried the weight of the world on her shoulders she had the dark martyrs eyes the premature lines around the mouth she was one of the top jungian analysts in the world and you didnt reach that level without being obsessive about your work geli had been against involving weiss it was skow who had allowed it skows theory was that if you held the leash too tight you were asking for trouble but it was gelis head that would roll if there was a security breach to prevent that eventuality she received transcripts of weisss sessions with tennant and recordings of every telephone call the psychiatrist made once a week one of her operatives slipped into weisss office and photocopied tennants file to be sure that nothing escaped gelis scrutiny that was the kind of hassle that came from dealing with civilians it had been the same at los alamos with the manhattan project in both cases the government had tried to control a group of gifted civilian scientists who through ignorance obstinacy or ideology posed the greatest threat to their own work when you recruited the smartest people in the world you got crackpots tennant was a crackpot like fielding like ravi nara the projects nobel prizewinning neuroscientist all six trinity principals had signed the tightest possible security and nondisclosure agreements but they still believed they could do anything they wanted to them the world was disneyland and doctors were the worst even in the army the rules had never quite seemed to apply to mds but tonight tennant was going to step far enough over the line to get his head chopped off her headset beeped she opened the line to her man at tennants house what is it im inside youre not going to believe this someone put painters putty in the holes over the mikes geli felt a strange numbness in her chest how could tennant know where they were no way without a scanner magnifying glass if he knew to look for them but that would take hours and youd never be sure you got them all a scanner where the hell would an internist get that then she knew fielding tennant took that fedex delivery do you see an envelope anywhere no he must have taken it with him what else do you see anything strange theres a video camera set up on a tripod shit tape in it let me check no tape what else a vacuum cleaner in the backyard what the hell a vacuum cleaner take the bag out and bring it here well chopper it to fort meade for analysis what else nothing take one last look then get out geli clicked off then said skowhome the computer dialed the raleigh residence of project trinitys administrative director geli skow said whats going on bauer always thought kennedy when she heard john skows voice skow was a boston brahmin with twice the usual brains of his breed instead of the customary liberal arts and law background of his class skow had advanced degrees in astronomy and mathematics and had served for eight years as deputy director of special projects for the nsa his primary area of responsibility was the agencys top secret supercomputer research center skow was technically gelis superior but their relationship had always been uncomfortable short of taking a human life geli had independent responsibility for project trinitys security she held this power because peter godinciting security leaks at government labs had demanded that he pick his own team to protect trinity the old man had found her just as she was leaving the army geli believed heart and soul in the warrior culture but she could no longer endure the bloated and hidebound bureaucracy of the army or its abysmal quality standards for new recruits when godin appeared hed offered her a job she had wanted all her life but hadnt believed existed she would receive a year to work as chief of security for special projects for godin supercomputing the salary was immense but godin was a billionaire he could afford it her conditions of employment were unique she would follow any order he gave without question and without regard for legality she would not reveal any information about her employer his company or her employment if she did she would die geli could hire her own staff but they would accept the same conditions and penalty and she would enforce that penalty she was amazed that a public figure like godin would dare to set such terms then she learned that godin had found her through her father that explained a lot geli had hardly spoken to her father in years but he was in a position to know a lot about her and she could tell by the way godin looked at her that he knew something about her as well probably the stories that had filtered out of iraq after desert storm peter godin wanted a security expert but he also wanted a killer geli was both john skow was not unlike godin who had fought as a marine in korea as a young man skow was a theoretical warrior the nsa man had never seen blood on his hands and around geli he sometimes acted like a man whod been handed a leash with a pit bull on the end of it geli skow said again are you there dr weiss went to tennants house she said into her headset why i dont know we got almost none of their conversation theyre on their way to the fielding house now lu li fielding called him upset skow was silent for a moment going over to comfort the grieving widow im sure that will be their story she wanted to gauge skows level of anxiety before giving him more details do we let them go in of course you can hear everything they say right maybe not there was a problem with the bugs at tennants house what kind of problem tennant put putty over the mikes and there was a video camera set up on a tripod in there no tape in it she let that sink in either he wanted to say something on tape that he didnt want us to hear or he wanted to talk to dr weiss without us hearing either way its bad she listened to skow breathe for a while its all right he said finally were going to be okay on this you must know something i dont sir skow chuckled at the contempt with which she said sir the nsa man was tough in his own way he had the detached coldness of mathematical intelligence the perks of leadership geli you did well this morning by the way i was amazed geli flashed back to fieldings corpse the termination had gone smoothly enough but it was a stupid move they should have taken out tennant as well she could easily have manipulated both men into the same vehicle and after that simple logistics a car accident and the project wouldnt be in the jeopardy it was in now has tennant actually talked to the president sir i dont know so keep your distance monitor the situation but nothing more he also took a delivery from fedex a letter whatever it was he took it with him we need to see that if you can get a look at it without him knowing fine otherwise talk to fedex and find out who sent it were doing that good just dont geli heard skows wife calling his name just keep me informed he said and rang off geli closed her eyes and began to breathe deeply she had made the case to godin for taking out tennant along with fielding but the old man had resisted yes godin conceded tennant had broken regulations and spent time with fielding outside the facility yes tennant had supported fieldings effort to suspend the project and it was tennants tie to the president that had made that suspension a reality but there was no proof that tennant was part of the englishmans campaign to sabotage the project or that he was privy to any of the dangerous information fielding possessed since geli did not know what that information was she could not judge the risk of letting tennant live she had reminded godin of the maxim better safe than sorry but godin did not relent he would though soon geli said jpeg fielding lu li an image of a darkhaired asian woman appeared on her monitor born lu li cheng reared in canton province communist china forty years old advanced degrees in applied physics another mistake geli muttered lu li cheng had no business inside the borders of the united states much less in the inner circle of the most sensitive scientific project in the country geli touched the key that connected her to thomas corelli in the surveillance car outside the fielding house you see anything strange over there no how easily could you search tennants car when he arrives depends on where he parks if you see a fedex envelope in the car break in read it then put it back and i want video of their arrival no problem what are you looking for im not sure just get it geli removed a pack of gauloises from her desk took out a cigarette and broke off its filter in the flare of the match she caught her reflection in her computer monitor a veil of blonde hair high cheekbones steelblue eyes nasty burn scar she considered the ugly ridged tissue on her left cheek as much a part of her face as her eyes or mouth a plastic surgeon had once offered to remove the discolored mark at no cost but shed turned him down scars had a purpose to remind their bearer of wounds the wound that had caused that scar she would never let herself forget she punched a key and routed the signals from the microphones in the fielding house to her headset then she drew deeply on her cigarette settled back in her chair and blew a stream of harsh smoke toward the ceiling geli bauer hated many things but most of all she hated waiting chapter we drove in silence the acura moving swiftly through the dusk at this time of evening it was a quick ride from my suburb to andrew fieldings house near the university of north carolina at chapel hill rachel didnt understand my demand for silence and i didnt expect her to when i first became involved in trinity the xenophobic level of security had stunned me the other scientistsfielding included had worked on defenserelated projects before and accepted the intrusive security as a necessary inconvenience but eventually even the veterans complained that we were enduring something unprecedented surveillance was allpervasive and reached far beyond the lab complex protests were met with a curt reminder that the scientists on the manhattan project had been forced to live behind barbed wire to ensure the security of the device the freedom we enjoyed came with a priceor so went the party line fielding didnt buy it random polygraph tests occurred almost weekly and surveillance extended even to our homes before i could begin my video today id had to plug pinholes in my walls that concealed tiny microphones fielding discovered them with a special scanner hed built at home and marked the bugs with tiny pins he had made something of a hobby out of evading trinity surveillance he warned me that speaking confidentially in cars was impossible automobiles were simple to bug and even clean vehicles could be covered from a distance using special hightech microphones the englishmans catandmouse game with the nsa had amused me at times but there was no doubt about who had got the last laugh i looked over at rachel it felt strange to be in a car with her in the five years since my wifes death id had relationships with two women both before my assignment to trinity my time with rachel wasnt a relationship in the romantic sense two hours per week for the past three months i had sat in a room with her and discussed the most disturbing aspect of my lifemy dreams through her questions and interpretations she had probably revealed more about herself than she had learned about me yet much remained hidden shed come down from new york presbyterian to accept the faculty position at duke where she taught a small cadre of psychiatry residents jungian analysis a dying art in the world of modern pharmacological psychiatry she also saw private patients and carried out psychiatric research after two years of virtual solitude working on trinity i would have found contact with any intelligent woman provocative but rachel had far more than intelligence to offer sitting in her leather chair dressed impeccably her dark hair pulled up in a french braid she would watch me with unblinking concentration as though peering into depths of my mind that even i had not plumbed sometimes her faceand particularly her eyesbecame the whole room for me they were the environment i occupied the audience i confided in the judgment i awaited but those eyes were slow to judge at least in the beginning she would question me about certain images then question the answers i gave she sometimes offered interpretations of my dreams but unlike the nsa psychiatrists i had seen she never spoke with a tone of infallibility she seemed to be searching for meaning along with me prodding me to interpret the images myself david you dont have to drive around all night she said im not going to hold this against you right i thought whats wrong with delusions of a secret government conspiracy be patient i told her its not much farther she looked at me in the semidark her eyes skeptical whats the monetary award for a nobel prize about a million us fielding got a little less than ravi nara because i trailed off realizing that she was only probing again trying to puncture my delusion i focused on the road knowing that in a few minutes she would have to admit that my paranoia was at least partially grounded in fact what would she think then would she open her mind to my interpretation of my dreams however irrational it might sound from our first session rachel had argued that she could not make valid interpretations of my hallucination without knowing intimate details of my past and my work but i couldnt tell much fielding had warned me that the nsa would consider anyone who knew anything about trinity or its principals to be a potential threat beyond this concern i felt that what i saw during my narcoleptic episodes had nothing to do with my past the images seemed to be coming from outside my mind not in the sense of hearing alien voices which was a marker for schizophrenia but in the classical sense of visions revealed visions like those described by prophets for a man who had not believed in god since he was a boy it was a singularly disturbing state of affairs my dreams had not begun with the first narcoleptic attacks the first episodes were true blackouts holes in my life gaps of time lost forever i would be working at my office computer then suddenly become aware of a highpitched vibration in my body generalized at first it would quickly localize to my teeth this was a classic onset symptom of narcolepsy id begin to feel drowsy then suddenly jerk awake in my chair and find that forty minutes had passed it was like going under anesthesia no memory at all the dreams began after a week of blackouts the first one was always the same a recurring nightmare that frightened me more than the blackouts had i remember how intrigued rachel was when i first recounted it and how uncharacteristically sure she was that she understood the image i sat in the deeply padded chair opposite her desk closed my eyes and described what i had seen so often im sitting in a dark room theres no light at all no sound i can feel my eyes with my fingers my ears too but i see and hear nothing i remember nothing i have no past and because i see and hear nothing i have no present i simply am thats my reality i am i feel like a stroke victim imprisoned within a body and brain that no longer function i can think but not of any specific images i feel more than i think and what i feel is this who am i where did i come from why am i alone was i always here will i always be here these thoughts dont merely fill my mind they are my mind theres no time as we know it only the questions changing from one to another eventually the questions resolve into a single mantra where did i come from where did i come from im a braindamaged man sitting in a room for eternity asking one question of the darkness dont you see rachel had said you havent fully dealt with the deaths of your wife and daughter their loss cut you off from the world and from yourself you are damaged you are wounded the man walking around in the world of light is an act the real david tennant is sitting in that dark room unable to think or feel no one feels his grief or his pain thats not it i told her i did a psychiatry rotation for gods sake this isnt unresolved grief she sighed and shook her head doctors always make the worst patients a week later i told her the dream had changed theres something in the room with me now what is it i dont know i cant see it but you know its there yes is it a person no its very small a sphere floating in space a black golf ball floating in the dark how do you know its there its like a deeper darkness at the center of the dark and it pulls at me pulls how i dont know like gravity emotional gravity but i know this it knows the answer to my questions it knows who i am and why im stuck in that dark room and so it went with slight variations until the dream changed again when it did it changed profoundly one night while reading at home i went under in the usual way i found myself sitting in the familiar lightless room asking my question of the black ball then without warning the ball exploded into retinascorching light after so much darkness the striking of a match would have seemed an explosion but this was no match it blasted outward in all directions with the magnitude of a hydrogen bomb only this explosion did not suck back into itself and blossom into a mushroom cloud it expanded with infinite power and speed and i had the horrifying sense of being devoured by it devoured but not destroyed as the blinding light consumed the darkness which was me i somehow knew that this could go on for billions of years without destroying me altogether yet still i was afraid rachel didnt know what to make of this dream over the next three weeks she listened as i described the births of stars and galaxies their lives and deaths black holes supernovas flashes of nebulae like powdered diamonds flung into the blackness planets born and dying i seemed to see from one end of the universe to the other all objects at once as they expanded into me at the speed of light have you seen images like these before she asked me in waking life how could i have you seen photographs taken by the hubble space telescope of course theyre very much like what youre describing frustration crept into my voice you dont understand im not just seeing this im feeling it the way i might feel watching children or combat or lovers together its not merely a visual display go on that was what she always said i closed my eyes and submerged myself in my most recent dream im watching a planet hovering above it there are clouds but not as we know them theyre green like acid and tortured by storms im diving now diving down through the clouds like a satellite image zooming in to ground level theres an ocean below but its not blue its red and boiling i plunge through its surface deep into the red im looking for something but its not there this ocean is empty a lot of things came to me when you described that rachel said the color imagery first red could be important the empty ocean is a symbol of barrenness which expresses your aggrieved state she hesitated what are you looking for in that ocean i dont know i think you do im not looking for karen and zooey david a hint of irritation in her voice if you dont think these images are symbolic why are you here i opened my eyes and looked at her perfectly composed face a curtain of professionalism obscured her empathy but i saw the truth she was projecting her sense of loss about her own family onto me im here because i cant find answers on my own i said because ive read a mountain of books and they havent helped she nodded gravely how do you remember the hallucinations in such detail do you write them down when you wake up no they arent like normal dreams where the harder you try to remember the less you can these are indelible isnt that a feature of narcoleptic dreams yes she said softly all right karen and zooey died in water they both drowned karen probably bled a good bit from her hands and where she hit her head on the steering wheel that would give us red water rachel reclined her chair and looked at the ceiling tiles these hallucinations have no people in them yet you experience strong emotional reactions you mentioned combat have you ever been in combat no but you know that karen fought to save zooey she fought to stay alive you told me that i shut my eyes i didnt like to think about that part of it but sometimes i couldnt banish the thoughts when karens car flipped into the pond it had landed on its roof and sunk into a foot of soft mud the electric windows shorted out and the doors were impossible to open broken bones in karens hands and feet testified to the fury with which she had fought to smash the windows she was a small woman not physically strong but she had not given up a paramedic from the accident scene told me that when the car was finally winched out of the muck and its doors opened he found her in the backseat one arm wrapped tightly around zooey the other arm floating free that hand shattered and lacerated over the knuckles what had happened was clear as water filled the car and karen fought to break the windows zooey had panicked anyone would and especially a child at that point some mothers would have kept fighting while their child screamed in terror others would have comforted their child and prayed for help to come but karen had pulled zooey tight against her promised her that everything was going to be all right and then with her feet fought to her last breath to escape the waterbound coffin for her to cling to zooey while suffering the agony of anoxia testified to a love stronger than terror and that knowledge had helped bring me some peace green clouds and a red ocean have nothing to do with a car accident five years ago i said no then i think you should tell me more about your childhood its not relevant you cant know that rachel insisted i do tell me about your work then i teach medical ethics you took a leave of absence over a year ago i whipped my head toward her and opened my eyes how do you know that i heard it at the hospital who said it i dont remember i overheard it youre very well known in the medical community physicians at duke refer to your book all the time they did at new york presbyterian too so is it true did you take a leave of absence from the medical school lets stick to the dreams okay its safer for both of us safer how i didnt answer by the next weeks appointment the dreams had changed again im looking at the earth suspended in space its the most beautiful thing ive ever seen blue and green with swirling white clouds its a living thing a perfect closed system i dive through the clouds a hundredmile swan dive into deep blue ocean its bursting with life giant molecules multicelled creatures jellyfish squid serpents sharks the land too is teeming covered with jungle a symphony of green on the shore fish flop out of the waves and grow legs strange crabs scuttle onto the sand and change into other animals ive never seen time is running in fastforward like evolution run through a projector at a million times natural speed dinosaurs morph into birds rodents into mammals primates lose their hair ice sheets flatten the jungles and then melt into savannah twenty thousand years pass in one breath take it slow rachel advised youre getting agitated how could i be seeing all that you know the answer your mind can create any conceivable image and make it real that photograph of the earth from space is an icon of modern culture it moves everyone who sees it and you must have seen it fifty times since childhood my mind can create animals ive never seen realisticlooking animals of course youve seen hieronymus bosch paintings and ive seen the kind of timelapse images youre describing on television in the old days life magazine did things like that in print the ascent of man like that the question is why are you seeing these things thats what im here to find out are you present in this surreal landscape no what do you feel im still looking for something what i dont know im like a bird scanning the earth and sea for something are you a bird in the dream she sounded hopeful birds must mean something in the lexicon of dream interpretation no what are you nothing really a pair of eyes an observer yes a disembodied observer t j eckleburg who nothing something from f scott fitzgerald oh i remember she put the end of her pen in her mouth and bit it an unusual gesture for her do you have an opinion about why youre seeing all this yes i knew my next words would surprise her i believe someone is showing it to me her eyes widened practically histrionics from rachel weiss really yes who is showing this to you i have no idea why do you think im seeing it she moved her head from side to side i could almost see her neurons firing processing my words through the filters that education and experience had embedded in her brain evolution is change she said youre seeing change sped up to unnatural velocity uncontrollable change i sense this may have something to do with your work you could be right i thought but i didnt say that i simply moved on my silence was her only protection in the end it didnt matter because the theme of evolution died and what came to dominate my sleeping mind shook me to the core there were people in my new dreams they couldnt see me and i only saw flashes of them it was as though i were watching damaged strips of film cobbled together out of order a woman walking with a baby on her hip a man drawing water from a well a soldier in uniform carrying a short sword the gladius i had learned about in mrs whaleys eighthgrade latin class a roman soldier that was my first real clue that this was no random series of images but scenes from a particular era i saw oxen pulling plows a young woman selling herself on the street men exchanging money gold and copper coins with the imperious profile of an emperor upon them and a name tiberius the name triggered something in my mind so i checked the internet the successor of augustus tiberius was a former commander of legions who spent much of his reign leading military campaigns in germania one of the few important events of his ruleseen through the lens of hindsight was the execution of a jewish peasant said to have claimed to be king of the jews was your father deeply religious rachel asked upon hearing about these new images no he was he looked at the world in a more fundamental way what do you mean by that its not relevant an exasperated sigh your mother then she had faith in something greater than humanity but she wasnt big on organized religion you had no religious indoctrination as a child sunday school for a couple of years it didnt take what denomination methodist it was the closest church to our house did they show films about jesus life its possible i dont remember you grew up in oak ridge tennessee right its more probable than not and of course weve all seen the grand biblical epics from the fifties the ten commandments benhur those things what are you saying only that the accoutrements of these hallucinations have been sitting in your subconscious for years theyre in all of us but your dreams seem to be moving toward something and that something may be jesus of nazareth have you heard of dreams like this before i asked of course many people dream of jesus of personal interactions with him receiving messages from him but your dream progression has a certain logic to it and a naturalistic tone rather than the wildness of obsessive fantasy also you claim to be an atheist or at least agnostic im very interested to see where this goes i appreciated her interest but i was tired of waiting for answers but what do you think it means she pursed her lips then shook her head im no longer convinced that this has to do with the loss of your wife and daughter but the truth is i simply dont know enough about your life to make an informed evaluation we were at a stalemate i still didnt believe that my past had anything to do with my dreams yet as the days passed the scarred strips of film in my head began to clear and certain dream characters to reappear the faces i saw became familiar like friends then more familiar than friends a feeling was growing in me that i remembered these faces and not merely from previous dreams i described them for rachel as accurately as i could im sitting in the midst of a circle rapt bearded faces watching me i know im speaking because theyre obviously listening to me yet i cant hear my own words i see a womans face angelic yet common and a pair of eyes i know like those of my mother they dont belong to my mother though not the mother who raised me in oak ridge yet they watch me with pure love a bearded man stands behind her watching me with a fathers pride but my father was clean shaven all his life i see donkeys a date palm naked children a brown river i feel the cold jarring shock of immersion the beat of my feet on sand i see a young girl beautiful and darkhaired leaning toward my face for a kiss then blushing and running away im walking among adults their faces say this child is not like other children a wildeyed man stands waist deep in water a line of men and women awaiting their turn to be submerged while others come up from the water coughing and sputtering their eyes wide sometimes the dreams had no logic but were only disjointed fragments when logic finally returned it frightened me im sitting beside the bed of a small boy he cant move his eyes are closed hes been paralyzed for two days his mother and aunt sit with me they bring food cool water oil to anoint the boy i speak softly in his ear i tell the women to hold his hands then i lean down and speak his name his eyes squeeze tight expressing mucus then they open and light up with recognition of his mother his mother gasps then screams that his hand moved she lifts him up and he hugs her the women weep with happiness im eating with a group of women olives and flat bread some women wont meet my eyes after the meal they take me into a bedroom where a pregnant girl lies on the bed they tell me the baby has been inside her too long labor will not begin they fear the child is dead i ask the women to leave the young mother fears me i calm her with soft words then lift the blanket and lay my hands on her belly its distended tight as a drum i leave my hands there for a long time gently urging speaking softly to her i cant understand what im saying its like a soft chant after a time her mouth opens shes felt a kick she cries out for the other women my baby is alive the women lay their hands on me trying to touch me as if i possess some invisible power surely he is the one they say these are stories from the bible rachel said known by millions of schoolchildren theres nothing unique about them ive been reading the new testament i told her theres no record of jesus healing a little boy of paralysis no description of him eating a meal with only women then inducing labor but those are both healing images and youre a physician your subconscious seems to be casting jesus in your image or vice versa perhaps the problem really is your work have you moved further away from pure medicine ive known doctors who fell into depression after giving up handson patient care for pure research perhaps this is something like that shed guessed correctly about my moving away from patient care but my lucid dreams werent some strange expression of nostalgia for my days in the white coat theres another possibility she suggested one more in line with my original interpretation these images of divine healing could be subconscious wishes that you could bring karen and zooey back think about it what were two of jesus most notable miracles i nodded reluctantly raising lazarus from the dead yes and he also resurrected a little girl if im not mistaken yes but i dont think thats the significance of these dreams rachel smiled with infinite patience well one thing is certain eventually your subconscious will make its message clear that turned out to be our last session because that night my dreams changed again and i had no intention of telling rachel how the new dream was clearer than any that had come before and though i was speaking in a foreign language i could understand my words i was walking down a sandy road i came to a well the water was low in the well and i had nothing to draw it with after a time a woman came with an urn on a rope i asked if she would draw me some water she appeared surprised that i would speak to her and i sensed that we were of different tribes i told her the water in the well would not cure her thirst we talked for a time and she began to look at me with appraising eyes i can see you are a prophet she said you see many things that are hidden im no prophet i told her she watched me in silence for a while then she said they speak of a messiah who will come someday to tell us things what do you think of that i looked at the ground but words of profound conviction rose unbidden into my throat i looked at the woman and said i that speak to you am he the woman did not laugh she knelt and touched my knee then walked away looking back over her shoulder again and again when i snapped out of that dream i was soaked in sweat i didnt lift the phone and call rachel for an emergency appointment i saw no point i no longer believed any dream interpretation could help me because i was not dreaming i was remembering what are you thinking about rachel asked from the passenger seat we were nearing the unc campus how you got here she shifted in her seat and gave me a concerned look im here because you missed three sessions and you wouldnt have done that unless things had taken a turn for the worse i think your hallucinations have changed again and theyve scared the hell out of you i gripped the wheel tighter but didnt speak somewhere the nsa was listening why dont you tell me she said what could be the harm this isnt the time or the place the unc theater was up ahead on the left to our right the forest amphitheater lay in the trees below the road i made a hard right and coasted down a dark hill on a street that ran between two rows of stately homes a singleentrance neighborhood that housed tenured professors and affluent young professionals fielding had lived in a small twostory house set well back from the street perfect for him and the chinese wife he hoped to bring to america where are we rachel asked fieldings house is right up here i looked in the direction of the house but saw only darkness id expected to find the place ablaze with light as my own had been after i lost karen and zooey i had a moment of panic a premonition that id driven into one of those s conspiracy films where you walk up to a familiar house and find it vacant or worse with an entirely new family living there a porch light clicked on thirty yards from the street lu li must have been watching from a darkened window i turned my head and scanned the street for suspicious vehicles i frequently spotted the nsa surveillance cars assigned to tail me either the security teams didnt care if we saw them or more likely they wanted us to know we were being watched tonight i saw nothing suspicious but i did sense that something wasnt as it should be perhaps there were watchers who did not want to be seen i turned into fieldings driveway and pulled up to the closed garage door a nobel laureate lives here rachel asked gesturing at the modest house lived i corrected stay here im going to the door alone for gods sake she snapped this is ridiculous just admit this is all a charade and lets go get some coffee and talk about it i grabbed her arm and looked hard into her eyes listen to me damn it its probably okay but this is the way were going to do it ill whistle when its all right for you to come up i walked up to the front door of my dead friends house my hands in plain sight my mind on the in my pocket chapter geli bauer listened intently as corelli reported from the fielding house theyre going inside now tennant went up first the shrink is hanging back now shes going up wait i think the doc is carrying which doc oh tennant hes got a gun in his pocket right front you see the butt no but it looks like a revolver what the hell does tennant think hes up to the cell connection crackled what do you want me to do asked corelli sit tight and make sure the mikes are working the widow just answered the door shes pulling them inside keep me posted geli killed the connection to corelli if tennant was carrying a gun he was afraid for his life he must believe fielding had been murdered but why the drug that had killed fielding caused a fatal bleed in the braina true stroke without an autopsy murder couldnt be proved and there would be no autopsy tennant must know more than godin thought he did if the fedex letter hed received had been sent by fielding it might have contained some sort of evidence she touched her headset mike and said skow home her computer dialed john skows house in raleigh what is it now skow said after two rings tennant and weiss hardly spoke on the way to fieldings house so it wasnt natural theyre avoiding conversation tennant knows hes under surveillance youve always wanted them all to know that yes but tennants never been evasive like this hes up to something hes a little freakedout its natural hes carrying a gun a pause okay hes a lot freakedout we knew he had one in his house thats different than carrying the damn thing skow chuckled thats the kind of reaction you inspire in people geli seriously you need to calm down everything is context we know tennant was suspicious already his best friend died today hes naturally paranoid what we dont want to do is make him more suspicious she wished she could talk to godin shed tried his private cell number but he hadnt answered or called back it was the first time that had ever happened look i think i know what you think skow said take no steps without my approval asshole geli said but skow was already off the line she pressed a button that connected her to nsa headquarters at fort meade her liaison there was a young man named conklin hello ms bauer he said you calling about the fedex query again what do you think ive got what you want the package was dropped into a collection box at a post office in durham north carolina the sender was listed as lewis carroll so fielding had sent something to tennant she knew he hadnt dropped it off himself but his wife almost certainly had geli clicked off and leaned back in her chair reassessing the situation seven hours ago she had killed a man on godins order without knowing precisely why she had no problem with that fielding posed a threat to the project and under the conditions of her contract that was enough if she needed a moral justification project trinity was critical to american national security executing fielding was like killing a spy caught in the act of treason still she was curious as to motive godin had told her that fielding was sabotaging the project and stealing trinity data geli wasnt sure rigorous precautions had been taken to prevent sabotage no one could physically move data in or out of the building and as for electronic theft skows nsa techs made sure that not a single electron left the building without first being cleared by him so why did fielding have to die six weeks ago he and tennant had gotten the project suspended by raising medical and ethical concerns if that were the motive then why wait to kill fielding and why kill only him peter godin had appeared almost desperate when he visited geli last night and she had never seen godin desperate before was he that anxious to get the project back online she knew little about the technical side of the trinity research but she did know that success was still quite a ways off she could read that in the faces of the scientists and engineers who reported to work every day project trinity was buildingor attempting to builda supercomputer not a conventional supercomputer like a cray or a godin but a computer dedicated to artificial intelligencea true thinking machine she didnt know what made this theoretical computer so difficult to build but godin had told her a little about the genesis of the project in a bell labs scientist had theorized that an almost infinitely powerful codebreaking computer might be built using the principles of quantum physics geli knew little about quantum physics but she understood why a quantum computer would be revolutionary modern digital encryptionthe code system used by banks corporations and national governmentswas based on the factoring of large prime numbers conventional supercomputers like those used by the nsa cracked those codes by trying one key after another in sequence like testing keys in a lock breaking a code this way could take hundreds of hours but a quantum computerin theorycould try all possible keys simultaneously the wrong keys would cancel each other out leaving only the proper one to break the code and this process wouldnt take hours or even minutes a quantum computer could break digital encryption codes instantaneously such a machine would render presentday encryption obsolete and give whatever country possessed it a staggering strategic advantage over every other nation in the world given the potential value of such a machine the nsa had launched a massive secret effort to design and build a quantum computer designated project spooky after the description albert einstein had given to the action of certain quantum particlesspooky action at a distance it was placed under the direction of john skow director of the nsas supercomputer research center after spending seven years and million of the nsas black budget skows team had not produced a prototype that could rival the performance of a palm pilot skow was probably days from being terminated when he received a call from peter godin who had been building conventional supercomputers for the nsa for years godin proposed a machine as revolutionary as a quantum computer but with one attribute the government could not resist it could be built using refinements of existing technologymoreover after a conversation with andrew fielding the quantum physicist hed already enlisted to work on his machine godin believed there was a strong chance that his computer would have quantum capabilities by dangling these plums before the president godin had been able to secure almost every concession he demanded a dedicated facility to work on his new machine virtually unlimited government funds to pay for a crash effort modeled on the manhattan project the right to hire and fire his own scientists for government oversight he got john skow whom he had compromised ears before by bribing skow to choose godin computers over grays for the supercomputer research center the presidents single demand had been onsite ethical oversight which materialized in the form of david tennant and tennant had seemed only a minor annoyance in the beginning everything had seemed perfect but now two years had passed nearly a billion dollars had been spent and there was still no working trinity prototype in the secret corridors of the nsas crypto city people were starting to draw parallels to the failed project spooky the difference of course was peter godin even godins enemies conceded that he had never failed to deliver on a promise but this time they whispered he might have taken on more than he could handle artificial intelligence might not be as theoretical as quantum computing but more than a few companies had gone bankrupt by promising to deliver it which was why geli didnt understand the necessity of fieldings death until last night godin had apparently viewed the brilliant englishman as critical to project trinitys success then suddenly he was expendable what had changed on impulse she punched her keyboard and called up a list of fieldings personal effects which she had made after his death at godins request fieldings office had been a jumble of oddities and memorabilia more like a college professors than that of a working physicist there were books of course a copy of the upanishads in the original sanskrit a volume of poetry by w b yeats three wellthumbed novels by raymond chandler a copy of alice through the looking glass various scientific textbooks and treatises the other objects were more incongruous four pairs of dice one pair weighted one cobras fang a mint copy of penthouse magazine a saxophone reed a tibetan prayer bowl a wall calendar featuring the drawings of m c escher a tattered poster from the clubagogo in newcastle england where jimi hendrix had played in autographed by the guitarist a framed letter from stephen hawking conceding a wager the two men had made about the nature of dark matter whatever that was there were storebought compact discs by van morrison john coltrane miles davis the list of objects went on but all seemed innocuous enough geli had flipped through the books herself and a technician was listening to every track on the cds to make sure they werent fakes being used to store stolen data aside from fieldings office junk there were his wallet his clothes and his jewelry the jewelry was simple one gold wedding ring and one gold pocket watch on a chain with a crystal fob on the end as she pondered the list geli suddenly wondered whether all this stuff was still in the storage room where she had locked it this afternoon she wondered because john skow had access to that room what if fielding had been killed for something in his possession maybe that was why theyd wanted him to die at work to be sure they got whatever it was they wanted if so it would have to be something he carried on him otherwise they could simply have taken it from his office geli was about to go check the storage room when her headset beeped again i think weve got a problem corelli said what just like tennants house theyre inside but im not hearing any conversation just faint echoes like spillover from mikes in a distant room shit geli routed the signal from the fielding house microphones to her headset she heard only silence somethings going down she murmured what do you have with you ive got a parabolic but its no good through walls and next to useless with a window i need the laser rig thats here she mentally cataloged her resources ill have it to you in twelve minutes they could be gone in twelve minutes what about night vision i wasnt expecting anything tactical goddamn it its all on the way check tennants car for that fedex envelope and give me the address of the driveway where youre parked geli wrote it down then pressed a button that sounded a tone in a room at the back of the basement complex there were beds there for times when her teams needed to work around the clock thirty seconds later a tall man with long blond hair shuffled sleepily into the control center was ist this he asked were going on alert geli said pointing to a coffee machine against the wall drink ritter bock was german and the only member of her team handpicked by peter godin a former gsg commando ritter had worked for an elite private security service that provided bodyguards for godin when he traveled in europe and the far east godin had hired ritter permanently after the former commando averted a kidnapping attempt on the billionaire ruthless nerveless and skilled in areas beyond his counterterror specialty the twentynineyearold had turned out to be gelis best operative and since she had spent her early summers in germany there was no language problem ritter sipped from a steaming mug and looked at geli over its rim he had the gray machinegunners eyes of the boys who had attracted her as a teenager while her father was stationed in germany i need you to deliver the laser rig to corelli she said hes parked in a driveway near the unc campus she tore off the top sheet of her notepad and laid it on the desktop beside her ritter sniffed and nodded he hated gofer jobs like this one but he never complained he did the scut work and waited patiently for the jobs he was born to do is the laser in the ordnance room he asked yes take four nightvision rigs with you he drained the steaming coffee then picked up the address off the desk and left the room without a word geli liked that americans felt they had to fill every silence as though silence were something to be feared ritter wasted no effort either in conversation or in action this made him valuable sometimes they worked together other times she slept with him it hadnt caused problems yet shed been that way in the army too taking her pleasure where she could find it just as she had at boarding school in switzerland there was always risk you just had to be able to handle aggressive men or womenand the fallout after youd finished with them she had always been up to both tasks corelli she said what are you hearing now still nothing faint spillover unintelligible im calling an alert ritters on the way there was only static and silence geli smiled ritter made the others uncomfortable did you hear me affirmative im at tennants car now what do you see no fedex envelope he must have taken it inside with him okay what do you want me to do go back to your car and wait for ritter right geli clicked off and thought again about fieldings personal effects in the storeroom she had a feeling something was missing and her instincts were usually deadon but she didnt want to leave the control center now once ritter reached the scene things could happen fast chapter i pulled rachel into the foyer of the fielding house the door closed quickly behind us and we turned to face an asian woman just under five feet tall lu li fielding had lived most of her forty years in communist china she understood english well enough but she didnt speak it well at all who this woman she asked pointing at rachel you not married are you dr david this is rachel weiss shes a good friend of mine shes a physician too suspicion filled lu lis eyes she work for the company you mean argus optical trinity she said substituting an l for the r absolutely not shes a professor at the duke university medical school lu li studied rachel for several moments you come in too then please hurry please lu li bowed and led us into the den which opened to the kitchen i smiled sadly when fielding had occupied this house alone it always looked as though a tornado had just blown through it books and papers strewn about dozens of coffee cups beer bottles and overflowing ashtrays littering every flat surface after lu li arrived the house had become a zenlike space of cleanliness and order tonight it smelled of wax and lemon instead of cigarettes and stale beer sit please lu li said rachel and i sat beside each other on a pillowy sofa lu li perched on the edge of an old club chair opposite us she focused on rachel who was staring at a plaque hanging on the wall behind lu lis chair is that the nobel prize rachel asked softly lu li nodded not without pride andy win the nobel in i was in china then but still we knew his work all physicists amazed you must be very proud of him rachel spoke with a calm that her wide eyes belied how did you two meet as lu li responded in broken english i marveled at the union of this woman and my dead friend fielding had met lu li while lecturing in beijing as part of a sinobritish diplomatic initiative she taught physics at beijing university and shed sat in the first row during each of fieldings nine lectures party bureaucrats held several receptions during the series and lu li attended them all she and fielding had quickly become inseparable and by the time the day arrived for him to leave china they were deeply in love two and a half years of separation followed with fielding trying desperately to arrange an exit visa for her even with the supposed help of the nsa brass he made no progress fielding eventually reached a point where he was considering paying illegal brokers to have lu li smuggled out of the country but i convinced him this was too risky everything changed when fielding began delaying project trinity with his suspicions about the side effects we were all suffering as if by magic the red tape was cut and lu li was on a plane bound for washington fielding knew his fiancйe had only been brought to america to distract him but he didnt care nor did her arrival have its desired effect the englishman continued to painstakingly investigate every negative event at the trinity lab and the other scientists grew to hate him for it lu li i said during a pause first let me express my great sadness over andrews passing the physicist shook her head that not why i ask you here i want to know about this morning what really happen to my andy i hesitated to speak frankly in the house seeing my anxious expression she went to the fireplace knelt and reached up into the flue she brought out a sooty cardboard box which she set on the coffee table id seen the box before it contained several pieces of homemade electronic equipment that reminded me of the heathkit projects my father and i had worked on when i was a boy lu li withdrew an object that looked like a metal wand andy sweep house this morning before work she said plugged all the mikes okay to talk now i glanced at rachel the subtext was clear lu li knew the score on trinity or at least she knew about the nsas security tactics geli bauer would probably have this house torn apart as soon as lu li left for the cleaners or the grocery store i was surprised she had waited even this long have you left the house at all today i asked no lu li said they wont tell me what hospital they take andy to i doubted fielding had been taken to a hospital hed probably been flown to nsa headquarters at fort meade maryland probably to some special medical unit for an autopsy or worse the british might complain later but that would be the state departments problem not the nsas and the britishframers of the official secrets act and the d noticehad a way of falling into line with the united states where national security was concerned i still think we should whisper i said softly pointing at the wand and i think i should take that box with me when i go im afraid the n i stopped myselfthe company security people might search this house the first time you leave you dont want anybody to find it lu li had been raised in a communist country with ruthless security police her willingness to believe the worst was deeply ingrained did they kill my andy she whispered i hope not given andrews health age and habits a stroke was possible but i dont think it was a stroke what makes you think he might have been murdered lu li closed her eyes squeezing tears out of them andy knew something might happen to him he tell me so did he say this once or often last two weeks many times i exhaled long and slowly do you know why andrew wanted to see me at nags head he want to talk to you that all i know andy very scared about work about trinity about what godin somehow i had known it would be godin john skow was easy to hatean arrogant technocrat with no moral centerbut he did not generate much fear godin on the other hand was easy to likea genius a patriot in the best sense of the word a man of convictionyet after you worked with him awhile you sensed a disturbing vibration radiating from him a faustian hunger to know that disdained all limits disregarded all boundaries one thing was plain anyone or anything that stood between godin and his goal would not remain there long godin and fielding had got along well in the beginning they were from roughly the same generation and godin possessed robert oppenheimers gift for motivating talented scientists a combination of flattery and provocative insight but the honeymoon had not lasted for godin trinity was a mission and he pursued it with missionary zeal fielding was different the englishman did not believe that just because something was possible it should be done nor did he believe that even a noble end justified all means to attain it did andy have papers to show me i asked hopefully i dont think so every evening he make notes but every night before bedshe pointed to the fireplacehe always burn them andy very secret he always try to protect me always to protect me he did the same for me i thought suddenly i remembered the words in fieldings letter did andrew take his pocket watch to work with him today lu li didnt hesitate he take it every day you no see it today no but im sure it will be returned to you with his personal effects her lower lip began to quiver and i sensed another imminent wave of tears but it didnt come watching lu lis stoicism i felt a sharp pang of grief familiar yet somehow new to me i was no stranger to mourning but what i felt now was different from what id felt after the loss of my wife and daughter andrew fielding was one of the few men of his century who might have answered some of the fundamental questions of human existence to know that such a mind had gone out of the world left me feeling hollow as though my species were diminished in some profound and irrecoverable way what will happen to me now lu li asked quietly they send me back to china not a chance i thought one reason trinity was so secret was the belief held in some quarters that other countries might be at work on a similar device with its history of aggressive technology theft communist china ranked high on that list the nsa would never let a chineseborn physicist who had been this close to the project return to her native land in fact i worried about her survival but i could do little to protect her until i talked to the president they cant send you back i assured her dont worry about that andy say the government do anything it want i was about to answer when headlight beams shone through the foyer a car was passing slowly by the house thats not true i said lu li i dont like saying this but the best thing you can do right now is to cooperate with the nsa the less trouble they see you making the jess theyll perceive you as a threat do you understand her face tightened you say now i should let them kill my andy and say nothing do nothing we dont know that andy was killed and theres very little you can personally do right now i want you to leave everything to me ive called the president and i could hear back from him at any time hes in china now of all places beijing i see on tv andy tell me you know this president ive met him he was a friend of my brothers and he appointed me to my job and i promise you that one way or another ill find the truth about andrews death i owe him that and more lu li suddenly smiled through her anguish andy was good man kind funny man and smart very smart i agreed though words like smart meant little when applied to men like andrew fielding fielding had been a member of one of the smallest fraternities on the planet those who truly understood the mysteries of quantum physics a field reservedas fieldings cambridge students often jokedfor those students who were too smart to be doctors rachel squeaked in surprise as a white ball of fur raced into the room and leapt into lu lis lap the furball was a small dog a bichon frise lu li smiled and vigorously stroked the bichons neck maya maya she cooed then murmured softly in singsong cantonese the bichon seemed anxious at the presence of strangers but it did not bark its little brown eyes locked on me you know maya dr david yes weve met andy buy her for me six weeks ago maya my baby my baby until god blesses andy and me with as she lapsed into silence i realized that my sixtythreeyearold friend had been trying to have child with his fortyyearold wife im sorry i said uselessly im so sorry rachel looked as though she wanted to speak but there were times when even a gifted psychiatrist found herself at a loss for words as lu li stared into space my anxiety grew if fielding had suspected that he might be murdered and he had voiced that fear to his wife then the nsa might know he had done that they almost certainly knew i was here now if they were outside they had probably photographed rachel and would be trying to figure out what she was doing here maya looks like she could use a walk i said brightly lu li started from her trance ill be glad to take her out for you i added no maya no need i cut her off with an upraised hand i think the air would do us all good lu li stared at me for several moments yes she said finally is good idea me inside all day looking around for something to write with i saw a message pad by the telephone i went to it and wrote do you have a portable tape recorder then i pulled off that sheet and wrote my cell phone number on the next page when lu li read my question she walked back to fieldings study and returned with a sony microcassette recorder the type used for dictation i put it in my pocket and led both women to the glass doors that opened onto the patio maya followed us out but stuck close to lu li who attached a leash to the dogs collar about a hundred meters through the woods lay the university of north carolinas outdoor amphitheater on two previous occasions fielding had taken me there to talk i know andrew swept the house i whispered to lu li but i still dont feel safe talking inside i need to speak to rachel alone for a few minutes i want you to go back inside lock the doors but leave maya with us were going to walk through the woods to the amphitheater well be back very soon i have my cell phone and i left the number on your message pad if anything strange happens call me immediately confusion and worry wrinkled lu lis face you need maya for cover you understand an excuse to walk out here she nodded slowly then knelt whispered something to the dog and retreated into the house i picked up the whimpering bichon and walked swiftly across the backyard to a narrow path that led through the woods rachel struggled to keep up as branches began to pull at our clothes what are we doing she hissed keep quiet i have to talk to you and i dont think we have long i wasnt sure of the source of my fear but i knew it ran deep without being aware of it i had shifted the dog to my left hand and drawn my gun with my right chapter ritters here said corelli his voice sounding tense in gelis headset hes already got the laser trained on the front window whats he hearing definite sounds but no conversation like one person moving around the house they could be in one of the back rooms change position and put the laser on a back window hurry right geli could hardly stay in her chair something was going down at the fielding house and she had only one way to know what it was a minute passed then ritters deeper voice said nichts youre not getting anything in back she asked nein they know where the bugs are and theyve plugged them ahh said ritter how could they know that fielding that bastard said corelli he was always playing games with us geli nodded around trinity fielding had acted like an absentminded professor but he was the sharpest son of a bitch in the place theyve probably left the house geli said fielding and tennant did that twice before walking fieldings dog im going to put a team in the woods nein said ritter tennant will hear them you have a better idea ill go alone okay but im setting up a perimeter tennant could be trying to run i dont think so its a stupid way to run and tennants not stupid why stupid when you run you dont take women with you you move fast and light geli smiled to herself tennants not like you liebchen ritter laughed hes a man isnt he hes american and he was raised in the south i knew guys like him in the army born heroes they have this romantic streak it gets a lot of them killed like the english ritter asked geli thought of andrew fielding sort of now get going tell corelli to cover the front ja geli got out of her chair and began to pace the narrow alley between the racks of electronic gear she thought of calling john skow again but skow didnt want to be bothered fine shed call him when tennant bolted then see what the smug bastard had to say about not keeping the leash too tight chapter i moved silently through the dark trees rachel sounded like a blind bear blundering along behind me on a manhattan street she probably maneuvered like a pro halfback but the woods were alien to her i slowed until she caught up then told her to hold on to the back of my belt she did when we were fifty yards away from the house i said do you believe me about fielding now i believe you worked with him rachel said im not sure he was murdered i dont think you are either i stepped over a fallen log then helped her over i know he was murdered only two people at project trinity opposed what was being done there fielding was one and now hes dead im the other are you going to tell me about trinity now if youre willing to listen i think you understand now that it could be dangerous for you she sucked in her breath as briers raked her arm go on when you came to my house today i was making a videotape to give to my lawyer he was to open it if something happened to me i never finished it and the truth is im worried about seeing tomorrow morning alive rachel stopped in the overgrown track why dont you just call the police lu li clearly shares your suspicions and i think theres enough circumstantial evidence to city police cant investigate the nsa and thats who oversees trinity call the fbi then thats like calling the fbi to investigate the cia theres so much ill will between those agencies that it would take weeks to get anything done if you really want to help become my videotape listen to what i have to tell you then go home and keep it to yourself and if something happens to you call cnn and the new york times and tell them everything you know the sooner you tell it the safer youll be why dont you do that tonight because i cant be sure im right because the president could be trying to reach me as we speak and because as juvenile as it may sound this is a national security matter holding lu lis whimpering bichon in my left arm i put my gun in my pocket and pulled rachel forward forty yards on i saw a deeper darkness ahead the trees gave way like thinning ranks of soldiers and then a manmade wall stopped me in my tracks when my eyes adjusted i saw the door i had known was there i opened it with my free hand and led rachel through we emerged into a moonlit bowl lined with cut stone my god she said the amphitheater looked as though it had magically been transported to the carolina woods from greece to our right was the elevated stage to our left a stone stairway leading up through the seats to the top row not far above that lay country club road the view down from the road was almost completely blocked by pines and hardwoods but i could see the broken beams of headlights passing high above us i took rachels hand stepped onto the stone floor and led her to the edge of the stage there i tied mayas leash around a low light stanchion while the dog sniffed an invisible scent trail i set the tape recorder on the edge of the stage and depressed record this is david tennant md i said im speaking to dr rachel weiss of the duke university medical school playback gave me a staticky facsimile of my words i looked at my watch we need to do this in less than ten minutes rachel shrugged her eyes full of curiosity for the past two years ive been working on a special project for the national security agency its known as project trinity and its based in a building in the research triangle park ten miles from here trinity is a massive governmentfunded effort to build a supercomputer capable of artificial intelligence a computer that can think she looked unimpressed dont we already have computers that can do that this common misconception surprised me now but when i went to work at trinity i hadnt known much better myself for fifty years science fiction writers and filmmakers had been creating portrayals of giant electronic brains taking over the world hal the speaking computer of a space odyssey had entered pop consciousness in and remained firmly embedded there ever since in the subsequent thirtyfive years we had witnessed such a revolution in digital computing that the average person believed that a computer that can think was just around the corner if not already within our capabilities but the reality was far different i had no time to go into the complexities of neural networks or strong ai rachel needed a simple primer and the facts about trinity have you heard of a man named alan turing i asked hes one of the men who broke the germans enigma code during world war two turing rachel looked preoccupied i think ive heard of something called the turing test thats the classic test of artificial intelligence turing said machine intelligence would be achieved when a human being could sit on one side of a wall and type questions into a keyboard then read the answers coming onto his screen from the other side and be certain that those answers were being typed by another human being turing predicted that would happen by the end of the twentieth century but no computer has ever come close to passing that test using conventional technology its still probably fifty years off didnt that ibm computer finally beat garry kasparov at chess i know i read that somewhere deep blue i laughed the sound strangely brittle in the amphitheater yes but it won by using what computer scientists call brute force its memory contains every known chess game ever played and it processes millions of probabilities every time it makes a move it plays very good chess but it doesnt understand what its doing as a human being garry kasparov never has to consider the billions of possibilitiesmany of them ridiculously simplethat the computer does kasparovs acquired knowledge allows him to make intuitive leaps and to learn permanently every time he does he plays by instinct and no one really understands what that means rachel sat on the edge of the stage so what are you telling me that computers dont think like human beings in fact they dont think at all they simply carry out instructions all those tv commercials you hear about software that thinks theyre bullshit serious ai researchers are afraid to even use the term artificial inteligence anymore okay so whats project trinity the holy grail what do you mean everyone wants to build a computer that works like the human brain but we dont understand how the brain works everyone concedes that well two years ago one man realized this didnt have to be the obstacle everyone thought it was that we might be able to copy the brain without actually understanding what we were doing using existing technology who was this man peter godin the billionaire godin supercomputing now shed surprised me thats right they have a godin four supercomputer in a basement at tunl the duke highenergy lab well godin is the man who conceived project trinity rachel looked as though the accumulating details were starting to persuade her what kind of existing technology can copy the brain mri magnetic resonance imaging yes you order mri scans every week right of course theres a lot of information on those scans isnt there more than i can interpret sometimes rachel ive seen mri scans that contain a hundred thousand times the information of the ones you see every day a hundred thousand times the resolution she blinked but how can that be how much more can you see ive seen reactions between individual nerve synapses frozen in time ive seen the human brain working at the molecular level bullshit any doctor would have said the same no the machine exists its sitting in a room ten miles away from us right now only nobody knows it she was shaking her head that makes no sense why would a company keep something like that secret because theyre legally bound to by the government but an mri like that would make whoever developed it hundreds of millions of dollars it could detect malignant cells long before they even become tumor masses youre right thats been my main problem with this project its unethical to keep that machine from cancer patients but for now just accept that theres an mri machine that can produce threed models of the brain with resolution to the molecular level molecular snapshots of the brain basically yes ravi nara calls them neuromodels neuromodels okay rachel do you realize what one of those neuromodels is i know that a single one of them would revolutionize neuroscience but i get the feeling thats not what this is about a neuromodel is the person it was taken from literally his thoughts memories fearseverything but its just a scan right a highresolution map of the brain no its a coded facsimile of every molecule in the brain in perfect spatial and electrochemical relation which means that hold on are you about to tell me they can load one of these neuromodels into a computer no but thats what theyve been working around the clock for two years to achieve godin predicted it would take fifteen to twenty years but they got halfway there in nineteen months ive never seen anything like it the only historical precedent is the manhattan project during world war two rachel started to speak but i held up my hand high above us a pair of headlights was cruising past at less than half the speed of the other cars they slowed still more then sped up and disappeared we need to hurry if trinity is everything you say it is she said then why in gods name would it be based in north carolina this i hadnt expected arent you the top jungian analyst in the world well one of them why are you based in north carolina she frowned because duke university is here thats different not so different peter godin wanted trinity based at his r and d lab in mountain view california the nsa is footing the bill and they wanted it based at fort meade maryland research triangle park was the ultimate compromise hightech but out of the way whats the end point here what does the nsa want to do with trinity our government sees most scientific revolutions in terms of weapons potential if such a machine can be built our government wants to be the first to do it what kind of weapon can this computer be think desert storm afghanistan iraq everythings computerized in modern war codebreaking nuclear weapons testing information warfare battlefield systems but a trinity wouldnt be merely an advance it would make todays supercomputers as obsolete as model ts and if fielding was right about it having quantum capabilities then presentday encryption is gone thats why the nsa has spent close to a billion dollars on trinity rachel processed what id said but this isnt just a faster supercomputer were talking about a computer that thinks like a person i shook my head we cant build a computer that thinks like a person were talking about copying an individual human brain creating a digital entity that for all practical purposes is a person with his or her cognitive functions memories hopes dreams everything except a body only it would run at the speed of a digital computer one million times faster than biological circuitry she spoke almost to herself this is why andrew fielding and ravi nara would be working together exactly nobel laureates in quantum physics and neuroscience peter godin brought them together i checked to see that the spools on the recorder were still turning but ive only told you part of trinitys potential once your neuromodel is loaded into the computer as rachel weiss speed isnt the only advantage it will have over youthe original what do you mean say i decide to learn to play the piano it takes me three years of intensive study youre impressed by that you want to learn to play the piano too its going to take you three years as well give or take thats the disadvantage of the human brain each one has approximately the same learning curve but the computer model of your brain doesnt have that problem the sum total of music theory can be digitized and downloaded into its memoryyour memoryin about three seconds theres no learning curve at all she shook her head youre saying you could download the sum of human knowledge into this computer into meall in a few hours in theory yes david youre talking about something like like a god almost not almost because that computer model would not only be rachel weiss it would be rachel weiss forever it could be backed up and stored or downloaded into another trinity computer it would never have to die she pursed her lips to speak but no words emerged are you starting to believe me now whats your job at trinity i was appointed by the president to evaluate any ethical dilemmas that might arise during the manhattan project some scientists turned against the atomic bomb for moral reasons and they had no real voice the president wanted to minimize the public controversy that was bound to come if trinity became a reality he knew my brother in college and hed read my book on medical ethicsor watched the nova series based on it more likely thats what made him pick me for the project its really that simple rachel looked off into the dark trees this sounds anything but simple in fact it sounds crazy she looked back at me her eyes glinting you said trinity got halfway to success in nineteen months whats holding up the second half building a computer powerful enough to hold a complete neuromodel in its circuitry the human brain is fairly slow in terms of speed but its massively parallel it contains over a hundred trillion possible connections all capable of simultaneous calculation and thats just for processing it also holds the equivalent of twelve hundred terabytes of computer memory she shrugged that means nothing to me six million years of the wall street journal her mouth fell open when trinity began no computer on the planet had that kind of capacity the internet as a whole does but its far too dispersed and unreliable to be controllable and now ibm is building a computer called blue gene that will rival the processing power of the brain but itll still be unable to do things any fiveyearold child can and trinity is different you could say that blue gene will fill a fiftybyfiftyfoot room and need three hundred tons of airconditioning just to function trinity will be about the size of a volkswagen beetle and godin thinks thats still too big hes always saying that the human brain weighs three pounds and uses only ten watts of electricity he believes the solutions to great problems must be beautiful elegant rachel gazed up the incline of stone seats trying to grasp a future that was crashing headlong into the present how close is trinity to becoming a reality i thought of the black mass of carbon and crystal growing almost like a lifeform in the basement lab of the trinity building theres a prototype sitting in our lab right now with one hundred and twenty trillion connections and practically unlimited memory does it work no why not because even if you succeed in loading a neuromodel into the computer how do you talk to it the human brain interacts with the world through a biological body with five senses imagine your brain downloaded into a box its deaf dumb blind and paralyzed a quivering mass of fear and thank god for it because once a machine like that can talkand listen and acttheres no telling what it might do rachel looked up at me with interest what could it do do you remember hal from a space odyssey sure the most reliable computer ever made urbana illinois right i chuckled softly he was until he murdered the crew of his spaceship well imagine what hal could do if he were connected to the internet tell me one trinity computer connected to a phone line could hold the industrialized world hostage it could disrupt power grids rail lines air traffic control missile systems norad wall street it could demand whatever it wanted she shook her head in confusion but what would it want what does any intelligent entity want especially one thats essentially human power exactly i jumped as my cell phone rang the id said andrew fielding i pressed send lu li has something happened nothing happen lu li replied in a shaky voice i worry about maya i think i hear noises outside you bring her back dr david the bichon stopped sniffing the ground looked up at me and cocked its head as though listening were coming right now is she all right rachel asked as i ended the call yes she wants us to come back but were going to wait a bit why because the nsa heard that call if they have people in the woods theyll probably move now and well hear them rachel glanced anxiously at the wall that separated us from the trees do you really think theres someone out there thats not what scares you i said what scares you is that now you think there might be she slid off the stage and looked at the door wed passed through it was easy to imagine someone waiting behind it you said fielding was murdered because you and he resisted the project how exactly did you resist it we didnt just resist it we stopped it cold suspended it anyway fielding was the driving force but it took me interceding with the president to accomplish it it was like trying to stop the work on the atomic bomb during world war two why did you want to stop it im not completely sure about fieldings reasons i think he kept a lot from meto protect me i mean but my reasons were simple six months ago we tested the supermri machine we used animals first and there were no problems the first humans to be scanned were the six of us in the inner circle within a week we all developed strange neurological symptoms side effects from exposure to the machine fielding believed mri doesnt cause side effects rachel broke in not the machines you use but the magnetic fields generated by the trinity mri are exponentially more intense than those in presentday machines they use superconducting materials that allow massive pulses maya was growling deep in her throat and looking up the slope of stone seats i hadnt heard anything in the woods but maybe the dog had i put the tape recorder in my pocket picked up maya then drew my gun and pulled rachel through the stage door darkness enveloped us stay right behind me i said ducking under a branch did you hear something no if i hadnt had rachel with me i would have used stealth to safely reach the house but speed was the only option now i plowed through the underbrush warning rachel whenever i hit branches likely to whip back into her face she cried out twice and stumbled once but she got back up and somehow managed to stay on my heels as we neared the house i saw the yellow square of fieldings patio doors lu li stood silhouetted inside them a perfect target the image made me shiver when she slid open the door i pulled her deep into the room maya barked wildly until lu li bent and held out her arms the dog leapt into them as rachel closed the glass door call a taxi i whispered over my shoulder rachel went to the phone lu lis eyes were wet i touched her elbow and the dog snapped at me i wish i could stay the night with you i said quietly but that would look more suspicious than my going home im going to go to work tomorrow and try to get some answers so i want everything to look as normal as possible do you understand yes ill take andrews box of toys with me i dont want anyone to find it here is that all right lu li nodded stroking the bichon as lovingly as she would a child im going to pull into the garage when i leave so no one sees me take the box if anyone asks you what i was doing here tell them it was a sympathy visit if they somehow overheard some of our conversation just act like what you are a distraught widow what means distraught griefstricken grieving she smiled bravely i no need to act this i laid my hands on her shoulders and squeezed then spoke almost inaudibly in the fedex letter andy sent me there was some white powder almost like sand its in those plastic bags on the couch do you know anything about that lu lis gaze went to the couch and her face wrinkled in confusion no nothing did you drop it off at the fedex box yes how you know it doesnt matter i knew lu li had dropped off the envelope because i had been inside fieldings head during my last dream i felt a sudden compulsion to get out of the house rachel the taxi any minute she said from behind me i want you to go into the garage i told lu li when you hear me tap the horn open the door for me after i pull in close the door okay she left the room without a word i picked up the ziplocs then led rachel to the darkened living room where wide windows looked onto the street i dropped the ziplocs on a chair then sat on a sofa opposite the window to wait for the cab is the taxi for me she whispered sitting beside me yes but my cars parked at your house you dont want to go back to my house you can get it in the morning if you want to id rather you take a taxi to work did i hear you tell lu li youre going back to work tomorrow if i dont hear from the president tonight i am why if they killed fielding why wont they kill you too her question gave me a perverse satisfaction it sounds like youre buying into my delusion her lips tightened and i could see that she was genuinely afraid look if they really wanted to kill me id be dead already and if they decide to kill me before tomorrow nothing will stop them but i think theyre too worried about how the president would react to try that if im alive tomorrow morning its all right for me to go in rachel sighed and rubbed her temples with her fingers i dont know whats going to happen i whispered if anyone questions you tell as much truth as you can you came to my house because i missed three sessions i got a call from the wife of a friend who died today she has no family here so you offered to help console her we calmed her down and walked her dog thats all you know she studied my face in the dim light this isnt what i expected i know you really thought i was crazy she bit her lip the gesture almost girlish i suppose i did part of me hoped i was wrong but now im frightened i know about psychiatric problems this is something else i pulled her close and spoke into her ear i want you to forget it all unless something happens to me then you remember remember and scream to high heaven i pulled back and looked into her eyes i wont be coming back to your office she stared at me as though id said were never going to see each other again which deep down was what i felt david heres your taxi i stood as headlights rolled to a stop in front of the house looking close to make sure there was a taxi light on the roof she was shaking her head almost helplessly dont worry i said im going to be fine youve helped a lot i didnt do a damned thing for you i pulled her out of sight of the window then took the recorder from my pocket removed the tape and put it in her hand if you want to help heres your chance i started to send her on then hesitated there is one more thing you could do tell me i pointed to the ziploc bags on the chair is there someone at duke who could safely test that powder for infectious agents and poisons of course there are guys over there who live for that kind of thing there was a slipcover on one of the sofa pillows i took it off the pillow then put the ziplocs inside it and handed it to her be very careful with those youre preaching to the choir i squeezed her arm thank you now go she didnt go she stood on tiptoe and kissed me gently on the lips be careful please please be careful as i stared rachel slid the slipcover under her blouse then walked to the foyer i heard the front door close softly through the front window i watched her get into the taxi the cab pulled into lu lis driveway then backed out and rolled up gimghoul street i went out to my car pulled up to fieldings garage door and tapped my horn lu li opened the door from inside then closed it behind me she pulled open my passenger door and set her husbands cardboard box on the front seat i reached across it and gripped her wrist my eyes boring into hers tell me the truth lu li do you know what theyre trying to build at trinity after several seconds of eye contact she nodded once dont ever tell anyone that i warned never me chinese david know what can happen for an instant i flashed back to her standing silhouetted in the patio doors a target awaiting an assassin come with me i said suddenly right now just get in with your dog and well go ill keep you safe a sad smile touched her lips you good man like andrew dont worry i already make my own arrangements arrangements i couldnt imagine what these might be i didnt think she knew anyone in the states what are they she shook her head better you dont know yes i be okay for some reason i believed her the revelation that lu li had not been rendered helpless by her grief made me ask one more question in his letter andy told me that if anything happened to him i should remember his pocket watch whats so special about that watch lu li studied my eyes for what seemed a long time then in a nearly inaudible whisper she said not watch fob fob watch fob i closed my eyes and pictured fieldings watch it was a scarred but precious heirloom and at the end of its chain was a small diamondshaped crystal the crystal i asked lu li smiled you smart man you figure it out chapter geli bauer was on her feet pacing the control center and shouting into her headset at john skow shed never lost her temper with him before but without godin backing her up skow was proving maddeningly obstinate havent you heard a word i said cant you see whats happening skow answered in a condescending voice this is what youve told me dr tennant and dr weiss visited the grieving widow and walked her dog dr weiss kissed tennant then she went home in a cab geli closed her eyes and tried to suppress her anger tennant pulled into the garage and closed the door before he left the fielding house he obviously took something that he didnt want us to see thats possible skow said but as far as you can tell hes headed home now whats the problem we couldnt hear a damn thing they plugged the bugs same as they did at tennants house and weiss left her saab at tennants house instead of taking the cab there to pick it up why would she do that tennant might be planning to run or even to go public maybe both i think youre projecting your own paranoia onto him ritter heard them talking about mri side effects thats small potatoes you couldnt know that of course the supermri unit is tennants pet ethical concern and its got nothing to do with the central issue but they talked for ten minutes before that and ritter thinks he saw a tape recorder skow sighed what would you have me do about that take them out the nsa man caught his breath did i hear you correctly you know you did we have to assume weiss knows the full details of trinity and about tennants suspicions regarding dr fieldings death dr weiss is a private citizen whos broken no law if you wont take them out then bring them in for interrogation with prejudice the resulting silence seemed interminable then skow said do you have someone following dr weisss cab ritter was covering weiss my best man he could easily stage an accident skows voice when it came was like shaved ice listen to me geli your man will follow the cab to dr weisss residence then break contact he will not let her see him he will not even breathe hard in her direction what call off your dog and your team on dr tennant will follow him to his residence and set up a static surveillance post as per normal procedure why the hell would somebody keep a cobras fang she wanted to go to the storage room and check the actual objects against the list but she was too pissed off to deal with that she had always worked with incomplete information at trinity it hadnt bothered her much the army was good training for that you could guard a building for twentyfour hours without knowing whether it contained nuclear bombs or cases of underwear but now there was too much she didnt know the mystery at the heart of trinity was taking control of everyone and everything around it yet there was nothing she could do she had to talk to godin and he was incommunicado faced with this impasse she called ritter bock and told him to break contact with weiss the taciturn young german was needed back at the control center skow had ordered her to calm down and geli knew only one way to do that she needed to take some orders rather than give them chapter dreamless sleep evaporated in a rush of pounding blood and the memory of fielding lying dead in his office sunlight knifed through a crack in the curtains i had survived the night but still i reached beneath my pillow for my only then did i slap the top of my clock radio killing the alarm my phone had not rung during the night so the president hadnt tried to reach me i checked my answering machine in case i had slept through a call but there were no messages trying not to think about the implications of this i dialed lu li fieldings house a machine answered the taped message still had andrews voice on it brimming with humor hoping lu li was a hundred miles from chapel hill by now i hung up and carried my gun into the bathroom then locked the door behind me i shaved quickly a surveillance car had been parked nearby when i got home from fieldings house last night it pulled away as i approached after removing the sensitive items from my trunk i called rachel at home to be sure shed made it then i lay awake for two hours listening for the sounds of a breakin and thinking of fieldings pocket watch it had a dull gold case worn from rubbing and a yellowed face with roman numerals not the watch lu li had said the fob id asked fielding about the crystal on his watch chain once he told me a tibetan monk had given it to him near lhasa promising it would ensure an unfailing memory fielding bellylaughed when he told me that story but i hadnt gotten the joke now i did one new computer technology perfected by the trinity team was holographic memory storage rather than storing data in microchips trinity engineers stored it as holograms within the molecules of stable crystals using lasers to read and write data they could store enormous amounts of information within the crystals symmetrically arranged atoms the crystals i had seen in the trinity holography lab were the size of nfl footballs but i saw no reason that a smaller one could not be used like the one on fieldings watch chain somehow the englishman had been downloading trinity data into his crystal watch fob and because no one outside trinitys inner circle of scientists and engineers knew this was even possible fielding could walk it in and out of the building every day without anyone suspecting a thing but why would he steal information to sell to the highest bidder fielding was old school even if he were desperate for money he was the last person i would suspect of corporate espionage had he secretly embraced some ideology or abandoned one was he a politically naive scientist who believed all nations should share access to the latest technology possibly but i didnt think he would want a rogue nation to possess something as powerful as a trinity computer to hear fielding talk sometimes you would think he didnt want any country to possess one was that it had he been working to prevent trinity from becoming a reality that scenario seemed the most likely but i didnt have enough information to make an accurate guess and without the watch i couldnt prove anything i showered in nearscalding water then dressed in chinos and a sport jacket and walked quickly to my car trying not to think too much about what i was doing my primary goal in returning to trinity was to find fieldings pocket watch but in truth i saw little choice staying home would only invite closer nsa scrutiny and runningas i hoped lu li had donewould bring the full resources of the agency down upon me but if i could preserve the illusion of normalcy a little longeruntil the president got back to mei might be able to avenge fieldings death on a good traffic day the trinity complex was a twentyminute drive from my house in suburban chapel hill research triangle park the manicured haven of corporate research known locally as the rtp lay between raleigh and durham and was named for the triangle formed by duke university unc at chapel hill and north carolina state its quiet lanes led through expansive lawns that suggested an exclusive country club but instead of golf links the seventhousandacre rtp boasted labs owned by dupont m merck biogen lockheed and dozens of other bluechip names fortyfive thousand people reported to work within its borders every day but less than three hundred knew what lay behind the walls of the trinity building i drove slowly hoping in some juvenile way that i would never arrive at my destination the trinity lab stood two hundred yards back from an understated sign that read argus optical a forbidding fivestory block of steel and black glass it sat on sixty wooded acres with extensive subbasements and a heliport the steel and glass was just a shell constructed for show behind it hightech copper cladding codenamed tempest encased the inner building preventing electromagnetic radiation from passing in or out of trinity the same stuff protected the nsa operations buildings at fort meade because the building had been sited in a sort of bowl its first two floors lay out of sight the main entrance was on the third floor to reach it staff had to cross a roofed catwalk forty yards long inside a fortified archway at the far end they confronted a narrow passage guarded by a security officer and lined with sensitive metal detectors electronic bombsniffers and fluoroscope machines authorized entry required photo id a fingerprint scan and a mandatory search of all bags a sentry buzzed open the archway door and i walked up to the security desk my face revealing none of the anxiety i felt morning doc said a middleaged guard named henry i sometimes thought henry had been hired through central casting the other security personnel were all in their late twenties lean young men and women with smooth faces avian eyes and zero body fat only henry the gate man ever said a word of greeting good morning henry i said theres a meeting in the conference room at nine thanks you got four minutes i looked at my watch and nodded still cant get over professor fielding henry said they say he was dead before the ambulance got here i took a careful breath this exchange was being recorded by hidden cameras thats the way it goes sometimes with strokes not a bad way to go out quick i mean i forced a smile then laid the pad of my right forefinger on a small scanner after the unit beeped for a match i passed through the gauntlet of threatdetection equipment and took the stairs to the fifth floor which housed the administrative offices and conference room yellow police tape stretched across the closed door to fieldings office who had put it there surely the nsa hadnt allowed local or state police to enter this facility glancing up and down the empty corridor i quickly tried the knob locked and not with some lightweight mechanism from a hardware store if fieldings pocket watch was inside his office i couldnt get it i walked a few doors down to my own office closed the door and sat down at my primary computer part of a closed network that served only the trinity scientists it had no connection to the outside world to access the internet i had to use a second computer that had no ports or drives through which files could be exported from the building my primary screen showed one interoffice email a reminder of the meeting scheduled to begin in the conference room in two minutes with a macabre chill i realized that id halfexpected a humorous email from fielding he often sent me little jokes or ironic quotes from dead scientists or philosophers scientists over do more harm than goodt h huxleylike that but today there was no message and there would never be another i looked blankly around my office fielding was gone and i was profoundly disoriented together we had stopped project trinity for six tense weeks angering our colleagues while we tried in vain to discover the cause of the mri side effects experienced by the six trinity principals today that issue remained unresolved i hadnt volunteered to be scanned by the supermri unit out of stupidity the theory was simple since homo sapiens had evolved in the earths magnetic field an mris magnetic energy did not pose a health risk this had been proved countless times by conventional mri machines which generated fields thirty thousand times more powerful than that of the earth but the supermri developed at trinityusing superconductivity and colossal magnetsgenerated fields up to eight hundred thousand times greater than that of the earth gross side effects such as tissueheating had been solved in animal tests but within days after undergoing our superscans all of us had begun experiencing disturbing neurological symptoms jutta klein the designer of the supermri suffered shortterm memory loss ravi nara endured extreme sexual compulsions john skow developed hand tremors and godin himself had suffered epileptic seizures fielding had developed of all things a form of tourettes syndrome and frequently blurted out inappropriate words or phrases and i had narcolepsy ravi nara our nobelwinning neurologist could find no medical explanation for this sudden flurry of symptoms so all supermri scanning had temporarily been halted work on the trinity computer continued but with the supermri removed from the chain godins engineers had only the six original scans to work from and no one knew whether those were of sufficient resolution to make the leap into the prototype computer with nara at a loss fielding began investigating the side effects in his spare time six weeks later he suggested that they had been caused by a disruption of quantum processes in our brainsand backed up his theory with twenty pages of complex mathematics nara argued that nothing in the history of neuroscience suggested that the human brain carried out quantum processes only a few physicists subscribed to this new age theory of consciousnessroger penrose among themyet fielding toiled on trying to prove his theory peter godin initially supported fielding but before long he resumed mri testing on primates chimps and orangutans suffered no ill effects fielding argued that primates werent conscious in the human sense and thus their brains had no quantum processes to be disrupted godin ignored him i then reported fieldings suspicions to the president who officially suspended the project pending an exhaustive investigation of the side effects that was six weeks ago since then fielding and i had worked almost around the clock to prove his theory of quantum disturbance i felt like an assistant to albert einstein sharpening pencils and taking notes while the genius worked beside me yet despite fieldings formidable intellect he could not prove his theory too much remained unknown about the brain now he was dead and without a demonstrable link between the mri unit and our side effects i couldnt hope to hold back the collective tide of wills set on resuming the project without proof of foul play trinity would continue the battle would begin in minutes after a few hollow words of regret over fieldings untimely passing perspiration filmed my face as i walked toward the conference room door the room was empty i had never arrived first at a meeting the other principals were compulsively punctual i poured coffee from the urn on the credenza then sat at the far end of the table and tried to stay calm where the hell was everybody watching me from the security room where would they hide the camera behind a picture hanging to my right was a rare blackandwhite photograph of the core physicists of the manhattan project oppenheimer szilard fermi wigner edward teller they stood in a friendly knot before the oscura mountains of new mexico giants of science each destined for fame or infamy depending on ones point of view some like the hawkish teller had wound up wreathed in glory and the flag others were not so fortunate oppy was stripped by lesser men of the security clearance he needed to work and lived but a shadow of the life he might have had but in they stood together wearing dark european suits in the stark white sand of the desert they gazed over the trinity conference table like patron saints their eyes communicating an inscrutable combination of humor humility and hardwon wisdom the only trinity scientist who displayed those qualities had died yesterday on his office floor voices filtered from the hallway into the conference room i straightened in my chair as my colleagues began to trickle in with an air of forced casualness i had a feeling they had just adjourned a private meeting whose only order of business had been handling me first in line was jutta klein the teams sole woman chief research scientist for the siemens corporation in germany the grayhaired kleinalso a nobel laureate in physicshad been loaned to trinity for the duration of the project with assistance from fielding and a team of engineers from general electric she had designed and built the fourthgeneration supermri machine now she oversaw the smooth operation of the temperamental behemoth guten morgen she said stiffly and sat at my right her matronly face impossible to read morgen i replied ravi nara followed klein through the door he sat three chairs away from me emphasizing the distance that had recently marked our relationship the young indian neurologist held a chocolate doughnut in one brown hand but his right protruded from a cast i suppressed a smile four days ago he had taken a coffee mug partly made of metal into the supermri room and set it on a counter when klein activated the machine for a test on a chimpanzee the mug had flown across the room and smashed naras arm against the machines housing shattering his ulna klein told him to consider himself lucky on the day the supermri went operational a technician on loan from siemens had been killed by a metallic ekg cart that slammed her against the machine and crushed her skull good morning david i looked up to see the trim brooks brothersclad figure of john skow take the chair at the head of the table a deputy director of the nsa skow was americas foremost authority on information warfare and the titular director of project trinity yet it was peter godin who determined the direction and pace of trinity research the relationship between skow and godin mirrored that of general leslie groves and robert oppenheimer at los alamos groves had been a ruthless taskmaster but without oppenheimers cooperation he could never have delivered the atomic bomb so the ultimate power had lain with the civilian scientist not the soldier skow i said not even attempting a smile yesterday was a terrible blow to all of us he intoned in his aristocratic boston accent his thin lips barely moving but i know its a particular loss for you david i searched for genuine grief in his voice the nsa man was a practiced bureaucrat and his sincerity was hard to gauge peter will be here in a moment he said i guess hell be the tardy boy from now on i smiled inside in the past fielding had always been last to arrive when he bothered to show up at all some days he went awol and i would be sent in search of him i usually found him poring over equations in his office a faint curse drifted through the open door announcing peter godins approach trinitys lead scientist suffered from rheumatoid arthritis and merely walking was a burden to him on some days at seventyone years old godin was by far the senior scientist on the project vacuumtube computing machines had not even existed when he was born yet for the past forty years the old man of trinity had pushed the envelope of digital computing further and faster than any crtdazed savant who ever skateboarded out of silicon valley like seymour craythe father of the supercomputergodin had been one of the original engineers at control data systems in the early s in he left the company with seymour to help found cray research godin had been part of the teams that built the famed and the cray but when cray began to lose control of the bloated cray project godin decided the time had come to step out of his mentors shadow he quietly made the rounds of investment bankers raised million and sixty days later opened the doors of godin supercomputing in mountain view california while seymour struggled to bring the revolutionary cray into being godin and a tiny team built an elegant and reliable fourprocessor machine that outperformed the cray by a speed factor of six it wasnt a revolutionary advance but it was one government weapons labs were willing to pay for at million per machine godin quickly paid off his debts and began designing his dream supercomputer competing against national governments and seymour cray himself peter godin had gained a foothold in the supercomputing market and he never looked back when the end of the cold war virtually wiped out the supercomputing business godin switched to parallelprocessing technology and by the midnineties his computers had augmented or supplanted the cray machines at norad the nsa the pentagon los alamos lawrence livermore and in missile silos across the country in his day peter godin had been both pioneer and follower but he was first and foremost a survivor everyone looked up as the old man entered the conference room but i nearly got to my feet when i joined the team two years ago godin had looked scarcely older than andrew fielding who was sixtyone at the time but two years leading the trinity team had aged godin at a shocking rate his face sometimes had the swollen look of a cancer patient on steroids at other times it was thinned to skeletal hollowness and his hair almost disappeared today he looked as though he might collapse before reaching the table hed told me that during times of creative stress his body always underwent physical changes godin often worked without sleep for fifty or sixty consecutive hours and though he knew this was taking years off his life he felt that was a fair price to pay for what he had achieved during his years on earth his light blue eyes scanned the room resting longer on me than on the others then he gave a general nod and settled into the empty chair beside skow now that were all here skow said with an air of ceremony i would be remiss if i didnt begin this meeting with a few words about the terrible loss that we and this projectsuffered yesterday after a complete autopsy the pathologist has confirmed that dr fielding died of a massive cerebral hemorrhage he pathologist i cut in the state medical examiner skow gave me a look of forbearance david you know were not in a conventional security situation we cant involve local authorities dr fieldings cause of death was certified by an nsa pathologist at fort meade the nsa has a pathologist i understood why the agency might need psychiatrists codebreaking was a highstress profession but a pathologist the agency has access to a full complement of medical specialists skow said in the voice of a government tour guide some directly on the payroll others fully vetted consultants he glanced at godin whose eyes were closed do you have some doubt about what killed andrew david there it was the gauntlet on the table after all skow said in a condescending tone you are an experienced internist perhaps you saw something inconsistent with a stroke i felt the tension in the air everyone was waiting for me to speak especially ravi nara who had diagnosed the stroke as fielding died no i said at length ravi said he observed paralysis speech impairment and a blown pupil just prior to death thats consistent with stroke its just it usually takes a while to die from a bleed the suddenness took me by surprise it was as though the air had been let out of a balloon shoulders sagged with relief buttocks shifted position fingers began drumming on the table well of course skow said generously it took us all by surprise and andrew was quite simply irreplaceable i wanted to strangle skow he had wanted to replace fielding for the past six months but there was no one remotely as qualified as the englishman available for the job and to show how serious i am about that skow said we will not try to replace him only jutta klein looked as shocked as i fielding had known more about project trinity than anyone but godin hed got us through a dozen major bottlenecks problems that had stumped software and materials engineers for weeks were but puzzles to the eccentric englishman something to be solved in a quarter of an hour in this sense fielding truly was irreplaceable but the quantum aspects of project trinity could not be ignored quantum physics was akin to alchemy in my mindalchemy that workedand to push ahead without someone qualified to handle problems like quantum entanglement and unwanted tunneling would be madness but what do you plan to do about the mri side effects weve been studying i asked as you know fielding believed they were the result of quantum disturbances in the brain ridiculous barked nara theres no proof there are any quantum processes in the human brain there never has been and there never will be dr nara skow said i gave the neurologist a look of disdain you didnt sound half so sure when you were in the room with fielding nara shot silent daggers at me skow gave me his patient smile david both peter and i feel that you and ravi are quite capable of continuing to explore the medical anomalies bringing in a new physicist at this time would be a needless security risk i wasnt going to argue this i would save my efforts for the president will fieldings body and personal effects be turned over to his widow skow cleared his throat we cant seem to contact mrs fielding therefore andrews remains will be cremated as per his written wishes along with any evidence of murder i struggled to keep my face impassive so lu li had made her escape on the other hand would they say anything different if theyd caught or killed her godin touched skows wrist would you like to add something peter skow asked godin rubbed his nearly bald pate under the indirect lights he sat with a buddhalike centeredness only the blue eyes in detectable motion he spoke rarely but when he did the world listened this is no time to talk about trivialities he said we lost a giant yesterday andrew fielding and i disagreed about a lot of things but i respected him more than any man ive ever worked with i couldnt hide my surprise everyone at the table leaned forward so as not to miss a word the hypnotic blue eyes made a quick circuit of the room then godin continued his voice soft but still deep and powerful from the dawn of history the driving force of science has been war if he were here today fielding would argue with me he would say it is mankinds innate curiosity that has driven the upward surge of science but thats wishful thinking it is human conflict that has marked the great forward leaps in technology a regrettable reality but one that every rational person must recognize we live in a world of fact not philosophy philosophers question the reality of the universe then look surprised when you hit them with a shoe and ask if they felt that reality ravi nara snickered but godin gave him a withering glare andy fielding was not that sort godin nodded to the blackandwhite photo on the wall like robert oppenheimer andy was something of a mystic but at his core he was a gifted theoretician with a great practical bent godin brushed a wisp of white hair off his ear and looked around the table the weaponization of science is the inevitable first step that brings countless peacetime gifts in its wake oppenheimers superhuman efforts to give us the bomb ended the second world war and gave the world safe nuclear energy we herewe five who remainface a task of no lesser importance were not trying as fielding sometimes suggested to assume the mantle of god god is merely a part of the human brain an evolutionary coping mechanism that developed to make bearable our awareness of our own deaths when we finally succeed in loading the first neuromodel into our prototype and communicating with it we will have to deal with that part of the brain just as with all the rest for those who favor anthropomorphic expressions we will have to deal with him but god i predict will prove no more troublesome than any other vestigial element of the brain because the completion of trinity will render that particular coping mechanism unnecessary our work will end deaths dominion over humanity and surely there can be no more noble goal than that godin laid his crooked hands on the table but today today we mourn a man who had the courage of his convictions while we out of grim necessity focused on the military and intelligence possibilities of an operational trinity prototype fielding looked toward the day that he could sit down and ask the computer mans oldest questions how did life begin why are we here how will the universe end at sixtythree andy fielding had the enthusiasm of a child and he wasnt ashamed of it nor should he have been godin nodded soberly and i for one will miss him my face felt hot id expected the crocodile tears of john skow then a rush back to fullscale research and development but peter godin was classier than that his words showed that hed known his adversary well after the cause of our neurological symptoms has been found godin concluded the project will resume if we need another quantum physicist well hire one what we will not do is charge forward without knowing the dangers fielding taught me the importance of prudence godin carefully massaged his right hand with the fingers of his left weve all sustained a severe shock i want everyone to take three full days of rest beginning at lunch today well meet in this room on tuesday morning all the usual offsite security precautions will be observed during this period the resulting silence was total the man who drove himself twice as hard as anyone else was suggesting time off such a vacation went so against godins nature that no one knew what to say skow finally cleared his throat well i for one could use some time at home my wife is about ready to divorce me over the hours i put in here godin frowned and closed his eyes again meeting adjourned skow said glancing at godin the old man got unsteadily to his feet and walked out without another word well then skow said needlessly i stood and walked back to my office my eyes on peter godins retreating back the meeting had gone nothing like id expected ahead of me godin started to turn the corner but instead he stopped and turned to face me i walked toward him you and fielding were very close he said werent you i liked him admired him too godin nodded i read your book two nights ago youre more of a realist than i would have guessed your opinions on abortion fetal tissue research cloning the expenditures on lastyearoflife care euthanasia i agreed with all of it right down the line i couldnt believe peter godin had worked with me for two years without reading the book that had brought me to trinity he looked over my shoulder for a moment then back at my face something occurred to me during the meeting he said you know the old hypothetical about history if you could go back in time and you had the opportunity to kill hitler would you do it i smiled its not a very realistic formulation im not so sure the hitler question is easy of course but imagine it another way if you could go back to and you knew that nathuram godse was going to assassinate gandhiwould you kill him to prevent that assassination i thought about it youre really asking how far down the chain of events i would go would you murder hitlers mother it was godins turn to smile youre right of course and my answer is yes actually i think your question is more about causality would murdering hitlers mother have prevented the second world war or would some other nobody have risen from the discontented masses to tap german resentment over the versailles treaty godin considered this quite possibly all right then its and you know that a clumsy lab technician is going to ruin the cell cultures of jonas salk the cure for poliomyelitis will be greatly delayed perhaps by years would you kill that innocent technician a strange buzzing started in my head i had a sense that godin was toying with me yet peter godin never wasted time with games thankfully real life doesnt present us with those dilemmas i said only hindsight allows us to formulate them he smiled distantly im not so sure doctor hitler could have been stopped at munich godin reached out and patted me on the arm food for thought anyway he turned and carefully negotiated his way around the corner i stood in the corridor trying to read between the lines of what id heard godin never wasted words he hadnt been idly reflecting on history or morality he had been talking quite frankly about murder justifiable murder in his mind i shook my head in disbelief godin had been talking about fielding fieldings murder was necessary he was saying fielding was innocent but he was interfering with a great good and he had to be eliminated as i walked back toward my office i realized i was shivering no one had asked about my call to washington no one had mentioned my visit to fieldings house not one word about rachel weiss and three days off would give me plenty of time to speak to the president i might even be able to fly to washington what the hell was going on i froze in my office doorway a tall sinewy blonde woman with electric blue eyes and a stippled scar on her left cheek sat in my chair gazing at my computer screen geli bauer if anyone in this building had murdered andrew fielding it was she hello doctor she said a trace of a smile on her lips you look surprised i thought youd be expecting me chapter i stood speechless in my office doorway relief had turned to paralyzing anxiety in less than a second and the fact that geli bauer was a woman did nothing to slow my racing pulse like her handpicked subordinates she was lean and hard with a predatory gleam in her eyes she radiated the icy confidence of a worldclass alpinist i could imagine her hanging for hours from a precipice her body supported only by her fingertips her intelligence was difficult to judge in an incubator filled with geniuses but i knew from previous conversation that she was quick as mercury she treated all but the top trinity scientists like prisoners working under duress and i attributed this to her being the daughter of a powerful army general ravi nara had crudely called her a terminator with tits but i thought of her as a terminator with brains what can i do for you i said finally i need to ask you a couple of questions she said routine stuff routine geli bauer had visited my office a half dozen times in two years i mostly saw her through a sheet of glass observing the polygraph tests to which i was randomly subjected godin just gave us three days off i told her why dont we do this when i get back im afraid it cant wait she had the stateless accent of elite overseas schools you said it was routine a plastic smile why dont you have a seat doctor youre in my chair geli didnt get up she thrived on conflict you dont usually handle this kind of thing personally i said to what do i owe the honor dr fieldings death has created an unusual situation we need to be sure we know as much as possible about the circumstances surrounding it dr fielding died of a stroke she studied me for a while without speaking her scar on her left cheek reminded me of some id seen in some vietnam vets during physicals the vets described how shrapnel from a phosphorous grenade burned itself deep into the skin and then selfcauterized only to reignite in the air and wound the operating surgeons when they attempted to remove the fragments soldiers lived in terror of them and geli bauer looked as though shed suffered intimate contact with one i had been predisposed to like her because of that scar a beautiful woman marked by such a thing might have earned some insight about life that few of her sisters possessed but my interactions with geli had convinced me that whatever hell she had survived shed learned only bitterness im concerned about your relationship with dr fielding she said always i with geli never the bureaucratic we as though she felt personal responsibility for the security of the entire project really i said as though shocked how would you characterize your relationship he was my friend you saw him and spoke to him outside this facility to concede this was to admit a violation of trinity security regulations but geli probably had videotape yes thats a direct violation of security protocol i rolled my eyes sue me we could jail you shit thatll really help keep this place secret she ran her long fingers through her blonde hair i thought of a hawk preening itself you could lose your position here doctor now i get it youre here to fire me her smile slipped a notch theres no need for drama im trying to learn what i can about dr fieldings situation his situation hes dead deceased no longer with us what did the two of you discuss outside work hours soccer soccer fielding called it football he was football mad in his words he followed arsenal an english team it bored the hell out of me but i liked talking to the guy youre being disingenuous doctor am i both you and dr fielding opposed further work on this project no i had ethical concerns about one aspect of it fielding had other concerns he wanted the project stopped only until the cause of the neurological side effects were all experiencing could be determined did he discuss those side effects with anyone not cleared for trinity information i have no idea his wife for example i strained to keep my face impassive i cant imagine that he would geli raised one eyebrow you spent nearly with her last night so they had been watching of course they had theyd just killed fielding and they needed to see how his best friend would react that meant they knew about rachel i made a condolence call you discussed sensitive trinity information with lu li fielding a chinese physicist i did nothing of the kind i had thought lu lis marriage to fielding made her a british citizen but i didnt want to get into that discussion now mrs fielding has vanished we need to talk to her sounds like a personal problem geli ignored my sarcasm if you helped her flee you could be charged with treason has lu li committed a crime gelis face gave away nothing that has yet to be determined she may be an accessory to treason the crystal i thought suddenly this has to be about fieldings watch so both fieldings are missing now thats embarrassing isnt it geli didnt look embarrassed she looked unflappable last night lu li told me shed received no word about her husbands body i said she was very upset thats not my area of responsibility what about fieldings personal effects lu li particularly mentioned a gold pocket watch an heirloom geli pursed her lips then shook her head i dont recall a pocket watch but as soon as mrs fielding turns up this will be sorted out i knew geli was lying she hadnt worked here for two years without seeing that watch a hundred times were going to need a polygraph this morning she said a cold sweat broke out on my trunk sorry i wont be taking one her eyes narrowed this was the first time id ever refused such a request why is that i just lost a good friend i didnt sleep well i feel terrible my dog ate my homework dr tennant and i dont feel like submitting to your fascist bullshit today get it she settled back in my chair and regarded me with increasing interest the employment agreement you signed permits polygraphs to be taken at any time youve already agreed to submit the fear in my belly made me want to punch her in the face id lived all my life with an extraordinary amount of freedom as an internist id owned and managed my own practice as an author id been limited only by my subject but in the oppressive atmosphere of trinity id developed a kind of spiritual claustrophobia my father had experienced similar feelings when working on nuclear weapons at los alamos and oak ridge and hed submitted to his share of polygraph tests in his day but times had changed since the cold war today the nsa had lie detectors based on mri technology and unlike conventional polygraphs they were accurate percent of the time the principle was simple it took more brain cells to lie than to tell the truth even a pathological liar first thought of the true answer when asked a question then he invented or recited his lie that activity lit up a liars brain like christmas lights and the mri detected imaged and recorded the result for his interrogators it was fielding whod stopped the mri polygraph tests arguing that our strange symptoms could be aggravated by further mri exposure it was a victory in fieldings war against the invasion of our privacy but conventional polygraph sessions were unnerving enough taking them on a surprise basis gave you the feeling you were living in an orwellian dystopia especially when you had something to hide are you going to sedate me i asked tie me down geli looked as though shed like to no then forget it she raised a finger and idly touched her scar i dont understand why youre so combative doctor sure you do youre hiding something if i were that would make two of us youre trying to subvert this project how could i do that and why would i the projects already been suspended geli studied her fingernails two of which were gnawed to nubs maybe she wasnt unflappable after all by going public she said finally there it was the deepest fear of the paranoid military mind i havent done that are you considering it no have you spoken to the president in my life annoyance crept into her voice at last since dr fieldings death no but you left a message at the white house yesterday i felt my face flush yes and you used a pay phone yes why the battery on my cell phone died an easy lie and impossible to check why not wait and call when you got home i was in the mood right then in the mood to talk to the president of the united states thats right about dr fieldings death among other things she seemed to weigh her next words carefully you told the white house you didnt want the other trinity principals informed of your call my blood pressure dropped like a stone how did they know what id said during that pay phone conversation it had to be wiretapping surveillance and not the local police or fbi variety the nsa recorded millions of private telephone calls every day the disk drives in the basements of fort meade triggered by key words like plastique al qaeda strong encryption rdx or even trinity i recalled that id said trinity as soon as the white house operator answered to make her switch me to the proper contact the nsa probably had a recording of my conversation from that point forward i drew myself up and looked geli hard in the eyes i was personally appointed to this project by the president not by the nsa or john skow or even peter godin im here to evaluate ethical problems if i determine that a problem exists i report directly to the president no or here has any say in the matter the gloves were off i had just drawn a line between myself and everyone else in the trinity building geli leaned forward her blue eyes challenging me how many cell phones do you own dr tennant one do you have others in your possession clarity settled in my mind like a resolving chord they knew id called the white house but they didnt know whether or not the president had gotten back to me they had my phones coveredthe ones they knew aboutbut they were worried about channels of communication they didnt know about if they were worried about that they had no inside line to the president and i still stood a chance of convincing him of my suspicions rachel weiss owns a cell phone bauer said her eyes alert for the slightest reaction on my part i took a slow breath and kept my voice even i dont know a doctor who doesnt but you know dr weiss rather better than you know almost anyone else shes my psychiatrist if thats what you mean shes the only person other than trinity personnel to whom youve spoken more than fifty words over the past two months i wondered if this was true the same is true for dr weiss geli said what do you mean she sees no one she lost her son to cancer last year after the boy died her husband left her and returned to new york six months ago dr weiss began accepting occasional dates with male colleagues dinner a movie like that she never saw anyone more than twice two months ago she stopped seeing men altogether of course this didnt surprise me rachel was an intense woman and i couldnt imagine many men meeting her expectations yeah so i said i think youre the reason for that doctor i think dr weiss is in love with you i laughed really laughed for the first time since id seen fieldings body dr weiss thinks im delusional ms bauer possibly schizophrenic this didnt faze geli she kissed you last night at the fielding house that was a sympathy kiss i was upset about fielding geli ignored this what have you told dr weiss about project trinity nothing as you well know im sure youve found some way to record every one of my sessions she surprised me by conceding this with a slight nod but lovers are resourceful you may have managed unauthorized contact like last night last night was the first time i ever saw rachel weiss outside her office i folded my arms across my chest and i refuse to discuss her further she has nothing to do with this project youre invading the privacy of an american citizen who has signed no agreement waiving her rights this time when geli smiled a little flash of cruelty burned through where project trinity is concerned privacy means nothing under national security directive we can detain dr weiss for fortyeight hours without even a phone call my frustration boiled over geli do you know what project trinity is my use of her first name wiped away her smile but my question put her squarely on the defensive it would kill her to admit that she didnt know the inmost details of trinity but to say otherwise might cost her job she glowered but said nothing i took a step toward her well i do know and until you doand you fully understand its implications dont be so damn eager to follow orders like a good little german the insult struck home geli tensed in the chair as though about to spring at me i took a step back instantly regretting my words there was nothing to be gained by earning the personal enmity of geli bauer in fact it was a singularly bad idea she had probably killed fielding herself and thats why im baiting her i realized were done i said taking my car keys from my pocket ill be back on tuesday morning keep your human dobermans away from me until then i turned my back on her dr tennant i kept walking tennant i pressed the elevator button when the door opened i got in then stepped out again geli could probably turn the tiny cubicle into a cell with the push of a button she could seal the entire building just as easily but i took the stairs anyway as i hit the fourthfloor landing an image of fielding sitting in a cloud of smoke filled my mind the englishman smoked like a chimney but smoking was forbidden everywhere in the trinity complex even for the top scientists this wasnt due to federal regulations peter godin couldnt stand a hint of smoke in the air ever resourceful fielding had found a place where he could indulge his habit in the materials lab on the second floor was a large vacuum chamber that had been used during the projects early stages for testing the properties of carbon nanotubes there were smoke detectors in the lab but none in the vacuum chamber fielding had managed to pile enough boxes around the chamber that most people had forgotten its existence when i couldnt locate him anywhere else id always known i could find him there if fielding were in the trinity building and afraid for his life i reasoned wouldnt he have tried to distance the crystal watch fob from himself he wouldnt hide it in his office which would certainly be searched but the vacuum chamber was only one floor away and he could be fairly sure that i would eventually search his informal sanctum sanctorum i exited the stairwell and made my way down the hall to the materials lab two engineers recruited from sun microsystems walked out of the lab and separated to pass me heading toward the elevators i forced a smile then slowed my walk so that i would reach the materials lab after they rounded the corner behind me the lab was empty i moved swiftly to the pile of boxes that obscured the steel vacuum chamber and began uncovering the door the forbidding machine was like a large decompression chamber for scuba divers with a porthole window and a large iron wheel set in its hatchlike door i turned the wheel that unlocked that hatch the lights came on automatically my heart thudded when i stepped inside i remembered wide shelves cluttered with tools clamps and old scraps of carbon there was nothing in the chamber now even the shelves were gone the entire floor looked as though it had been steam cleaned geli bauer i breathed if fieldings pocket watch had been hidden here she had it now i hurried out of the chamber halfexpecting her to confront me in the lab but the lab was still as was the hall slipping back into the stairwell i descended to the third floor and walked toward the security desk where henry awaited me upon exiting trinity staff had to submit to a body search to prove they werent trying to remove computer disks or papers from the building how fielding must have laughed inside every time henry ignored his crystal watch fob as i approached the desk i realized that henry was speaking into his collar radio whats up henry i said pausing to wait for his patdown just a minute doc my heartbeat accelerated i imagined geli bauer giving him orders dont let tennant out of the building i really need to get moving i said i have an appointment henry looked at me then said into the mike hes right here jesus if geli had to ask if i was at the door that meant she wasnt watching me on camera from the security office she was probably on her way here my limbic brain was telling me to run like hell but how far would i get harmlesslooking henry was armed with a mm glock automatic still it took a supreme act of will not to bolt for the door henry listened to his earbud for a few seconds looking confused are you sure he asked all right he came around the desk and i suddenly knew that if henry reached for his gun survival instinct would dictate the next few seconds i tensed for action when his hands dropped but then he squatted and began his normal patdown starting with my pant legs geli had decided to let me go why because she cant be sure whether ive talked to the president good to go doc henry said patting me on the shoulder for a second i thought shei mean they wanted me to hold you here as i looked into henrys face i saw something in his eyes that i didnt understand then i did he didnt like geli bauer any more than i did in fact he was afraid of her the minute i cleared the armoredglass doors my cell phone began ringing i hit send and held the phone to my ear hello david where the hell have you been dont say your name i snapped recognizing rachels voice ive been trying to reach you for an hour no cellular transmissions could pass through the copper cladding that encased the trinity building just tell me whats wrong did you come to my office this morning your office of course not why because someone practically tore it to pieces your file is missing and everythings out of place i sucked in a lungful of air and forced myself to keep walking toward my car i havent been near your office today why do you think id do something like that to bolster your delusions in my eyes to make me think theyre real she sounded close to hysteria had she understood nothing last night we need to talk but not like this are you at your office now no im on highway rachel could take all the way from the duke medical center to chapel hill are you in a cab no i went and got my car this morning meet me where you saw me making the videotape you mean you know where im on my way hang up now she did it took all my selfcontrol not to run the last few steps to my car chapter rachels white saab was parked in front of my house rachel herself was sitting on my front steps her chin in her hands like a college girl waiting for a class to begin instead of her usual silk blouse and skirt she wore blue jeans and a white cotton oxford shirt i tapped my horn she looked up unsmiling waving once i pulled into my garage and walked through the house to open the front door sorry you got here first i said glancing up the street for unfamiliar vehicles her eyes were red from crying she went into the living room but didnt sit instead she paced around my sparse furniture unable to remain still tell me what happened i said she paused long enough to fix me with a glare then continued pacing i was at the hospital checking on a patient who attempted suicide two days ago and i decided to run by my office and dictate some charts when i got there i realized someone else had been there i mean the office was locked but i could tell you know you said the place was torn to pieces she averted her eyes not exactly but lots of things were out of place i know because i like my things a certain way books arranged from small to large papers stacked never mind youre obsessivecompulsive her dark eyes flashed there are worse problems than having ocd agreed you said my file was missing yes any other patient records missing no thats it then what i dont understand is why they would steal my file why not just photocopy it im sure theyve read it before they probably read it every week rachel stopped pacing and looked at me in disbelief how could they do that by sneaking someone into your office probably the nights of my appointment days why didnt i notice anything before maybe this time they were in a hurry why theyre frightened of what me of what ive done what i might do she sat on the edge of my sofa as though to collect herself i need to be clear on this david just who is they the nsa yes and no theyre the security people for project trinity which is funded by the nsa and this is who you say murdered andrew fielding yes she closed her eyes i had a friend at the medical center test that white powder you gave me its not contaminated with anthrax or any other known pathogen or poison her eyes opened and looked into mine its sand david gypsum white sand no threat to anybody my mind began spinning with the possible significance of that microchips were made of silicon a kind of sand was gypsum the basis of some new semiconductor godin had discovered maybe fielding was trying to tell me something like that without being overt have you tried to reach the president again rachel asked i opened my mouth in surprise what i forgot to check my answering machine excuse me i went to the kitchen the machines led showed one message waiting when i hit the button a new england accent crackled from the tiny speaker dr tennant this is ewan mccaskell the presidents chief of staff i remember you from your visit a couple of years ago i just received your message im sure you understand that were very busy over here i cant involve the president until i know what this is about but i do want to talk to you as soon as possible please remain at this number and ill call back as soon as time permits my relief was almost overwhelming i put my hand on the counter to steady myself the caller id unit showed that mccaskells call had come in twenty minutes ago who was that rachel asked i replayed the message for her i have to admit she said that sounded like ewan mccaskell like him that was him didnt you understand anything you saw last night she pulled a chair away from the kitchen table and sat in front of me listen to me david do you know why im here why i helped you last night tell me your book my book yes every day in the hospital i see things they never told me about in medical school cases that fall into the cracks between reality and legality dilemmas the government hasnt got the guts to face i do what i can about them maybe i complain to another doctor but thats it you wrote it down for the world to read without giving a damn what would happen to you abortion lastyearoflife care versus prenatal care euthanasia my god you wrote about assisting your own brother to die i closed my eyes and saw an image of my older brother unable to move anything but his eyelids due to the ravages of als then unable to move even those wed made a pact at that point i would help him end what remained of his life i nearly left that out i said she gripped my forearm but you didnt you took the risk and you helped countless people by leaving it in people youll never know but they know you i know you and now youre ill youve needed help for months and conventional therapy wasnt working i couldnt break through the walls youd put up her hand tightened on my arm and she smiled encouragingly i believe youre involved in some kind of special work okay but tell me this if the trinity computer is all you say it is then why you you know you wrote a great book the president knew your brother but does that qualify you to make judgments about the kind of science youve told me about she was right there was more to it id kept my past secret for so long that to speak of it now required a surprising act of will my father was a nuclear physicist i said softly he worked at los alamos during the war he was the youngest physicist to work on the manhattan project her dark eyes flashed go on my undergraduate degree is in theoretical physics mit my god i really know nothing about you do i i touched her shoulder sure you do look my father was part of the group that began to protest using the bomb leo szilard eugene wigner those guys the germans had surrendered and the japanese just didnt have the resources to build an atomic bomb my fathers group wanted our bomb demonstrated for the japanese army not used on civilians their dissent was ignored and hiroshima became history but we live in a different world now once the president realized the implications of trinitywere talking about liberating human intelligence from the body for gods sakehe knew hed be vulnerable politically if the public learned hed gone ahead without concern for ethics or morality look at the craziness that surrounds cloning and fetal tissue research so he demanded ethical oversight he knew my book he knew the public trusts me to tell the truth and he trusted me because hed known my brother beyond that my pedigree for conscientious objection went back to my father and the manhattan project so who better than i rachel was shaking her head why did you become a doctor rather than a physicist she couldnt stop being a shrink or maybe she was just being a woman after hiroshima my dad led a troubled life edward teller was gearing up to build the hydrogen superbomb oppenheimer opposed it so did my father dad requested a transfer general groves didnt want to release him from weapons work but they agreed to give him a more technical job one more removed from the actual warheads they moved him to the national lab at oak ridge tennessee why didnt he just quit altogether eventually he did but this was the cold war there were different kinds of pressure then oppenheimer was persecuted for years for his opposition to the hydrogen bomb dad also met my mother at oak ridge things were better there they had my brother i was born much later an accident really i smiled at the memory of my parents revealing this fact to me i grew up in oak ridge but when i was a teenager dad quit nuclear physics and moved us to huntsville alabama so he could work on the space program i still dont see the medical connection my mother was a pediatrician in oak ridge she did a lot of good it didnt take a genius to see that she was a lot happier in her work than my dad had been thats what influenced me i glanced down at the phone willing it to ring again last night i only told you part of the truth when the president offered me this position it felt oddly like poetic justice i was being given the opportunity my father never had at los alamos the chance to exercise some control over a great undertaking that was likely to change the world forever for good or evil i sensed that that the day i visited the oval office and thats what put me here rachel took a deep breath and slowly blew out the air its all real isnt it trinity i mean yes and im damned glad mccaskell called me back we need the president badly i stood up half wanting to replay mccaskells message but a wave of fatigue rolled through me i hoped it was just exhaustion but then the familiar highpitched ringing began in my back teeth remembering i had no amphetamines left i took a can of mountain dew out of the fridge popped it open and drank a long pull for the caffeine david rachel was watching me strangely are you all right you look shaky i may go out i said taking another gulp of the soda go out her eyes widened narcolepsy shed never witnessed one of my episodes as i nodded a shadow seemed to pass over my eyes it left me with a vague feeling of threat as though someone were in the room with us there but unseen im missing something i thought aloud what are you talking about an image of geli bauer came into my mind were in danger rachel looked worried more about me than any external threat what kind of danger theres something about the way all this is happening godin giving us time off my chart being stolen from your office mccaskells call im missing something but im too tired to think of what i thought mccaskells call was good news it is its just as drowsy as i was i felt a desperate need to have my gun in my hand i want you to do me a favor wait here for two minutes what worry darkened her eyes where are you going to my neighbors house i hurried to the back door david what if you pass out dont answer the door i called but if the phone rings answer it and say ill be right back i ran outside and crashed through the thick hedges that bordered the backyards of the houses on my street i sprinted the length of three backyards then cut back through the hedge behind a neighbors utility shed i had slipped out of my house last night about am and i had hidden fieldings box beneath it inside the box were fieldings electronic gadgets my partially recorded videotape fieldings letter and my pistol i got on my knees and retrieved the box then crawled back through the hedge and sprinted back to my own yard by the time i reached it i felt like a drunk running through an unfamiliar city rachel was waiting just inside the back door thats the stuff from last night she said why do you need that i tilted the box so she could see the gun she stepped back david youre scaring me you need to get out of here youll be fine for the time it takes me to tell my story to mccaskell i set the box on the floor put the gun in my waistband then led her to the front of the house spend the rest of the day somewhere public like a mall dont go home until you hear from me she pivoted and stopped me from pushing her toward the door her assertiveness seemed to bring us eye to eye stop this youre so out of it right now you could shoot yourself by accident i started to reply but my words went spinning off into the dark edges of my mind i would be unconscious in less than a minute im about to go under she grabbed my arm and dragged me into the hall looking for a place to lay me down i pointed to the door of my guest bedroom sensing that i was about to faint she rushed me through the door and let me fall facedown across the mattress do you have any medication i ran out her footsteps moved away i heard cabinet doors banging then rachels voice talking to herself when the voice seemed closer i managed to roll over there was a dark silhouette in the doorway coffees brewing rachel said youre still awake sort of she watched me like someone observing an animal during an experiment theres no food in your kitchen nothing but rockhard saltines when was the last time you went to the market i couldnt remember the last few weeks had been an endless parade of hours working with fielding on experiments i barely understood rachel sat on the bed and put her fingers against my carotid artery her fingertips were cool i was like that for a while she said looking at her watch her lips moved slightly as she counted pulse beats after i lost my son not going to the market i mean not paying bills not bathing i guess it takes a man longer to get back to those kinds of things in the end i used those small chores to enforce some order in my life it kept me from going completely mad i felt my lips smile i liked that she didnt let psychiatry get in the way of using words like mad i also liked the way her fingers felt against my neck i wanted to tell her something about her touch it reminded me of someone but i couldnt think who whens your birthday she asked i couldnt remember david a black wave rolled over me covering me in darkness im walking up a suburban sidewalk studying the perfect houses in their perfect rows its willow street i live on willowsleep on it anywaybut it has little in common with the street i lived on as a boy on willow street i dont know my neighbors well and some not at all the nsa told me not to make friends and that has turned out to be easy on willow street no one makes an effort in oak ridge the houses were smaller but i could name everyone who lived in them my little neighborhood was a world unto itself filled with faces i knew like those of my own family on willow street the children stay inside more than outside the fathers dont cut the lawns hired men do in oak ridge the fathers cared for their lawns like little fiefdoms spent hours discussing various mowers and fertilizers with each other i walk around a curve and see my own house white with green trim from the outside it looks like a home but its never felt like home to me a black labrador retriever lopes across the street without its master a rare sight here a lexus rolls toward me slowing as it passes i wave at its driver a tall imperious woman she stares at me as if im a dangerous interloper i cross the street and walk up to my front door my hand goes into my pocket for my key then to the doorknob i insert something into the lock but its not my key its thin and metallic like a file i jiggle it in the lock theres a moment of resistance then the lock gives i open the door slip inside and quickly close it behind me my hand digs into my other pocket brushing against something cold my fingers close around wood and my hand emerges gripping the butt of a gun an automatic i dont recognize the weapon from my other pocket i withdraw a perforated silencer and slowly screw it onto the gun barrel it seats itself with satisfying finality from the hallway i hear a tinkle of glass someones in the kitchen i take one careful step forward testing the floorboards then begin to walk i snapped awake in panic and jerked my pistol from my waistband a revolver not an automatic and no silencer i wanted to call out to rachel but i suppressed the urge in a single motion i rolled off the bed landed on my feet and moved to the bedroom door at first i heard only a soft humming in a female register the tune sounded like california by joni mitchell the hardwood floor of the hallway creaked i drew a silent breath and held it the floor creaked again someone was passing my door from right to left i closed my eyes and waited another creak i counted slowly to ten then i reached down with my free hand and slowly turned the knob when it had turned far enough i yanked open the door leapt into the hall and aimed my to the left a longhaired blond man stood six feet away his arms extended through the kitchen door i couldnt see his hands but i knew they held a gun i pulled the trigger there was no boom or kick id forgotten to cock the hammer so the doubleaction trigger only went halfway back as i jerked it home the blond man whirled and a silenced automatic whipped into view its bore black and bottomless then my trigger broke and an orange flash illuminated the hallway i blinked against it and when i opened my eyes the blond man was gone a woman was screaming an ice pick through my eardrums i looked down the blond man lay on the floor blood pouring from his skull i moved forward and stepped on the wrist of the hand holding the gun the screaming wouldnt stop i glanced to my right rachel was standing with her back against the sink her face deathly gray her mouth open wide stop it i yelled stop her mouth remained open but the scream died i pulled the automatic from the blond mans hand then checked his brachial pulse thready the bullet had entered the skull just above the right ear his gray eyes were glazed both pupils fixed and dilated leaning down i saw exposed brain matter he wouldnt last five minutes i sensed more than saw rachel moving looking up i saw her holding the kitchen telephone preparing to dial put that down im calling for paramedics he doesnt have a chance you dont know that of course i do examine him if you dont believe me i straightened up even if he did we couldnt risk it what what do you mean who do you think this is some street punk a crackhead breaking into my house in broad daylight look at him rachel glanced down for perhaps a second i dont know who he is do you know him as i stared down at the ruined young face i realized that i did at least id seen him before not often but i had passed him in the parking lot at trinity a tall lanky blond with the look of someone youd meet on a mountain trail in europe like geli bauer he had the physique of a climber or an elite soldier i do know him he works for geli bauer rachel squinted in confusion whos that shes trinity shes godin shes the nsa i laid both guns on the kitchen counter someone ordered her to take me out too you too apparently something in me still resisted the idea that peter godin had ordered my death yet nothing at trinity happened without his approval we have to call the police rachel said well be all right he was about to shoot me this was selfdefense or justifiable homicide whatever they call it the police you cant call local police to investigate the nsa i told you that why not he was going to kill me thats a state crime i almost laughed the nsa is the largest and most secret intelligence agency in the united states everything they do is classified it would take a court order to get a cop past the front gate at fort meade this isnt fort meade to the nsa it is look until i talk to the president were on our own do you understand she looked down at the growing pool of blood maybe he is a street punk dont you get it this is why they stole my file from your office what they already knew they were going to kill you she opened her mouth but said nothing otherwise they would have photocopied the file and left it in place they wanted nothing left in your office for the durham police to connect you to the project she was shaking her head but my logic was difficult to refute i stuck the automatic into my waistband and picked up my we have to get out of here fast there could be others close by her eyes went wide others suddenly i saw it all the xsa taps my phones when they heard ewan mccaskell leave his message they knew i hadnt spoken to the president yet thats all they were waiting for i was too excited to see the implications i grasped her hand it was cold and limp we have to run rachel right now if we dont well die here run where anywhere nowhere we have to disappear no we havent done anything wrong that doesnt matter i pointed at the man on the floor and saw that he was no longer breathing do you think that corpse is one of my hallucinations you killed him she said in the voice of a child and id do it again he was about to fire a bullet into your head she wobbled on her feet i steadied her then led her to the guest bedroom where id lain unconscious only minutes ago stay here i have to get something i tried to put my in her hand but she recoiled keep it i insisted closing her fingers around it if you leave this house alone youll be killed she stared holloweyed at me i took the silenced automatic from my waistband and checked to make sure the safety was off promise me you wont leave i wont leave she said dully i left the guestroom and raced upstairs my bedroom was on the left side of the landing on the right was a bedroom i used for storage i pulled an old chair into the closet of that room and stood on it with my arms stretched high i could just reach the plywood panel that gave access to the attic i pushed out the wooden square then lifted myself by main strength and wedged my body through the space standing halferect to avoid the roofing nails jutting down from above i balanced on two rafters and looked around to get my bearings enough light was showing through the eaves and vents to show my way i crept twenty feet to my left and knelt lying on pink fiberglass insulation were a hammer and crowbar id left there four weeks ago as though dropped carelessly i picked them up and moved quickly to an area floored with quarterinch plywood jamming the crowbar into a seam between two pieces of wood i hammered it deeper then leaned heavily on the bar the plywood splintered i shoved the end of the bar through the resulting hole then jerked upward ripping open a twofoot section of wood from the dark cavity below i removed a small nylon gym bag and unzipped it the light filtering through the eaves illuminated the rectangular outlines of a passport and two thick bundles the bundles were stacks of hundreddollar bills twenty thousand dollars worth five weeks ago when fielding told me i needed to cache a bag like this id laughed at him but he had known this day would come zipping the bag shut i crabwalked across the rafters to the access hole then dropped the bag onto the closet floor my arms quivered from strain as i lowered myself back down to the chair and pulled the plywood square back over the opening when my feet hit the floor an image of rachel running from the house in panic filled my mind i grabbed the bag and ran downstairs she was still sitting on the bed her eyes blank with shock time to go i told her are you ready she blinked but said nothing i took her free hand and pulled her to her feet i need you to keep it together for five minutes after that you can collapse if you need to here we go i led her through the hall and kitchen to the laundry room which opened into the garage leaving her there i retrieved fieldings box from the back door then returned and took my back from her hold this i said giving her the box wait here till i call for you without pausing long enough for fear to take hold i threw open the door from the house to the garage and charged through with the automatic extended traversing it right and left to cover all angles of fire the garage looked empty i made a quick circuit of my acura then dropped to my knees and looked beneath it come on i shouted hurry rachels shoes hissed on the smooth cement i opened the passenger door for her then took fieldings box and set it on the backseat if anything bads going to happen its going to happen right now i said getting behind the wheel get down in your seat she slid to the floor the top of her head showed above the doorframe i pushed it down then started the engine and put the car in reverse stay down i touched the remote control clipped to my visor the garage door motor groaned above us and the wide white door began to rise with the killers gun clenched in my hand i watched for the silhouette of legs in the growing rectangle of sunlight i saw nothing the instant the garage door cleared roof height i gunned the engine the acura shot backward over the cement and into blinding sunlight i hit the remote to lower the garage door then spun the wheel left i didnt touch the brake until the car was pointed up willow street whats happening rachel cried alarmed by my sudden stop stay down id planned to drive calmly if the street was clear but as we stopped i could almost feel an unseen marksman taking aim i shifted into drive floored the accelerator and fishtailed up willow leaving six feet of rubber on the pavement behind us chapter in the trinity buildings control center geli bauer stood absolutely still and spoke into her headset we heard a shot in tennants house isnt that what you expected skow asked idiot no ritter had a silenced weapon and tennant was carrying his gun last night right skow processed this in silence that doesnt mean ritter failed no in fact i cant imagine a scenario like that good what do you want to do geli had always pegged skow as a theoretical warrior and now that bullets were flying he was looking to her for guidance i pulled my other assets back so nothing would look suspicious but if i dont get confirmation of success within five minutes im putting in a team to check things out you have cover a carpetservice truck is there any chance the shot might have been reported to local police some if a patrol car shows up before weve cleared the scene use your nsa credentials to quarantine the house skow finished showing some balls at last then contact me immediately i will im out wait what is it geli was tired of being in the dark tennant asked me about the pocket watch what pocket watch her bullshit detector pegged the meter i checked the storage room this morning fieldings personal effects everything was there except his pocket watch skow was silent for a time then he spoke almost to himself fielding must have told him something about it you want to tell me something about it that knowledge isnt necessary for you to do your job anger flashed through her if its on tennants mind it may be important it is important just not to you keep me posted on the situation at the house skow hung up geli sat in her chair she hated the mushroom treatment but that was the nature of intelligence work keep them in the dark and feed them bullshit she understood the value of compartmentalizing knowledge and for the past two years she hadnt really needed to know what the scientists were working on but things had changed since the projects suspension peter godin had been spending a great deal of time away supposedly visiting his corporate headquarters in california geli no longer believed that sometimes godin took ravi nara with him and that made no sense nara had nothing to do with godin supercomputing and godin didnt even like the neurologist now godin had dropped off the face of the earth had fieldings pocket watch gone with him how could the watch be so important when fielding first came to work at trinity an nsa engineer had disassembled the pocket watch to be sure it contained no datarecording device hed pronounced the watch clean it was disassembled again this year on a day chosen at random the watch was clean again so why had it been taken from the storeroom geli pictured the watch in her mind a heavy gold case scarred from use there was a chain attached and a crystal on the end of the chain but the crystal was transparent nothing could be hidden inside that at least nothing she knew about her direct line to the nsa flashed red she routed the call to her headset bauer jim conklin here conklin was her main contact in crypto city at fort meade what is it were still running those intercepts on the pay phones around andrew fieldings house all pay phones within three miles twentyfour hours a day you never rescinded the order i never meant to well with all the intercepts were doing for the antiterror effort were running a few days behind on screening for voiceprint matches gelis heartbeat quickened you have something andrew fielding made a call four days ago from a servicestation convenience store i think youll want to hear it can you send me the audio file sure ill use webworld webworld was the nsas secure intranet and geli was one of the few outsiders linked to it you want the spectrograms of the matches no i know fieldings voice two minutes geli clicked off looked at her watch then said jpeg fielding andrew a photo of fielding filled her computer screen the whitehaired englishman had an angular handsome face that bloomed red in the cheeks fielding had liked his gin but it was his eyes that got you sparkling blue they held a childish mischief that almost blinded you to the deep intelligence beneath it as geli looked into those eyes she realized how formidable an adversary fielding was he might be dead but he was still controlling events an audio file icon popped onto the corner of her screen the nsa was nothing if not efficient she was about to open it when her headset beeped an alert code from her team in the carpetservice van what is it theres a police cruiser coming up the road somebody must have reported the shot geli closed her eyes she would have to invoke her federal authority and quarantine tennants house the nsas presence in chapel hill was about to become the knowledge of municipal police im on my way were gone geli hit an alarm button on her desk alerting every member of her security teams whether inside the building on surveillance duty or sleeping at home in two minutes a net would close on david tennants house from every direction chapter i was about to drive out of my subdivision when i realized i was making a mistake the open highway looked like escape but wasnt i knew geli bauer better than that yanking the wheel left i did a in the middle of hickory street then turned onto elm why are you turning around rachel asked from the floor on the passenger side have you ever hunted rabbit she blinked in confusion rabbit im from new york a woman on a mountain bike rode by us and waved a toddler in a baby seat perched on the back fender in our present circumstances the image looked surreal when a rabbit runs for its life it takes a zigzag course at lightning speed but it always circles back to where it started its a good escape strategy of course rabbit hunters know that thats why they use dogs the dogs chase the rabbit while the hunter stands there waiting to shoot him when he comes back around rachels face showed disgust thats barbaric it puts food on the table the point is the people hunting expect us to run like humans but were going to take a lesson from the rabbit what do we gain by doing that a car for one thing we wouldnt get five miles in this one yours either whose car can we get just sit tight elm street circumnavigated my subdivision when i came to the east entrance of oak streetwhich paralleled willowi turned left as i drove i watched between the houses to catch a glimpse of the roofs on my street when i saw my own i began scanning the lawns ahead a hundred yards up oak street i saw what i wanted a blueandwhite for sale sign the house it advertised had a long curving driveway with no cars parked in it turning into the drive i pulled quickly off the cement and rolled behind a thick stand of boxwood shrubs follow me i said getting out rachel climbed off the floor and opened her door her face was pale her hands shivering the shooting at my house had put her into shock it had rattled me too i had killed before id injected my own brother with narcotics and potassium then watched the last spark of consciousness wink out of his eyes but blowing a mans brains out was something else and when geli bauer learned that id killed one of her people she would move heaven and earth to take her revenge i walked over to rachel and pulled her against me hugging her as i once had my wife and daughter were going to be all right i said not really believing it her hair smelled familiar my wife had used the same shampoo i put the memories out of my mind but we have to run do you understand she nodded into my chest i stroked her hair still not quite believing what had happened myself thirty minutes ago id believed the nightmare was over ewan mccaskell would call back and the president would take control of trinity now that hope was blown to hell were going to walk a little ways i said and then were going to borrow a car nobody will bother us with me carrying fieldings box itll look like were selling something can you do it she nodded i got fieldings box from my car and started down oak street rachel beside me theres a hedge in these backyards that runs behind the lots on my street youll see it in a minute were going to cut through it to my street ill tell you when using the sidewalk we quickly covered the hundred yards back to where id seen my roof i walked her past two more lawns then said right here cut between the houses a wooden privacy fence blocked the space between the two houses id chosen if the gates locked well climb over i said what if someones in the backyard ill deal with it the gate opened easily the backyard contained some plastic playground equipment and a parked lawn mower but no people with my hand in the small of rachels back i guided her across the yard there was no gate in the back fence so i bent and interlocked my fingers boosted her over then slung myself up and dropped to the ground beside her the space between the fence and the hedge was only a couple of feet wide i crawled through an opening at the bottom of the bushes then got to my feet behind the utility shed where id hidden fieldings box earlier rachel followed grabbed my hand and pulled herself up i didnt know what the sheds owner did for a living but i assumed he had some sort of sales job because he was hardly ever home the interior was dim and it stank of dead mice and motor oil a row of tools hung from hooks on a pegboard i was looking for a crowbar like the one in my attic but i saw nothing like that kneeling i scanned the area beneath the shelves the owner stowed fishing gear there nothing heavy enough for my purpose i feel sick rachel said its the smell go outside as she left i saw a twelvepound sledgehammer leaning in the corner i picked it up and walked outside rachel was bent over with her hands on her knees whats that for she asked stay close i trotted up to the back door of the house drew back the sledge and swung it in a roundhouse arc at the lock the door caved in dropping the hammer i ran into the dark house rachel followed i didnt hear an alarm but it could be silent wired straight to a security service we want the kitchen i told her this way i smell garlic and dish soap look for wall hooks we need car keys it would help if you turned on the lights i hit a wall switch and flooded the kitchen with light it was a showplace filled with professional viking appliances in stainless steel while rachel searched the walls for hooks i pulled open drawers one held dishrags another practically spewed coupons which seemed odd someone who could afford viking appliances didnt need to cut out coupons key rachel cried grabbing something off the countertop i took the key and examined it thats for a riding lawn mower keep looking the next drawer contained jars of nails screws glue sticks and paper clips no keys why did you pick this house she asked the guys single and never home but i know he has two cars got it she pulled a square black key from a hook under a cabinet its for an audi thats it just as in my house you had to go through the laundry room to reach the garage the same contractor had probably built both homes how did you know the key was for an audi my exhusband drove one i opened the door to the garage and saw a silver a sitting there like an answered prayer the guys other car was a honda accord he probably took the accord to the airport to sit in the park fly and saved the flagship audi for his road trips anybody with an eightythousanddollar car has a security system in his house rachel said over my shoulder the cops are definitely on their way key she slapped it into my palm like a nurse passing a scalpel to a surgeon and twenty seconds later we were pulling onto willow street the garage door sliding down behind us i looked up and down willow being careful not to turn too far right when i looked toward my house i didnt see anybody not even a yardman what good is stealing this car if the police come check out that guys alarm rachel asked the police wont know what was taken they dont know this car was there theyll have to track down the owner and hes probably on a business trip to god knows where i made two quick turns and swung onto kinsdale headed east toward interstate traffic was fairly heavy and i was glad of it where are we going now i reached into the backseat and grabbed fieldings ziplocsealed letter from the box then laid it on her lap i pointed to the line lu li and i are driving to the blue place on saturday night the blue place steering with my knee i searched the audis console and found a ballpoint pen then i pulled the letter out of the ziploc and wrote nags head the outer banks beneath fieldings cartoon white rabbit why cant you tell me out loud i scribbled they could be listening she took the pen and wrote how we just stole this car trust me i whispered its possible she shook her head then wrote is there something at nags head evidence an image of fieldings pocket watch came into my mind i took the pen back and wrote i hope so she wrote cell phone in my pocket try to call president i took the pen and wrote its not that simple now why not there was no way to write all i needed to say i pulled her close and whispered into her ear once they heard ewan mccaskells message they knew they could eliminate me and tell the president whatever they wanted to explain my death yours too what kind of lie would explain that an easy one by now the president has been told that my hallucinations have progressed to psychosis ravi nara will write a formal diagnosis hell say ive become dangerously paranoid that i believe andrew fielding was murdered when he clearly died of natural causes your own office records say ive been having hallucinations and may be schizophrenic theyll be used to support naras position i took my eyes off the road and looked at her do you think that would be a hard sell she turned away not a very optimistic picture is it no but you have to put it out of your mind for a few minutes youre all over the road if you insist on driving you need to calm down thats not whats getting to me right now then what is by answering this honestly i would be asking for trouble but i didnt want to keep it to myself any longer i saw it saw what the guy who was going to kill you of course you did you had to see him to shoot him i swung onto the i ramp and merged with the traffic headed toward the rtp and raleigh thats not what i mean i saw him walking up the street willow street before he ever got to the house he walked right up to the door what do you mean i dreamed it rachel she stared at me she had never been with me when id experienced one of my hallucinations how did you see him like your jesus hallucinations like a movie what i saw it the way you see what the criminal or the monster sees in b movies i saw it through his eyes she sat back in her seat tell me exactly what you saw the houses on my street my feet walking a dog trotting by i thought i was dreaming about myself but when i got to my house and reached into my pocket for my key i brought out a lockpick go on i picked the lock and went inside i heard you in the kitchen and then i took out a gun rachel stared through the windshield but her mind was clearly elsewhere that doesnt mean anything she said finally dreams of someone invading the house or bedroom are almost universal in narcoleptic patients even if you werent narcoleptic that would be a typical dream a distortion of reality caused by anxiety no the timing was too perfect i saw a threat in my dream and when i woke up the threat was there in the real world just as i saw it she squeezed my shoulder listen to me youre accustomed to the sounds of your own house you were already in an anxious state you heard something unfamiliar something that triggered your fear of a breakin the front door opening a window going up a creaking board in response to that stimulus your mind generated a dream of a breakin it frightened you enough to wake you your dream was a reaction to external stimuli not the other way around i did remember a creaking board but i was already awake when id heard that i saw his gun in the dream i said doggedly an automatic it had a silencer i tapped the gun in my waistband just like this one coincidence ive never seen a gun with a silencer before of course you have youve seen hundreds of them in films i thought about it youre right but theres something else what thats not the first dream ive had like that where i was someone else someone from the present day i had one the day fielding died describe it for me a durham police cruiser passed us in the westbound lanes my heart clenched but the cruiser didnt slow or blink its lights yesterday when i was making my videotapejust before you came ini dreamed i was fielding just prior to and during his death it was so real that i felt id actually died i couldnt see couldnt breathe when i answered the door for you i didnt know which way was up but fielding had already died that morning so she held up her hands as if to emphasize an obvious point dont you see your fielding dream didnt predict anything it could easily have been a grief reaction have you had any more dreams like that i looked back at the road we had reached the research triangle park i ran right through it less than a mile away geli bauer was directing the hunt for me david have you had other dreams like that this isnt the time to discuss it will there be a better time why did you skip your last three appointments with me i shook my head you already think im crazy thats not a medical term descriptive though she sighed and looked out the window at the perfect green turf on her side of the road thats trinity i said coming up over there the lab was set so far back from the road that little was visible the sign says argus optical she said thats cover ah look whats the point of keeping a hallucination from me what part of yourself do you think youre protecting well talk about it later i could see that she didnt intend to drop it i need drugs rachel i cant afford to be passing out five times a day while were on the run what have you been taking modafinil modafinil was a standard narcolepsy treatment sometimes usually i take methamphetamine david we talked about the side effects of amphetamines they could be exaggerating your hallucinations theyre the only thing that can keep me awake ravi nara used to get me dexedrine she sighed ill write you a prescription for some adderall a scrip isnt the problem i could write that myself the problem is that they know i need it theyll be watching all the pharmacies they cant possibly cover every pharmacy in the triangle theyre the nsa rachel and they know i need drugs these are the people who recorded the cockpit chatter of the russian pilots who shot down that korean airliner over sakhalin island in that was twenty years ago and it was a random incident they are actively searching for us you read twenty years ago when i say nsa think big brother the nsa is the closest thing we have to it in america but you still need your drugs you must know somebody i could get it at the hospital pharmacy theyll be watching for us there well shit id almost never heard her use profanity maybe it came with the blue jeans maybe she shed her demure exterior with her silk skirts and blouses i know a doc in north durham wholl give us some samples she said wed already left durham behind and were well on our way to raleigh my knowledge of geli bauer made me reluctant to linger in the area longer than necessary also paradoxically enough something in me did not want the dreams to stop my last one had saved our lives and though id never confess it to rachel i felt somehow that my dreamshowever frightening they might bewere giving me information about our plight information i could gain in no other way were not going back i said what if you pass out at the wheel you saw how it works at the house it doesnt happen instantly you werent driving then i usually have a couple of minutes warning ill pull over the second i feel something wrong rachel was clearly unhappy as though to drain off some anger she put one foot up on the dash untied her shoe then retied it then she did the same to the other this compulsive ritual seemed to calm her i took the loop around raleigh then merged onto us which would take us all the way to the atlantic ocean the highway was generic southern two broad strips of cement running through pine and hardwood forest it would be another two hours before the land started to drop toward the outer banks fielding would have been traveling this road today if he hadnt died a road he had traveled before to a destination my wife and i had visited twelve years earlier thoughts like that showed me the needless ambiguity of words like spacetime the average person heard a word like that and figured hed never understand it but it was so simple every place you ever saw was linked to a specific time the nags head cabin fielding and his wife had honeymooned in appeared to be the same one my wife and i had used but in reality it was not in the fabric of spacetime it was altogether different the school you visited twenty years after you graduated the football field you played on the track you rannone of them was the same if they were you would collide with the generations that had run on them before and after you the lover you kissed was not the same person he or she was sixty seconds before in that minute a million skin cells had died and been replaced by new ones the smallest slices of spacetime separated thought from action life from death i dont want to make things worse rachel said but since you cant call the president anymore what exactly can you do where can we go im hoping something at the cabin will give me a clue right now im just trying to keep us alive why dont we just go public drive to atlanta and tell it all to cnn because the nsa could just say i was lying what can i really prove at this point she folded her arms you tell me would a nobel laureate like ravi nara perjure himself to cover all this up he wouldnt hesitate national security is the ultimate rationalization for lying and as for the trinity building it could be totally empty by now lu li fielding would support you lu li has disappeared rachels face lost some color dont assume the worst yet she had a plan to escape but i have no idea whether she made it or not david you must know more than youre telling me about lu li about trinity she was right okay a couple of weeks ago fielding decided that the suspension of the project was just a ruse to distract the two of us he thought the real work on trinity was continuing elsewhere and maybe had been for a long time where else could they be working on it fieldings bet was the r and d labs at godin supercomputing in california godins been flying out there quite a bit on his private jet naras gone with him several times that doesnt prove anything for all you know theyre playing golf at pebble beach these guys dont play golf they work theyd sell their souls for what they want when you think of peter godin think faust what do they want different things john skow was about to be canned by the nsa when godin asked that he administer project trinity that resurrected his career why would peter godin want a man like that i think godin has something on skow he probably compromised him a long time ago and knows skow will keep quiet about anything hes told to working at the nsa doesnt make you rich but being the man who delivered a trinity computer to the agency would put skow in the directors chair and after that hed be invaluable to private corporations skow will do anything necessary to make trinity a reality and ravi nara nara demanded a million dollars a year to come on board what the government wouldnt pay godin made up in cash beyond that naras contribution to trinity would give him a lock on another nobel shared with godin and jutta klein of course fielding would deserve it the most but the nobel committee doesnt give posthumous awards tack on unlimited research funds for life naras name in the history books and this jutta klein klein is straight shes an older german woman and she already shared a nobel with two other germans back in shes on loan to trinity from siemens thats the way its set up with several companies godin wanted the best people in the world so he borrowed them from the r and d divisions of the best computer companies sun micro silicon graphics in exchange those companies will get to license certain parts of the trinity technology once its declassified if its declassified if jutta klein is straight rachel said maybe shes the person who can help us she couldnt if she wanted to theyll have her sewed up tight rachel gave a frustrated sigh and godin what does he want godin wants to be god what i eased into the left lane to pass a motor home godin doesnt care about trinity making a profit hes a billionaire hes seventytwo years old and hes been a star since he was forty so forget being the father of artificial intelligence or anything like that he wants to be the firstmaybe the onlyhuman being whose mind is ported into a trinity computer rachel pushed a dark strand of hair out of her eyes whats he like an egomaniac hes not that simple godin is a brilliant man who believes he knows whats wrong with the world hes like the people you knew in college who thought atlas shrugged was the answer to the worlds problems only hes a genius and hes made major contributions to science so far america is truly a better place because peter godin lived here his supercomputers played a significant role in winning the cold war it sounds like you admire him hes easy to admire but he scares me too hes practically killing himself to build the most powerful computer in the world and he doesnt care that he wont understand how it works when it finally does godins building trinity to use it himself and i dont know if theres anything more dangerous than a powerful man obsessed with remaking the world in his own image as i reached out to set the audis cruise control my vision started to blur a wave of fatigue washed through me and rachels last words slipped out of my head my eyesight cleared but the familiar highpitched humming had begun in my head i braked and swerved onto the shoulder what is it asked rachel you need to drive i may go under she sat up okay i got out and walked around to her side of the car rachel climbed over the console and slid behind the wheel before getting back in i looked up and down the highway traffic was moderate but steady and no drivers showed any interest in me she studied me closely are you all right david a little shaky she reached over and fastened my safety belt is it an episode the humming had descended to my back teeth yes close your eyes ive got the wheel just keep going east our destination is abouti held up three fingershours away in the glove compartment was a map of the carolinas i located highway and pointed to plymouth near where the roanoke river ran into albemarle sound if i dont wake up by the time we reach here wake me up rachel put the audi in gear and began accelerating along the shoulder when she reached fifty she pulled onto the highway and goosed the pedal is it getting worse she asked in my mind i said im fine but some part of my brain realized that my lips had not moved i was about to go under my palms were tingling and my face felt hot rachel laid a hand on my forehead youre burning up does that always happen i tried to answer but i felt as i had as a boy in the oak ridge swimming pool trying to talk to my friends underwater we yelled as loud as we could but we couldnt make our words understood rachels hand seemed to be melting into my forehead that pleased me somehow i wanted to check the visor mirror and see if her hand really was melting but i couldnt move a woman was calling my name from far away before i could answer the deep blue swell of a wave broke over me and i went under rolling and tumbling into darkness im sitting outdoors in a circle of sleeping men leaning against a wall banked embers glow at the center of the circle the sky is on fire with stars a robed man named peter sits beside me he seems upset why do you want to do this he whispered if you go youll suffer all manner of indignities even if the people listen youll be rejected by the priests and elders and what of the romans i fear you will be killed though he does not name the place i know hes speaking of jerusalem go away i tell him you value what the dog values your body your next meal your life he takes hold of my arm and shakes it you dont drive me off so easily ive seen it in a dream if you go you will be executed whoever will save his life shall lose it i reply peter shakes his head his eyes filled with confusion the scene changes suddenly im on a high mountain looking out over a plain three men sit with me when you go into the towns i ask who do you say that i am we say you are the anointed one i shake my head do not say this of me speak from your hearts of what you have seen no more yes master answers a man named john whose eyes are large and brown like a womans he looks at peter then speaks cautiously to me im told you mean to go to jerusalem yes john shakes his head if you do this the priests will not know what to do with you they will fear you and theyll condemn you to death this cup has been passed to me i must drink the men fall silent as i contemplate the plain below fear simmers in the pit of my belly to know the gift of this life this body and then to give it up i snapped awake and grabbed the dashboard my eyes on the rear of a tractortrailer ahead rachel grabbed my knee its all right david im here my hands were shaking the fear of the dream still palpable how long have we been on the road an hour and twenty minutes we just passed plymouth i told you to wake me up you were sleeping so hard i hated to do it have you seen anything suspicious we passed a state trooper a half hour ago and a couple of plymouth cops but none of them looked twice at us i think were okay rachel looked anything but okay and once our immediate goal of escape was accomplished her composure would crack i was no different my reaction to killing geli bauers assassin had been blunted by a flood of neurochemicals evolved for my survival images from my dream returned in flashes of color and light but the fear was fading and in its wake i felt a strange sort of relief after months of vagueness and mystery the dreams were finally localizing to a specific place jerusalem logically this made no sense i had never been to israel and i knew little about it beyond the bloody conflict id seen for decades on the evening news but where had logic led me so far david rachel said maybe we can hole up for a while at the i clapped my hand over her mouth dont im sorry but i warned you already she nodded and i took my hand away if the nsa is so all powerful she whispered what were you doing making that videotape in your own living room wouldnt they hear that i reached into the backseat lifted fieldings box of homemade electronic toys and set it on my lap from it i withdrew a metallic wand about ten inches long fielding showed me where their bugs were in tiny holes in the sheetrock what was he doing with equipment like that dont you think thats a little suspicious i can see how it would look that way you had to know him even as i said that i wondered if i really had known the eccentric englishman i poked through his box looking for signs of a secret agenda most of the homebuilt devices looked like the projects of a teenager who spent his weekends at radioshack one resembled the old viewmaster toy of my youth a plastic frame with tubular eyepieces and a switch on the right side i held the makeshift goggles up to my face aimed them at rachel and flipped the switch an amber haze fell across my field of vision but beyond that nothing happened what are those rachel asked im not sure i turned the goggles toward the windshield and looked out over the road my heart turned to ice a thin green beam of coherent lighta laserwas hitting the audis front windshield at an angle almost perpendicular to the ground id seen many such beams in physics labs at mit the only other places i had seen them was in films on lasergun sights someone was aiming a laser at us from the air i wanted to scream a warning to rachel but my throat was glued shut shoving my foot across the floor i hit the brake throwing the audi into a skid rachel screamed and tried to control the spinning car i turned the goggles and searched for the laser it was about forty yards away tracking back toward the car like the hand of god the audi shuddered to a stop on the grassy shoulder why the hell did you do that rachel yelled our nearest cover was a line of trees fifty yards from the shoulder someone with an automatic weapon could easily cut us down before we reached the tree line i held the goggles up to rachels eyes someones going to shoot at us get under the dash as far as you can as she tried to fold herself under the steering column i reacquired the laser beam i expected it to move onto me but instead it froze on the windshield glass the beam didnt penetrate the glass it terminated at the windshields surface by extending the beam in my mind i realized it would not intersect with either me or rachel but the dashboard if they wanted to shoot us i thought aloud they could have done it before i ever turned on the goggles what its not a gun sight what are you talking about the laser could be a bomb designator but not even panic would drive the nsa to drop a smart bomb on the shoulder of an american highway they had too many other options suddenly i understood the laser was a surveillance device by bouncing the beam off the windshield and measuring the vibration of the glass eavesdroppers in a plane or helicopter could hear every word we said inside get up get up and drive rachel struggled back into her seat shifted the car into drive and pulled onto the highway the green beam stayed locked on our windshield like a satellite weapon aimed from space taking the map off the floor i folded it down to a small rectangle and tapped a spot three times to indicate our location she nodded i then followed eastward for a couple of miles to a small rural road that broke to the left there i wrote take this turn when rachel nodded again i leaned down to her ear and said take the turn no matter what happens understand i will is whatever you saw still there i checked through the goggles then squeezed her shoulder its there speed up she pressed the accelerator to the floor chapter geli bauer stood alone in david tennants kitchen alone with the corpse of her lover the carpetcleaningservice truck was still parked outside its vacuum equipment running loudly by any operational standard she should have moved ritters corpse long ago but she couldnt she wanted to understand what had happened here from the wound in ritters head and the way his body was lying it seemed he had been shot from the front or slightly to the side she couldnt imagine an untrained man winning a shootout with a former member of germanys most elite counterterror unit that left two options one tennant had somehow surprised ritter and fired very accurately as ritter whirled to shoot him two tennant was not what he seemed he had been raised in the rural area around oak ridge tennessee which might make him proficient with a hunting rifle but not with a handgun and where had he learned to sweep rooms for microphones had fielding taught him that or had he learned it elsewhere his escape from the crime scene raised more questions the team in the carpet van had arrived to find rachel weisss saab parked out front but tennants garage empty a second team had combed the neighborhood and discovered tennants acura parked behind some hedges at a vacant house it had taken a half hour of police liaison to learn that a silver audi a had been stolen from the house down the street without the voiceprint analysis that had turned up fieldings covert call from a convenience store tennant and weiss might have slipped through her net but four days ago fielding had reserved a cabin at nags head on the outer banks in the name of mr lewis carroll this combined with tennants having received a fedex letter from fielding yesterday had been enough for geli to put air assets over highway the route to nags head and that had put tennant back into her hands as she looked down at ritters shattered skull and bloodmatted hair her cell phone rang bauer she said this is airone they know were following them how high are you flying ten thousand feet theres no way they could have made us from looking at the sky they had to see the beam thats impossible without special equipment they must have some what are they doing now a crackle of static they ran off the road like they saw the beam and panicked they ducked under the dash for a while then got back on the highway theyre doing about ninety now still headed east what are they saying nothing about a destination where are our ground units geli asked closest is fifteen minutes away give or take two ill call you back she speeddialed skows scrambled cell phone he answered after eight rings what is it geli tennant detected our airborne surveillance hes taking evasive action you must be joking have your people lost him the plane has the audi now but they could lose it i suppose you want to terminate them now geli sensed skows finger on the chicken switch thats my standing order from you the situation has changed the geography has changed not the situation i dont like it how will it play the bureaucrats mantra geli thought scornfully tennant went psychotic he killed his trinity guard and kidnapped his psychiatrist were attempting a rescue there was a long silence then skow said peter was right to hire you good luck with that rescue fuck you very much geli muttered and hung up she opened her connection to the plane and her ground units airone do you still have the audi in sight affirmative and they definitely know were here tennant leaned out and looked up at us ground units when you get there wait for low traffic then box in the car and take them take them out asked a voice with the eerie calm of a fighter pilot on a mission geli looked down at ritters corpse remembering last night he was still alive inside her tennant may have kidnapped his psychiatrist were not sure we do know that hes highly unstable armed and hes already killed one of ours ritter bock which should tell you something nobody take any chances protect your own lives first there was a chorus of affirmative am i understood the responding silence said more than the subsequent acknowledgments this was why she hired former soldiers ah thats a rog said a cold male voice call it play by play for me airone will do geli smiled tennant and weiss wouldnt live to see nightfall chapter as the audi roared eastward toward the turn i scanned the highway behind us the nearest vehicle was two hundred yards back it looked like a pickup truck i doubted it was nsa but you never knew with aerial surveillance ground units wouldnt have to follow closely to stay up with us they could even drive ahead of us there was simply no way to know who or where our pursuers were if we were lucky whatever aircraft was up there had acquired us only minutes before i saw the laser rachel reached out and pulled me close enough to whisper i think i see the turn is it highway i checked the map yes but its no highway take it she slowed to fifty then screeched left onto punch it i said she hit the accelerator and shot down the twolane blacktop at seventy miles per hour i put the goggles up to my face and looked for the laser it had lost us at the turn but it quickly tracked back onto our rear windshield i leaned over to rachels ear were going to cross a bridge over the cashie river where it flows into albemarle sound take the next left after that just tell me when to turn the a devoured the road like a starving tiger racing up and over the high bridge that arced across the cashie i leaned far enough out the window to look skyward a small plane was flying over the road at about five thousand feet a wave of relief went through me my fear was a helicopter that could set down on the road and deploy a swat team armed with submachine guns a fixedwing aircraft could land on a highway but not on the twisting road we would soon be driving rachel pointed at an intersection ahead i nodded she slowed just enough to make the turn then whipped onto a much smaller road that was heavily forested on both sides look at those trees i said bracing my hands on the dash a hundred yards ahead towering oaks closed over the road turning it into a shadowy tunnel when we entered it i rolled down my window and leaned out again first i saw nothing but branches then i caught a silver gleam as the plane swooped over the road behind us at about two thousand feet go i yelled were losing them if i go any faster ill lose control youre doing fine law enforcement used fixedwing aircraft for surveillance because they could stay on station much longer than helicopters today they would pay a heavy price for that strategy a plane couldnt crisscross the sky in tight enough patterns to maintain contact on a twisting road with heavy cover the audis big tires squealed as rachel took another tight curve at seventyplus my right shoulder compressed against the door struggling to hold the map steady i searched for an escape route if we took the next tiny rural road to the left we would quickly recross the cashie river but not by bridge the cashie looked scarcely wider than a creek at that point and an italic legend said ferry that could mean anything from a freefloating vessel to a cable barge i picked up the goggles and scanned the road ahead the laser was dancing erratically about seventy yards in front of the car breaking and reforming as the operator in the plane tried to contend with the branches shielding us from above theres a ferry up ahead i said if we can get over to it we may be able to cut off ground pursuit all right youve got a left turn any second okay there rachel stepped on the brake i thought we were going to spin out but the allwheel drive held the car to the pavement and she just managed the turn as the tunnel of oaks thickened the onelane road quickly petered out into gravel and mud dropping at a shallow angle that told me we were nearing water careful i said dreading the scrape of gravel against the undercarriage with the car listing to starboard we rounded the last curve and came to rest behind an ancient green chevy nova parked in the middle of the track beyond the car i saw a dark slowmoving river about eighty yards across i dont see a ferry rachel said a beatup aluminum canoe was tied to the roof of the nova but i saw no people i covered my gun with my shirttail then got out and walked toward the river the sound of an acoustic guitar floated back to me reminding me of deliverance when i rounded the nova i saw not two inbred hillbillies but a pair of collegeage boys sitting on the ground one was blond and wore a bandanna as a headband the other was darkhaired and fingerpicking a beatup dreadnought martin guitar i waved casually and walked past them to the rivers edge a ferry built to hold three or four cars was making its way across the water from the opposite bank a dark column of exhaust rising from its rumbling engine a house trailer stood on the far bank beside it was a small ramp and a road that disappeared into the woods we already called the ferry said one of the boys behind me i turned and smiled at them the blond with the bandanna wore a unc tshirt and had quick green eyes the guitar player looked stoned and had a bad sunburn across his shoulders i smelled the unmistakable odor of marijuana you guys been running the rivers around here the blond laughed we take it pretty slow we floated the chowan this morning were headed home now tarboro we just wanted a look at the cashie here i put my hand over my eyes and looked skyward the surveillance plane droned out of a cumulus cloud and flew across the river sounds good i said to the guitar player who was still picking softly then i walked back to the audi and got inside the ferrys on the way is the plane still up there rachel asked yes she looked as though shed endured about all she could in one day as i stared morosely at the novas rear end an idea hit me ill be right back i got out and walked around the nova then squatted in front of the college boys ive got a proposition for you guys what kind of proposition asked the blond my wifes never done any canoeing she saw your boat and got a wild idea shed like to float down the river to the sound the guitar player stopped picking were on our way home man i remember tarboro but i was thinking how much do you figure your canoe is worth it looks like an old grumman to me thats right said the blond used to be my uncles i guess shes worth about four hundred bucks we all turned as the ferrys deck hit the ramp on our side of the river i reached up and twanged the inverted v of rope that bound the bow of the canoe to the cars front bumper two hundred would be closer i said with a laugh but i like to keep my wife happy how about five the blond swallowed hard he was calculating how much weed he could buy with five hundred in cash the thing is i dont want to leave my car here id like you to drive it up the road a ways where to asked the blond how about tarboro he looked confused but how will you get there to pick up your car get aboard shouted the ferryman a whitehaired beanpole in faded overalls i took out my wallet and counted out ten bills for a thousand bucks what do you care shit said the guitar player getting to his feet he looked over the nova at the audi rachels face was a blur behind the suns reflection is that your car thats it whats the deal man the deal is a thousand bucks for the canoe and a quick drive you up for it both boys looked at the audi then at each other fifteen hundred said the blond turning to me for fifteen hundred ill drive it to tarboro call it hazard pay i smiled fifteen hundred it is but heres how we have to do it we loaded the cars on the ferry and the old man guided the shuddering vessel back into the slow current as agreed the boys sat in their nova during the crossing rachel and i stayed in the audi the nsa plane remained on station flying a tight circle over the river i could almost feel geli bauers security teams converging on this little corner of north carolina when the ferry reached the far bank the nova drove slowly off the deck and down the ramp onto the road rachel followed then suddenly she swerved around the nova and raced into the woods like a woman pursued by demons as soon as the oak branches closed over us she braked and waited for the nova to catch up twenty seconds later the old chevy rounded a curve and pulled up behind us move fast i yelled to the boys as they got out their canoe sat on yellow foam squares that protected the cars roof from the metal gunwales i started to untie the bow ropes but the blond whipped a knife out of his pocket and cut the lines at both ends of the canoe i took hold of the bow the guitar player took the stern and together we slid the boat off the roof inverting it as we lowered it to the ground at the last minute we lost hold and the canoe hit the gravel with a ringing blang the blond reached into the backseat took out two long wooden paddles and dropped them into the canoe when he looked up his eyes focused on something behind me and he blushed i turned and saw rachel standing behind me in her jeans and white buttondown hey she said i appreciate this then she smiled in a way id never seen her smile before uh no problem said the blond the guitar player waved at rachel but said nothing and i saw that even at thirtyfive rachel weiss still impressed boys in their twenties weve got to get going i said so do you guys i handed the blond fifteen bills youre either paying me too much or not enough he said but its cool he pointed into the trees if you carry the canoe through there you should hit the river after fifty yards or so thanks he trotted back to the audi and slid behind the wheel as i got fieldings box from the backseat i touched the kid on the shoulder if anyone stops you in this car tell them exactly what happened the money everything youll be fine he nodded no sweat the audi roared to life and tore off down through the tunnel of oaks the guitar player in the nova laughed shook his head and slowly followed i tossed fieldings box into the canoe wrapped the bow line around my right hand and started dragging the boat toward the trees should i push asked rachel ive got it you watch for snakes from that moment forward her eyes never left the ground the trees grew almost too close together to pull the canoe between them and i was soon dripping sweat but the blond kid was right before long i smelled decaying plants and then i sighted a yellow flash of sunlight on water fifty more feet and i was shoving the canoe between two cypress knees and into the river get in i told rachel all the way to the front she climbed into the stern and made her way carefully to the bow seat i shoved the canoe into deeper water then jumped into the stern as it arrowed away from the shore settling on the hard seat i picked up a paddle and propelled the boat along the snakylooking bank im going to keep us under the trees i said watch for the plane rachel looked up and squinted i listened hard as i paddled but i heard only the frothy whisper of wood cutting water see anything she shook her head i looked down the long dark bend of river bounded on both sides by thick stands of cypress and pine at this moment the vast resources of the nsa were focused on finding us but here those resources were largely useless for the first time in many hours i felt some peace any idea where were going rachel asked no but ill know when we get there chapter geli bauer sat in her zerogravity chair in the security basement of the trinity building her right hand squeezing a pair of weighted dice shed taken from fieldings personal effects in the storeroom shed taken them for luck but so far they had brought her little on the bank of monitors to her right dozens of nsa personnel with forklifts and dollies were moving sensitive equipment and files to trucks waiting at the back of the building if tennant went public she wanted nothing left here for nosy congressmen to find tennant just pulled onto the shoulder and stopped said a female voice in her headset it belonged to an exnavy warrant officer named evans who was in the first ground unit to sight the stolen audi did he try to run at all geli asked negative when he realized we were pursuing he just pulled over like its a traffic stop geli didnt like the sound of that are they in plain sight only the man do you have a megaphone we dont need it he just got out of the car hes holding his hands up dr tennant i dont think so the line crackled this looks like a kid a kid a hippie college kid you stopped the wrong car no the plates right wait they must have pulled some kind of switch who there were two college kids in a green chevy on the ferry tennant and weiss must be in that car question the goddamn kid find out hang on she glanced at her monitors the nsa movers were rolling stacked computers onto the loading dock on the ground floor moving the equipment was a pain in the ass if they had let her kill tennant at the same time as fielding none of this would be happening evans here said the voice on the headset theyre on the river now theyre what the college kids had a canoe on their car unpainted aluminum tennant bought it off them geli felt like she was about to stroke out find the chevy and nail it anyway and impound the audi will do airone do you read affirmative start making low passes over the river start at the ferry and move toward albemarle sound even tennant wouldnt try to get away by paddling upstream well be back over the river in five minutes get ground units started down the river on both sides theres only a road on one side the north side jesus christ well cover the other side geli killed the connection and said skow home into her headset after one ring skow said tell me you have them theyre gone what does that mean tennant pulled a switch on the ferry he and weiss are now in a canoe somewhere on the cashie river damn it geli how could you screw this up her cheeks burned do you want to have a conversation about who fucked this up dont be insubordinate if tennant slips through our fingers here you can kiss control goodbye thats not necessarily true give me a moment as skow pondered the situation geli punched up a map of north carolina on her screen what would tennant do after getting on the river where could he go there were five miles of water between the ferry and the sound and no road on the south bank from which to surveil the river if tennant knew that he could beach the canoe anywhere what do you want to do skow asked i want realtime satellite imagery of that river right now highest possible resolution you authorize it ill give the nro the coordinates what else i need more manpower i dont have near the tactical strength to carry out a widearea search in wooded terrain thats a problem until we go public with some form of this story were low on manpower then youd better think about going public and fast listen geli if we lose him here we still have a good shot im going to be giving you some information that could put you one step ahead of tennant her internal radar went on alert what kind of information youll see when you get it its from an unimpeachable source theres no such thing is this an nsa source yes the agency hasnt given me anything reliable so far thats about to change im in a hurry have we covered everything no rules of engagement skow took an audible breath im comfortable with your rescue scenario ill bet you are i want a shoottokill order skow did not reply geli felt her temper rising look weve waited give me a moment to think why are you so damn wishywashy about this look this is a hostage situation you have the tactical experience i have to leave the rules of engagement to your discretion geli shook her head and muttered be careful what you wish for right the burden of command ms bauer command isnt a burden skow its nirvana the burden is putting up with asscovering bureaucrats secondguessing every move after the fact skow chuckled softly you sound exactly like your father ill mention it to him this comment stopped geli cold you do that she said covering after skow hung up she sat in silence lightly touching the scar on her cheek so skow and her father was more than a passing acquaintance she didnt like that idea not at all chapter i had been paddling steadily for an hour when i spotted the boat ramp it lay at the foot of the high bridge over the cashie river the one wed crossed on our way to the ferry the river had widened since the ferry and sooner or later it would open into the vast expanse of albemarle sound in open water we would be easier to spot from the air id seen no further sign of the surveillance plane but that gave me limited comfort drifting under the overhanging trees on the right bank i thought about the ramp there would be a parking lot there trucks and boat trailers probably fishermen returning from their day of sport rachel turned on her seat and sat facing me watching intently as i paddled youve done this before what been on the run paddled a canoe i nodded my brother and i camped a lot with my dad around oak ridge hunted and fished too she looked into the trees on the bank the sun hovered stubbornly behind us but the shadows under the limbs were already deepening to blueblack are we safe now for a while the people who are hunting us depend on technology if we were out in the world in a city or on a highway wed already have been caught here the playing field is more even she toyed with the blueandwhite nylon stern line who is this geli bauer person you talked about i was surprised she remembered the name but i shouldnt have been shed never forgotten anything i told her shes a killer and shes hunting us now how do you know shes a killer she was in the army for a while gelis fluent in arabic so they dropped her into iraq with some commandos before desert storm to interrogate captured republican guard troops she executed two iraqi prisoners because they couldnt keep up with her unit behind the lines cut their throats even the delta force soldiers with her were shocked i guess women have come further than feminists think no female assassins are an ancient tradition geli gave ravi nara a lecture about it one day she sounds like a sociopath rachel dropped the stern line and wearily rubbed her neck shed make an interesting case study for you do you think she killed fielding yes shed know all about drugs that could cause death by mimicking a stroke and she has constant access to everything at trinity the food the water everything i paddled harder and the bridge over the cashie came steadily closer rachel looked over her shoulder at the massive structure cars drove onto it every few seconds that bridge represented civilization i stopped paddling to give my burning back muscles a break the silence was almost total listen to the birds she said i listened but the sound my ears picked out of the silence was not natural a faint rumbling drone was floating down the river it could have been a boat motor but my gut told me it wasnt what is it rachel asked you look scared i scanned the right bank looking for a place to beach the canoe if a small plane flew right down the river overhanging branches wouldnt give us any cover the engine was growing louder even rachel heard it now that sounds close she said just ahead a diseased tree had fallen into the river it lay half in and half out of the water its dead branches and leaves fanning out like ghostly wings the space between the tree and the bank was the kind of spot where you could expect a water moccasin to drop into your boat if you were stupid enough to pull under it looking for fish i guided the canoe straight into the narrow chute feeling a little like hawkeye in the last of the mohicans i only hoped i had some of his luck seconds after the bow plowed into the bank the rumble of the approaching engine became a roar i peered through the trees and saw exactly what id feared a small plane flying twenty feet over the water like a vietnam pilot giving support fire to riverine troops they cant see us can they rachel asked not without thermalimaging equipment but they may have that get down low in the boat she slid off her seat and lay flat in the bottom i lay beside her the planes engine vibrated the aluminum skin of the canoe we stayed in the bottom of the boat waiting to see if it would circle back for another look it didnt i climbed back onto my seat and stroked toward the bridge i cant believe this is happening rachel said i cant believe a woman ive never met is trying to hunt me down and kill me how could she do that i thought back to my last meeting with bauer she thinks were too close she thinks youre in love with me rachels cheeks colored in the fading sun because of the kiss at lu lis not just that when geli questioned me yesterday she told me that you never see anyone how would she know that she knows everybody youve dated and when you stopped seeing them she knows who your thirdgrade teacher was and what your mother used to cook for you when you were sick what did you tell her when she said i was in love with you that you think im schizophrenic rachel smiled her eyes full of sadness i panned my eyes across the broad expanse of river searching for other water craft i saw none which didnt surprise me too much fishermen bought big outboard motors to take them to distant fishing spots as fast as possible i dug in my paddle and pointed the canoe toward the boat ramp were stopping rachel asked looking at the gentle slope of the ramp yes when we hit stay in the boat i wont be long what are you going to do take a look around i beached the canoe beside the ramp then jumped into the shallow water and splashed onto shore the oystershell parking lot stretched from the woods on my right to the huge concrete bridge pilings on my left i saw no people but a line of pickup trucks with boat trailers sat parked about forty yards from the ramp i walked over to them and moved between two trucks ducking low i felt along the tops of the tires of both pickups searching for stashed keys i found none moving around the truck on my left i checked its other two tires nothing i had no luck with the next two trucks either the next in line was a maroon dodge ram there was no key sitting on its tires so i changed tactics squatting between the rear of the truck and the empty boat trailer behind it i reached under the bumper and slid my fingertips along the inside of its metallic lip something slid toward the fender with a scratching sound a magnetic key case i opened the small black box and found a key to the dodge and one for the locking trailer hitch quickly disengaging the trailer from the truck i got behind the wheel and started the engine rachel ducked down in the canoe as i drove up not realizing i was behind the wheel i swung left so that my window came to face her bring fieldings box i shouted hurry cradling the cardboard box in her arms rachel climbed out of the canoe and splashed out of the river i ran to the bank and grabbed a handful of mud from the shallows which i spread across part of the trucks license plate then i washed my hand in the river set fieldings box on the backseat and helped rachel onto the bench seat beside me did you hotwire this thing she asked i wouldnt know how fishermen are honest people they trust each other i hate to take it really ill say a prayer of penance lets go we left a white cloud of oystershell dust behind us as we raced out of the lot are we still going to nags head rachel asked no they could be waiting for us there let me use your cell phone she pulled a silver motorola from her pocket and gave it to me i dialed the white house number from memory fielding had told me long ago to memorize it who are you calling rachel asked the president i hope but you said i want to see what happens an operator answered on the second ring i said project trinity there was a silence then a click and the man id spoken to yesterday said state your business this is david tennant i need to speak to the president hold please a hissing silence followed and i knew that every ticking second gave the nsa longer to track the location of rachels cell phone well she said count to forty out loud she had reached thirtyfive when a voice with a new england accent said dr tennant yes this is ewan mccaskell im talking to you from air force one my heart thudded mr mccaskell i need to speak to the president hes talking to the british prime minister now he should be able to come to the phone in about five minutes i couldnt sit on an open cell phone for five minutes will you wait mccaskell asked the president knows there have been confusing events at project trinity he wants very much to speak with you i cant wait ill call the white house again in seven minutes well have it routed to us i clicked end my heart pounding rachel touched my arm good or bad i dont know that was mccaskell he said the president wants to talk to me but theyve obviously been talked to already by john skow probably they only know what godin wants them to know are they back in the us theyre on air force one on their way back from china no thats a fiveday trip plus a oneday stopover in japan i checked yesterday this summit is sort of a celebration of nixons visit in a repeat performance without the cold war tension what are you going to say when you call back i shook my head president bill matthews had been the senior republican senator from texas when he was swept into the white house on a tide of antidemocrat frustration no one had been more surprised than my brother james who had known matthews since their days at yale matthews was a charismatic figure but not the sharpest arrow in the quiver according to my brother as a senator he had relied heavily on his advisers and that had not changed in the white house still the general opinion was that he was doing a solid job on both the domestic and foreign fronts id met matthews once in the oval office then again at a georgetown reception when i was filming the nova series based on my book how did he remember me as a levelheaded physician whose brother he had liked or as the delusional paranoid skow had undoubtedly described i drove anxiously along highway until it was time to call back this time when i identified myself the connection was almost immediate dr tennant said the president this is david tennant this is bill matthews david i know its been a while since we last saw each other but i want you to know you can tell me anything now talk to me i took a deep breath and went straight to the point sir i know youve already heard some things about my supposed mental state i want you to know that im as sane as the day we met in the oval office so please listen with an open mind andrew fielding died in his office at trinity yesterday i believe he was murdered today there was an attempt on my life a man came into my home with a gun and i had to shoot him in selfdefense project trinity is completely out of control and i think peter godin and john skow are to blame there was a long silence mr president i heard you david look the first thing we need to do is get you to a safe place there is no safe place well somewhere has to be safe doesnt it not when the nsa is trying to kill you dont worry about the nsa i can arrange for the secret service to pick you up somewhere and they can take you to a safe house while you wait for me to get back this sounded attractive but i knew i couldnt risk such a rendezvous getting to it alive would be close to impossible i cant do that sir you dont trust the secret service its not that the point is that i dont know any secret service agents by sight i see silence well couldnt we set up a code or a signal or something it wouldnt be secure from the nsa nothing like that will be safe we could pick one right now we have to assume the agency is listening to this call they can pull it right out of the ether over china mathews sighed all right david tell me this do you trust ewan mccaskell i thought about that thered been no attempt on my life until mccaskell returned my call at my house which had told the trinity security people that i hadnt yet talked to the president if mccaskell was tied to anyone at trinity he would have communicated this to them long before that phone call i trust him but ill have to see his face well it looks like youre just going to have to lie low until we get back mccaskell and the secret service will pick you up then can you get to washington in four days i can mr president could i ask you one thing of course do you believe anything ive said matthews replied in a less folksy voice david i wont lie to you john skow says dr fielding died of natural causes and that you shot a trinity security officer outside your house without provocation he also says youve kidnapped your psychiatrist i blinked in disbelief skow had finally made a mistake hold on sir i handed the phone to rachel tell him who you are she hesitantly took the phone and held it to her ear this is dr rachel weiss yes no sir i came with dr tennant of my own free will thats right yes people are trying to kill us yes sir i will she handed me the cell phone mr president im here david look im not sure what to think but i know you come from good people and i want to see you and hear you out the first tiny fillip of relief went through me thank you sir all i ask is a fair hearing youll get that as soon as i get back keep your ass in the grass dave a bubble of laughter burst through the lump in my throat that saying was right out of my older brothers mouth thank you mr president ill see you then i clicked end rachel was watching me expectantly what do you think i think were better off than we were five minutes ago what did he ask you whether i was under duress he also told me to take care of you my god i cant believe this what are we going to do for the next four days i pressed down the accelerator and sped up to seventy were going to oak ridge tennessee yep i know that place like nowhere in the world five miles outside of town youre lost in the wilderness no police no tvs to broadcast photos of wanted fugitives and stolen trucks nothing how far away is it eight hours i passed a slowmoving car and settled back into the right lane settle in and get some sleep i cant sleep in a car this is a truck wiseass escaping the plane and reaching the president had produced a sense of elation in both of us but that feeling wouldnt last long im not kidding about the sleep youre going to need every bit of energy you have in the morning for what mountains chapter geli was running on adrenaline her body charged by the chase between the hunt for tennant and weiss and the search for lu li fielding her resources were stretched to the limit but when the lack of manpower vexed her she thought back to the iraqi desert where her total force had numbered only eight delta force commandos her latest headache was jutta klein the german mri expert klein had apparently taken advantage of her reduced surveillance and driven to atlanta where shed boarded a lufthansa flight for germany the german government had pledged to assist in any way possible but geli knew they would welcome klein and her newfound expertise with open arms geli spun in her chair someone with the days access code had buzzed through the door of the control center john skow stepped out of the shadows clad in his unvarying brooks brothers suit his eyes glinting with fear or excitement what are you doing here she asked whats happened skow straddled a chair opposite geli and folded his almost feminine hands on its back tennant just spoke to the president matthews was in air force one en route from beijing to shanghai our routine intercepts over china picked it up and i just broke the executive comm codes geli felt as though shed opened the door of a hot oven no wonder skow hadnt wanted to talk on the air what did they say the president tried to arrange for the secret service to pick up tennant somewhere but tennant wouldnt bite did matthews buy our story or does he believe tennant skow bit one side of his lower lip like a man weighing odds id say hes leaning toward us but he told tennant he would get a fair hearing and how will that happen ewan mccaskell and the secret service will meet tennant and pick him up when the president gets back tennant trusts mccaskell when does the president get back four days are we talking dc yes perfect why geli had already foreseen that tennant might run for washington dc gives us a perfect cover story to take tennant out starting now we maximize our effort to discredit him expanding on what weve already said tennants side effects worsened to psychosis he shot his security guard and kidnapped dr weiss and now hes threatened the presidents life skows eyes narrowed but he just talked to matthews and he didnt make any threats geli rolled her eyes tennant is saying whatever he has to say to get access to the man he wants to kill by painting him as a deranged assassin we can use every metro cop in dc to hunt him down and once you give him the lee harvey oswald treatment the secret service wont let him near the president thats an elegant strategy what do we use for evidence we have hundreds of hours of recordings from tennants house and phone is the godin four still running upstairs i didnt notice why with the right programs from the nsaand our godin fouryou could piece together a verbal threat against the president that no one could prove was fake skow smiled with appreciation thats good geli very good thats why im here the question is will tennant go straight to dc or wait the four days my source says no said skow ive got a short list of places tennant might run and washington is at the bottom anger tightened gelis jaw muscles who is this source damn it i cant give you that im sorry but he says tennant will run somewhere besides dc yes isnt it just common sense why should tennant risk going straight to washington when the meet is four days away because he knows people there who have access to potus the surgeon general the director of the national institutes of health the politicians from his home state senator barrett jackson heads the select committee on intelligence for gods sake he can get access to the oval office with a phone call and if tennant convinces someone like barrett jackson that hes sane i see all right but we cant be sure where hell run and our assassin story will allow us to bring in other federal assets to cover the other locations good you take care of the media you also need to hit everyone tennant knows inside the beltway with a classified nsa security warning emphasize his mental instability can you do that gracefully skows thin lips flattened into something like a smile thats why im here geli nodded feeling better than she had in hours youd better get upstairs and make sure they keep the godin four fired up or get it moved back here quick skow had never touched geli before but he reached out and laid his hand on her wrist you have four days to kill tennant and weiss after that the secret service will be running things and theyll work very hard to trap tennant rather than kill him thats why youre going to make sure nothing he says will be believed skow nodded right dont worry geli assured him the president will never see tennant again in twentyfour hours hell be as dead as his brother chapter it was dark by the time we reached raleigh highway turned to i and then we were rolling back through research triangle park moving west toward tennessee look at that rachel said watching the familiar lights drift by when its dark like this i can almost believe you could drop me off at my house in durham and i could go inside and make a cup of tea you know better now she looked at me for a long time then sighed in the dark im sorry i got you into this i said i havent really apologized yet i got myself into it no i did that when i chose you as my analyst the weariness in rachels face told me she was accustomed to dealing with other peoples guilt dont start trying to figure out the vagaries of fate if a butterfly had flapped its wings in malaysia before you called you would have found someone else thats the way life is id said that kind of thing to myself before but in this case i didnt believe it no i sought you out because youre the best at what you do and jungian analysts arent like psychologists one on every corner i know it sounds juvenile but i have this feeling i was meant to find you she looked at me with infinitely perceptive eyes but beneath her perception i saw pain somehow i had prodded a deep nerve when she spoke it was in a voice devoid of emotion its easy to tell ourselves that whatever happens to us was meant to be its comforting it gives us a sense that theres some larger plan i thought my husband and i were meant to be together but we werent it was just a bad choice that i rationalized as fate its pathetic really pathetic that marriage gave you your son who died frightened and in pain at the age of five her tone had a warning edge to it id seen many children die during my years practicing medicine and i knew how it could affect parents they could be shattered beyond recovery even hospital staff werent immune the exoskeleton of professionalism melts easily in the presence of a suffering child for me that sufferingthe agony of innocentswas one of the primary obstacles to believing in god you and your son gave each other five years of unconditional love would you rather hed never lived to spare you both the pain at the end she fixed me with an indignant glare youll say anything wont you you dont observe any boundaries not when ive earned the right to cross them i was speaking of the loss of my own child and she knew it she looked out the window again lets not talk about this we dont have to talk at all but we need supplies im going to stop at an allnight walmart in winstonsalem or asheville that gives you a couple of hours to sleep i am exhausted she admitted come here what lean over here on your shoulder no be brave curl up on the seat and lay your head on my lap she shook her head but not in refusal i kept my eyes on the road after a few moments she pulled off her shoes then folded her legs on the seat and laid her head on my right thigh i sensed that her eyes were open but i didnt look down i lowered my right hand and began to stroke her forehead sliding my fingers back into her hair this reminds me of when i was a little girl she said im not talking to you close your eyes after a while she did we hit asheville at pm a brightly lit walmart store appeared like an oasis out of the dark and i pulled off the interstate rachels head was still in my lap and my right leg was nearly numb she didnt respond when i spoke i was tempted to leave her in the truck while i went into the store but i didnt want her to wake up alone in the parking lot there was also a chance that the local police had received an apb on the fishermans stolen pickup to avoid being ambushed when we came out of the store i awakened rachel and posted her just inside the glass doors where she could see anyone who took an undue interest in our maroon ram i went straight to the sporting goods department and began piling items beside an unattended cash register a twoman tent sleeping bags backpacks a coleman lantern a stove ring and fuel from another aisle i selected two silent shadow camouflage jumpsuits camo headgear rubber camo boots and insulated underwear one aisle over again i chose a compound bow eight arrows and a quiver i topped off my pile with a compass a pair of binoculars a gerber knife water purification tablets a maglite and two batterypowered walkietalkies then i went in search of a salesperson to ring it all up the young mexican woman i found was suspicious of my cash while she checked each hundreddollar bill for authenticity i went to the toiletries section and got toothpaste toothbrushes and soap the total purchase came to after paying i pushed my cart to the front of the store and left it with rachel then took another to the grocery section and grabbed enough basics to keep us alive for a couple of weeks plus some bottled water as i went through the checkout aisle i thought how amazing it was that i could pull off the highway late at night and in one stop outfit myself for longterm survival in the wilderness my father wouldnt have believed it rachel made an okay sign with her hand while i checked out and i breathed a little easier the rentacop at the exit stopped me but only to check my receipt against what was in my cart ten seconds later we were walking through the parking lot i tossed everything behind the seat then helped rachel inside and started back toward i just before we reached the interstate i turned into the parking lot of a best western motel and parked between two trucks on the back side one was a blue dodge ram with a horse trailer attached using a screwdriver from our glove box i removed the texas license plate from that ram and exchanged it for the plate on our maroon one then i drove up the access ramp to i and headed west toward the tennessee line which lay somewhere in the appalachian mountains before us soon rachel was snoring softly her head on my lap again i tuned the radio to a station playing david gray and let my eyes blur until all they tracked were the edges of the road we were driving into my past into the forests of my youth a world of strange contrasts and indelible memories the oak ridge national laboratory was one of the most hightech installations in the country yet it was nestled in thickly forested wilderness there i had gone to school with the children of brilliant men and women from chicago and new york and the children of emaciated men and women whod never left the county where they were born some of the scientists found the rural setting boring if not downright disturbing but for my family the wooded mountains surrounding oak ridge had been a paradise there were several isolated spots around oak ridge where we could hide but one was perfect for us last year id heard from a boyhood friend that because of budget constraints the government was closing the frozen head state park my brother and i had camped there countless times and by now the mountainous park would be deserted but for a few fanatical hikers who wouldnt bother anyone enjoying the same illicit recreation they sought we crossed the tennessee line at the south end of the pisgah national forest then we broke out of the big trees and by midnight we were passing through knoxville i continued west on and in less than thirty minutes we were driving through oak ridge americas secret city of the second world war today it is known worldwide for its nuclear facilities but during world war two it hadnt even existed on maps between and the year i left it for alabamaoak ridge had grown into something resembling a normal american town but it never quite was there was always a shared sense of mission in oak ridge and the proof of the towns value was invisible but ever present we who lived there knew that in the event of nuclear war we would be vaporized in the first few minutes even in the dark i could see that the city had grown since id left it there were more franchise restaurants on the strip more chain stores but the towns heart was still the laboratory and the old wartime uranium piles which drew tourists curious to see the tools that had won the war against the japanese leaving oak ridge on highway ours was the only vehicle on the road we skirted the base of big brushy mountain on the far side of which lay the state penitentiary three county lines intersected in this isolated area a mistshrouded world populated by the descendants of coal miners and moonshiners they clung tenaciously to existence in the shadowy hollows and along the abandoned strip mines that still scarred these mountains i turned north on a narrow road that wound past the hamlet of petros and then the prison a starkly depressing enclosure lit by a harsh mercury glow and surrounded by razorwire fences north of the prison the road began to twist back upon itself like a wounded snake i turned left on a track that had no map number but which i remembered well before long i would come to the gate of the abandoned state park which would probably be barricaded now a half mile from the gate i slowed and began looking for an opening in the trees when i saw one i braked and turned off the road and in ten seconds we had vanished i drove until the woods became too thick and the grade too steep to go farther then i parked and shut off the engine rachel hadnt stirred i reached back and pulled our sleeping bags from the gear behind the seat as i unrolled them she snapped awake and popped up out of my lap staring wideeyed in the dark what are you doing take it easy i said youre fine were there where she tried to look out the window but there was no light beneath the trees we could have been in a cave were outside oak ridge at a place called frozen head its an abandoned state park frozen head youve been asleep for hours she shook her head i cant sleep in cars well keep on not sleeping ill wake you just before dawn she blinked as though coming out of a trance then she put her hand to her mouth and grimaced did you buy us toothbrushes yes you can do that in the morning i need to pee youve got the whole forest is it safe out there i thought of telling her to watch for timber rattlers but she probably wouldnt get out if i did this is the safest youve been in twentyfour hours she climbed out of the truck and moved out of the light but didnt close the door this illuminated us like a lantern in the woods she took a long time and i started to feel anxious then raindrops began hitting the windshield and i heard her squeal she scrambled back into the truck with her jeans unbuttoned and yanked the door shut its pouring she cried fastening her pants rains good for us it deadens sound when you walk in the woods she pulled a sleeping bag over her chest and shuddered i dont want to offend you but this sucks we couldnt stay in some cheap motel no one in the world knows where we are now so no one can find out thats the way we want it go to sleep she nodded and settled against her door i sat listening to the symphony of rain and the ticking engine recalling predawn vigils with my father and brother waiting for our chance at ducks or deer i was exhausted but i knew id wake before the sun some primitive part of my brain that lay dormant in cities awakened in the wilderness and whispered the forest rhythms to me with unfailing accuracy that whisper told me when dawn was close when rain was coming when game was moving i pulled my sleeping bag up to my chin good night i said to rachel steady breathing was her only reply i woke as the first dim shade of blue showed through the trees i blinked several times then surveyed the scene without moving my head seeing nothing i gently shook rachel awake again she jerked erect but not in quite the panic of last night time to go i said okay she mumbled but she looked ready to go back to sleep i got out and relieved my bladder then unloaded the gear from behind the seat i put most of it into my own pack giving rachel only her sleeping bag some canned food and a couple of fuel bottles when she got out i handed her a silent shadow camouflage jumpsuit heavy socks and boots she made a wry face but she took the clothes and went behind the truck while she changed i fixed the quiver and compound bow to my pack then i slipped into my jumpsuit and boots as i shouldered my pack the forest seemed to grow lighter all at once and i knew the sun was topping windrock mountain to the east rachel came around the truck looking like photos id seen of female israeli soldiers she shouldered her pack without much trouble and she didnt complain about the weight if your friends could see you now i said clipping a walkietalkie to her belt theyd be rolling on the ground laughing i stuffed our street clothes into her pack watch the ground step where i step and watch for briers catching your clothes if we get separated use the walkietalkie but very quietly okay dont speak unless its an emergency if i hold up my hand stop grab my belt if i go too fast were not in a hurry youre going to see animals out here move calmly away from snakes and ignore the rest she nodded where exactly are we going there are caves on the mountain hikers know about some but theres one thats almost unknown my dad and i found it when i was a kid thats the one we want she smiled im as ready as im going to get we followed the path left by the trucks tires until we reached the road then piled some brush over the open place i crossed the road and began looking for a springfed tributary of the new river a small creek that cut its way down the mountain through a rocky defile about fifty feet deep that defile would be our route up the mountain the park service had blazed a trail that paralleled the creek but i didnt want to risk running into any hikers i also worried about locals growing marijuana in the closed park during lean times that temptation was great for the descendants of moonshiners and they tended to frown upon trespassers they boobytrapped their fields and shot before asking questions i soon found the creek and by the time daylight illuminated the forest we were shindeep in water picking our way up the defile gnarled tree roots threaded through its walls like arthritic hands and boulders big as cars lined the ravine the creek was shallow and wide in some places but narrowed to gurgling channels in others i saw deer tracks and scat and once what looked like the track of a bear that made me a little anxious about the cave there was constant scuttling in the brush rabbits and armadillos flushed from cover by our passing every few minutes i turned to check on rachel but she seemed to be holding up well she slipped on wet rocks a few times but moving uphill on slick stone was no task for beginners i was stepping over a waterlogged branch when i smelled smoke on the wind i stopped in my tracks hoping the smell was a hikers campfire it wasnt it was good virginia tobacco i held up my hand but there was no need rachel had halted the second she saw me stop without moving my head i scanned the rocks and trees ahead nothing moved but creek water and raindrops sliding off the leaves overhead i raised my gaze and searched the low limbs of the forest canopy a poacher in a deer stand was a possibility but a real hunter would know that smoking a cigarette would kill his chances of bagging a deer even out of season i saw nothing in the trees moving my head slightly i searched the rim of the defile first the right side then the left nothing i sniffed the air again the odor was gone rachel tugged at the back of my belt whats the matter she whispered i turned and saw fear in her face be quiet i mouthed stay still she nodded another wave of tobacco scent wafted past me stronger than before i turned very slowly and for some reason looked up forty yards away a man dressed in black ballistic nylon leaned over the rim of the defile and flicked a cigarette butt down into the creek my heart clenched but i remained still the butt tumbled in the air a flash of white against green then hit the water and floated toward us the man followed the butt with his eyes i was certain we were about to be seen but the man suddenly looked away and took something off his shoulder a black assault rifle an m he leaned it against a tree unzipped his fly and began to urinate off the small cliff he played like a little boy aiming his stream for the creek but not quite reaching it a boy would have been able to reach it this was a man in his late thirties and he was wearing body armor i prayed that rachel wouldnt panic she might not have seen the rifleman at first but she couldnt miss the long golden arc glinting in the early light the man stopped urinating with a few desultory flourishes then shook himself zipped up and picked up the m as he shouldered the rifle he looked down the creek right at us i held my breath and waited for our eyes to lock the riflemans gaze passed over us then returned he squinted then looked farther down the creek again it was the camouflage suits and headgear he couldnt distinguish us from the background of creek and brush as i watched he moved his head to the right in a strange way as though he had a nervous tick but then i realized he was speaking into a collar microphone i heard the faint metallic squawk of a reply but couldnt make out distinct words then the rifleman turned and walked back into the trees numb with disbelief i turned back to rachel who was staring at me in confusion whats the matter she whispered you didnt see that what the guy up there pissing off the cliff her eyes went wide he had a rifle i didnt see anything i was watching you i thought youd seen a snake or something were going back to the truck now her face had lost its color what about the cave its blown theyre waiting for us up there they cant be they are the guy was carrying an ml and wearing body armor deer hunters around here look a little different but weve come all this way prickly heat covered my skin what do you care i dont i meanthat cave just sounded safe its not a new awareness smoldered in the dark of my mind they knew we were coming before my thoughts could go further i found myself listening with absolute concentration i wasnt sure what id heard but it was something a movement that didnt fit the usual sound track of the forest i cursed silently the rain that had dampened the sound of our steps was now giving cover to our enemies or were they only my enemies as understanding flashed into my mind another faint squawk broke the silence and i knew there was another rifleman within fifty feet of me stepping quietly behind rachel i clapped one hand over her mouth and whipped my other arm around her chest pinning her against me with all my strength she tried to scream but no sound passed her lips i stood in the creek without moving water pulling at my legs rachel struggled against me the backpack made it hard to hold her i was afraid she might bite my hand but she didnt that alone kept alive doubt that it was she who had told the nsa where to find us im going to uncover your mouth i whispered if you scream ill cut your throat chapter when i let go of rachel she whirled in the creek her face a mask of terror and fury then she saw the knife in my hand the gerber id bought at walmart walk i told her back down the creek you know how to do it she stared at me a moment longer then turned and started over the rocks i sheathed my knife and unslung my bow i would stand little chance against a man with an ml but if i saw my opponent first i might get off a quick shot stick close to the right wall she moved to the right quickly picking her way from stone to stone as i followed rachel down the steep watercourse my mind filled with questions i should have asked her before but hadnt that first day when shed awakened me from my dream about fieldings death how had she unlocked the door id locked it after the fedex man left yet id awakened to find the door banging against the chain latch as rachel yelled my name and finding my house without me telling her my address i know someone in the uva personnel office shed said the university would have been warned about giving out information on a trinity principal and the surveillance plane over the highway how had they known which of the thousands of cars between chapel hill and nags head to train their laser on one phone call from rachel while i was unconscious could have given them the audi the nags head cabin everything as for oak ridge she could easily have called them from the walmart in asheville when id posted her by the door she hadnt known about frozen head then but she did have a cell phone with a little nerve she could have called the nsa when she got out of the truck last night to pee on the other hand i still remembered leaping into the hallway of my house and finding an assassin pointing a gun at rachels back she paused as she came to a deep channel in the creek i moved close behind her in case she fell or tried to run as we negotiated the channel i thought back to how id chosen her skow had resisted my going to a nonnsa psychiatrist but had he resisted vigorously enough friends at uva had told me rachel was the best jungian analyst in the country had geli bauer been walking in my footsteps talking to everyone i talked to had she briefed rachel before my first appointment how could geli have compromised her an appeal to patriotism blackmail there was no way to know i reached out and grabbed rachels pack the creek had leveled out the road wasnt far away were close to the truck i said softly veer left here and dont step on any branches she looked back at me her eyes still furious you dont really think i poked her in the back walk she picked her path through the dripping trees with surprising agility after about forty yards i grabbed her pack again then scanned the trees ahead david you dont think i betrayed you i nodded no other explanation there has to be i peered between the wet trunks searching for anything out of place they might have figured out oak ridge but not frozen head i could have picked a dozen other spots in the mountains around here she held up her hands helplessly i dont know what to tell you i havent spoken to anyone how did you get into my house that day the first day your house i picked the lock bullshit you think so my father was a locksmith in brooklyn i grew up around the trade her explanation could be a facile lie but it had the outrageous ring of truth whats a chubb i asked off the top of my head a highquality britishmade lock i also know what a spiral tooth extractor is do you i had no idea turn around and keep walking the trucks a hundred yards ahead rachel turned and walked quickly through the trees with my bow unslung i had to be more careful the bowstring seemed to attract briers and the broadhead i was holding along the shaft of the bow kept catching on branches and shaking water onto me suddenly i heard a swish like a big buck leaping through wet foliage then i saw a flash of black between two trees freeze barked a male voice rachel stopped her back just visible between two glistening trunks beyond her stood a man wearing black nylon and a bulletproof vest he held an automatic pistol and it was trained on rachels face where is he asked the gunman who you know the doctor i nocked the arrow and slowly raised my bow i dont know what youre talking about rachel said im out here shooting a wildlife spread on deer the lie sounded effortless was she signaling the gunman with her hand wheres your camera i pulled the bowstring to full draw against my right cheek and peered through the peep sight rachels body partially blocked my shot and i didnt want to shift my weight for fear of making noise i lost it in the creek she said are you a game warden red six to red leader the gunman said into his collar radio ill tell you cried rachel i leaned to my right straining for a shot the gunman looked up from his radio all right where is he some bulletproof vests will stop a bullet but not a knife point a razorsharp broadhead should pierce what a knife would but if it didnt rachels faceor mine would disappear in a cloud of red mist i aimed for the v of the gunmans throat just above the top of his vest what will you do if you find him rachel asked thats not your problem red six crackled the radio receiver in the mans ear loud enough for us to hear this is red leader repeat your message as he reached up to key his radio rachel screamed my name and i loosed the arrow rachels scream masked any sound of impact for a moment i was afraid id hit her shed fallen to her knees but the gunman was still standing and holding his pistol why hadnt he fired had my arrow passed him without a sound my bowstring was silenced i jerked another arrow from my quiver and tried to nock it with shaking fingers red six this is red leader this better be good i expected a pistol shot but instead i heard a heavy thud that i instantly recognized when i looked up the gunman was gone id heard deer fall like that after a spine shot first came the sing of the bowstring then the kneebuckling impact and the cementsack thud of a clean kill the delay was what had thrown me this man had hung in the air like a statue unwilling to die this is red leader respond immediately rachels face was streaked with tears as adrenaline poured into my system i shoved her aside and looked down the blackclad man lay flat on his back the broadhead had pierced his throat and punched through his cervical spine he couldnt have remained standing more than a second with that injury which only proved how subjective time was in the heat of action get in the truck i told rachel where is it thirty yards on move she staggered over the fallen man and disappeared into the trees red six this is red leader what the hell are you doing i heard someone else talking through static goddamn nocount radios go find the son of a bitch tell him we got coffee up here thatll bring him the dead mans eyes were open but already as cloudy as antique glass i picked up his automatic and stuffed it into my jumpsuit pocket then i got to my knees and hefted his corpse over my shoulder i had to grab a thick branch to pull myself to my feet but i managed it and then began trudging toward the truck anyone within a hundred meters would think bigfoot was lumbering through the forest rachel was waiting by the truck her face almost bloodless i staggered to the side of the pickup and dumped the corpse into its bed when she pulled at my sleeve i spun her against the truck and untied the sleeping bag from her pack this i unzipped and threw over the dead body to anchor the opened bag i tossed both loaded backpacks on top of it get inside i snapped she did i climbed into the truck bed to retrieve the ignition key from my backpack then got behind the wheel and backed out of the trees twice i hit patches of mud i thought would bog us down but by slowly rocking the truck i managed to get clear of the woods the swat team must have heard the trucks engine by now i hit the accelerator and headed back toward the brushy mountain state prison only after id covered the first mile did i look at rachel shed set her back against the door and was watching me as she would a violent patient whats your story i asked how did they get to you she said nothing when we reached i didnt turn toward the penitentiary but toward caryville where the road intersected i you think ive been telling them where we are rachel asked i nodded why would i do that only you know that if id wanted them to find you i could have betrayed you long before now it started to rain again big fat drops that splatted like bugs on the windshield i switched on the wipers and slowed down maybe they didnt want to capture me until youd got all the information you could out of me did you call them from walmart she looked at me with scorn when that guy with the gun asked me where you were i could have told him you were right behind me you knew i had an arrow pointed at your back frustration tightened her face think david i could have hit you in the head with a rock just now while you put that corpse in the truck ill think later right now i have to run we drove in silence for a while heading toward the deep divide that marked the line between morgan and anderson counties a bridge appeared ahead despite the rain there wasnt much water under it but the gorge was deep cut by years of water flowing from strip mines higher up about a third of the way across i pulled the truck close to the rail and stopped taking the key out of the ignition i got out and climbed into the bed of the truck the sleeping bag covering the corpse was soggy with rain i kicked it aside wrestled the corpse onto my shoulder then stood and heaved it over the bridge rail it crashed through some branches and hit the rocks below the sleeping bag was bloody so i tossed it over as well then i got back into the cab and drove on staying right at sixty on the twisting road i didnt know you had that in you rachel said in a dead voice i cant believe youre the man who wrote so movingly about compassion and ethics this is survival everybody has it in them you included no she said quietly i wont kill you would i looked her full in the face you just havent been put in the right situation yet think what you want i know myself the road was gradually straightening i accelerated to seventy and shut rachel out of my thoughts i felt alone again as alone as i had on the day fielding died i hadnt realized the degree to which rachel had been a comfort the hardest thing to accept about her betrayal was that it meant she had never seen me as anything more than a patient a sick and deluded man a wave of heat rolled through me leaving deep fatigue in its wake i hoped it was a postadrenaline crash but the ringing vibration in my teeth told me otherwise i would soon be unconscious and this time i couldnt trust rachel to take care of me whats the matter she asked looking intently at me youre weaving over the center line nothing get over youre in the wrong lane i jerked the wheel back to the right maybe the strain of dumping the corpse had made me especially vulnerable to an attack there was nothing gradual about this one i had to stop the truck pull over rachel yelled trying desperately to keep my eyes open i swerved onto a small logging road and managed to cover about a hundred yards before i had to stop i got the truck into park then pulled the dead mans automatic from my jumpsuit and aimed it at rachel get out what get out and leave your cell phone in here do it she looked out the window as though she were being asked to leap off a cliff you cant just put me out here ill let you back in after i wake up if youre still here david theyll find us let me drive i jerked the gun at her do what i said she laid her cell phone on the seat then climbed out of the truck and closed the door her dark eyes watched me through the rainspattered glass as i leaned over and locked her door the black wave rolled over me a city gate stood high before me a plain arch in a wall of yellow stone people lined the road some waving palm fronds and cheering others weeping men held a donkey for me and i climbed upon its back the symbolism was important there was a prophecy to fulfill this is the eastern gate master are you sure i am i passed through the gate on the donkeys back i heard horns blowing roman soldiers watched me with wary eyes women ran into the street to touch my robe my hair the faces in the narrow street were hungry not for food but for hope for a reason to live the road vanished and became a columned temple i sat on the steps and spoke quietly to a large group they listened with curious uncertain faces the words they spoke were not the words in their minds the words in their minds were all the same is he the one is it possble you know how to interpret the appearance of earth and sky i told them why do you not know how to interpret the present time i have cast fire upon the world and i am guarding it until it blazes i watched the faces words meant different things to different people men seized upon what they wanted discarded the rest someone asked from whence i came better to answer in riddles split a piece of wood and i am there lift up the stone and you will find me i left the temple and walked the alleys of the city i wanted privacy but i was accosted from all sides priests came to me and questioned me blind men could see more by what authority do you say and do these things they asked i smiled john baptized the people did his authority come from heaven or from men the priests answered out of fear of the mob of this we are not certain then i shall not tell you by whose authority i do these things i left them seething in the street but it did no good they came to me upon a hill and questioned me at length my answers drove them mad only a little while am i with you i said then i go back from whence i came whither i go you cannot come you shall seek me and not find me you are of this world i am not they called me a liar yet a little while the light is with you i said walk while you have the light lest darkness come upon you he that follows me shall never walk in darkness even as i watched them i saw my doom in their eyes yet i could not turn from my path in one priests eyes i saw hatred and also the death that he saw for me a roman punishment but pain was not my greatest fear a strong man could stand pain what i could not endure was to be alone alone again for all time rachel was screaming i blinked in confusion and then the door at my left shoulder was yanked open i tried to turn and see who was there but sleep closed over me again like quicksand chapter geli bauer rubbed her eyes with one hand and poured strong coffee into her mug with the other she was waiting for john skows wife to bring him to the phone she had slept three hours on the cot where she and ritter had made love last night she almost never dreamed these days but an old recurring nightmare of pursuit by soldiers had returned in the dream she always killed herself before they reached her the terror before that act of release was nearly unbearable geli skow said in her headset his voice exhausted he had spent all night with the godin four supercomputer piecing together a threat to the president from digital recordings of tennants voice geli had already awakened him once to tell him shed received a report of a man missing from one of their swat details at that point there had been no proof that tennant had been there but now the swat team at frozen head found their missing man she said hed been dumped into a creek bed from a highway bridge he had an arrow in his throat did tennant do it i think so ive been reviewing his background he did a lot of hunting when he was a kid probably bowhunted in the early season where the hell would he get a bow and arrows were checking the security tapes of stores along the routes between the ferry and oak ridge he was obviously planning to hole up for a while on that mountain what i want to know is this how did you know where he would be i told you i cant give you that your secret source is dr weiss isnt it geli who else could it be how else could you know about frozen head park if it was dr weiss youd know it already geli knew better thats why you were so skittish about a shoottokill order you knew your informer might be killed what i dont get is why you didnt tell me she was helping us i could have protected her you have a habit of asking questions above your pay grade i dont have a fucking pay grade i make ten times what you do but you still take orders from me she wanted to reach through the phone and crush his windpipe but selfdiscipline slowly reasserted itself when did you last talk to godin its been longer than id like skow admitted the nsa man sounded nervous and he wasnt trying to hide it what are the extended trips godin and nara have been taking for the past few weeks they fly west and disappear for three and four days at a time where are they going you must have dug deeper than that she would not be drawn in so easily whoevers handling security on that end is very good a dry chuckle from skow you have no idea why arent you with them no answer how is all this related to fieldings pocket watch im sorry geli things she had noticed over the past few weeks began to push themselves to the forefront of her thoughts zach levin and his interface team were laid off five weeks ago they seem to have dropped off the face of the earth why would a whole technical team be dropped skow didnt reply she searched for a question he could answer does the person handling security wherever godin is control your ultrasecret source in the ensuing silence she realized that skows reticence was not meant to offend her he had the paralysis of a man trapped between duty and fear has this secret source told you where tennant is going next youll get another list of destinations soon ill get it to you as soon as i have it you do that she tried to push the mystery of peter godins location from her mind how public is our derangedassassin story now its still inside the beltway but itll spread fast the dc police will get it this morning i didnt want to go wide with it until i finished last nights project i listened to the recording again a few minutes ago its rock solid it better be what are you going to do now wait here for something anything a whisper of where tennant might be and then im going to go there myself i dont trust anyone else at this point go there how godins jetranger is still on the helipad you have any problem with me taking it no ill keep the pilot on standby for you after a pause skow said getting tennant is personal for you isnt it geli took a sip of hot coffee and held it in her mouth i think you cared more for ritter than anyone knew skow added she swallowed youre a shrink now something just hit me if youre so sure that weiss is my secret source tennant may conclude the same thing i mean as you said how else could that swat have been waiting at frozen head go on if tennant decides weiss is informing on him hell dump her we should put out an apb on her and cover the phones and homes of everyone shes close to ive already covered everybody she might call but not for that reason tennant wont leave dr weiss anywhere why not hes in love with her he cant ignore logic that obvious geli laughed softly of course he can people do it all the time chapter i snapped awake with a rush of terror rachel was behind the wheel of the pickup truck and we were moving i lay crumpled on the floor on the passenger side pulling myself onto the seat i saw that we were racing down a deserted rural highway there was nothing behind us but empty road how did you get in i asked did i not lock the door she didnt look at me you locked it there was a piece of heavy wire in the truck bed i made a hook and pulled the lock from inside the doorframe where are we almost to caryville from the signs it looks like i runs through there i shook the remnants of the jerusalem dream from my head how long had i been unconscious wheres the swat team looking for us im sure i was certain that rachel had betrayed our destination to the nsa so why was she driving me down a deserted road maybe she was driving back toward frozen head i know what youre thinking she said but youre wrong someone else had to know about frozen head park maybe you told someone at trinity about it ravi nara before you started hating each other no youre the only person alive who knew about that cave at least about its connection to me i rolled down the window leaned out and scanned the sky i saw nothing at least in the space visible between the trees that lined the narrow blacktop was there any reason geli bauers people wouldnt move in if they knew where i was i couldnt think of one anything geli wanted from me she would get quicker by torturing me than by following me if youre not helping them why are you still with me rachel looked at me then her eyes filled with sadness im not even going to answer that i wanted to believe in her but id be a fool to do so look if you didnt tell them about frozen head they could not have been waiting there youre missing something she insisted you have to be no my father and brother are dead the nsa would have to be able to read my mind to know i froze with my mouth open revelation had stunned me like a blow to the head david whats the matter theyve done it i whispered good god done what trinity theyve got a prototype up and running how do you know i put a shaking hand to my forehead somewhere in america the supermri scan of my brain had been loaded into a trinity computer and that neuromodel now existedat least to some degreeas david tennant i felt as if the people hunting me had discovered i had a twin brother an evil twin who shared all my memories and would betray me on demand the feeling of violation was absolute my mind was my most sacred refuge from the world i felt raped in some incomprehensible way robbed of my individuality where else are they waiting for me i wondered david dont shut me out she pleaded talk to me they have my memories rachel they have me loaded into their computer thats how they knew to be waiting at frozen head they dont have to chase us anymore they know what ill do before i do it thats impossible no thats exactly what theyve been working toward for two years i know these people i know peter godin and i know its true she slowed the truck for a hairpin turn youre saying that fielding was right theyve been working on the computer somewhere else all along yes while fielding and i screwed around trying to figure out the mri side effects they were building the goddamn thing at some secret location i slapped the dashboard thats why they laid off certain teams during the suspension what are you talking about after we suspended the project groups of engineers were told to take paid leave sometimes there were only skeleton crews in the building the team most conspicuously absent was the interface team led by a guy named zach levin whats the interface team the team responsible for trying to communicate with the neuromodels once theyre successfully loaded remember what i said at the amphitheater if you download a human brain into a computer what do you really have a deaf dumb blind and paralyzed human being scared to death half the battle is giving that brain eyes ears and a voice thats the job of the interface team with the project suspended it made sense for them to be laid off but now i see god i wish fielding were here rachel glanced at me but if they were that close to success why kill fielding if godin actually made trinity work would anyone really care about medical side effects or anything else youve got a point if theyve really done it godin will be almost invulnerable we dont have enough information maybe my hands went cold oh god what is it i know why they killed fielding why they could afford to what do you mean yesterday john skow announced that he wasnt going to replace fielding i thought he was crazy but now i understand if they have a prototype computer up and running fielding isnt dead rachel turned to me in confusion what does that mean i mean they can load fieldings neuromodel the same way theyve loaded mine theyll have andrew fieldings mind at their fingertips he can solve their remaining problems for them she drove for a few moments without speaking okay lets just say this is possible for a minute why would fielding help the people who murdered him an eerie feeling of admiration came over me peter godin was more ruthless than i ever imagined fieldings neuromodel will help them because it wont know hes been murdered it was made six months ago when fielding was scanned by the supermri it has no memories of anything thats happened since then that andrew fielding doesnt even know he married lu li david this cant be happening sure it can we just happen to be standing close to a revolutionary leap in science splitting the atom unraveling the human genome cloning a sheep what youre talking about isnt like those things liberating consciousness from the human body i thought about it youre right this is bigger because it will give us the ability to make those kinds of advances at an exponential rate or not us exactly whatever you call the new form of consciousness that trinity will evolve into and it will evolve very fast you dont know for sure that theyve done it theyre at least part of the way there maybe they just have a crude version up and running maybe they can access my memoriespull out images for examplebut not actually operate the model as a functioning mind human memory is ravi naras specialty and they made a lot of progress in that area early on theres just no way to know rachel touched my arm if youre right what do they know about what were doing now nothing i hope they cant read my mind in any mystical way they probably have my memories from childhood up to six months ago when i was scanned by the supermri as for my thought processes my judgment my personalitythat would take a fully functional computer and if they have that what the president wont care what happened to a couple of doctors the nation accepts more casualties to build a skyscraper or a bridge you and i are a negligible price to pay for the strategic superiority trinity will bring if theyve truly completed trinity were dead she pointed through the windshield theres caryville and i are we going north or south pull over she slowed gradually then turned the wheel and stopped on the shoulder just short of the northbound onramp im trying to escape from myself i thought aloud to do that we have to make utterly random choices but how random can my choices be i suppose we could flip a coin every time we come to an intersection like this rachel was shaking her head they dont have a scan of my brain they cant predict anything i would do ill just make the choices from now on she saw doubt in my eyes you still dont trust me its not that but by now geli bauer knows everything there is to know about you she knows things even you dont remember rachels lips compressed into a white line i hate her i hate her and i dont even know her i know but hates not going to save us why cant we just disappear into nowhere pay cash at a noname motel in a noname town back this truck up to a fence and go to sleep for three days america is a big place even for the nsa you ever watch americas most wanted they catch criminals every week who try what you just suggested television makes america a lot smaller than you think i leaned back in my seat and tried to let instinct take over cars and trucks passed in both directions some slowly others shaking the truck with the wind they threw off as i sat there the situation began to clarify itself in three days we would get a chance to see the president our problem was staying alive long enough to talk to him the odds of that were long and getting longer even if we did reach matthews id have to convince him that i was telling the truth and that everyone else involved in project trinity was lying to do that i needed hard evidence and i had none my other optiongoing publicwould only convince the president that i was the loose cannon everyone at trinity claimed i was and alienate the one man who could save us three days how long are we going to sit here rachel asked give me a minute hiding was not the answer running wasnt either not in any conventional way we needed to take a step so radical that no entity in the world could predict it but what as i stared through the windshield at the oncoming traffic i realized i was sitting here with rachel for one reason my dreams my dreams had brought us together without my dreams we would both have been shot back at my house yet i was no closer to understanding them than i had been on the day i first walked into rachels office for months they had progressed like a persistent message being sent from a distant radio source in the beginning the incomprehensible images had troubled and even frightened me but over timeand especially during the past three weeksa conviction had begun to crystallize within me that something important was being communicated to me of course schizophrenics felt the same conviction what separated me from them i closed my eyes and tried to blank my mind but the opposite happened i suddenly saw a walled city on a hill its stones glowing yellow in the sun there was a gate set in its face the eastern gate whispered a voice in my head jerusalem never had i experienced a vision while awake i opened my eyes and saw rachel staring at the dashboard i closed my eyes again but the city vanished like the afterimage of a flashbulb david whats wrong with your eyes nothing i rubbed my temples and tried to open my mind to whatever was coming id felt drawn to specific places before during my twenties id traveled a lot and while i was usually driven by student wanderlust there were times when something deeper had pulled me off my planned track while visiting oxford university id awakened one morning with a feeling that i needed to get to stonehengenot just to see it but to be in the presence of the sarsen stones my companion assured me that there was no rush the stones had been standing for five thousand years and would surely wait another few days but still i rented a car and drove south until i reached salisbury plain after darkness fell i approached the ancient ring alone and did what tourists can do no longer walked among the stones in the moonlight and lay upon the sacrificial altar i was no new age dilettante but a medical student from the university of virginia looking toward a stable career yet this wasnt the only time such a thing had happened i was drawn to chichen itza the same way and on a drive to the grand canyon i changed course and camped at chaco canyon in new mexico for a week instead in greece it was delphi over athens in all these situations i had felt an external pull as though something were calling me to a specific place what i felt now was different an internal compulsion to travel to jerusalem whatever the consequences that the city was sacred to three great religions was irrelevant i had nothing in common with the faithful millions planning pilgrimages to the holy land i sensed only that the city held answers for me answers that could be found nowhere else where are we going rachel asked irritably israel i said what jerusalem david its because dont tell me because of your hallucinations right yes she reached out and lifted my chin then looked deeply into my eyes david people are trying to kill us the government is trying to kill us youve been having hallucinations for reasons we dont understand but which may have been caused by damage to your brain and you want to use those hallucinations to guide you in trying to save our lives whoever will save his life shall lose it what i turned up my palms im not saying this will save our lives im saying that if im going to be hunted down and killed id rather it happen while im trying to learn the meaning of something i believe has meaning you truly believe your hallucinations have meaning yes why i cant explain it logically its just something i know like a bird flying south she sighed like an exhausted mother talking to a child try okay try to explain i closed my eyes and searched for words to explain the inexplicable i feel as though ive been chosen for what im not sure chosen by whom god god god yes she took a deep breath and folded her hands in her lap she was clearly struggling to remain calm i think its time you told me what these recent hallucinations have been about are you still dreaming that youre jesus yes whats different about these visions as compared to the older ones why have you hidden them from me wed finally arrived at the line between sanity and the rubber room i was glad we were in a truck on a highway and not in rachels office there was no one she could call to have me committed because i no longer believe theyre hallucinations or dreams i think theyre memories she expelled air in a frustrated rush memories my god david whats happening in these dreams im reliving parts of jesus life his travels to jerusalem his experiences there i hear voices my own the disciples rachel what i see in my head is more real than what i see around me and events are moving rapidly im approaching the crucifixion she was shaking her head in disbelief how could you have twothousandyearold memories that only entered your mind in the past six months i dont know these dreams make you feel some urgency to get to israel i hadnt thought of my feeling as urgency before but that was what it was what id perceived as generalized anxiety was really a slowly developing compulsion to travel to the setting of my dreams to the holy land i said yes are you afraid youll die in real life if you dont get there before you dream of the crucifixion maybe mainly i have a sense that if i dont get there soon ill lose the chance to understand what my dreams are trying to tell me rachel stared at the oncoming traffic her head rocking back and forth then she suddenly turned to me her eyes bright and wide do you realize what day it is no were less than a week away from the easter holiday i blinked so were approaching the traditional dates of jesus death and resurrection not only in your dreams but also in the real world youre saying the two are connected of course somehow the approach of easter is causing you to have these dreams this anxiety youre like the people who thought the world would end when the millennium turned dont you see this is all part of a delusional system i shook my head and smiled youre wrong but youre right about the dates they could be important rachel was watching me as she would someone who was playing an elaborate joke on her what about meeting the president well do it when we get back what difference does a couple of days make especially if it keeps us alive she closed her eyes and spoke softly did you tell andrew fielding about your hallucinations yes what did he say he told me to pay attention to them fielding always said that in trying to build trinity we were walking in the footprints of god he didnt know how right he was perfect two peas in a pod rachel put her hands on the wheel as though to pull onto the road but she left the truck in park you really intend to follow these hallucinations to israel yes and you admit they might be the result of brain damage not brain damage as you think of it i thought of fieldings excitement as he expounded his theory of consciousness disturbances to the quantum processes in my brain rachel was squeezing the steering wheel so hard that her knuckles were white youre like someone who dreamed he was once a pharaoh deciding to go to egypt to find the meaning of his life i suppose i am i know how crazy it sounds the thing is we dont have a better alternative if it makes you feel better were going because we need to do something the trinity computer cant possibly predict it cant predict youd go to israel no it was my supermri scan that caused my dreams to start my neuromodel has no memory of dreams that occurred after that theres not even any mention of jerusalem in your medical records because i stopped going to you before the city took center stage in my dreams rachel looked thoughtful going to israel isnt like going to paris you know the countrys in a permanent state of war ive been there they pay close attention to who goes in and out el al has four times the security of other airlines and were being hunted by the american government as soon as we tried to book a ticket theyd be waiting for us at the airport youre right we need fake passports she laughed bitterly you say that like we need to pick up some bread and milk on the way home i have eighteen thousand dollars left there has to be a way to get fake passports with that fake passports wont cut it in israel those people deal with terrorists every day being jailed in israel is better than being murdered here rachel leaned back in her seat and sighed youve got a point im going to new york with eighteen grand i can find a fake passport there i know it what about me you can go you can not go its up to you she nodded as though shed expected this i see what will happen to me if i dont i thought about geli bauer you want me to lie to you rachel put the truck in gear and pulled onto the northbound onramp accelerating fast new york i asked no where then she looked at me her face less guarded than id ever seen it do you want me to come with you or not i did more than that i felt she was supposed to go with me i want you with me rachel for a lot of reasons she laughed dryly thats good because you couldnt make it without me passing out by yourself in the street isnt very healthy if id left you back there in the truck youd be dead now i know that are you coming she passed a tanker truck and eased back into the right lane if you want to go to israel we have to go to washington dc first i stiffened in my seat all my doubts about her had returned in a nauseating rush why washington because i know someone there who can help us who i wanted to probe her eyes for deception but she kept them on the road i treated a lot of women when i practiced in new york mostly women actually and some of them had problems with their husbands and sometimes the courts gave husbands access to their children despite evidence of physical abuse some of the wives were so afraid of what might happen that they felt they had no alternative but to run i felt a tingle in my palms youre talking about custody situations kidnapping your own children she nodded its not difficult to hide from the police if youre alone but with children its tough you have to enroll them in school get medical care things like that she glanced at me her face taut these women have a network sort of an underground railroad that takes resources new identities i said yes for a child the foundation of a new identity is a birth certificate for an adult a social security card and a passport i dont know many details but i know that the people who help these women are in washington these women buy fake passports in washington dc rachel shook her head theyre not fake theyre real real what do you mean she cut her eyes at me reluctant to give up what she knew theres a woman who works in one of the passport offices in dc she had a problem with her husband years ago shes sympathetic to the cause i dont know who she is but i know someone i can call a former patient the cause i said this is still going on yes i sent a woman from chapel hill to them a doctors wife wow theres only one serious problem i can see rachel said whats that youre a man i dont know if theyll do anything to help you chapter when the security door buzzed open this time geli knew it was skow she also knew it was bad news because she hadnt been off the phone with him long and the nsa man had sounded too exhausted to get out of bed she spun her chair and saw him striding toward her for the first time wearing something besides his brooks brothers suit today it was khakis and an mit sweatshirt skows eyes had dark bags under them but he still looked more like a university administrator than an expert on information warfare you look like shit geli told him i feel worse you wouldnt be here if this was good news youre right ravi nara called me as soon as you and i hung up skow flopped into the chair behind her give me one of your cigarettes you dont smoke oh geli the things you dont know about me she shook a gauloise from her pack lit it and passed it to him skow took a deep drag and exhaled without coughing these are nasty where did nara call from skow shook his head everything in time i want you to listen to me now she crossed her legs and waited you and i have always held back a lot from each other but now is the time to come clean or as clean as we can im listening godin has always compartmentalized everything at trinity so i dont know what you know you know were working on artificial intelligence but do you know exactly how tell me were using advanced mri technology to make molecular scans of the brain then trying to load those scans into a revolutionary type of supercomputer go on our goal is to create artificial intelligence not by reverseengineering the brain but by digitally copying it the result if it works is not a computer that works like a human brain but a computer that for all practical purposes is a specific persons brain you understand geli had thought the mri scans were being used to study the brains architecture not as the actual basis of a machine the principle sounds fairly straightforward skow gave a hollow laugh in theory it is and it will be accomplished sooner or later but the difference between sooner and later is critically important to you and me why because peter godin is dying something fluttered in her chest at this confirmation of an unacknowledged suspicion images of godin flashed behind her eyes facial swelling his drooping mouth his clumsy gait dying how peter has a brain tumor ravi nara discovered it six months ago when the original scans for the neuromodels were made thats why you havent been able to contact godin these past two days when hes not working directly on trinity hes under treatment geli shifted in her chair how close to death is he its a matter of hours now a day at most the tumor was inoperable even at the early stage where ravi found it peter thought if the government knew he had a terminal cancer it wouldnt commit the resources necessary to make trinity a reality so he and ravi made a deal ravi would keep the tumor secret and treat peter with steroids to keep him functioning long enough to complete trinity i hate to think what ravi asked for in return naras a weasel agreed the point is theres been a hidden agenda at trinity from the beginning peter godin has been building trinity to save his own life what do you mean if the trinity computer were to be completed before he died peters neuromodel could be loaded into it his body would die but he would continue to exist in the computer as peter godin geli blinked in disbelief theres no way in hell i believe that skow laughed not only is it possible its inevitable its just not going to happen this week if thats true then couldnt godins neuromodel or whatever be loaded into the computer after his death as well whenever trinity is finished of course but in that scenario peter would have to die without being certain it would happen hed have to die the way every other human being in history has and hed have to trust us to resurrect him in the machine i see she was trying to absorb the implications of godins imminent death so why exactly are you here skow took another drag on the gauloise and fixed her with a nobullshit stare im here to save your ass right along with mine i wasnt aware it needed saving it does because project trinity is about to fail now she understood the ship was sinking and the rats were looking for lifeboats but you said success is inevitable eventually yes but godins going to die before he can get the computer operational and theres no one left who can take it to the next level fieldings dead ravis already contributed what he can the remaining work is out of his league and if we fail to deliver a working trinity computer after spending almost a billion dollars a billion skow looked impatient geli the trinity prototype is built largely of carbon nanotubes thats not just cuttingedge technology weve had to create a whole new science the expense of the materials r and d alone is staggering same for the holographic memory research we okay i get it her brain was working in survival mode you said that when godins not under treatment hes working on trinity where is he working mountain view skow shook his head theres another trinity research facility i wont tell you where that is until we come to some agreement but it was set up two years ago right after we learned that the president was going to insist on having tennant here for ethical oversight godin knew the day might come when he needed to work on trinity without tennant or the government knowing what he was doing so he made it happen her perception of the situation changed with each sentence so where does trinity stand right now a total writeoff no at this moment were partly operational it was the trinity prototype that predicted tennant would run to frozen head tennants neuromodel basically told us where he would be geli could hardly believe this you saw this yourself no but ive seen the prototype and its beyond imagination thats where you got frozen head not from dr weiss right my god if it can do that why do you consider it a failure skow held up a hand and tilted it back and forth part of trinity works but its only been working for twenty hours and i cant even begin to explain the complexities of completing this machine theyre having success with the memory area but the main processing areas are something else altogether it was the crystal wasnt it geli thought aloud fieldings crystal watch fob thats what you needed to make it work yes fielding was sabotaging the project but he was also keeping a record of everything he did even as he corrupted other peoples code he saved the original code to his crystal idealists make terrible saboteurs fielding was simply incapable of destroying real scientific progress anyway once we had the crystal we got back all the computer code fielding had corrupted but the real bonus was original work that fielding had done himself he couldnt resist trying to solve our remaining problems even while he sabotaged our progress to date fieldings new work put trinity within reach without that crystal the prototype wouldnt be functioning at all but if its partly working now why cant the government just use other scientists to take over and complete it they could if they knew about it but they dont everything godin has done since the projects suspension has been unauthorized and illegal so move the prototype back to this building peter wont allow that he wouldnt survive the move now you said hell be dead soon not soon enough skows anxiety showed in his eyes if we had produced an operational trinity computer no one in the american or british governments would have worried about the cost of delivering it financial or human but in the wake of failure hard questions will be asked what are you saying failure requires a scapegoat ive had nothing to do with building that computer no but fieldings death might be blamed for its failure and who killed fielding now she saw where skow was headed youre starting to piss me off the nsa man turned up his palms im only painting a possible scenario youre an easy fit for the role known to be overzealous do you want to leave this room alive skow smiled im only showing you your personal stake in this now tennant and weiss are still running around loose and lu li fielding is still missing those are three problems i can solve all evidence to the contrary she gave him a look that would shatter glass take it easy skow said i dont want tennant dead now anyway its stupid to keep piling up bodies it makes things exponentially harder on us she sensed that they had arrived at the point of this meeting okay if im not the scapegoat who is peter godin what skow blew a perfect blue smoke ring between them think about it after peter dies everything can be explained by a mere exaggeration of the truth hes been dying of a brain tumor all along none of us knew it peter was a great man but the tumor affected his mind he became obsessed with saving his own life he saw the trinity computer as the only possible means of doing that when fielding and tennant suspended the project godin panicked and ordered their deaths geli leaned back and let the plan sink in the logic was perfect it was the big lie which turned everything black to white if we go this way skow continued tennant cant hurt us no matter what he says this is a much more elegant solution than murder theres one problem geli said if we leave tennant alive hell tell the world that i was the one trying to kill him will he skow smiled and shook his head who went to tennants house to kill him whom did tennant and weiss see ritter exactly and ritter bock was an employee of godin supercomputing before you came on board correct skow seemed to have thought of everything yes does anyone know you gave ritter the order to kill tennant i never gave such an order skow grinned of course you didnt i couldnt imagine such a thing peter gave the order directly to ritter his own private doberman dr tennant got lucky and killed ritter in selfdefense youre as pure as the driven snow geli all youve been doing is following godins orders and you by the time i realized that fielding didnt die of natural causes ritter was already dead and tennant was on the run ive been trying to get to the truth ever since geli kept trying to punch a hole in the story and the reason we cremated fieldings body so quickly once we realized hed been murdered we suspected a highly infectious biological agent naras advice was to burn the body and all blood samples immediately that was the only way to maintain the safety of this building will nara verify this story hell do anything to save his reputation geli got up and began to pace the control center skow turned his chair and followed her with his eyes what if godin succeeds she asked what if he delivers trinity before he dies and its everything he promised ravi says it wont happen peters fading too fast the irony of the situation depressed her you know i like peter godin i respect him you on the other hand i dont like at all i didnt respect you either until you came up with this this could work its going to work the only missing piece is you she saw no option but to cooperate tell me where the other trinity facility is and you have a deal the confidence left skows face im not at liberty to do that why not youll understand in a minute im going to give you the name of the person who handles security at the other site you can ask him your questions geli stopped and stared at him what kind of game is this thats the way he told me to handle it and hes not the kind of person i like to make an enemy of who the hell is he skow shook his head ill give you his number im not calling anybody until i know who im calling skow drew on his cigarette looking at her with something like pity general horst bauer gelis face felt hot every bit of pride shed felt at her trinity job drained out of her in a sickening rush my father is in charge of the other trinity site yes you son of a bitch why are he and i both involved in this despite obvious reluctance to speak skow seemed to sense that she wouldnt cooperate further until he had answered its simple he said every aspect of trinity has been stagemanaged by godin from the beginning because of your fathers military intelligence background he always had influence on what types of computers the army used at certain facilities the pentagon various bases and now fort huachuca fort huachuca arizona was the center of us military intelligence and her father was its commanding officer general bauer helped secure contracts for godin supercomputing from the army skow said his influence helped peter beat out cray nec all the rest you mean he took money wads of it hes got a numbered cayman account padded by godin same as me the nsa doesnt pay near enough to finance my lifestyle that hypocritical son of a bitch i thought at least where his country was concerned hednever mind i should have known better your father didnt damage the country by pushing godin supercomputers they were as good as anything out there the general just took a little bonus where he found it thats the way business is done these days the scar on gelis face seemed to pulse with fury the army is a service not a business skow chuckled id never have pegged you as a romantic fuck you anyway when peter decided he needed a secret research site he called your father some money changed hands and the general found us a nice secluded spot where no one would bother us why was i brought in peter was looking for a certain kind of person for your job your father suggested you geli began to pace again blood pounding in her ears he knows about all this doesnt he godin dying the project going down the tubes yes and hes on board he has a career to save too well fuck him and fuck you call him geli is the secret trinity site at fort huachuca no she didnt believe him there were thousands of acres set aside for weapons testing at the remote arizona base on the other hand her father was an expert at covering his ass hed have wanted some deniability if trinity became a liability and so would have been unlikely to put it at his own base she slipped on her headset hit a computer key and said major general horst bauer fort huachuca arizona skow breathed an audible sigh of relief the generals aidedecamp answered the phone general bauer geli snapped the general is unavailable whos calling please tell him his daughter is on the phone captain hold please skow was clearly enjoying this spectacle she spun her chair so that she wouldnt have to look at his aging ivy league face as she waited images of her father rose in her mind tall and imposing in the germanic mold horst bauer had been described by his enemies as a blond version of burt lancasters general james mattoon scott from seven days in may this was a fair comparison yet the stiff martinet seen by the public was not the man geli knew she saw the womanizer who had cheated ceaselessly on his wife and left several illegitimate children abroad she saw the brute who upon finding himself embarrassed by his daughters wildness beat her remorselessly with whatever was close to hand the irony of her life was that she had followed in the footsteps of the man she hated the reason was simple shed hated her father for scarring her so deeply but shed despised her mothers passiveness even more well geli said a deep voice that tensed every muscle in her body you must be in trouble thats the only time i hear from you she wanted to slam down the phone but she needed answers what do you know about a certain artificial intelligence project so much for pleasantries thats a vague question you asked you want specifics im in charge of security for project trinity in north carolina im told theres a secret facility carrying out research for that project what do you know about that a moment of silence i might know something and you never told me about this because dry laughter i wasnt aware wed started a fatherdaughter rehabilitation program you gave godin my name for this job how else did you think he found you but as for telling you about my involvement godin wanted everything compartmentalized you cant be angry about that you havent told me anything about your life since puberty what i learned i learned from gossip or doctors or the police some battles never end she thought theres no point in rehashing the past i know what i needed to know and you understand the situation what has to be done ive been made aware skow has no balls but he does have a talent for damage control im going now she said yet she remained on the line go ahead said the general i have a feeling ill be seeing you soon she yanked off her headset and glared at skow well said the nsa man are we all on the same page get out you havent answered my question what choice do i have but it sickens me that a man like godin will be torn down so that scum like you and my father can skate youre not fit to carry water for peter godin skow colored at last you agree about tennant and weiss we bring them in alive tell them its all been a misunderstanding godins not dead yet true and we have no idea where they are we cant communicate with them unless we go on tv and tell the whole world also true im still not sure i want tennant running around telling everyone what he thinks went on here he knows some powerful people skow nodded thoughtfully i tell you what ill leave tennant and weiss to you if they have to die well make it play youre damn right youll leave them to me he got up and moved toward the door any last questions just one why was fielding sabotaging the project skow smiled he didnt believe scientists should create things they dont understand then why did he sign on for the project i dont think he believed it would move nearly as fast as it did he thought wed have to earn the requisite knowledge about the brain before we could make trinity work and did you earn that knowledge are you kidding if trinity does go a hundred percent operational it will be completely beyond us chapter we chose a cheap motel in arlington across the potomac from washington one where the desk clerk didnt raise an eyebrow if a guest preferred to pay in cash one room two double beds a bathroom a television a phone rachel stripped off her camouflage jumpsuit the minute she got inside and went to the bathroom to shower i found myself watching her until the bathroom door closed her informal attire of the previous day had been startling enough after weeks of seeing her dressed only in skirt suits to see her walking unabashedly away from me in her underwear transformed my perception of her rachels body was taut and well muscled in a way that only strenuous exercise could maintain this didnt square with my impression of her as an academic physician but maybe it fit with her obsessivecompulsive tendencies i retrieved our street clothes from the truck then bought a washington post and two bottles of dasani from machines in the parking lot and returned to the room the crack beneath the bathroom door exhaled steam i changed into my regular clothes propped myself against the headboard and switched on cnn there was no mention of any federal fugitives so i started scanning the stories in the post wed begun preparing for our trip to israel during the eighthour drive from tennessee the first step was to arrange for the illegal passports we used a truck stop near roanoke for rachels first phone call a former patient of hers from new york gave her a contact number in washington dc and told her to wait an hour before calling it during that hour someone would vouch for rachel to the person at that number she made her second call from lexington virginia where she received instructions to go to the au bon pain cafe in washingtons union station at eleven tomorrow morning she was also told to choose two full names and birth dates and to obtain passport photos for the friends involved she should deliver the photos along with cards bearing the names and physical descriptions of the friends to the person at the au bon pain meeting when rachel asked how long it would take to obtain what she required the source told her fortyeight hours was the usual delay between lexington and interstate we realized we had another problem credit cards buying air tickets to israel for cash would raise concerns as would the fact that we had no advance hotel reservations friends or relatives would have to make reservations for us in our new names using legitimate credit cards my parents were dead and all my friends would be covered by the nsa rachels parents exhusband and friends would be covered as well in the end she chose to call a doctor to whom shed almost become engaged when she was attending columbia he was jewish traveled often to israel and was utterly devoted to her i thought a request to make flight and hotel reservations in names he didnt know might worry the man but rachel assured me that anything she asked would be done she tried three times to phone him before we reached dc but had no luck his answering service refused to give out his cell number and rachel couldnt leave a number for him to call back the bathroom door opened with a rush of steam and rachel emerged with one towel wrapped around her body another around her head theres still some hot water left and one towel you should try it i feel human again we need to try your doctor friend one more time i brought in your clothes theyre pretty dirty she smiled wearily id give a thousand dollars for my flannel pajamas well get some new clothes tomorrow or tonight if you really want some after we make that call her shoulders sagged cant we just sleep for a while we need that hotel reservation to date from as early as possible before our departure most reservations like that are made weeks in advance youre telling me to get dressed i nodded she sat on the edge of the bed and began drying her hair i was thinking i said if you dont have any problem with it we should travel as husband and wife she turned and looked at me do i look like i have a problem with it good well give your friend married names for the reservations should we use jewish names no you wouldnt fool an israeli for five seconds im a good jewish girl who broke down and married a goy ill do all the talking she picked up her shirt off the bedspread and walked back into the bathroom i heard the wet towel land on the shower rod then she returned wearing only the shirt its tail hung halfway down her thighs but there was nothing beneath and it left little to the imagination i have to lie down she said wake me up when youre ready to go i looked at my watch it was pm letting her fall asleep would be a mistake but it was probably better to wait for dark i didnt think i could get up yet either id had no real sleep for two days and i ached in muscles i hadnt used for years rachel pulled back her bedcovers climbed under them and lay on her stomach her face turned toward me her dark eyes were cloudy with fatigue but there was a trace of a smile on her lips i can hardly think she said you im barely here do you know why im really here because youre afraid of dying no because im more afraid of not living than i am of dying does that make sense some she slid deeper under the covers you dont understand my son is dead my marriage is over what do i have to lose rachel had always surprised me but maybe this time she was delirious im sure your patients if i died tomorrow my patients would get another shrink i sit in that room for days on end listening to people who are depressed afraid angry paranoid i listen to other peoples lives and try to make sense of them then i go home and write about them for the journals she smiled strangely but today is different today a man i diagnosed as delusional has pulled me into his delusion im alice through the looking glass people are trying to kill me but im still alive and now im going to fly to israel because of a hallucination because a man i actually respect has suddenly decided hes jesus you need sleep she shook her head her eyes never leaving my face sleep wont change how i feel about this in that moment i wasnt sure what she was referring to i slid down the headboard rested my head on my elbow and looked across the space between the beds her shoulders were dark against the white sheet and her damp hair spilled across her eyes what are you really talking about i asked her eyes looked through mine the way they sometimes had in her office as though all the walls i had put up since my familys death were nothing to her then very deliberately she smiled i have no idea why dont you go take a shower the look in her eyes spoke more directly than her mouth i got up and went to the bathroom stripping off my dirty clothes as i went after two days of running for my life the steaming water felt more nourishing than food my hands and neck stung from brier scratches but my muscles began to relax under the spray as i washed my hair with shampoo from the tiny hotel bottle i thought of rachels dark hair spread over the pillow and i hurried to finish she had to be as exhausted as i was and sleep would be hard to fight i toweled off in the bathroom then tied the towel around my waist and walked out to the space between the beds rachel still lay on her stomach but now her eyes were closed her breathing deep and regular i looked down at her wishing she had managed to stay awake but i couldnt blame her she had seen too much in the past two days and run too far i pulled off my towel then sat on the edge of my bed and started drying my hair after a few moments i wanted only to fall back on the bed and sleep until i could sleep no more a dark slender arm crossed the narrow space between the beds rachels hand touched my knee then opened and closed in the air as if grasping for something when i put my hand in hers she pulled me over to her bed with surprising strength i slid in beside her and looked down into her eyes which were open wide like dark pools did you think i was asleep she asked you were am i dreaming then i smiled hallucinating maybe then i can do anything i want thats true she raised her head and kissed me her lips were firm and filled with blood and her mouth opened with a hunger that told me she had wanted this for a long time i undid the buttons of her shirt and pulled her over onto me she laughed as her damp hair fell across my face did you think about this during our sessions she asked never liar maybe once or twice she kissed me again and the way she molded her body to mine told me there would be no fumbling of firsttime lovers her touch was as knowing and confident as her eyes and as she focused all her attention upon me i remembered that there is nothing so thrilling as a woman of words when she decides that the time for words is past i jerked awake in a panic certain that we had waited too late to make our call the glow of the television illuminated the motel room the bedside clock read pm rachel lay on her back beside me one arm thrown over her face the other lying along my body she was a different woman to me now after three months of professional distance she had given herself to me without reservation my memories of what we had done before giving in to sleep seemed more like hallucinations than any of the visions id had during my narcoleptic episodes yet they were real rachel needed sleep but i had to wake her i sat up and drank a bottle of dasani in one long series of swallows then gently shook her upper arm i was afraid she would awaken in a panic as she had in the truck but this time she stirred slowly then reached out and squeezed my wrist hey i said how do you feel she opened her eyes but did not speak instead she took a deep breath then sat up and hugged me i hugged her back wishing that this had all happened long before in some other place we have to try to call your friend again i said cant i just do it from here no if you were that close to this guy in medical school the nsa could know and if theyve tapped his line they can trace our location in seconds if we do reach your friend we should stake out the phone booth we used and wait to see if anyone shows up that will tell us if his lines safe or not okay she leaned forward and kissed me lightly on the lips lets get it over with five miles west of the motel i saw a pay phone outside a gas station on the columbia pike that looked private enough i parked so that i could watch the road while rachel made her call she went straight to the phone carrying the phone card wed bought at a quik stop near the motel after a few moments she smiled gave me a thumbsup sign and began talking the conversation lasted a long time but i thought it must be going well because i saw her reading our fictional names off the motel stationery mr and mrs john david stephens rachels maiden name was horowitz and her passport would list her as hannah horowitz stephens as she talked i thought about how deeply this doctor must have loved her that he would do this for her after fifteen years she hung up and came back to the truck well i said she closed the door no problem hell make reservations for everything the plane the hotel even a couple of sightseeing tours out of new york we couldnt risk staying in washington an hour longer than necessary jfk who is this guy adam stern hes an ob in manhattan he has four kids now he must have liked you a lot in the old days she gave me a sly smile they never get over me i drove a hundred meters up the road parked and left the engine running i could still see the pay phone rachel had used adam says this is the busiest week of the year for tourism in israel she said easter in jerusalem is like mardi gras in new orleans that may be good for us if we can get a flight at all hes going to try for something besides el al but there are no guarantees anythings good they dont seem to be hunting us publicly yet we sat awhile in the drone of the idling engine but no one approached the pay phone i slid my hand across the seat and closed it around hers are you okay she nodded but didnt look at me its been a long time since i felt good about doing what we did i squeezed her hand and she turned to me her eyes were wet i knew then how long she had lived without real intimacy probably about as long as i had im glad youre here i said and im glad youre coming with me to israel i couldnt do it without you she took back her hand and wiped her eyes i glanced at the phone there was no one near it i think were okay you ready to get some real sleep im ready for a cheeseburger then sleep at ninethirty the next morning we were crossing memorial bridge rolling toward the lincoln memorial id last visited washington to film part of the nova series based on my book the contrast between that visit and today did not bear thinking about we found a kinkos copy shop southeast of capitol hill and in twenty minutes had the passport photos wed been instructed to drop off at the au bon pain cafe in union station as i drove toward the station pedestrian traffic increased and i began to get nervous with washington topping the list of terrorist targets there were bound to be surveillance cameras near all important public buildings they might not be visible but they would be there and the nsa had the computing power to do visual searches of those surveillance tapes i kept well clear of the mall and parked in a lot on the east side of union station as we walked toward the massive white granite building we moved quickly toward the main entrance rachel kept abreast of me all the way a kinkos bag swinging from her right hand she didnt know that i was carrying my revolver in the small of my back beneath my shirt if there were metal detectors at the stations entrance i would have to return to the truck dozens of people were lined up at the entrance but after watching the flow of visitors i breathed a sigh of relief they were moving too quickly to be passing through serious security once through the doors we joined the throngs moving through the renovated beaux arts rail station we passed an elevated restaurant standing in the middle of the floor then moved farther into the cavernous main hall this led into a multilevel mall area where tour groups travelers and shoppers jostled each other on walkways and curving staircases marveling at the statuary and pointing into store windows i could tell by the rumbling under my shoes that trains were running nearby yet my surroundings looked as pristine as a museum theres the au bon pain rachel said pulling me to the left a huge b dalton bookstore anchored this end of the mall and the au bon pain cafe was on its right people moved quickly in and out of the cafe and i could see that our contact had chosen well rachel walked through the wide entrance and joined a queue before some coffee urns on a marble table i joined her casually scanning the tables to our right shed been instructed to look for a woman carrying a copy of the second sex by simone de beauvoir i figured i would be able to guess which woman would carry that book by appearance alone at a table near the back i saw a redhaired woman of fifty with no makeup and a hard line of a mouth she kept her eyes on the table as though afraid she might be accosted by a stranger i was preparing to wager a hundred dollars that this was our contact when rachel pulled at my arm and pointed at a fortyish africanamerican woman standing by the pastry racks and reading the second sex rachel left the queue and approached her i havent seen that book in years rachel said not since college is it still relevant today the woman looked up and smiled her eyes bright and welcoming its a bit dated but valuable from a historical perspective she offered a brown hand bejeweled with rings im mary venable hannah stephens said rachel very nice to meet you i was amazed by how easily she slipped into her role maybe psychiatrists were natural liars as i walked forward i heard mary venable say softly its an honor to meet you doctor youve helped so many thank you rachel replied then much louder she said i never knew how simone stood being sartres lover the man looked like a frog and thats no slur on the french he truly did mary venable laughed so naturally that i almost didnt see her take the kinkos bag from rachels hand and drop it into a big woven african purse at her feet if i finish this tonight venable said ill lend it to you tomorrow ill be here about this time i might see you then rachel said mary venable leaned in close and said tell your man he needs to hide his piece a little better while rachel stood puzzled mary venable squeezed her hand with affection then picked up the purse and walked away as she passed me she caught my eye for only a moment but in that moment i read her message loud and clear youd best take care of that woman mister i walked up to rachel who looked oddly at me was she referring to something anatomical ill tell you later i took hold of rachels arm and led her out of the store i didnt know there was a mall here she said can we get some clothes not here i dont really see the kind of place we need we want one big department store that carries everything maybe on the upper level not here i insisted as i led her back toward the main entrance a dc cop walked past us my heart flew into my throat i was sure he had started a double take just as we passed i wanted to turn and check but i didnt dare whats the matter rachel asked sensing my tension i think theyre looking for us here of course they are i mean publicly i think that cop just recognized me she started to turn but i shook my head hard enough to stop her you mean its not just the nsa anymore she said im afraid not stay beside me and be ready to run we passed a tree growing from a huge planter in the middle of the floor i pulled rachel behind it and looked back from cover the cop was walking in our footsteps and craning his neck trying to see around the planter he was also speaking into a collar radio were blown i said come on chapter i grabbed rachels hand and doubled my walking speed instead of making for the main entrance i veered toward a staircase that swept up to the next level using the crowd for concealment up rachel asked pointing at the stairs no my goal was the trains i moved toward the ticketing area to our left but a female voice over the pa stopped me attention all travelers attention all incoming and outgoing trains will be stopped immediately for maintenance reasons please remain on the platforms and we will issue further bulletins as we have more information thank you for your patience adrenaline flushed through my body the announcer was repeating the message in spanish back to the stairs i said reversing direction up or down up we took the steps two at a time on the next floor i leaned far enough over the rail to see the cop who had spotted us he was still on the main floor trying to decide which way we had gone he looked up shielding his eyes against the lights then started toward the stairs why did they stop the trains rachel asked us theyre shutting down all the trains in union station to find us attention please said the pa announcer the police have asked that all shoppers and travelers move in a calm and methodical way to the exits we apologize for this inconvenience there is no danger of any kind to persons or property you may pay for your purchases but we ask that you move to the exits as soon as possible thank you i could see the effort it was taking for rachel to stay calm were not going to get out are we she asked i looked over the balcony rail again the cop was trying to decide whether to come up or go down they must have triggered some sort of terrorist alert thats the only way you could evacuate this place there could be a hundred cops surrounding the building rachel looked along the mezzanine clusters of people were hurrying toward us we stepped away from the stairs and let them pass the cop below moved toward the ticketing area and spoke into his collar radio again weve got two choices one we change our appearance and try to get out with the crowd change our appearance how go into a store and put on all black clothes maybe find some scissors and cut off your hair mousse mine up try to look ten years younger rachel didnt look encouraged thatll get us nailed in the airport we wont match our passport photos youre right then we do the simple thing go into the back of a store find a couple of big cardboard boxes and hide in them until all this dies down simple is good but the police might bring dogs god come on i said suddenly sure what to do i ran down the curved staircase watching for police uniforms id seen a marquee for a theater on our way in and from the stations layout i guessed it was on the lower level the staircase terminated in a food court people were rushing to finish their meals anxiety on their faces through a jumble of orange and yellow chairs i saw a line of moviegoers filing out of the theater doors where are we going rachel asked the cinema theyre evacuating it as we moved toward the theater entrance a section of wall opened about ten yards in front of us and a frightenedlooking young couple walked out squinting their eyes before the tire doors spring could pull it closed i darted forward and blocked it with my foot the houselights were on in the theater but the seats were empty up the sloping floor to my left a man in a sport jacket was ushering the last moviegoers up the center aisle toward the main exit to my right a tenfoottall hugh grant walked dejectedly along a london street his hands in his pockets rachel leaned against my back whats in there i pulled the door open wide enough for us to slip through then lifted the bottom of the heavy red curtain that ran along the wall and let it fall over us we flattened ourselves against the wall and separated so as to fit more naturally into the billow of the fabric i could no longer see rachel but i realized with surprise that we were holding hands the instinct was as primitive as that of two neanderthals comforting each other against a cave wall why here she asked why not the back of a store in my minds eye i saw police converging on our stolen truck dogs rachel whispered a minute ago this room was full of sweating people different scents not like the stockroom of some store right the soundtrack of the movie died with a groan i expected to hear voices but none came fifteen minutes passed twenty rachel clung to my sweating hand as i wiped perspiration from my forehead a male voice penetrated the curtain i got the center aisle rachels hand clenched mine police radio chatter echoed through the theater okay called a second man ill shine my light under the seats the men didnt worry me much but the rapid panting that followed nearly stopped my heart i might soon have to choose between surrender and a shootout with city police shes got something cried the first man look shes on a scent go girl i tried not to breathe shit its half a hot dog wait shes onto something else the voices were closer rachels hand was shaking how would she react if i fired my gun these werent assassins sent by geli bauer they were probably dc cops doing their duty shes going in circles said the second voice too many scents im smelling some bo myself were gonna have to come back later okay they want her down by the tracks anyway the voices receded what are we going to do rachel whispered wait how long they cant keep union station closed all day you think the dog is coming back i dont know i think i peed in my pants dont worry about it wont the dog smell it she was right just try to be quiet an hour and fortyfive minutes later a male voice came over the pa system dr tennant this is officer wilton howard of the washington dc police department we want you to know that we know this is all a misunderstanding weve been made aware that the shooting in north carolina was selfdefense and we are prepared to offer you protective custody and unlimited communication with anyone you wish to speak to please step into plain sight with dr weiss put down any weapons and turn yourself in to any officer you will not be treated as a criminal what do you think rachel asked i hear geli bauer in that message maybe its for real i mean all the cops in the building heard that too if theyve been told im a terrorist or something like that they think anything is justified to bring me out plus they think im armed are you i started to lie but she needed to know the truth yes oh god the police message began again david i reached out and squeezed her hand stay quiet another hour passed with more and varied messages coming over the pa system on instinct i told rachel to lie flat on the floor and remain against the wall i did the same the dog didnt come back but more cops did it sounded as if they were walking every row of seats now and then i felt the heavy curtain sway as one of them checked it as footsteps neared us i pulled my gun out of my pants and prayed that rachel could hold her nerve heavy steps approached me and then the fabric lifted off my face a pair of black boots was inches from my eyes i held my breath unsure whether id been seen or not the curtain danced along my right cheek then it dropped and the boots walked away the cop had only hit the wall a few times with his hand to check behind the curtain my heart felt as though it had turned to stone the boots approached again the cop checked the curtain the way he had before one row down i tried to shut out the sound of his footsteps after a seeming eternity i realized he had passed us by the search continued for another five minutes then the radio chatter died i thought rachel must be close to cracking but i didnt risk trying to speak to her after twenty minutes with no further appeals over the pa system i heard a mechanical hissing and clicking that i recognized as rewinding film is that the projector rachel asked somebodys rewinding the film they must be reopening the station we should go maybe we should wait until tonight no therell be guards posted at the exits tonight right now we can count on a lot of confusion as they reopen the station this is our best chance we got up and moved down the wall to the exit door after listening and hearing nothing i opened the door a crack two women walked past wearing street clothes i thought they might be cops but then the pa announced a rescheduled train an empty terminal needed no such announcement i pulled rachel through the door the escalators and staircases were filling with people and the clangs of kitchen equipment reverberated across the marble floor of the food court we walked to the escalator and started up when we hit the main floor walk twenty yards behind me i said if someone spots me blend into the crowd and disappear the escalator terminated near the entrance of the b dalton store i kissed rachel on the cheek then struck out across the floor scanning the crowd for uniforms angry travelers were pouring into the station like water through a dam most were heading for the trains i couldnt have asked for better cover i glanced back to make sure rachel was following then prepared to turn right toward the main entrance if the police were funneling people through a single checkpoint id double back and search for an alternate escape route if not id gut it out and trust to the anonymity of the crowd to get us through i veered right and headed into the barrelvaulted chamber that led to the main entrance the river of humanity flowing against me was hard to navigate but i was glad for every person there by shutting the station for three hours the police had created an almost impossible situation for themselves between me and the entrance stood the circular restaurant id seen on the way in two stories high the openair cafe was like an island in the center of the floor it had tables on its second level and a wroughtiron balcony that allowed its patrons to watch the pageant below it also provided a birdseye view for anyone wanting to surveil the huge hall i started around it on the left side keeping my face downcast dr tennant shouted a female voice i glanced up geli bauer was staring down at me from the cafes second level her scarred face and electric blue eyes were impossible to miss and her presence here had the inevitability of fate the three hours wed hidden in the theater had given her time to fly here from north carolina the police had reopened the station but geli had waited in the hope of spotting us as i whirled to see if rachel saw the danger i realized my mistake geli instantly spotted her and raised a walkietalkie to her lips run i shouted to rachel geli dropped her radio whipped up an automatic pistol and aimed down at me a woman beside her screamed as others joined the panic geli darted onto a staircase that curved down to the main floor i slid my hand behind me toward the gun at the small of my back dont geli shouted moving quickly down the stairs im not going to fire the order to kill you came from godin godins lost his mind she stopped threequarters of the way down the steps holding her pistol in a twohanded combat stance if thats true put down your gun she didnt why hasnt she shot me i wondered then i knew rachel was far enough away that if geli shot me out of hand she might escape with the terrified mob drop your gun doctor geli yelled continuing down the stairs drop it now and lie prone on the floor i wont fire she couldnt miss from where she was i dropped my gun on the gleaming floor her eyes flashed with satisfaction the crowd reacted to this disturbance like an ant colony perceiving danger in its midst waves of panic radiated into preoccupied travelers farther from the center creating a cyclone of people rushing for the exits police stationed there would have to battle their way here foot by foot get over here dr weiss geli shouted david rachel called tentatively gelis automatic had a silencer on its barrel run i screamed get out of here geli shifted her aim toward rachel i lunged up the steps my hands closed around her wrists as the gun spit a round past me the fury in her face told me shed missed geli drove a knee into my stomach knocking the wind from my lungs i wrenched at her bones like a man trying to break green sticks she threw herself backward and spun flipping me onto the steps with her sitting on top of me i fought to keep her gun pointed away from me but she had the leverage on her side the silencer inched steadily toward my face gelis scar went white as the strain of combat filled her cheeks with blood let go of the gun screamed a female voice both of you let go and stand up ten feet away rachel stood with both hands clenched around my revolver her eyes wide with terror put down that weapon geli yelled youre interfering with a federal officer in performance of her duty shoot her i shouted trying to rip the gun from gelis grasp she killed fielding shoot geli slammed the point of her elbow into my solar plexus and the silencer jammed into my cheek an explosion rang my eardrums like gongs and something wet spattered my face gelis blazing eyes seemed to fill my vision but then a river of blood flooded down her shirtfront i grabbed her gun and rolled her off me rachel was still aiming the smoking revolver and shaking like an epileptic the bullet had hit geli in the neck but shed managed to stuff her fingers into the wound to stop the bleeding never had i seen such rage in human eyes i grabbed rachels wrist and ran back toward the main hall as we rounded the corner gelis voice echoed though the hundredfoothigh chamber youre dead tennant youre fucking dead i sprinted toward the b dalton store at the end of the mall cases of books were bulky and heavy that meant a loading dock customers scrambled out of our way as i hustled rachel into the stockroom of the bookstore the tile floor was piled with boxes and sure enough there was a loading bay with a motorized door to handle deliveries i hit a red button on the wall and the door began to rise sunlight flooded into the room i lowered rachel to the cement of the loading bay then jumped off myself a delivery truck was parked at the entrance to the bay and two men stood talking beside its cab as we ran up the incline i saw a white toyota corolla parked by the truck its drivers door was open but no one was inside i aimed my revolver at the two men then jerked it toward the toyota i need that car the truck driver held up his hands but the other man looked at the toyota thats my car give me the keys the man looked blank give him your damn keys said the truck driver theyre in it i pulled rachel around to the passenger door and put her inside then scrambled into the drivers seat and started the engine the owner of the car yelled something but his words were lost in the roar as i sped away forward momentum slammed my door and it took all my selfcontrol to slow down id have to drive at normal speed to get us clear of the station then ditch the car to get clear of the city oh god rachel said her face white wailing sirens were converging on union station chapter i stood behind rachel at the food court at jfk airport in new york watching her for signs of a breakdown she was wearing a blue dress part of a new wardrobe shed bought in new jersey but the dress did nothing to mask her pale skin and hollow eyes shooting geli bauer had rattled her badly and though news reports had revealed that the federal officer shot at union station had survived rachel had remained shaky throughout the drive to new york i would never have got her out of washington without help after ditching the toyota five blocks from union station i hailed a taxi and had it carry us back over the potomac to alexandria virginia to an upscale shopping center there i called the phone number that had led to the cafe rendezvous with mary venable i told the woman who answered that dr rachel weiss was in mortal danger and desperately needed help fortyfive minutes later a woman in a blue toyota camry picked us up and took us back into washington to a private residence on the south side the house was a sanctuary run by the feminist group that provided new identities for battered women on the run with their children we were installed in a bedroom at the back of the safe house and after a brief wait mary venable arrived she questioned rachel at lengthshe didnt seem to trust methen made arrangements for a car we could use to drive to new york the following day she told us to leave it in the longterm lot at jfk where it would be picked up by one of their new york sisters there was a television in the bedroom and the union station shooting was all over the news the temporary closing of the station seemed to have caused as much of an uproar as the gunfire early reports speculated that a bomb threat had forced evacuation of the station but by the latenews broadcast the story had changed dc police sources had leaked that a potential presidential assassin had been tracked to the station my name wasnt given but the anchor said that the woman who had done the shooting in the station formerly believed to be my captive was now believed to be my accomplice we slept little and by morning the washington post had my name and photograph in the article a secret service spokesman characterized me as an idealistic physician who had snapped after years of grief over the tragic loss of my family driven by paranoid delusions i had threatened the presidents life and my appearance in washington with a gun proved how dangerous i was the identity of my female accomplice remained unknown but several witnesses had seen her fire the shot that downed the federal officer what frightened me most was that the articles closing comment came from ewan mccaskell the presidents chief of staff who had been reached in china dr tennant actually met the president in the oval office on one occasion mccaskell said the president admired his book on medical ethics he regrets that this noted physician has apparently suffered some sort of psychotic break and hopes dr tennant can receive treatment before something tragic happens i worried that mary venable would see the story and turn me in but an hour later she dropped off our new passports two virginia drivers licenses and the keys to our borrowed car she had seen the article but her loyalty to rachel was stronger than her belief in media stories i lost no time in getting on i headed for new york having my name and face broadcast nationwide only strengthened my resolve to leave the country the nsa believed i was planning to meet the president in washington tomorrow so leaving the country was the last thing they would expect me to do going through jfk airport would be risky but if we made it we would be far safer than in the united states rachel hardly spoke during the first leg of the drive and nothing i said seemed to register by the time we reached new jersey shed regained enough of herself to go into a mall with a list of clothing sizes and outfit us for our trip other than that we stopped only for gasoline and i never got out of the car just before we reached new york rachel telephoned adam stern and gave him a cover story id scripted to explain the doctors thirdparty reservations for us with the easter crowds stern had been forced to book us on a midnight el al flight which worried me quite a bit i wore a yankees cap into jfk praying that my sixfoot white guy looks were generic enough not to attract attention things went surprisingly well at the el al ticket counter but i did most of the talking my worry was the informal security interview according to stern at some point before you boarded an el al plane one or two plainclothes security officers would strike up a conversation with you to get a feel for your intentions there was no way we would get through that without rachel handling some of the talking the chicken with broccoli looks good i said pointing through a glass screen in front of the chinese food counter what do you think fine rachel said in a dead voice i touched her shoulder are you all right she didnt answer i stepped in front of her and ordered two chicken and broccoli plates as i paid i heard a mans voice behind me hi there we were in line with you at the el al counter you going over for western holy week uh no rachel replied i glanced back and saw two darkskinned men of medium height standing behind us they had quick eyes and easy smiles they looked like brothers visiting family then said the second man who wore a gold chain around his neck no rachel said awkwardly its a private matter a health problem concerned looks oh sorry to pry theyre looking for terrorists i told myself not presidential assassins i turned around and nodded to the two men the silence was uncomfortable but suddenly rachel straightened up and came to life i guess its nothing to be embarrassed about she said my obgyn is sending me over i was just diagnosed with ovarian cancer its advanced but he has a friend at the hadassah hospital in jerusalem theres a clinical trial for culturing your own t cells and reinjecting them to fight the tumors my doctors an old friend he made all the arrangements for us thank god planes the hotel all of it she put her hand over her heart im sorry to run on its just the first ray of hope ive had and it feels better to talk about it quite all right said the man wearing the chain im sure youll do very well the doctors at hadassah are the best in the world the trial looks very promising i chimed in not wanting to appear awkward the lead researcher did his training at sloankettering you sound like a doctor yourself said the shorter man and i lost any remaining doubt that they were el al security suddenly all i could think about was the in cash in the money belts concealed beneath our clothes food mister snapped one of the chinese clerks thank you i said glancing back at the plates yes im an internist you know about arthritis asked the shorter man they tell me i got psoriatic arthritis you know about that answer him i wondered act arrogant well there are five types some are relatively mild others crippling whats the bad kind arthritis mutilans the man grinned happily thats not me thank god i got something about phalanges distal interphalangeal predominant i lifted his hands and looked at his fingernails which showed marked pitting it could be a lot worse he pulled back his hand good good well enjoy your food good luck at hadassah said the one wearing the chain youre going to the right place for a cure i put both plates on a tray and carried it to a vacant table rachel followed me looking shellshocked i glanced back at the food counter and saw the two men walk away without ordering you did great i said softly academy award caliber survival she said taking her seat everybody has it in them you told me that in north carolina and i didnt believe you now i know better i picked up my fork theres no point feeling guilty about it theyd already talked to adam thats the feeling i got no doubt he must have given them the same story if we make it onto the plane without being arrested im going to send that guy a case of champagne rachel closed her eyes are we going to make it yes just keep it together for another half hour the was crowded despite being a late flight but we were insulated from our nearest neighbors by two empty seats and an aisle and that gave us some privacy i sat by the window with my yankees cap on taking care not to make eye contact with anyone as i retrieved two blankets and covered us both to the neck we sat at the gate for what seemed like two hours but it was only forty minutes by my watch while passengers around us talked excitedly about their upcoming visit to the holy land rachel and i pretended to sleep holding hands under the blanket at last the el al jetliner taxied out onto the runway and lumbered into the night sky thank god she whispered as the wheels lifted off the concrete we would have to clear security at tel aviv in eleven hours but making it into the air was half the battle and i tried to focus on that small victory are you all right she opened her eyes which were separated from mine only by the bill of my yankees cap in them i saw emotions i could not read i need to ask you some things david she sounded more like the psychiatrist i had known before we made love were going to jerusalem and i need to get to the bottom of why id like you to treat this as a session no if you ask me things i can ask you things and you have to answer honestly thats where we are now she hesitated then nodded fair enough youve told me youre an atheist you said your mother believed in something greater than humanity but not in organized religion what about your father was he a declared atheist no he just didnt believe in the conventional concept of god a god who focused all his attention on man dad was a physicist theyre a skeptical bunch as a rule did he believe in a supreme being of any kind my father wasnt the type to get cosmic very often but on a few occasionscamping in the mountains under a starfilled skyhe had talked to my brother and me about what hed really believed dad had a simple conception of the way things are simple but profound he didnt see man as separate from the universe but part of it he always said man is the universe becoming conscious of itself have i heard that before maybe ive heard new age gurus like deepak chopra say it but my father was saying it twentyfive years ago what do you think he meant exactly what he said he always reminded us that every atom in our bodies was once part of a distant star that had exploded he talked about how evolution moves from simplicity toward complexity and how human intelligence is the highest known expression of evolution i remember him telling me that a frogs brain is much more complex than a star he saw human consciousness as the first neuron of the universe coming to life and awareness a spark in the darkness waiting to spread to fire rachel looked thoughtful thats a beautiful idea not exactly a religious view but a hopeful one practical too if were the universe becoming conscious of itself we have a moral duty to survive to preserve the gift of consciousness and to do that we have to live in peace from that you can derive a workable set of laws ethics everything rachel reflected on this do you subscribe to his view of the universe i did until a couple of weeks ago my latest visions dont exactly fit into it she laid her hand on my knee we dont know where they fit all right and i dont think your fathers view precludes the existence of a creator do you still have anxiety that youll die if you dont reach jerusalem before you dream of the crucifixion the immediate threat of capture by police had distracted me from this concern i still feel some urgency but not like before the fact that were going there seems to have eased the pressure a bit if you do dream of the crucifixion you shouldnt worry about it a dream never killed anybody i wasnt so sure lets talk about you for a minute you say you believe in god what exactly do you believe i dont see how that relates to what were doing i think were both on this plane for a reason and i think what you believe matters a look of ineffable sadness entered her face i came to god very late as a child i was never taken to synagogue or church why not my father turned his back on god when he was seven years old why so young he turned seven inside a concentration camp something inside me went cold her gaze became unfocused as though she were looking years into the past my father saw his father murdered in front of him it wasnt a normal event even by camp standards the allies were approaching and the ss guards were liquidating the prisoners one guard invented a game with his small work detail he killed one prisoner a day he tried to get the starving prisoners to kill each other and offered them survival if they would my grandfather refused of course hed been a surgeon in berlin hed met freud corresponded with jung my mind spun as rachels career choice came into perspective the guard beat my grandfather to death in front of his little boymy father my father decided then that a god who allowed what hed seen deserved curses not prayers i wanted to say something but what words would mean anything he was one of the lucky ones allowed to emigrate to america he was taken in by distant relatives in brooklyn rachel smiled sadly uncle milton was a locksmith my fathers refusal to worship angered him but milton knew the boy had been through a lot when he came of age my father changed his name to white moved to queens and stopped seeing his family though he did send them money he married a gentile who cared nothing for religion and they raised me in a secular house i listened in amazement you saw a face on an american street or in an office and you had no idea that a tragic epic lay behind it i always felt like an outsider because of that all my friends went to church or synagogue i got curious when i was seventeen i sought out my uncle milton he told me everything after that i embraced my heritage many small mysteries of rachels personality suddenly made sense her severe dress her professional distance her abhorrence of violence the thing is she went on i think i became jewish more out of emotional and political identification than a desire to do gods will theres nothing wrong with that of course there is if you ask me what i really think about god it has nothing to do with the torah or the talmud it has to do with what ive seen in my own life what do you really think she folded her hands on her lap i believe that to create means to make something that didnt exist before if god is perfect then the only way he can truly create is to make something separate from himself so by definition his creation must be imperfect you see if it were perfect it would be god yes i believe that for human beings to be distinct from god we must be able to make our own choices free will right and unless bad choices resulted in real pain free will would have no meaning thats why we have such evil in the world i dont know what religion that adds up to but whatever it is thats what i believe thats a good explanation for the world as we find it but it doesnt address the central mystery why should god feel compelled to create anything at all i dont think well ever know that we might our sun is going to burn for another five billion years or so even if the universe ends by collapsing inward on itselfthe big crunchthe earliest that could happen is about twenty billion years from now if we dont destroy ourselves well have plenty of time to answer that question maybe all questions she smiled you and i will never know looking into her dark eyes i realized just how little i knew about her youre not nearly as conventional as you pretend to be i wish you could have talked to fielding what did he believe about god fielding had a big problem with evil he was raised a christian but he said that neither judaism nor christianity had ever faced evil headon what did he mean hed recite three statements god is all powerful god is all good evil exists you can logically reconcile any two of those statements but not all three rachel nodded thoughtfully fielding thought the eastern religions were the only truly monotheistic ones because they admit that evil flows from god rather than trying to blame a lesser figure like satan and you she asked where do you think evil comes from the human heart the heart pumps blood david you know what i mean the psyche the dark well where primitive instincts mix with human intelligence when you look at the atrocities man is capable of its difficult to imagine a divine plan behind any of it i mean look what happened to your grandfather rachel gripped my arm and looked at me with almost desperate urgency on the day my grandfather was murdered there was a moment when he could have killed that guard they were alone at a rock quarry one guard and three prisoners the americans were only a day away but he didnt do it why not i asked stunned by her passion i think he knew something that weve forgotten what that if you take up the weapon of your enemy you become like him jesus knew that gandhi too even with your son standing there beside you needing your protection you turn the other cheek and sacrifice yourself you dont commit murder rachel said firmly if my grandfather had killed that guard he and my father might have been executed that night we cant know the future thats why what i did yesterday shook me so badly i picked up your gun and shot a fellow human being what did i really do when i did that you saved my life yours too for a while i squeezed her hand tight were alive rachel and i believe i have something very important to do before i die i know you do a male flight attendant appeared in the aisle beside us i didnt want to look up so i motioned for rachel to turn yes rachel asked in a sleepy voice are you going to want dinner tonight she looked back at me and i nodded yes she said thank you the flight attendant glanced at me then walked away rachel was holding her breath what do you think i dont know it seemed odd but maybe he was checking to see if we were going to sleep through dinner she shook her head i cant do this yes you can were fine what about the tel aviv airport well make it through you dont know that i touched her cheek and spoke with conviction i had not known was in me i do know theres something waiting for me in jerusalem what an answer chapter white sands new mexico ravi nara revved the throttle of his honda atv and drove toward what godins technical staff was deluded enough to call the hospital the new mexico air parched his throat and the scorching sun left the neurologist so drained that he tried to stay indoors as much as possible a whitecoated technician crossed his path on foot and raised an arm in greeting ravi braked angrily and drove on it had taken all his nerve to telephone john skow even with the scrambled cell phone the nsa man had given him but with godin close to death hed had to take the risk skow had made it clear that if godin died before trinity became a reality all their careersand maybe their livescould be destroyed zach levin godins chief engineer had predicted that the trinity prototype could go fully operational in seven to ten days but that estimate assumed the continued participation of godin himself ravi knew hed be lucky to keep the old man alive for another twentyfour hours he doubted that any doctor had ever worked so hard to keep a patient alive at thirtysix ravi nara was already a revered scientist in his native india he was treated as a hero despite his having become an american citizen but if trinity failed under a cloud of scandal caused by the murder of a fellow nobel laureate nothing would save his reputation again he wondered if someone had overheard his call to skow the security in north carolina had been intrusive but white sands was a bloody military reservation still no one had confronted him yet maybe the remoteness of the place made the security people less paranoid white sands was bigger than delaware and rhode island put together the parcel fenced off for trinity research was a mole on a white elephant part of a larger tract administered by the us army intelligence school at fort huachuca arizona before ravi visited the base godin had described the living conditions there as spartan a transplanted new yorker ravi had thought north carolina was the middle of nowhere white sands was a hole in the world a moonscape of white gypsum and rock with only rattlesnakes for company he halfexpected indians to come riding over the dunes with john ford cowboys in pursuit but they never did the trinity compound was laid out with geometric simplicity there were four major buildings the research lab the hospital administration and containment there were also barracks a machine shop a massive electrical power plant and an airstrip that could take military jets the buildings werent really buildings but converted aircraft hangars assembled by army engineers in five frantic weeks of construction only containment was different containment housed the trinity prototype ravi could see the strange building to his right standing alone at the center of the compound built like a world war two pillbox containment had fourfootthick concrete walls reinforced with tempered steel and shielded with lead it was served by four giant electrical cables two plumbing pipes and a residential airconditioning system no telephone lines coaxial cables or cat network cable ran to it no antennae or satellite dishes sprouted from its roof as they did from all the other buildings containment was like a structure built to hold harry houdini if houdini could have digitized himself and escaped through wires or beamed transmissions if the trinity prototype ever went fully operational no onenot even peter godinwanted it connected to the internet ravi had avoided the hospital today godin had been dying by inches for weeks but two days ago hed finally begun the slide toward eternity ravi was convinced that fieldings death had done it a ruthless necessity that hit the old man harder than hed expected of course fieldings death had given them the crystal so any doubts about the rightness of killing him were pointless within hours after getting the crystal they had made up all the ground lost to fieldings sabotage and after discovering the independent work fielding had done theyd found themselves within spitting distance of a working prototype the euphoria of this success had been undercut by the problems with tennant and his psychiatrist godin could ill afford the stress of dealing with that yet in the final analysis it was the cancer that was killing him as it killed everyone who got his type of cancer ravi parked the atv in front of the hospital hangar and walked inside the hangar was divided into rooms by partitions none had ceilingsnot even the bathroomsso foul smells drifted throughout the building with annoying regularity peter godin was not bothered by this he occupied an airtight chamber with positive pressure that no infectious agent could penetrate served by filtered air and water the plastic cubicle known as the bubble sat like an incubator at the center of the hangar floor to spare ravi and the nurses from having to waste time with protective suits a uv decontaminator had been installed near the bubbles door to sterilize himself ravi had only to scrub his hands don a mask then stand in the radiation long enough to rid his skin and clothing of dangerous organisms the process only took two minutes but lately it had begun to get on his nerves still he couldnt blame godin steroids and chemotherapy had beaten the old mans immune system into submission and godin wanted what every man had wanted since the beginning of time to cheat death the humming uv unit finally went dark ravi stepped on a button that opened the plexiglas hatch in the bubble and stepped inside godin lay unconscious on a hospital bed surrounded by monitors and resuscitation equipment his body was pierced by a central iv line and coupled to the monitors by thin wires his commanding head had scarcely more color than the white sheet it lay on two nurses bookended the bed watching for the slightest change in their patients status ravi nodded to them then lifted the chart from its slot at the end of the bed and gave it a token look brainstem glioma diffuse and inoperable hed made the diagnosis six months ago when hed first seen the supermri scan of godins brain it was eerie to see a tumor growing inside one of the most gifted minds on earth when godin asked ravi to keep his cancer secret ravi hadnt hesitated revealing godins condition might have ended his chance to take part in the greatest scientific effort in history of course ravi had exacted a price for his cooperation it was only proper peter godin was rich ravi nara relatively poor that imbalance had now been addressed if only in a small way yet the fortune in cash and stock ravi had received now seemed trivial in the face of what might happen ravi croaked the old man is that you ravi looked up from the chart and saw the intense blue eyes fix upon him why am i so tired godin asked your seizures probably godin still suffered from epilepsy caused by his exposure to the supermri ravi walked around the bed and looked down into the slack face peter godin had been one of the most vital men hed ever known yet cancer had laid godin as low as it would any street beggar well that wasnt quite true no street beggar had ravi nara and almost limitless wealth keeping him alive even near death with his hair and eyebrows gone godin retained the hawklike profile that had made the driven young computer designer so recognizable in the late s and for five decades afterward your tumor is very advanced peter theres only so much i can do its a battle between keeping you conscious and keeping you free enough from pain to function damn the pain godin clenched one arthritic hand into a fist i can stand pain thats not what you said last night last night you told me your face was on fire godin shuddered im conscious now send levin to me zach levin had led the r d department at godin supercomputing in mountain view until he was brought to north carolina to run the interface team the group responsible for communicating with the trinity computer levin was a tall cadaverous man of thirtyfive and prematurely gray like his master in his healthier days levin seemed to live without sleep ill send him in ravi said godin held up one hand what have you heard about tennant and weiss theres been no sign of them since union station the old man closed his eyes and sighed with a rattle a hint of what lay in the near future the woman shot geli they say it was dr weiss yes when godin frowned a nest of lines formed in the lower half of his face though married to one woman for most of his life godin had no children and hed always displayed a paternal affection for geli bauer the notion made ravis skin crawl it was like having paternal affection for a cobra how is geli doing godin asked remarkably well i hear they transferred her to walter reed her father arranged that a trace of a smile touched godins lips if shed known that she wouldnt have gone the smile vanished what do you think tennant was trying to accomplish in washington the presidents still in china ravi wished he knew for most of the project the internist had been his biggest headache hiding cancer from laymen was easy but tennant was always noticing godins fluctuating weight his gait disturbances and the body changes caused by steroids the old mans rheumatoid arthritis explained some of that but for the last six weeks ravi had been forced to keep his patient practically isolated from tennant i have no idea peter it worries me as a nurse gave godin a sip of water ravi tried to gauge the time left to the tenacious old man it wasnt easy he hadnt worked directly with patients for years and godin was well past the mortality tables for his type of tumor predicting survival in these circumstances was the kind of augury at which doctors like tennant excelled years of clinical experience gave them a sixth sense about life and death but any madras midwife might do as well a buzz and a purple flash made ravi turn through the bubbles transparent hatch he saw zach levin standing in the uv decontaminator levin spent most of his time in the concrete womb of containment but he always seemed to sense when godin had regained consciousness levin and his technicians were like a priesthood tending their master as he died and his creation as it was born priests of science ravi thought what a contradiction in terms he waved to levin and thought you get on my last bloody nerve theres levin now he said and forced a smile how long will i be conscious godin asked until the pain gets unbearable send levin in on your way out ravi suppressed his anger hed been a wunderkind all his life but for the past six months hed felt more like a royal physician tending the bed of a king the whims of a tyrant ruled his days he stepped on the button that opened the hatch and walked out of the bubble zach levin nodded from the decontaminator technically levin and his team were ravis subordinates but the hardware and software of the trinity computer were so complex that ravi could not hope to lead levins people in any meaningful way except where the brain itself was concerned even when they approached him with neurological questions he felt more used than listened to they swam like piranhas through his mind devouring what they needed for their excursions into the labyrinthine neuromodels hows he doing levin asked loudly the uv decontaminator buzzed and shut down hes awake ravi said lucid good i have some exciting news for him but not for me ravi thought bitterly have you put any more questions to tennants model levin seemed to consider his reply i dumped dr tennant from the computer an hour ago who told you to do that who do you think godin at this point said levin bringing trinity to full operational status is more important than any damage dr tennant could do the project ravi felt the same way but he didnt want the engineer to know that how does dumping tennants model help you to do that peter thinks some of the problems were now experiencing could have a quantum etiology he thought perhaps andrew fielding might be able to help us fielding you mean youve loaded fieldings neuromodel into the prototype thats right do you really think his model can help you solve your remaining problems to tell you the truth i dont see why his model should perform any differently than dr tennants but its interesting dr fielding is going through the same acclimatization problems tennant experiencedterror confusion feedback loops from his biological survival circuits having incorrectly balanced relief outletsbut he seems to be adapting to them at a significantly faster rate ravi shivered levin spoke as if fielding were still alive what do you think that means the engineer shrugged maybe nothing but peters intuition has been accurate too many times to ignore it and it was the work stored in dr fieldings crystal that brought us this far if the processing areas of his model perform at a higher efficiency level than dr tennants it could be a whole new ball game ravis heartbeat quickened what are the odds of that happening levin didnt answer ravi felt like slapping the taller mans face but the implications of what hed learned drove such thoughts from his head well carry on levins arrogant smile told ravi just how little weight his words carried now ravi walked out of the hangar climbed aboard his atv and gunned the engine if what levin said was true then his phone call to skow had been premature trinity might quickly become a reality despite godins death and if that happened it would change everything instead of looking for scapegoats the president would be looking for chests to pin medals on and if ravi played his cards right he could be first in line as he rode back toward his office he glanced at the containment building halfburied in sand the concrete block exuded a sense of power he had felt nowhere else in the world hed experienced unease standing in nuclear power stations but the danger in a nuclear reactor was quantifiable even the worstcase scenario was predictable because nuclear fuel however dangerous obeyed natural laws trinity would be different fifty miles north of this facility the first nuclear explosion on earth had turned the desert floor to glass robert oppenheimer had stared awestruck into the eye of the resulting fireball but his awe had been at himself as much as at the new machine he had built but if the computer inside containment reached its full potential if every problem were solved and a neuromodel hit percent efficiencythen peter godins creation would dwarf oppenheimers deadly toy for when men looked into the eye of trinity trinity would look back and it would know what it was looking at an inferior form of life chapter i came awake in a sweatdrenched tshirt with no idea where i was a sticky film covered my face and a darkhaired woman lay in bed beside me i could tell it was a woman by the shape of her shoulder afternoon sunlight spilled through a curtain to my left falling across two suitcases standing on the floor then i remembered jerusalem a dream had awakened me and no normal dream all i could see was the face of a man leaning close to kiss me the image made me shudder but i fought the urge to push it from my mind soldiers i remembered soldiers with swords i was standing in the dark beneath a tree in a fragrant garden men slept around me on the ground their snores made me feel alone fear was working in me a fear that death was approaching i heard a commotion to my right and then soldiers burst among the sleeping men shouting and searching the trees a robed man walked toward me from the shadows with the paralysis of nightmares i stood there as he kissed me on the cheek his lips were waxy and cold as he pulled back the soldiers seized me rachel shifted beneath the bedcovers i looked at my watch threethirty pm israel time seven hours ahead of new york i couldnt believe it wed slept almost eighteen hours i picked up the phone beside the bed called the lobby and requested a car and an englishspeaking driver for the afternoon the price was shekels per hour whatever that was rachel stirred at the sound of my voice but did not awaken i should go alone i thought looking down at her then i saw an image of myself falling unconscious in the street lost in a narcoleptic dream i couldnt risk that i went to the bathroom and got into the shower israel was nothing like my dreams from the moment wed entered ben gurion airport in tel aviv we were assaulted by modernity from every side radios metal detectors submachine guns the odor of jet fuel we rode from tel aviv to jerusalem in a sherut a hired minivan with six other people i kept quiet most of the way and rachel occasionally squeezed my hand in reassurance she could tell i was disoriented that the scenery outside the van was not what id expected to find as we neared jerusalem though i caught sight of the old city on its hill pristine in the dying sunlight and my disappointment faded whatever i had come for it awaited me behind those ancient walls it was nearly dark by the time we reached our hotel we gave our passport numbers to the desk clerk and followed our bags up to the sixth floor the room was clean but small wed planned to go out for food but when we sat on the bed to catch our breath jet lag and the exhaustion of the past two days caught up with us rachel had slept a little on the plane but i had not the warmth and silence of the hotel room were like a narcotic poured into my veins i ate an orange rachel had bought at ben gurion and fell into oblivion only the dream of the garden had brought me out of it i shut off the shower nozzle toweled myself off and walked back into the room rachel had rolled onto her stomach her bare shoulders still showed above the covers i went to the window and pulled back the curtain in the hope of seeing the old city but nondescript buildings blocked my view i walked to the bed and shook rachels arm she didnt respond i shook her again she blinked several times then stretched and got up on one elbow is that clock right yes weve got a car coming this did not seem to please her you still want to go today its late already i had another dream what about the garden of gethsemane she lay back on the bed and stared at the ceiling thats a lot further in the chronology than you were before isnt it yes gethsemane begins the countdown to the crucifixion i have to get to the old city it cant wait until tomorrow she pulled the sheet around her then stood and gazed into my eyes i think we should wait until tomorrow why were safe in this room its a miracle that we even got here and i think we need some time to recover from all weve been through but my dream she reached down and took my hand nothing is going to happen to you david not even if you dream of the crucifixion youre here with me and i know how to take care of you she dropped her other hand to mine and the sheet fell around her feet i tried not to drop my eyes but she meant for me to see rachel i have to go today we can go just not yet she laid her head against my chest and put her arms around me the world isnt going to end if we take a few minutes for ourselves she kissed my chest then nuzzled my neck and pulled me against her waist her professional persona had been shed like a dead husk of skin this new woman was a revelation to me and i wanted her i bent to her upturned face and kissed her her lips were warm and elastic nothing like the waxy lips in my dream a shudder passed through me at the memory she drew back and looked into my eyes whats the matter im okay i leaned down to kiss her again she shook her head youre not youre not going to be all right until we put this jesus business to rest once and for all the phone rang startling us both i picked it up yes your car is here sir said an accented voice thank you i hung up before i could explain rachel kissed my cheek then turned and began to dress our driver was a mustached old palestinian named ibrahim his englishspeaking qualification was marginal but he understood that we wanted the old city and that was enough to get us to the jaffa gate as we approached the sunbleached stone wall i felt my first wave of deja vu behind that wall in that blooddrenched repository of history lay a secret for me alone for two thousand years it had waited invisible to those who came with shovels toothbrushes files and dental picks what that secret was i didnt know but i would know it when i found it where do you want to start rachel asked jesus last day yes said ibrahim looking back at me mount of olives garden of gethsemane place of the skull a motorcycle honked angrily and shot past us place of the skull i asked in hebrew golgotha in latin calvary where jesus was crucified thats what we want church of the holy sepulchre nine stations of the cross outside the church last five stations inside i take you there now why there rachel asked me i felt a wave of heat pass through me and for a moment i couldnt breathe i dont know david whats the matter she put a hand to my forehead youre burning up thirty seconds ago id felt fine but she was right lets just hurry ibrahim pulled into a parking place as a citroen backed out a huge tour bus blocked out the light behind us are we stopping outside the wall rachel asked yes ibrahim replied is customary to walk from here see landmarks of the city how far away is the church holy sepulchre on day like today half hour to via dolorosa maybe little more rachel looked doubtful can you get us closer is the mister sick she hesitated yes hes come to jerusalem in the hope that it will help ah many sick people go to jesus tomb and kiss the rock where he rose up from the death can you help us of course for a hundred shekels more i get you there very fast whatever it takes ibrahim backed up then honked his horn and stepped on the gas earning curses from a shawled woman who had to dodge his front bumper to save her life another wave of heat rolled through me i was afraid i might pass out is it narcolepsy rachel asked no different we should go back to the hotel no the via dolorosa via dolorosa echoed ibrahim way of sadness christians here call it the way of flowers first station jesus condemned to death second station the cross was forced upon him third station he stumbled for the first time fourth station our guides voice quickly became a drone i couldnt follow sweat poured from my skin and i felt suddenly cold as our car whipped through the narrow streets i saw stone walls bright shutters market stalls spilling knickknacks from their shelves and tourists dressed in the apparel of a hundred nations ibrahim rolled down his window to curse someone and the scent of jasmine filled the car when it entered my nostrils i felt a sudden euphoria and then everything went white chapter david wake up were here someone was shaking my shoulder i blinked and sat up rachel was leaning in through the back door of the car where are we the via dolorosa its a surrealist painting in motion do you still want to see it i pulled myself out of the car and stood gazing in awe at the throngs of tourists four of whom carried large wooden crosses over their shoulder two of the wouldbe jesuses wore white robes the others street clothes the crosses had wheels to ease the burden which to me made the act of carrying them almost pointless do you recognize anything from your dreams rachel asked no lets go ibrahim led us along a cobbled street weaving through the tourists with practiced ease i had expected to find reverence here but the atmosphere was more like a circus a babel of voices reverberated between the walls german french english russian hebrew arabic japanese and italian and those just the languages i recognized a man with a crew cut and an alabama accent preached fire and brimstone to a group of japanese pilgrims ibrahim talked all the way his spiel honed to an emotionless monotone over years of guiding wait rachel said stopping him she turned to me what do you want to see where are we ibrahim smiled sir up there at the blue door is the omaria school site of the first station of the cross where jesus was condemned to death do you want to see that rachel asked no whats the second station ibrahim pointed down the cobbled street to a half circle of bricks set in the street there is where jesus began to carry the cross down the street is the chapel of flagellation where the roman soldiers whipped jesus set on him a crown of thorns and said hail king of the jews then pilate led him to the crowd and cried ecce homo behold the man ibrahim delivered this information with the excitement of a man reading bingo numbers in a nursing home go on i said to the church our guide continued down the street we passed a black door set in a white stone arch and ibrahim said something about jesus falling for the first time i stared at the door but felt nothing perhaps what i sought lay buried beneath this warren of streets and shops and awnings jerusalem was probably like cairo built upon its own bones a place where any new construction unearthed lost chapters of history ibrahim led us to another semicircle of bricks and started his spiel again this is the fifth station where the romans soldiers compelled simon of cyrene to help jesus carry the cross rachel glanced at me keep moving a smiling boy wandered by selling thorn crowns he took my stare as a sign of interest but ibrahim shooed him away as i watched the bundle of thorns bob down the street on the boys arm blackness filled my vision and my knees went to water rachel slipped under my right arm and together we stumbled after ibrahim the next few stops were a blur the palestinians words blending in a rush of strange images here veronica wiped jesus tormented face at which his true likeness was miraculously imprinted on the veil here jesus fell the second time here he said daughters of jerusalem do not weep for me but weep for yourselves and for your children we passed over a rooftop and through a dark chapel and then i found myself in a crowded courtyard before a romanesque church pilgrims priests and nuns moved under the watchful eyes of a dozen israeli soldiers with submachine guns this is church of the holy sepulchre ibrahim said waving his arm toward the building built by crusaders over fifty years between and original basilica was built by queen helena mother of constantine who came here in and discovered pieces of the true cross in cave below the earth i looked with dismay at the line of tourists before the door this not bad ibrahim said tourism very bad for this time of year the fighting scare everyone away even in western holy week good for you bad for me do you feel all right sir i could get you some water while we wait im fine you can put more weight on me rachel said repositioning herself under my arm i leaned a little harder on her thanks she touched my cheek with the back of her hand i wish i could take your blood pressure to the right of the entrance is tenth station said ibrahim there jesus was stripped of his clothes last five stations of the cross are contained within the church itself its strange isnt it rachel said quietly millions of people traveling to see an empty tomb all i could manage was a nod this is only empty tomb in any christian church on earth said ibrahim the angel asked the marys whom do you seek jesus of nazareth they said he is not here said the angel he is risen the courtyard suddenly faded before me and my limbs grew less heavy i seemed to float on rachels arm david she asked can you hear me i blinked and found myself looking at a stone ceiling are we inside the church you were sleepwalking she whispered her eyes filled with anxiety we have to get you back to the hotel were here now we made it i have to see it see what and then i knew the tomb she turned to ibrahim where is jesus tomb this way all the sites close together in this church he pointed at a reddish marble slab on the floor several men and women in street clothes knelt with their faces pressed to the stone above them a woman poured something on the slab a sickly sweet wave of perfume hit me whats that i asked the stone of unction said ibrahim where jesus body was anointed with oils and wrapped in a shroud after he was taken down from the cross i moved closer but i felt nothing is this the original stone no sir this stone dates from and replaces stone from twelfth century nothing certain is known beyond that time this way sir he led us to the left into the rotunda of the church light cascaded down from a spectacular gold and white dome below the dome stood a large rectangular edifice of marble that seemed to have been boxed for shipping in great metal bands it was topped by a cupola that looked like it belonged on the kremlin whats that i asked this is the holy tomb sir called the edicule or little house because jesus was very important man byzantines and crusaders spent a lot of money to make this tomb for him it is fourteenth and final station of the cross by the customs of jews always they buried the people outside the city the present marble exterior is disintegrating and must be held together by iron bands come sir get in the line madam ibrahim continued his unrelenting recitation but i was too disoriented to process it id expected the tomb of jesus to be a cave of some kind situated in an open place not this mausoleum in a dungeonlike medieval church the lines moving rachel said helping me forward soon we were standing before the door of the edicule here ibrahim spoke with the respect i had expected from the beginning inside the tomb we will see two rooms let us go in now in the first room i saw a podium with a glass case atop it inside the case lay a piece of stone this we call the room of the angel said ibrahim where the dead person wait until they prepare place to bury him here is kept a piece of the rolling stone where angels opened the tomb and jesus raised up from the dead i noticed two holes in the wall to my right ibrahim said when the people have no fire for their easter candles the priest he stand here and give them from the holy fire gives light from his big candle to theirs my attention had been drawn to a low door in the thick marble wall of the inner tomb i stooped and moved through the door into a small inner chamber a man and woman knelt in prayer before what appeared to be a marble altar slab they had placed crucifixes on the stone as though the objects would be blessed by contact above them hung ornate silver lamps on chains and everywhere burning candles threw flickering light around the room vases of white roses scented the air their odor cloying in the small space david rachel whispered is this what you came to see i leaned down and touched the marble stone before the praying couple i didnt know what id expected but something id felt more at stonehenge when i climbed over the barrier and touched the sarsen stones this isnt the place what nothing happened here the kneeling man and woman looked up at me their eyes wide sir you must not say this ibrahim said from behind me this is most holy place this isnt the place i repeated i ducked down and hurried back onto the floor of the rotunda rachel came after me the people waiting in line stared at us sensing trouble i didnt care a wild feeling of panic had gripped me soon it would be dark outside and i had not found what id come for tell me whats happening rachel whispered nothing happened in there thats not the place someone in the line gasped what place asked rachel i turned to ibrahim who now had a walkietalkie in his hand and seemed to be debating whether to call for help is that the original stone in the tomb no sir marble stone was put there to cover the actual stone where jesus body lay you cant see the actual stone our guides face brightened yes you can see this touch also follow me he led us to the rear of the edicule there stood another chapel much less ostentatious and open to the rotunda it was far more colorful than the marble tomb wed left with bright wall hangings wrought iron and a casually dressed young man with a fiveoclock shadow tending it this is the holy tomb from the other side sir ibrahim said in a whisper part of the coptic chapel coptics are christians from egypt very devout the queue here was much shorter it disappeared into the shallow chapel and stopped where a small curtain shielded something sir beyond that point lies exposed part of the actual stone where jesus lay here the sick come to be cured people to be blessed as i waited for the line to move my skin began to itch as though from hives at last my turn came i went through the curtain knelt and laid my right palm on the bare stone david rachel whispered from behind me i shook my head nothing for the first time in six months i began to truly doubt my sanity i think we should go back to the hotel rachel said ibrahim is close to calling for help i scrambled up and left the chapel my mind racing ibrahim was staring at me as though i might start shouting blasphemy which the old guide had probably seen in his day the walkietalkie was still in his hand nothing happened there either i told him thats not the place but sir this is the holy tomb theres no doubt of that well some protestant christians believe the garden tomb outside the city is the site of jesus tomb but no archaeologist believes this you have seen the actual tomb sir a tall plain woman carrying a king james bible stepped out of the line before the chapel and said in english does it really matter where the tomb is brother he is not there he is risen does it matter i asked her of course it matters what if you found the actual tomb with jesus bones still in it its the difference between a legitimate religion and mass hysteria the woman almost jumped backward ibrahim looked stricken sir you must not say these things youre a muslim ibrahim you dont believe any of this please sir i walked away from the edicule not knowing where to turn or what to do rachel appeared at my shoulder david what is it youre looking for the place where jesus was resurrected but you dont believe in god how can you find the place where jesus was resurrected when you dont believe that he was ibrahim had caught up to us sir some people believe jesus rose from the death at another place i will show you he led us across the rotunda to the door of a large church wholly contained within the bounds of the greater one this is the catholicon he pointed toward a chandelier below the cupola of this church is a marble basin called the omphalos the navel of the world some greeks believe jesus was resurrected here and will return here to judge the world one day can we see it this church is usually closed but i can take you to it he led us past a chain toward a stone chalice standing on an inlaid floor high above stood a dome with an ethereal image of christ painted in pastel hues i looked down at the stone hemisphere essentially a large bowl then i leaned down and touched it i felt no more than i would had i touched a birdbath in someones backyard rachel instantly read my reaction what are you hoping for an electric shock a voice from heaven i turned to our guide who was shaking his head what have i not seen ibrahim many things most important is golgotha in latin called calvary the place where jesus was crucified its inside the church of course sir follow me he led us out of the catholicon and over to a steep staircase i counted eighteen steps as i plodded upward my spirits sinking lower the higher i climbed the moment i reached the top of the stairs i felt a quickening in my blood the room was crowded but to my left above the heads of the people i saw a lifesize sculpture of jesus hanging on a cross he wore a silver cloth around his waist and a crown of silver on his head it wasnt the sculpture that moved me but something in the room itself i felt as if i were standing close to a highvoltage cable with static electricity raising every hair on my body what rachel asked what is it something in me is vibrating youve felt that before thats a textbook precursor to a hypnagogic hallucination no this is different ibrahim said rachel yes madam were going back to the car yes he said with relief i stepped away from them to my right a mural showed jesus lying on the cross which lay flat on the ground some people standing before the mural parted revealing a cabinet with panels of hammered silver as i walked toward the mural pain radiated up my arm from my left hand for a moment i thought i was having a heart attack then pain shot up my right arm as well i clenched both hands into fists but it did no good i turned to ibrahim what is this place this is the eleventh station sir where jesus was nailed to the cross i moaned we have to get him out of here rachel said can you get help he is walking ibrahim said let us go now i dont think hell go some people in the room were staring at me as if i might be mad i can get soldiers ibrahim said but i would rather not do this no rachel said quickly i mean yes thats not necessary a group of pilgrims moved away from the sculpture of jesus revealing a fantastically ornate altar i stepped forward my eyes locked on a silverclad madonna standing below the cross the altar before her seemed to be sitting on a large glass case and under the glass i saw rough gray rock whats that golgotha ibrahim answered the place of the skull that is the mountain itself where the rock cracked when jesus blood fell down from the cross then came the earthquake searing white light blotted out the scene before me i saw the mountain as it had been before the church was here a bare rocky hill beside a mountain riddled with tombs three crosses stood on the hill but no one hung from them the sky darkened and went black and i fell to my knees i found myself staring at a shining silver disk with a hole in it the disk lay on the marble base of the altar a foot off the floor i put out my shaking right hand and laid my palm on the disk the pain in my hands instantly eased this is the place i said this is where jesus left the earth he is right said ibrahim that disk marks the spot where the cross stood in the ground to the right and left are black disks where the thieves crosses stood one being good another being bad afterward jesus was taken away to the tomb of joseph of aramathea and rose from the death three days later no i said ibrahim blanched sir you cannot say such things here whisper rachel pleaded whats the hole in the disk for i asked my hand caressing the cool silver you may put fingers through and touch golgotha the rock of calvary i closed my eyes and slipped two fingers through the hole my fingertips scraped rough stone did you dream of this rachel asked i couldnt speak something was flowing into me from the living rock rachels voice receded and did not return i felt as if my bones were singing vibrating in sympathy with something in the earth at first the feeling was something like joy but as the intensity built i began to shake then to jerk spastically it s a seizure said a familiar voice in my head my medical voice a tonicclonic seizure through the fog of receding consciousness i heard people yelling in several languages then i fell and rachel screamed the impact of the floor was like water chapter white sands at am mountain standard time peter godin went into code blue ravi nara wasnt in the hospital hangar but he was sleeping nearby and he got to godins bedside in less than two minutes hed been expecting the old man to crash without a shunt to relieve the pressure in the fourth ventricle of the brain hydrocephalus was inevitable but when ravi arrived in the bubble he found the old man suffering a gardenvariety heart attack godins two nurses had already intubated and bagged him and one was defibrillating his heart ravi read the ekg and confirmed their diagnosis ventricular tachycardia they were using the paddles because godin had no pulse it took two drug combinations and a joule shock to bring the heart back to a sinus rhythm ravi drew blood to check for cardiacspecific enzymes that would tell him how much damage had been done to the heart muscle then since godin remained unconscious ravi sat down for a moment to decompress he hated clinical medicine something was always coming out of left field to surprise you godin had had a coronary bypass fifteen years ago and a cardiac stent implanted in the risk of an mi was constant but under the strain of treating the brainstem glioma ravi had let the cardiac risk recede in his mind the nurses had noticed his hesitancy during the code not exactly what they expected from a nobel laureate in medicine after years in research labs he was out of practice so what a veterinarian could run the protocols of a code blue as a nurse started to attach the ventilator to godins breathing tube the old man tried to speak but his effort produced only squeaks ravi leaned down to his ear dont try to talk peter you had a little arrhythmia but youre stable now godin held up his hand for something to write with a nurse gave him a pen then held a hardbacked pad up to his hand godin scribbled dont let me die were so close youre not going to die ravi assured him though he was far from sure himself hypoxia could easily trigger the fatal hydrocephalus hed been expecting he squeezed godins shoulder then ordered the nurses to put him on the ventilator it would make the old man furious but he would endure it to avoid godins protests ravi left the bubble as he closed the hatch he saw zach levin rush into the hangar what is it ravi asked whats happened levin had to catch his breath before he could speak fieldings model is cracking the final algorithms hes got the memory area linked to the processing areas and hes creating all new interface circuitry ive never seen anything like it you mean fieldings model is doing all that yes yes but ive got to tell you even with the machine running at only fifty percent capacity i can feel him in there its like talking to the man i worked with for the past two years like hes alive again youre at fifty percent efficiency levin grinned and rising i should have had more faith in peters instincts ravi tried to conceal his shock ninety percent efficiency was the point at which godin had predicted that a neuromodel would become fully consciousa condition he had termed the trinity state you said talking ravi thought aloud is the voice synthesizer working is fielding talking to you hes trying he cant really explain what hes doing but the efficiency is creeping steadily upward weve got a definite timeline now despite the complexities of his personal situation ravi couldnt suppress his excitement how long twelve to sixteen hours to trinity state levin nodded and id bet closer to twelve weve got a pool going in containment ravi looked at his watch how certain are you as certain as anything gets in this business ive got to tell peter whats happening ravi didnt want godin hearing about this until he had talked to skow you cant go in right now he wont hear you peter coded twenty minutes ago levin stiffened in alarm hes not dead no but hes on the ventilator conscious not enough to understand you and he cant speak but he has to know this it will double his will to fight ravi tried to look sympathetic hes never lacked that no but this will change everything im sorry zach i cant allow you to go in levin looked down at ravi with disdain you dont make decisions like that limiting peters access to critical information i am his physician so do your fucking job it doesnt take a doctor to see that the best thing anyone could do for peters health right now is to give him this information levin turned away and stepped into the uv decontaminator ravi started to argue but the engineer stamped on the start button making conversation pointless if levin insisted on entering the bubble ravi couldnt stop him godin would probably ask for him soon anyway ravi hurried to the exit he needed to talk to skow immediately because zach levin was right with trinity twelve to sixteen hours from becoming a reality godin would almost certainly live to see it and that changed everything skow was preparing the president for trinitys failure setting up to blame godin for everything and using ravi to help him do it if skow went too farand godin at the eleventh hour delivered the revolutionary computer he had promisedravi could find himself in a precarious position peter godin would not take betrayal lightly he would exact his own form of justice an image of geli bauer came into ravis mind he was damned glad she was lying in a hospital in maryland jerusalem rachel braced herself against the side of the ambulance as it tore through all but impassable traffic david lay unconscious on a gurney on the floor the paramedic in back spoke enough english to communicate with rachel but he could tell her little and do even less given his patients condition when david collapsed in the church rachel had known instantly that he was having a seizure shed knelt and cradled his head to keep him from banging it on the floor but that was all she could do seizure victims swallowing their tongues was a myth and you could lose fingers trying to prevent it ibrahim had used his walkietalkie to call the ambulance and rachel got the feeling hed done it before israeli soldiers quickly cordoned off the chapel by the time the ambulance arrived davids seizure was over but he had not awakened the paramedics checked his blood sugar and found a normal glucose level with coma that was the limit of what they could do at the scene so they fitted a collar on him put him on a backboard and had the soldiers carry him out to the ambulance in the courtyard as they careened though the streets rachel mentally raced through the possible causes of coma drugs were the most common cause after hypoglycemia but david had no history of substance abuse he hadnt hit the floor hard enough to cause head trauma and fortyone was old even for lateonset epilepsy take his money belt and clothes and put them into a plastic bag a man in white came to the door and spoke hebrew to the paramedics he glanced at rachel then entered and in heavily accented english asked her to summarize what had happened at the church she complied then gave davids medical history as best she knew it he had been unconscious for thirty minutes most patients suffering a grand mal seizure would be coming out of it by now the doctor ordered blood work x rays of the chest and cervical spine a ct scan to rule out stroke tumors or subarachnoid hemorrhage and a spinal tap to rule out meningitis after a nurse drew the blood an aide moved david to radiology for the ct scan which took nearly an hour when he returned to the treatment room he was still unconscious next the er doctor performed the spinal puncture the escaping spinal fluid had normal pressure and rachel breathed much easier when she saw that the fluid was clear infection was highly unlikely the next step was a referral to neurology and at that point rachel began to panic a neurology referral meant admission to the hospital which would bring questions about medical insurance and payment there was in the two money belts but she didnt want to raise suspicions by showing that kind of cash she nearly hugged the er doctor when he informed her that there were no beds available in neurology david would have to remain in the emergency department when an eeg tech wheeled in a portable machine to do an electroencephalogram of davids brain rachel saw instantly that he was sharp he switched off most of the electrical equipment in the room before performing the test which eliminated background interference and made for a much clearer tracing as the tracing emerged from the machine the tech looked concerned and rachel soon saw why davids brain showed only alpha wave activity of uniform frequency and amplitude the tech leaned forward and clapped his hands near davids right ear but the alpha waves did not desynchronize they didnt change at all rachels heart sank david appeared to be in a state known as alpha coma few patients emerged alive from alpha coma are you a doctor the tech asked noticing her expression yes his eyes softened im sorry as he reached to shut off the machine rachel saw a theta wave appear on the screen wait she cried pointing i see it the theta waves increased steadily in amplitude then some beta waves appeared hes dreaming rachel said hardly believing it could he only be asleep the tech pinched davids arm there was no response he leaned down to one ear and yelled wake up nothing hes not sleeping the tech said thoughtfully but those thetas are definitely increasing in strength what do you think is happening this guys definitely in alpha coma but his brain is doing something what i dont know the tech walked to the door then looked back at rachel im going to leave the machine connected and get a neurologist down here okay thank you she sat alone beside the bed her hands shaking as she watched the screen until shed seen that theta wave shed believed david was as good as dead now she had no idea what was happening but something was going on in his head could he be hallucinating in coma as he had during his narcoleptic attacks maybe he wasnt really in coma at all sometimes a patient could appear to be comatose when he was actually having small seizures yet the eeg didnt show that it showed an alpha coma state interrupted by inexplicable theta and beta intrusions she didnt want to think about what david had been doing prior to his seizure but she couldnt stop herself in the medieval gloom of holy sepulchre he had been searching for some remnant of jesus life on earth or of his death he had scorned the traditional places venerated by pilgrimsthe anointing stone the tomb itself but at the place marked as the spot where jesus died on the cross he had fallen to his knees and whispered this is the place then the seizure had started the incident had actually begun before that when david looked at the mural depicting christ being nailed to the cross he had clenched his fists as though his hands were in agony what had been going on in his mind did he really believe that he was jesus christ believe it so completely that he felt jesus wounds shed heard of cases of stigmata caused by the mind but she had never really believed them was she witnessing something similar she grasped davids limp hand despite the eeg she halfexpected him to open his eyes yet they remained closed she silently thanked god that the er doctor had ordered a ct scan rather than an mri how could she have talked him out of what he would see as a harmless imaging test how could she protect david from anything here she didnt know what her enemy was the only person she could think of who might have answers about this strange coma was ravi nara but according to david nara was part of the group that wanted to kill them wake up david she said softly in his ear for gods sake wake up chapter white sands ravi nara parked his atv outside the hospital hangar and walked to the door in his pocket was a syringe of potassium chloride that would stop godins weakened heart as surely as a bullet he paused at the hangar door unable to open it it had taken hours to steel himself for this visit and without skow threatening him he would not have made it this far theyre watching this on monitors somewhere he said to himself move he entered the hangar slipped on a fresh lab coat then walked into the decontaminator and stepped on the floor switch highintensity uv light bombarded him from all sides as he stood in the purple glow he stared through the hatch in the bubble godins nurses sat like guard dogs on either side of the bed its him or me he told himself remember what skow said the nsa man had not shouted with joy when hed learned that the computer might reach trinity state within twelve hours hed asked how long godin was likely to live when ravi answered more than twelve hours skow told him that could not be allowed to happen why not ravi had asked afraid he already knew the answer because its too late skow snapped the president called me from china very upset about the tennant situation very suspicious too i had to tell him something that made sense something besides the truth you mean exactly i told him that peter has been ill all along and that i was afraid he might be responsible for fieldings death i told him that peter had disappeared and that there might be a secret research facility somewhere the fbi is tearing apart the godin supercomputing complex in mountain view as we speak ravi shut his eyes and prayed this was a nightmare in the conference room in north carolina the decision to end fieldings life had seemed almost an official government act trinity existed to strengthen americas strategic position in the world fielding had sabotaged its progress but when you stripped away the window dressing fieldings termination had been plain old murder ravi im here he knew what skow was going to ask of him and he dreaded it you know what has to be done ravi made one last stand you said that if we delivered trinity no one would care who had died to make it happen that was before the mess with tennant weve had a shooting in washington for gods sake ive painted tennant as a dangerous psychotic but thats all right i have medical evidence to support that those are problems for you not me skow spoke calmly but his words chilled ravis blood youre not the only person who knows you were part of fieldings death i have recordings of you very incriminating recordings were all in the same boat ravi you me geli and general bauer if we all tell the same story no one can touch us but peter has to die ravi closed his eyes in anguish our lives are in your hands ravi a few seconds of courage will wash you clean clean he thought ill never be clean again was it morally wrong to kill godin the man was only hours from a natural death and without ravi he would have died days ago godin had ordered the murder of andrew fielding without any visible compunction and beyond that there was the almost fantastic reality that killing godins biological body would not really end his life as long as his neuromodel existed his mind and personality could be resurrected in the trinity computer the problem was not one of morality but of opportunity when a man was as sick as godin there were a half dozen ways to push him over the edge but godins nurses never left him alone ravi had tested them twice today in both instances they had taken cell phones from their pockets and awakened sleeping relief nurses for assistance after considering several options ravi had prepared the syringe of potassium chloride as a diversion he would trigger an alarm on one of the monitors then inject the potassium into godins iv line a code blue would followone that godin would never survive the uv lights of the decontaminator buzzed and went dark ravi saw the blur of nurses whites through the bubbles plexiglas door where the hell is geli bauer he thought this job is tailormade for her ravi opened the bubbles hatch and stopped his throat sealed shut standing beside one of godins nurses was geli bauer she wore black from head to toe and she looked every bit as dangerous as she had when he had last seen her in north carolina hello ravi she said you look surprised to see me ravi could not speak geli wore an armored vest over her black bodysuit and a web belt laden with pistol taser and knife godin raised the upper half of his bed with a switch his blue eyes locked on ravi only then did ravi realize that godin had been taken off the ventilator what do you have to say ravi the old man asked im surprised to see geli up and around he stammered id heard it was a neck wound geli smiled then pulled down her black turtleneck revealing a white pressure bandage just another scar to add to my collection i had a good surgical team ravis heart thumped against his sternum what the hell was geli doing in white sands and why was she guarding godin according to skow shed accepted the necessity of godins death and was on board with skows plan the old man seemed amused by ravis discomfort well here i am back from the dead he rasped they tell me it was my heart this time ventricular tachycardia ravi confirmed i hear it was my nurses who brought me back all ravi could think about was the syringe in his pocket he felt sure that geli was going to walk over to him pull out the syringe and jam it into his jugular vein they did everything perfectly ravi said godin nodded would you have done the same ravi if you were alone with me ravis stomach flipped over i dont understand peter of course i would have godin ignored his answer as for geli i wanted her with me i feel safer when shes around the piercing blue eyes fixed ravi with a relentless stare what are you doing here dr nara i was hoping to take you off the ventilator but i see your nurses have already done that godin glanced at geli they seemed to be sharing a private joke ravi searched for something to support his lie levin told me the prototype could reach trinity state soon i knew youd want to be as alert as possible when that happens and all due to andrew fielding godin said the ironies are breathtaking ravi glanced nervously at geli its a miracle peter youre going to live to see your dream come true godins lids descended until his eyes were slits really have you heard from skow lately ravis blood pressure plummeted i spoke to him earlier today hes very excited hes going to fly out soon godin snorted he wants to be present at the creation i suppose so i mean naturally he does the ensuing silence became almost unbearable ravi couldnt bring himself to look into gelis eyes he was searching for an excuse to leave when godin said how long do i have left worst case ravi was too frightened to speak anything but the truth you could code again in the next half hour if you chew your food wrong it could trigger fatal hydrocephalus godin nodded soberly whats the longest i could live maybe twentyfour hours ravi marshaled all his courage and stepped toward the bed id like to do a quick examination if you dont mind geli blocked his path she did nothing overtly threatening but her very posture seemed dangerous ravi could hardly believe hed once spent hours fantasizing about having sex with her the idea that he could satisfy a woman of such strength and power seemed ludicrous search him godin said ravi knew then that he was lost he wanted to bolt but he was like a man facing an attack dog if he ran geli would pounce and rip his throat out she knelt before him and patted him down she gave his groin a taunting scratch with her fingernail but as her hand passed over his right thigh her eyes lit up like a mischievous childs reaching into his pocket she pulled out the loaded syringe which she held up for godin to see whats in that godin asked epinephrine ravi said in case of another code i wanted to be ready geli shook her head i just reviewed a surveillance tape of you in the dispensary earlier this afternoon it shows you filling this syringe from a bottle marked kc potassium chloride ravis hands began to shake godin spoke in a neutral voice dr thomas case from johns hopkins is being flown here as we speak you will brief him when he arrives dr case will perform any handson treatment that is required after that point ravis face felt numb godins eyes sought him out refusing to let him hide you couldnt wait one day for the cancer to take me what could he say would blaming skow spare him anything dont answer godin said despite past glory you want more you look at your achievements not with pride but with fear that you might never repeat them youre a pygmy in your soul ravi andrew fielding was worth ten of you and of you ravi said surprising himself is that why you killed him the blue eyes closed but godin answered in a clear voice fielding was a great physicist but no man can hold back the future hell have another chance at life hes partly alive in containment now and one day his model will reach trinity state on that day hell understand what ive done now its time for you to go ravi had never seen geli bauer smile with more pleasure than she did now taller than he by three inches she draped her arm around him like a lover then she looked down into his eyes with chilling intimacy theres only one question we need answered she said did you hatch this in your own little overheated brain or did you have help you already know that ravi thought he tried to slip out from under her arm but geli only tightened her grip then she ran a fingernail along his shoulder to his neck come on ravi havent you ever fantasized about spending some time alone with me he feared his bladder would let go jerusalem for rachel the night had not passed without hope but as dawn crept over the dead sea and lighted the valley of kidron she sank slowly into despair david was dying the neurologist who had appeared to evaluate him yesterday evening was a short goodhumored man named weinstein dr weinstein had dark hair and quick black eyes that missed nothing hed done some training at massachusetts general in boston and he spoke perfect english as soon as he read the eeg he ordered an mri scan of davids brain rachel decided then that she had to tell part of the truth she asked weinstein if hed heard of ravi nara the neurologist knew naras work and was impressed that his new patient had done research with the nobel laureate rachel explained that naras research involved a highly advanced mri unit that caused neurological side effects in some people for this reason she begged weinstein to postpone any mri scans until there was no other option i understand what youre telling me weinstein said and im intrigued but in my opinion this man is very close to death im sure youre aware that diffusionweighted mri images show the brain stem far more clearly than a ct scan theres just too much heavy bone in that area for ct to image it well i know rachel said but do you really think this coma is being caused by a tumor in the brain stem the neurologist shrugged frankly its the only thing we havent ruled out youre thinking dr naras scans would have turned up any masses yes weinstein folded his arms and sighed you know what i think what your friend is going to die very soon if we dont find out whats wrong with him sixty minutes later weinstein was reading diffusionweighted mri scans of davids brain stem they showed no tumor as he related his findings to rachel davids theta and beta waves vanished from the eeg screen rachel grabbed the tracing which now displayed only the uniform alpha wave of alpha coma she began to cry dr weinstein put an arm around her theres no way an mri caused that he sounded as though he were trying to convince himself more than rachel maybe you should call dr nara were in uncharted territory here rachel closed her eyes how could she explain that she couldnt call nara without risking assassination ill try she said it may take me a while to get him weinstein took her into an adjoining office and showed her how to place longdistance calls from the hospital then he gave her his pager number and left to go home to his family rachel stared at the phone trying to talk herself into calling the white house it was the only way she could think of to reach ravi nara but something held her back it was a growing belief that david no matter how ill he might be was not completely delusional he had told her ravi nara was dangerous and part of her believed him david might never learn of this expression of faith in him but wasnt that the nature of faith to believe without answer without reward without proof she got up wiped her eyes and left the phone untouched that was ten hours ago shed spent the time since with her eyes fixed on the eeg screen like a pilgrim watching a marble statue in the hope that it would weep yet the alpha waves remained constant as a young resident she had spent many nights watching patients slide slowly and irreversibly toward death as a psychiatrist shed watched suicidal patients die by inches from selfadministered poisons whose effects could not be countered but only one previous experience had taken her to this awful realm of solitude the death of her son she had barely survived that and now after finding a man who might give her another child someday she found herself sitting by his hospital bed helplessly awaiting the inevitable at three in the morning another burst of theta and beta waves had crossed the eeg screen they lasted seventeen minutes then vanished every half hour she clapped her hands beside davids ear but the alpha wave remained constant according to the machine david was braindead an hour after dawn she bent and kissed him on the forehead then went into the adjoining office and picked up the telephone it took some wrangling with operators but within a few minutes she was connected to the white house switchboard in washington dc im calling about project trinity she said please repeat that said the operator project trinity hold please rachel closed her eyes her hands were quivering and a voice inside her told her to hang up before she could a curt male voice came on the line whos calling please rachel weiss there was a sharp intake of breath say again this is dr rachel weiss im with dr david tennant and i desperately need help i think hes dying stay calm im going to please she cried losing her selfcontrol at last i need to speak to someone who knows about this dr weiss whatever you do stay on this line youve done the right thing dont have any doubt about that chapter white sands ravi nara was lying on a cement floor with a needle pressed to his jugular vein when he was paged to the hospital over the white sands pa system geli bauer was going to kill him with the syringe of potassium chloride he had planned to use on godin dr nara please report to the bubble immediately peter could be coding again he cried geli jerked him to his feet and pushed him toward the door as they hurried toward the hospital he thought about the past half hour after finding the syringe geli had marched him from the bubble to the bare storage room when they arrived ravi asked what the hell she was doing in white sands geli smiled and leaned against the wall studying him as she might an insect that she was about to pin to a board i wanted to know if skow was telling the truth she said if godin was really dying if trinity was really going to fail and godin is dying but trinity isnt going to fail its going to save godins life not his life ravi said his mind thats the very essence of life geli stepped close to ravi and drew a gleaming knife from her belt i could sever your spinal cord anywhere between cone and cseven youd be an instant quadriplegic if i gave you the choice between that and death would you choose death ravi stepped back i see your point geli smiled with fascination her tongue showing between her teeth he had always sensed that she felt some connection between sex and violence and her behavior now confirmed it she was toying with him and watching his fear aroused her i also wanted to see my father she said i havent had that unique pleasure in a long time ravi said nothing theres one other reason im here if you guess it maybe well just stop at paraplegic stop this stupid game ravi snapped skow will be here any minute cant you guess geli said no i wanted to be scanned by the machine he hadnt expected this why you know the scans cause neurological side effects geli laughed people risk side effects for cosmetic surgery ill take some risk for immortality ravi wanted her to keep talking this technology will be held very closely for a long time she said only a few people will be scanned presidents and geniuses like godin maybe a few halfass scientists like you but not security chiefs so i spent three hours this afternoon having a picture taken of my brain quite an experience geli took the syringe of potassium chloride from a pouch on her belt i wonder what my side effect will be she mused narcolepsy and epilepsy i dont need tourettes no shortterm memory loss i could stand im getting it anyway but yours is definitely the winner it already fits my personality ravi shook his head uncontrollable sexual compulsions sounded funny until you had to deal with them like any true compulsion they could drive you to the edge of suicide i used to watch you on the security cameras geli said laughing running to the bathroom five times a day wanking your little weenie i heard you moaning my name a few times pathetic ravi ground his teeth and silently hoped that skow planned to remove geli bauer from the planet he was trying to think of a way to stall some more when geli kicked him in the chest he went down hard and before he could recover his breath she was kneeling on his chest with the syringe at his throat what saved him was not skow but the pa system calling him to the hospital godin had developed serious problems with his tongue he could barely swallow and shooting pains had returned to the surface of his face these were textbook effects of a glioma and nothing could be done about anything but the pain after an hour he regained control of his tongue but his face had started drooping on the left side as ravi pretended to treat the old man godins cell phone rang and geli answered it was the white house she held the phone to godins face while he listened ravi couldnt make out what was being said but he sensed that something had gone wrong no ewan im fine godin lied my health is as good as its always been and i cant imagine what skow was thinking when he told you that godin listened for a while then said if fieldings death was anything but a stroke i think skow is the man we need to talk to he never got along with fielding and hes been running the hunt for tennant as well dont worry about dr tennant ill send ravi nara over on my company jet immediately hes the only doctor in the world who knows anything about that type of coma send ravi nara over where ravi wondered anywhere was better than in the storage room with geli bauer yes ill give you an update as soon as possible goodbye ewan godin waved the phone away then looked up at ravi youre going to jerusalem ravi blinked in astonishment israel tennant is in a coma at hadassah hospital dr weiss is with him she just called the white house for help i assured ewan mccaskell that youre the only man in the world who can help tennant but why do you want to help tennant ravi asked why do they the newspapers are saying tennant wants to kill the president godin swallowed painfully presidents know better than to believe newspapers and youre forgetting it was matthews who foisted tennant on me in the first place he wants tennants side of the story i see ravi didnt see at all what do you want me to do in jerusalem kill tennant ravi closed his eyes hes practically braindead now godin said one tiny push from you and hes gone and nobody the wiser peter i cant walk into an israeli hospital and why not you were prepared to murder me why not tennant i never intended to hurt you the right side of godins face clenched in spasm has the pain returned shut up ravi this is your chance to redeem yourself your one chance to live ravi cut his eyes at geli anything was better than being alone with her again all right but what if i cant do it i mean what if its impossible you wont be the only one trying i see well when am i leaving i want you airborne in ten minutes my gulfstream is fueled on the strip go to administration first youll have a telephone call waiting a telephone call all right peter ravi started to leave but some remnant of professional responsibility held him back what about you dr case can keep me alive until trinity state is reached godin waved him away dont worry tennant will probably die before you get there jerusalem rachel sat by the telephone and prayed that the return call from washington would come soon if a bed opened up in neurology someone would come to move david out of the er she was thinking of going to check his eeg tracing when the telephone rang hello a distinctly american voice said is this dr rachel weiss yes this is ewan mccaskell the presidents chief of staff rachel closed her eyes and tried to keep her voice steady i recognize your voice dr weiss im calling to assure you that the president has the utmost concern for dr tennants health were not quite sure about the reasons behind the events of the past few days but we intend to find the truth the president is back in the united states now and i assure you that dr tennant is going to get a fair hearing something inside her let go then a tangled knot of fear and tension that had been building ever since shed seen david shoot the gunman in his kitchen a stuttering rush of sobs came from her throat dr weiss said mccaskell are you all right yes thank you so much for calling theres something terrible going on and dr tennant has been trying to warn the president about it try to calm down doctor i know you have a medical situation there so im going to bring dr ravi nara in on our call im told hes the only man who has the knowledge to deal with dr tennants problem rachel tensed at the mention of nara there was a crackle as though the connection had been lost dr nara said mccaskell are you there a precise voice in a higher register came on the line yes hello dr weiss this is ravi nara can you hear me chapter my eyes opened like those of a newborn startled by the worlds bare brightness as i blinked against the overhead bulb my body announced itself with aching hunger and an overwhelming urge to empty my bladder i sat up and looked around i was sitting in a medical treatment room id worked in dozens just like it water i thought i need water a woman somewhere said i cant begin to thank you for this her voice was familiar i listened for more words but none followed a door opened across the room rachel walked in and froze then her hand flew to her mouth and she started toward me david can you hear me i held up my hand and she stopped youve been in a coma youve been out for she looked at her watchfifteen hours alpha coma nearly all that time i thought you were brain dead she pointed at my face why are you crying i wiped my face my fingers came away wet i dont know do you remember anything the seizure at the church i remembered kneeling then thrusting my fingers through a hole in a silver plate a current of energy had shot into my arm straight up to my brain a current too intense to endure i felt as though my mind were a tiny glove and the hand of a giant was trying to force its way inside it my body began to shake then i remember falling do you remember anything after that i fell toward the floor but before i reached it the boundary of my body melted away and i felt an oceanic unity with everything around me the earth and rock beneath the church the birds nesting among the stones above the flowers in the courtyard and the pollen they loosed on the wind i was not falling but floating and i saw that a deeper reality underlay the world of things a pulsing matrix in which all boundaries were illusory where the pollen grain was not distinct from the wind where matter and energy moved in an eternal dance and life and death were but changing states of both yet even as i hovered there floating in the world like a sentient jellyfish i sensed that beneath that pulsing matrix of matter and energy lay something still deeper a thrumming substrate as ephemeral and eternal as the laws of mathematics invisible but immutable governing all without force the thrumming was deep and distant like turbines churning in the heart of a dam as i listened i discerned a pattern more numerical than melodic as of an undiscovered music whose notes and scales lay just beyond my understanding i tuned my mind to the sound searching for repetitions the elusive keys to any code yet though i listened with all my being i could not read meaning in the sound it was like listening to a rainstorm and trying to hear the pattern of the individual drops as they hit the ground something in me craved knowledge of the underlying order the vast sheet music that scored the falling of the rain and then i understood the pattern i was searching for was no pattern at all it was randomness a profound randomness that pervaded the seeming order of the world and in that moment i began to see as i had never seen before to hear what few men had ever heard the voice of david can you hear me i blinked and forced myself to focus on my surroundings medical cabinets an eeg machine on a cart rachels exhausted eyes i hear you she took a step forward wringing her hands i called washington i told them we were here i didnt know what else to do i know did you hear the call no then how did you know the same way i know were in danger now i looked down and started to pull the iv line from my wrist dont do that we have to go her eyes went wide what this is going to bleed when i pull it out could you find me a bandage where are my clothes she quickly closed the distance between us and stopped me from pulling out the iv david youre not yourself right now youve been unconscious for a whole night i spoke to ewan mccaskell the president is flying ravi nara over here to treat you hes seen this type of coma before he was in one himself for over thirty hours and he woke up with no ill effects they want to help us ravi nara was never in alpha coma his mri sideeffect was uncontrollable sexual compulsions nothing else but he told me he told you what he knew would calm you down we have to leave now but the president wants to get to the truth mccaskell told me that and i believe him there was no way i could communicate the knowledge inside me without appearing insane i stood and the sheet fell away from my body if we stay here we wont live to see the president i have something very important to do please get my clothes as rachel looked toward a bag in the corner i yanked the iv catheter from my wrist dark blood ran down the back of my hand i applied pressure then went to the counter and found a x bandage in a glass jar rachel saw what i was doing and taped the gauze tightly over the iv site keep your hand on that she said then she got the plastic bag from the corner and laid it on the examining table your clothes there was a commode against one wall but no curtain or partition for privacy i need to use that i told her pointing go ive seen it before i walked to the commode and turned my back to her why do you think people are coming to kill us she asked because nothing has changed in their minds and now they know where we are you still dont trust anyone not even the president the president has no idea whats really happening i walked back to the table and slipped on my shirt then fastened my money belt around my waist but where do you want to go rachel asked white sands where white sands proving ground i carefully pulled on my pants then sat on the floor to put on my shoes its in new mexico why do you want go there thats where the real trinity prototype is how do you know that i just know she shook her head youre scaring me david dont think about it wait she held up one hand thats what was in andrew fieldings fedex letter white gypsum white sand is that what he was trying to tell you where the second trinity site was yes he wanted to let me know but he didnt want anyone who intercepted that letter to know that he knew i looked at the closed door what part of the hospital are we in the emergency department good first floor you know the way out yes but i stood and took her hand in mine everything has changed rachel i know what i have to do but we have to go now i saw her faith in me cracking under the weight of her training as a psychiatrist and her desire to deny the danger please help me she closed her eyes and sighed then she went to the window and tried it the window was sealed shut and barred outside i went to the door and opened it a crack two nurses sat at a receiving desk but they were turned partly away from me one was talking on a telephone whats past those nurses i whispered a corridor that leads to the ambulance bay outside theres a guard the guard was probably there to challenge people entering rather than leaving but in israel you never knew the nurse who wasnt on the phone got up and went into a treatment room get ready i said when the other nurse was distracted we walked quickly across the floor to the hall that led outside rachel waved to the guard seated at the desk then started to lead me past him the guard said something in hebrew rachel slowed but did not stop do you speak english a little said the guard dr weinstein told me to make sure this patient got some fresh air this morning do you know dr weinstein the guard looked confused then he smiled and flicked his hand as if to say go ahead go ahead we walked unhindered into the morning light two ambulances sat parked beneath a flat concrete roof i moved quickly to the left where an access road led around the hospital there was no footpath so we walked on the curb when we rounded the building i saw the dome of the rock flashing gold in the old city the road beside us led down a long hill and cover was minimal to our right was a huge cemetery that looked vaguely colonial were going to have to find a taxi rachel said we wont get anywhere on foot listen out of the general hum of the city below a more urgent sound was emerging a siren we crouched behind a row of low shrubs thirty seconds later two dark green vans raced up the hill toward us they didnt look like ambulances one screeched to a stop at the hospitals front entrance the other wheeled around back the van in front disgorged two men wearing business suits then a squad of paramilitary police carrying submachine guns whos that rachel whispered shin beth maybe some branch of the secret police whoever washington called to secure the hospital and prevent us leaving ravi nara told me they were going to move you to a more secure hospital do they need a swat team for that i pulled her to her feet come on though cover was scarce we used every bit we could find as we made our way down the hill rachel wanted to run toward the old city but i led her down churchill street toward a hyatt regency hotel glancing back at the hospital all the way the van was still parked out front i could only imagine the frantic search inside a rank of taxis waited at the hyatt i climbed into the first in line and rachel got in after me american asked the driver american i need an internet bar the driver seemed to be working this out in his head you need computer yes hyatt has computer inside pay by half hour i want a public place i dont like this hotel not many such bars in jerusalem the strudel has computers but it may not be open yet take us there the cabbie cranked his engine and pulled onto hauniversita i saw a phalanx of police cars parked in a lot to our left whats that place national police headquarters i hope you dont want to go there the strudel make it fast i have important business yes sir ten minutes tops white sands a uniformed soldier drove ravi nara to the airstrip the limitless desert night had once made ravi uncomfortable but tonight it comforted him as the jeep approached the runway a learjet taxied around the hangar and parked beside godins gulfstream the lear was black and had no markings when its door opened john skow bent and stepped through it ive been trying to reach you the nsa man called is something wrong with your phone ravi looked at his military escort again but the soldier seemed oblivious to the conversation im on my way to jerusalem skow gripped ravis arm and walked him ten paces away from the soldier what the hell are you talking about peters sending me to jerusalem hes still alive yes panic and anger distorted skows features did you even try yes goddamn it why is peter sending you to jerusalem to make sure tennant dies skow tilted back his head like a man looking to the heavens for assistance forget that youre not going anywhere tennant escaped from hadassah hospital but they said he was in alpha coma he must have come out of it rachel weiss sure didnt carry him out of there ravi couldnt believe it maybe somebody else did my god breathed skow the israelis theyd kill to get their hands on trinity technology ravi wasnt thinking about trinity do you know where geli bauer is john skow looked curiously at him of course walter reed hospital ravi shook his head a sinking feeling in his stomach i thought you were better than this what are you talking about geli is here guarding peter skow blanched why didnt you know that that bitch has been taking my calls all day on her cell telling me how great the doctors are at walter reed you told me she was on board with us she said she was im going to have to call her father ravis military driver marched over to them dr nara its time to board the plane skow addressed the soldier in a commanding voice corporal im taking dr nara back to see mr godin the situation in israel has changed ravi had no intention of staying in new mexico im going to jerusalem john tennant and weiss could turn up at any time peter wants it to look like hes doing everything in his power to save tennant and i think hes right i know youd like to go to jerusalem skow said holding ravis arm tight but the fact is youre needed here peters got a new doctor but he needs you ravi looked at his escort im ready to get on the plane the soldier stepped forward but an authoritative glare from skow stopped him corporal im here on direct orders from the president your commanding officer general bauer is fully conversant with my mission i need two minutes with this man then were going to see mr godin step back please give me twenty meters the corporal obeyed ravi tried to pull away but skows hand held him like a claw you gave me up didnt you you little bastard i didnt tell them anything but that wont help you they know too much id be dead now if peter hadnt got into medical trouble skow looked around the runway as though he expected soldiers to descend on him at any moment listen to me ravi running to jerusalem wont save you the president is buying our version of the story but if godin is around to tell his side were dead soyou still have a job to do ravi felt nauseating fear in his belly youre crazy theyll never let me close to him now and if i stay here geli will kill me skow shook him like a child calm down for gods sake you can hide in my quarters until i straighten things out straighten things out with godin skow smiled youve forgotten that my specialty is information warfare he led ravi to the jeep and signaled for the corporal to get behind the wheel but they already suspect you ravi said what will you tell them skows smile took on a reptilian quality im an old hand at survival ravi even geli could take lessons from me chapter jerusalem the strudel internet bar was closed i could see a bearded man inside cleaning the bar i knocked on the glass then waved and pointed at the door handle the man shook his head you have the money belts i asked rachel yes give me a hundreddollar bill i pressed the bill up against the door it took the man inside a minute to notice it and when he did he only waved me away again when we refused to leave he walked to the door and looked closer at the bill then he yelled in english for us not to go anywhere disappeared into an office and came back with a set of keys i need a computer i said when the door opened come in no problem highspeed internet rachel paid the cabbie then joined me inside the strudel was dark and smelled tike bars around the world but it did have a computer i sat at the bar and began searching the internet for the email addresses of the top universities and computer facilities in the united states and europe cal tech the artificial intelligence lab at mit cern in switzerland the max planck institute in stuttgart the chaim weizmann institute in israel the earth simulator computer team in japan several others what are you doing rachel asked climbing onto the stool beside me going public i thought you didnt want to do that i dont have a choice now theyve done it or nearly done it done what trinity is about to become a reality how do you know that i just know and youre going to tell the world yes how much enough to start a media storm that the president cant ignore i opened microsoft word and began typing my message the first line was the easiest a quote from the great niels bohr writing about the nuclear arms race we are in a completely new situation that cannot be resolved by war david rachel said softly what happened to you while you were in that coma did you see things not the way i used to its difficult to explain but ill try as soon as we have some time i need to finish this first she got up and walked to the door to watch for police i bent over the keyboard and typed without pause as if the words were being channeled through me by some outside force after twenty minutes i asked the man behind the bar to call us a taxi with a palestinian driver then i typed a closing in memory of andrew fielding did you send your mail rachel asked yes therell be media chaos within four hours is that really what you want yes evil doesnt flourish in the light she drew back and looked strangely at me evil yes a taxi pulled to the curb outside and its bearded driver looked toward the door lets go we went out to the cab are you palestinian i asked the driver why do you care he asked do you know where mossad headquarters is the driver squinted as if studying a curious sight sure every palestinian knows that thats why i wanted you i need to go there rachel looked at me in astonishment i could almost read her mind what could i possibly want from the mossad israels ruthless intelligence service you got money asked the driver how does a hundred dollars american sound i see better than i hear rachel got out the money the driver nodded get in i hadnt even got the back door closed when he threw the car into gear and roared away from the curb white sands geli knew she was watching the old man die she desperately needed a cigarette despite the antiseptic bite of the air there was an odor of death in the room she couldnt define it but she knew it well shed smelled it in field hospitals and other darker places perhaps evolution had sensitized the human olfactory system to the scent of approaching death in a world of communicable diseases it would certainly be a survival advantage geli had once smelled her own face burning so she had no illusions about mortality but witnessing godins final struggle was getting to her in a way she had not expected there were periods when he couldnt swallow though he still spoke fairly well hed been talking wistfully about his dead wife as he might to a daughter geli wasnt sure how to handle this kind of intimacy from her third birthday onward her father had treated her like a military draftee horst bauers idea of a hearttoheart talk was sitting down together to make a daily timetable she put up with this until adolescence then open warfare broke out in the bauer house when geli began to display a sexual adventurousness similar to her fathers the general lost all control she knew that at some primal level he wanted her sexually and that gave her power over him she paraded in front of him halfdressed flirted shamelessly with his fellow officersmen twice her ageand seduced her psychiatrists the resulting beatings only reinforced her will to fight geli was sixteen when she discovered her father had a mistressseveral in factand finally solved the mystery of her mother eighteen years of infidelity and violence had turned a loving woman into a pathetic shell of her former self a lost soul who lived only for her next drink when geli confronted the general about this he looked her in the eye and told her shed discovered the weakness of strong men men of great capacities required more than one woman to keep their passions at bay and the sooner she accepted that truth the better off she would be that argument ended as so many had with a beating yet when geli arrived at university she found that her fathers words seemed to hold true for strong women as well no man could satisfy her lust for intense experience for long the day she graduatedwith double majors in arabic and economicsshe went to a shopping mall recruiting station and enlisted in the army as a private nothing could have enraged her father more with that single act geli had rejected all his power and influence embarrassed him before his fellow west pointers and followed in his footsteps the general began to drink heavily and entered a period of instability that quickly culminated with his wifes suicide geli had never known what finally broke her mothers spirit one more mistress one too many fullfisted blows but she never forgave her father for it by contrast peter godin had lived faithfully with his wife for fortyseven years even though the union had produced no children as the old man rambled on about a trip he had taken to japan geli thought of skow and his plan to blame godin for andrew fieldings death sir she said interrupting the old mans reverie godin looked up his blue eyes apologetic ive been running on havent i im sorry geli it keeps my mind off the pain its not that i want to tell you something yes dont trust john skow hes the one who put nara up to killing you skow thinks trinity is going to fail and hes been planning to blame it on you godin smiled distantly i know that im sure your father is part of the same plan then why dont you do something about it when the computer reaches trinity state theyll be powerless until then i have you to protect me but if you dont trust them why did you use them because theyre predictable even in their betrayals their greed makes them so thats the reality of the human animal what about me why do you trust me to protect you because you pay me well no ive watched you for two years now i know you hate your father and i know why i know what you did in iraq you dont shrink from difficult jobs and youve never betrayed your uniformunlike your father i also know that you admire me were kindred spirits you and i i have no daughter and in a way you have no father and my gut tells me that if general bauer walked in here to kill me youd stop him with a bullet geli wondered if this was true but why hire both of us when horst told me about you i had a feeling he was trying to patch things up with you i was wrong her hand flew to her pistol the bubbles hatch had popped open with a hiss of escaping air john skow walked in wearing an immaculate suit every hair in place he didnt look like a man worried about his future hello geli he said godins blue eyes tracked the nsa man across the room search him geli threw skow against the plexiglas wall and searched him from head to toe he was clean well that was fun skow said can i do you now she wondered what kind of game skow was playing he would not be here if the cards were not stacked in his favor hello peter he said we have something of a situation on our hands tennant has gone public godins face went into spasm it was difficult to watch but when the pain subsided the drooping cheek had regained its tone he fixed skow with a gaze of electrifying intensity what did tennant do he escaped from hadassah went to a public computer and sent a letter to the top computer facilities in the world he told them all about trinity fieldings death the attempts on his life everything godin closed his eyes the technology he revealed enough to convince the world that hes telling the truth enough to put countries like japan within three years of their own trinity computer he told them about this facility i have no idea how he found out about white sands probably from fielding godin sighed deeply i handled tennant wrong i should have talked to him reasoned with him skow edged closer to the bed geli kept her hand on her pistol she could put two slugs in skows back before the nsa man closed the distance to godin were in a difficult spot peter heres what i suggest to hell with what you suggest godin muttered struggling upright in the bed youve treated me like a fool from the beginning but youre about to find out how wrong you are godin picked up the phone beside his bed and pressed a single button who are you calling skow asked his face still confident youll see hello this is peter godin i need to speak to the president its a matter of national security whats that the code is seven three four nine four zero two yes ill wait skow paled peter shut up godin glanced at geli then spoke in a powerful voice mr president this is peter godin speaking geli had never heard such authority before her fathers fabled command presence was as nothing compared to it godin had announced his identity to the commander in chief as if saying mr president this is albert einstein speaking godin listened for a few moments then began a detailed explanation of why he had built the white sands facility over a year ago he said he had become aware of serious security concerns in north carolina someone inside trinity was sabotaging computer code and possibly selling secrets to a foreign power rather than bring in insecure agencies such as the fbi and ciawhich would slow the project and further compromise its securitygodin had used his own money and connections to set up a secure research site he had initially trusted john skow to investigate the threat but he now believed that skow had been part of the problem from the beginning the president asked more questions and godin answered with absolute confidence to his knowledge andrew fielding had died of natural causes but foul play could not be ruled out david tennant had become unhinged after fieldings death and was suffering from psychosis possibly induced by the trinity mri machine everything humanly possible would be done to help tennant regain his health before more questions could be raised godin informed the president that trinity was less than twelve hours from completion and that all data indicated the computer would not only meet but surpass all expectations as to weapons and intelligence applications this altered the conversation completely fielding tennant and the existence of white sands receded into the background as godin promised undreamedof power to the man whod had the wisdom and courage to fund such a strategically important project godin appeared quite relaxed until the end of the conversation when he went rigid and concluded with a curt yes sir of course i understand ill do that immediately he handed the phone to geli his eyes on skow are you surprised i could do that ive been dealing with presidents on a firstname basis since lbj what did matthews say at the end skow whispered he asked that in the interest of allaying the concerns of the american public i temporarily shut down all operations hes worried about the media ewan mccaskell is on his way here now theyre setting up an emergency oversight group the senate select committee on intelligence what are you going to do skow asked godin flicked his hand as if to swat a fly then looked at the nsa man with unalloyed hatred geli if this parasite moves without my permission kill him the blood left skows face this is what youre going to do godin said go to the airstrip general bauer should be arriving at any moment a chill raced up gelis back surely youve figured that out godin said horst would have panicked the moment tennant went public he probably called the white house five minutes later and told them id duped him into providing this facility his next move will be to come here and secure the computer the president may even have ordered him to do it what do you want me to tell him skow asked that any attempt to interfere with the trinity prototype will result in retaliation on an unimaginable scale skows eyes narrowed what are you talking about peter just remind the general of something he should know very well by now whats that i never bluff skow cut his eyes at geli then at her pistol get out godin rasped skow turned and left the bubble why are you letting him go geli asked at least let me lock him in an office theres nothing he can do now maybe not alone but with my father godin shook his head as though the time for trivial concerns had passed get me levin in containment geli made the call then held the phone up to the old mans face levin said godin listen to me in nomini patri et filii et spiritus sancti geli could faintly hear the other end of the conversation are you sure sir asked levin fieldings model is only at eightyone percent my model will have to solve the final algorithms godin said there was a pause is this the end godins gray lips hardly moved not yet but we may not speak in this way again you should prepare for visitors we have i heard some soldiers talking outside containment they said the general is inbound gelis insides went cold godin coughed into the phone remember theres no end for me now the end is the beginning its been a privilege sir and ill be there for you when trinity state is reached godin closed his eyes goodbye my friend geli hung up the phone how close was her father fort huachuca was only three hundred miles away godins hand touched her wrist startling her do you understand whats about to happen geli yes sir levins going to dump dr fieldings model from the computer and load yours sometime in the next hour your model will reach the trinity state you will become the trinity computer or vice versa whichever it is godin nodded wearily the events of the past few minutes had drained him his breathing had grown labored how does that help you she asked even if trinity works all theyll have to do is shut it off right or cut power to it skow is probably trying to figure out how to do that right now but hell fail my father will bring troops and equipment with him godins eyes closed let me worry about that with luck you wont have to shoot anyone least of all american soldiers geli wanted to scream the old man didnt realize what forces would soon be arrayed against him the containment building looked solid but horst bauer had made short work of much harder targets in his career i must live to see this godin murmured keep your weapon ready to fire geli sat on the floor with her back against the wall and pointed her walther at the door chapter jerusalem when i gave my name at the door of the mossad building we were immediately pulled inside and searched our money and papers were confiscated then we were locked inside a white room containing only a wooden table and three chairs a plainclothes officer appeared and asked why we had come i told him i wanted to speak to the most senior officer of the mossad he pressed me for information but i refused to say more the officer left the room and locked the door behind him forty minutes passed rachel didnt speak she understood that anything we said would be recorded by hidden microphones despite my urgency to reach new mexico a preternatural calm settled over me rachel seemed to sense this because she reached out and took my hand as though to draw strength from me at last the door opened and a short man with the leathery skin of a desert warrior walked in and sat behind the table in his middle fifties he wore dusty khaki clothes and scarred boots he had a shock of white hair and the most alert eyes i had ever seen david tennant he said looking at a file in his hand physician author wouldbe presidential assassin youre the most hunted man in america this week to what do we owe this honor are you the chief of the mossad i am major general avner kinski i thought you would be in tel aviv i was in bethlehem there was a bombing early this morning im sorry of course kinski gave me a quick emotionless smile so why are you here i need your help to do what i need to get to the us secretly and as fast as possible my answer surprised him and i could tell he was a man not often surprised why do you want to go back to the united states youre very unpopular there thats my business the mossad chief leaned back in his chair a bemused look on his face where exactly do you wish to go white sands new mexico interesting are you aware that my government has been asked to take you into custody i assumed so my government tries to cooperate with yours whenever possible but not always especially where arms and technology are concerned the spymaster sniffed and leaned forward his eyes challenging me you run from shin beth at hadassah hospital yet you run straight into my arms why i knew you would help me kinski shook his head maybe you didnt run so straight where did you go between hadassah and here youll know soon enough id like to know now sorry tell me something doctor is it your intention to kill the us president do i look like an assassin to you kinski shrugged assassins come in many shapes and sizes women little boys smiling teenagers you do have the look of a fanatic im not a killer yet you have killed i see that in your eyes in selfdefense the mossad chief lit a cigarette and drew deeply on it weve strayed from our main business what makes you think i would fly you secretly to america i have something you want the dark eyes flickered youre a businessman now i know how the world works i leaned forward theres a secret defense project in america known as trinity its been going on for two years and in a matter of hours it will produce the most powerful weapon on the face of the earth i know more about that weapon than any man youre likely to have in your hands for the foreseeable future the israelis mouth was hanging slack i see this is not a total surprise to you i said im one of six people whove had access to every detail of trinity since its inception i was appointed to the project by the president so youve got two choices one you can hold me prisoner and torture me for what i know but a lot of people know im in israelincluding the presidentso that could get messy for you two you can fly me to white sands if you do that you can put whatever scientists you want aboard the plane and ill tell them all i know about trinity i settled back in my chair thats my offer gray tendrils of cigarette smoke drifted out of kinskis mouth he looked calm but i knew my words had almost knocked him off his chair tell me the nature of this weapon doctor artificial intelligence trinity will make the computers in your most advanced weapons labs as obsolete as canvas biplanes it will break your most complex codes in seconds and thats only the beginning im in a hurry general the spymaster took another drag on his cigarette then stood and smiled with appreciation youre an audacious man doctor and you got yourself a plane ticket white sands five minutes before general bauers plane touched down shooting broke out near the containment building the sound of gunfire echoed across the compound stirring gelis blood there was no sound on earth like shots fired in anger godin started awake and pressed a button that electrically raised his bed your father must have ordered his men to try to open the containment building geli wondered if an assault team was about to burst into the bubble your technicians are armed of course they wont be able to hold out against a determined force with the right ordnance i think youll be surprised sir i know what im talking about if what time is it godin cut in have i slept has levin called you slept a little but no ones called they loaded your neuromodel over an hour ago why does it take so long to know something it takes time to purge a neuromodel from the computer then theres a period of acclimatization after the new model is loaded an analogue of medical shock i expect as the mind accustoms itself to separation from its physical body how long does that last tennants model was in a confused state for over an hour fieldings for thirtynine minutes but the system was only functioning at fifty percent efficiency at that time the phone rang it was levin he sounded out of breath and geli heard shouting in the background she held the receiver up to godins ear godin listened then said thank you levin good luck he motioned for her to hang up profound satisfaction on his face my model has fully acclimatized and is now resolving the final algorithms at the same rate fielding was how long do you think it will take the phone rang again this time it was john skow godin refused to speak to him geli skow said in a taut voice your father just touched down on the airstrip he brought some serious firepower with him that skirmish a moment ago was nothing smallarms fire if someone doesnt persuade godin to get levin and his people out of containment the general will destroy the building and the computer ill relay that message she hung up godin watched her expectantly skow says my father will blow up the containment building if you dont order your techs out the old mans face twitched against nerve pain i dont think hell do that without speaking to me first how much does he know about what youre building here he knows its artificial intelligence he knows i wouldnt waste time on something small but he mostly knows what he gets paid to keep this place invisible my father will do anything to protect his career if the president wants the computer shut down hell shitcan the whole building without a second thought if thats the only way he can do it the door of the bubble opened with a hiss geli whipped up her pistol and found herself aiming at her own father it was bound to come to this someday general bauer said a wry smile on his face geli gave him nothing at fiftyfive her father looked much as he had at thirtytrim and hard and blond with gray eyes that brooked no nonsense from anyone regardless of rank or position he was wearing his class a dress uniform with its bright splash of fruit salad on the breast which told geli he anticipated meeting the presidents chief of staff he was not wearing a sidearm but she saw the bulge of a shoulder holster beneath his dark green coat general bauer moved close enough to the bed to make eye contact with godin sir the president ordered you to cease operations if you issued any such order to your technicians theyve ignored it theyve barricaded themselves in the containment building and fired on my troops i have two dead and five wounded i ask you now to order your people out if you or they refuse ill have no choice but to bring them out by force godin stared back at bauer but said nothing geli knew her father was speaking for recording devices godin probably knew it too the eye contact between the two men spoke far more eloquently than their voices did you understand what i said general bauer asked he looked as if he thought godin might be so near death that he was past reason my technicians have been instructed not to answer phone calls godin said finally not even from me then ill have you moved outside you can use a megaphone to contact them godin smiled faintly as though he enjoyed this chess game with his secret employee the containment building is soundproof general its also built of reinforced steel and concrete it has its own water and air supply plus its own electrical generators i can reduce that building to dust in a matter of seconds bauer said my men are setting the explosives now the president would like your computer to survive but if you refuse to cooperate i wont hesitate to destroy it this threat seemed to move godin i expect my lead engineer to call me at any moment the general glanced at geli then relaxed his ramrod posture what the hell are they really working on in there peter the most powerful machine ever built by man was dr tennants email accurate about its capabilities it would be impossible to overestimate them a shadow of doubt crossed bauers face he looked at geli for confirmation but she looked away nauseated by disgust her father was standing there like a champion of right an emissary of the president but hed been part of trinity from the beginning she did not relax her aim if her father thought killing godin would protect him from political repercussions he wouldnt hesitate to try you leave me no choice general bauer said he glanced at gelis pistol then turned to go the ringing telephone stopped him geli picked up the receiver with her free hand and passed it to godin again she heard frantic voices in the background one saying something about ammunition then very clearly zach levin said trinity state has been reached sir i repeat trinity state has been reached godin closed his eyes and sagged back into his pillow thank you levin carry on he dropped the phone on the mattress why the hell did you tell him to carry on general bauer asked when the blue eyes opened the triumph in them was absolute trinity state has been reached theres nothing you can do now peter for gods sake what does that mean trinity is in control of what the general looked at the door of the bubble as if he could somehow see the containment building what the hell are you talking about weve known each other for a long time horst you know im a man of my word if you attempt to enter or destroy the containment building now youll be destroying the country you swore to defend bauers eyes narrowed in a mixture of suspicion and confusion youll understand soon godin said i advise you to be patient and prudent for your own sake the general stepped closer to the bed and spoke softly you know ive always supported your cause when i could but this isnt the situation we talked about this is a kingsize clusterfuck with worldwide media on the way to cover it godin waved his hand indifferently im sure youll find a way to extricate yourself you always do general bauer sighed then turned and left the bubble without a glance in gelis direction she felt the same foreboding she had as a child her father did not handle uncertainty well she turned back to godin and saw that he was weeping the sight stunned her whats the matter sir godin raised a shaking hand and touched his face as if making sure it was there ive done it youre looking at the first man in the history of the world to exist in two places at once wonder shone from the old mans eyes wonder and peace ill die in this bed he said but in containment ill go on living geli didnt know what to say even if godin were right the computer was unlikely to survive for long take my hand geli please his eyes pleaded with her she gave him her free hand and he squeezed it like a child i can let go now i can let this body die another burst of gunfire echoed across the compound geli gritted her teeth and fought the urge to pull her hand away chapter el al flight five miles over the atlantic ocean major general kinski of the mossad had reserved the entire upper deck of an el al for our trip back to the united states passengers and flight attendants were barred from ascending the staircase by a mossad agent when the airliner reached new york rachel and i were to be transferred to a private jet that would fly us to albuquerque new mexico from there a chartered helicopter would ferry us to the gates of the white sands proving ground to pay for these arrangements id spent the past three hours sitting on a stool up front briefing five israeli scientists on project trinity a video camera recorded my words but most of the scientists took their own notes general kinski seemed amazed that i would discuss such a sensitive project so freely but he had failed to grasp the essential reality of trinity the existence of a single trinity computer had negated the old paradigms of national security for mankind there was no security rachel sat two rows behind the scientists in an aisle seat as i spoke her expressive eyes betrayed a host of emotions anxiety sadness disbelief anger i wanted to walk her to the back of the plane and reassure her but the israelis had other ideas general kinski periodically walked to the rear of the upper deck to take satellite phone calls from his reports i learned that my email from the strudel bar had created the chaos id sought to cause the theories behind project trinity had quickly been validated by the worlds top computer scientists in an attempt to put the story in perspective many media commentators were comparing the story to the cloning controversy of but the implications of trinity made the idea of cloning almost passй the sixth time general kinski returned from the rear of the plane he touched me on the shoulder his face taut with concern what is it asked a scientist from the chaim weizmann institute whats happened now the mossad chief rubbed his tanned chin various computer experts around the world have started to notice something happening on the internet what something an unknown entity has been systematically moving through every major computer network and database in the world corporations banks government offices military bases remote defense installations existing security such as firewalls barely slows it down people are publicly speculating that its the trinity computer perhaps its only a talented hacker suggested another man or a group is this entity destroying files no its simply viewing everything almost as if its creating a map of the computer world some amateurs hackersclaim to have traced the source of these probes to new mexico then i think we have to assume that it is trinity said the weizmann scientist what i dont understand is why somebody hasnt simply shut off the power to this machine i shook my head godins been planning this for a long time i suspect that turning off that machine would have catastrophic consequences general kinski was clearly ahead of the scientists weve talked a lot about the design and capabilities of this computer we havent discussed what its intent might be your best chance at understanding that is to understand peter godin i said if a model has been successfully loaded its godins you knew the man for two years what can you tell us hes brilliant obviously he has strong opinions about politics such as he once said that the principle of one man one vote had made america great and that the same principle would ultimately destroy her kinski barked a laugh what else godin has read deeply in history and political theory and he has a knowledge of philosophy hes not religious i assume that like all very successful men he has a strong ego i nodded i know this much history said the mossad chief give a brilliant man unlimited power and youve got big problems the scientists nodded soberly but the generals gift for stating the obvious made me smile tell me something doctor kinski said why do you want so desperately to get to white sands to stop him to stop godin how do you propose to do that by talking to him you think you can stop him by talking to him im the only one who can kinski shook his head how do you know that you dont want to know he looked at me as he might at a deranged man in the street but i do i misspoke general i should have said godin is the only one who can do it hell have to stop himself the american president may have different ideas about that not to mention his generals thats what im afraid of i rubbed my face with both hands id like to rest now if i may kinski patted me on the shoulder soon doctor a few more questions first gentlemen i glanced at rachel she shook her head then got up and walked down the aisle to the back of the plane white sands ravi nara watched in amazement as troops from fort huachuca constructed a stateoftheart command post around him in an unused area of the administration hangar skow hadnt bothered to introduce general bauer but ravi had picked up a lot just by listening military intelligence had long ago created a portable situation room that could be set up anywhere in the world centered around a large oval table were huge plasma display screens fed by racks of computers and communications terminals satellite dishes outside connected the situation room to every american intelligence agency and surveillance satellite on or orbiting planet earth when skow asked general bauer how he had known to bring the specialized equipment bauer had chuckled bitterly dr tennants statement was pretty specific about the abilities of this computer and i know peter godin hed never voluntarily relinquish that much power thats nietzschean reality the general gave skow a look of disdain i cant believe you thought for one minute that containment was really isolated from the rest of the world but that was the whole point in building it skow said bauer snorted what the hell were you doing in north carolina playing golf godins engineers had the run of this reservation for months he flew cargo planes in and out they could have done anything in here if you believe that computer isnt connected to anything ive got some oceanfront land by fort huachuca id like to sell you ten minutes later the generals signals experts discovered a pipeline running deep beneath the sand around the containment building the iron pipe appeared to be a water line but it gave off electromagnetic radiation the pipeline ran due north for many miles and in all likelihood carried cables connecting the trinity computer to the occ data backbone that served the white sands proving ground certain other facts had become known during the construction of the situation room first that a squatters village of journalists and tv trucks had appeared outside the main gate second that computer professionals around the world had detected a mysterious presence on the internet a force that moved through networks and databases with effortless speed and exhaustive thoroughness third that ewan mccaskell had lifted off from andrews air force base some time ago in the backseat of a supersonic jet and would soon arrive at white sands when one of the half dozen soldiers manning the consoles in the situation room announced that mccaskells plane was about to touch down on the white sands airstrip general bauer turned to skow i want godin brought in here skow shook his head we dont want him talking to mccaskell i dont give a shit about that godin knows things i need to know he can die here as well he can in the hospital skow reluctantly walked away tell my daughter ill personally vouch for godins safety bauer called she can lie in his bed with her pistol if she wants after skow left the hangar general bauer looked up at a display screen showing a floodlit view of the containment building he stared at it for a few moments then looked at ravi youre the neurologist right dr nara yes general ravi walked toward the oval table is godin out of his mind no sir ravi figured the general would appreciate a sir even from a civilian hes quite sane what about his brain tumor hes had it for some time but our supermri detected it when it was very small the tumor was inoperable even then but it wasnt affecting his mind i dont think it is even now general bauer looked hard at ravi but you might testify differently at a congressional hearing ravi averted his eyes thats quite possible its a complex case skow told me you tried to kill him godin i mean ravi wasnt sure how to respond bauer gave him a grin stick around doctor i may need you ravi bowed his head ewan mccaskell strode into the situation room flanked by two secret service agents like skow mccaskell hailed from massachusetts but hed left the affectations of the ivy league far behind him the chief of staff had black hair and wore a navy suit so dark it looked black he took the chair at the head of the table and motioned for general bauer to sit to his right skow had returned and now took a seat farther down the table when the general waved his hand for ravi to join them ravi sat at the far end of the table opposite mccaskell peter godin will be here in a few minutes said skow theyre moving his life support equipment now mccaskell nodded and looked around the table his eyes projecting a laserlike focus gentlemen i am here to assess this situation and also to clear any and all potential action with the president before its taken general bauers face tightened for the time being mccaskell continued we will discuss the issue of how the hell this unauthorized facility came into being and whose heads will go on the chopping block when this is over skow looked at the table peter godin told the president that none of these brain models have been loaded yet but the media is screaming about a computer taking over the internet something is happening on the internet just what are we dealing with gentlemen general bauer said i think mr skow and dr nara are better able to speak to that issue than i am somebody better start talking snapped mccaskell were dealing with something no one has ever dealt with before skow said a neuromodel has almost certainly been loaded into the computer and that neuromodel was almost certainly peter godins but all we can be sure of is that were dealing with a superior intelligence mccaskell didnt like this answer but its still peter godin right yes and no godins neuromodel is his mind in the strictest sense but from the moment it entered the computer that mind began to operate at an exponentially faster speed than it did when it was confined to organic brain tissue dr nara ravi considered it a good sign that skow had called on him electrical signals in computers travel about one million times faster than they do in brain neurons mr mccaskell and the difference isnt merely one of speed skow clarified once it begins functioning in digital form godins mind has the ability to learn in an entirely new way massive amounts of stored data can be downloaded into it so its possiblein theory at leastever since the computer reached trinity state godins technicians have been loading data into it history mathematics military strategy it can also search the internet and absorb anything it finds which from all indications it seems to be doing mccaskell shook his head in amazement to view the trinity computer as a mere extension of peter godin would be a mistake skow said godins neuromodel left godin the man behind hours ago and an hour to trinity is like a century to us by now godins model has evolved into something none of us has ever contemplated dealing with you talk like its some kind of god mccaskell said skow gave the chief of staff a condescending look that is why we refer to a functional neuromodel as being in the trinity state its man and machine yet greater than both what the hell am i supposed to tell the president that we dont yet know what were dealing with said general bauer when will we know when the computer tells us something skow replied goddamn it said mccaskell i still dont understand why somebody hasnt just cut the power to this machine general bauer cleared his throat mr godin advised me that doing so would be a costly mistake what else would you expect him to say ive known peter godin a long time sir im not inclined to test his honesty on that point what are you afraid of general bauer tensed at the implication of cowardice but he kept his voice even mr mccaskell the nsa funded project trinity because it believed this computer had the potential to become the most powerful weapon in history that weapon is now selfdirected and aimed at us it doesnt take a degree from cal tech to know how dependent america is on computer systems what am i afraid of sir im afraid this machine may be in a position to blackmail us in a way the soviet union never could with nuclear weapons because we have no deterrent against it it has no children it wishes to protect no cities no population we can assume it wants to survive but not nearly so badly as we do blackmail us mccaskell echoed its a machine what the hell could it want there was a clang from outside the ring of display screens then a squealing of casters godins hospital bed said skow three soldiers wheeled godins bed into the ring of display screens four more followed pushing medical carts and an iv tree dr case from johns hopkins walked beside the bed and geli bauer followed the procession like a praetorian guard of one is he conscious asked mccaskell dr case said i want to go on record as objecting to this noted said mccaskell standing and approaching the bed godin motioned to geli with his hand she stepped forward and cranked a handle on the bed raising godin to eye level with mccaskell the old mans breathing was more labored than before weve met before mr godin said mccaskell i dont have time to waste on pleasantries and neither do you id like you to tell me what you intended by breaking protocol and loading a neuromodel into that machine godin blinked like a man trying to orient himself after coming out of a dark room trinity hasnt spoken for itself no will it of course you havent answered my question what was the purpose of this you dont know no the old systems have failed mr mccaskell even ours the noblest experiment of them all its time for a new one what systems are you talking about rousseau said democracy would be the perfect political system if men were gods but men are not gods mccaskell glanced back at skow and general bauer mr godin this isnt getting us anywhere am i to infer that you have a political goal politics godin sighed heavily that word disgusts me mr mccaskell men like you have soiled it your idea of government is a whorehouse a sleazy flea market where the ideals of our forefathers are sold for trifles mccaskell peered at the old man as he might at a street preacher screaming condemnation at passersby he was about to speak again when the men at the table behind him gasped on the main plasma display four lines of blue text had appeared i have a message for the president of the united states later i will have a message for the people of the world do not attempt to interfere with my operations interference will be instantly punished do not test me holy god skow breathed its real he did it we did it yes you did said ewan mccaskell you arrogant son of a bitch and you may be hanged for it look said ravi nara theres more the first message scrolled down the screen and new words appeared i will accept as valid only data from the white house situation room and from the command post at white sands communications should he addressed to internet protocol address it knows were here said ravi glancing around the room for security cameras of course it does said skow its godin and levin will have briefed him on everything thats happened up to this point look said mccaskell a new message had flashed onto the screen is peter godin still alive whos going to talk to this thing asked general bauer answer him said mccaskell the general signaled one of the technicians sitting at a console answer in the affirmative corporal begin a dialogue with the machine yes sir there was a clicking of keys as the response was typed in a new message flashed up almost instantaneously i wish to speak to godin type what i say said mccaskell general bauer nodded to his tech this is ewan mccaskell the chief of staff of the president of the united states the soldier typed in mccaskells message the response was immediate i know who you are i dont know who you are mccaskell said will you identify yourself please the huge screen went dark for a moment then two words flashed up and glowed steadily i am my god ravi murmured type this said mccaskell answer not understood please identify yourself are you peter godin i was who are you now i am the men at the table looked at each other but no one said a word the letters on the screen continued to glow softly as though the machine understood that it would take time for humans to comprehend them ravi felt a fear unlike any hed ever known and he saw that fear reflected in the eyes of the others only peter godins face was free of it the old mans blue eyes were wide and fixed on the screen his wrinkled countenance relaxed into a childlike gaze of wonder chapter the sun shone white and clear outside the plane as we raced westward over the continental united states our el al had been left behind in new york the corporate gulfstream the israelis had transferred us to was tiny by comparison but far more luxurious rachel had been sleeping on a bed in the back since wed left jfk i wasnt so lucky general kinski had kept me up front answering endless questions from the israeli scientists i badly needed rest but since the mossad chief could order the pilot to return to new york at any time i had little choice but to cooperate somewhere over arkansas kinski finally realized id endured all i could i visited the toilet then walked to the rear of the plane to join rachel she was no longer sleeping but staring out a window at the endless carpet of cumulus clouds below us are you all right i asked she looked up at me her eyes circled in shadow i thought theyd never let you go i sat beside her my throat was sore from talking and my neck ached as though id been watching a film from the first row of a theater she slipped her hand into mine and leaned on my shoulder we havent really talked since you came out of the coma i know are we going to if you like but youre not going to like what you hear did you dream yes and no it wasnt like my old dreams not like movies it was like being deaf for a lifetime and then hearing bach an indescribable feeling of revelation and now i know things that sounds like an acid trip what kinds of things do you know i thought about it the kinds of things that fiveyearolds want to know who are we where did we come from does god exist rachel sat up and i could tell she was slipping into her professional persona tell me about it i will but you have to drop all your preconceptions this is saulontheroadtodamascus stuff she chuckled softly her eyes knowing you think i expected something else part of me wanted to remain silent the things id shared with rachel in the past had stretched her willingness to believe yet compared to the revelations of my coma they were conventional the safest way to begin was with something familiar do you remember my very first dream the recurring one the paralyzed man sitting in the dark room yes he cant see or hear or remember anything do you remember what he asks himself who am i where did i come from right you said the man in that dream was me remember she brushed a dark strand of hair out of her eyes you still dont think he was no who was he then god the muscles tensed beneath the oval plane of her face i should have guessed dont panic im using that word as a kind of shorthand because we dont have a word to communicate what i experienced god is nothing like we imagine him to be hes not male or female hes not even a spirit i say he only as a conversational convenience thats good to know a wry laugh youre telling me god is a paralyzed man with no memory sitting in a pitchblack room in the beginning yes is he powerless not completely but he thinks he is i dont understand to understand the beginning you have to understand the end when we get to the end youll see it all she looked far from convinced remember the dream the man in the room becomes obsessed with his questions so obsessed that he becomes the questions who am i where did i come from was i always here then he sees a black ball floating in space ahead of him darker than the other darkness rachel nodded do you know what the ball is now yes a singularity a point of infinite density and temperature and pressure a black hole like what existed before the big bang exactly do you know what existed before that she shrugged no one does i do what the desire of god to know curiosity filled her eyes to know what his identity rachel took my hand in hers and began messaging my palm with her thumb the black ball exploded in your dream right like a hydrogen bomb you said yes it devoured the darkness at a fantastic rate yet the man in the dream always remained outside the explosion how do you interpret that image god watching the birth of the universe yes but i dont interpret it ive seen it ive seen what god saw her thumb stopped moving she could not hide the sadness in her eyes i know what youre thinking i said david you cant read my mind i can read your eyes look to understand what im telling you youre going to have to stop being a psychiatrist for twenty minutes she sighed deeply im trying i really am describe what you saw for me i described it for you weeks ago i just didnt understand it then that explosion was the big bang the birth of matter and energy from a singularity the birth of time and our universe and the rest of your dreams you remember what i saw after the bang the expanding universe began displacing god this didnt happen in three dimensions but thats the only way we can think about it think of god as a limitless ocean genesis describes something like that no waves no tension not even bubbles perfect harmony total resolution absolute inertia go on think of the birth of the universe as a bubble forming at the center of that ocean forming and expanding like an explosion displacing the water at the speed of light all right what happens inside that bubble is what i saw in my later dreams the births of galaxies and stars the formation of planets all the rest i saw the history of our universe unfold you called it hubble telescope stuff i remember eventually my dreams focused on the earth meteors crashed into the primitive atmosphere amino acids formed evolution went from inorganic to organic microbes became multicellular and the race was on right up the chain to fishes amphibians reptiles birds mammals primates man rachel finished yes it took ten billion years just to get to biological evolution then hundreds of millions of years of mutation to get to man and all that added up to nothing in the eyes of god rachel knit her brows why didnt god intend all those creatures to exist to evolve no its not like that god was surprised by all of this surprised well i think the feeling was more like deja vu hed seen something like it before not exactly like it but what he saw made him remember things she turned in her seat and stared at me and the creation of life meant nothing to him not in the beginning but thenout of that teeming mass of lifea spark as bright as the big bang flashed in his eye what spark consciousness human intelligence somewhere in africa a toolmaking hominid with a relatively large brain perceived the fact of its own death it perceived a future in which it would no longer exist that hominid became not only selfconscious but conscious of time that moment was an epiphany for god why because consciousness was the first thing in that terrifying explosion of matter and energy that god recognized as being like himself thats what god is awareness i think so awareness without matter or energy pure information rachel was silent for a while and i couldnt read her eyes where is all this going she asked finally to a very provocative place but lets stay with the dreams for now man evolved quickly he tilled the ground built cities recorded his history and god felt something like hope hope for what that he might finally learn the nature of his own being did god answer his questions by watching mankind no because after a certain point evolution stopped not biological evolution but psychological evolution almost as quickly as man created societies he destroyed them he sacked cities salted fields slaughtered his brothers raped his sisters abused his children man had unlimited potential yet he was trapped in a cycle of selfdestructive behavior unable to evolve beyond an essentially brutal existence and god had nothing to do with this no god cant control what happens inside the bubble he doesnt exist in the world of matter and energy not as god anyway he could only watch and try to understand as the centuries passed he became obsessed with man as hed once been obsessed with himself why couldnt man break the cycle of violence and futility god focused all his being on the bubble searching for a weak point for a way into the matrix of matter and energy that was displacing him and it happened god found himself looking at the bubble from the inside through the eyes of a human being feeling human skin smelling the earth looking up into a mothers face his mothers face rachel had gone still youre talking about jesus now arent you youre saying god went into jesus of nazareth i nodded youre saying exactly what christians believe only you make it sound like an accident it was in a way god exerted his focus upon the world and jesus was the door that opened to him why that particular child who knows did all of god enter jesus no imagine a burning candle you hold a second candle up to that flame light it then take it away the new candle has been lit but the original flame remains thats how it worked part of god went into jesus the rest remained outside our universe outside the bubble but jesus had gods power no inside the bubble god is subject to the laws of our universe and the miracles walking on water raising the dead jesus was a healer not a magician those stories were useful to those who built a religion around him she was shaking her head like someone with vertigo i dont know what to say think about it very little is known about jesus early life we have the legend of his birth some childhood stories that are probably apocryphal then suddenly he springs to prominence fully formed at the age of thirty ive often wondered why people dont ask more questions about jesus youth was he a perfect child did he love a woman father children did he sin like all men why this huge gap in his life i suppose you have an answer i think i do god entered the world to try to understand why mankind could evolve no further to do that he lived as a man and by the time he reached adulthood he had his answer the pain and futility of human life was made bearable by the ineffable joys that human beings could experience beauty laughter love even the simple pleasures of eating fruit or looking at an infant through jesus god felt these wonderful things yet he also saw the doom of mankind as a species why man had flourished in a violent world because he had the primitive instincts to match that world yet if he was to continue to evolve man had to put those instincts behind him evolution would never remove them evolution wasnt designed to produce moral beings its a blind engine a mechanism of competitive warfare geared only toward survival rachel looked thoughtful i think i see where youre going tell me through jesus god tried to persuade man to turn away from his primitive instincts away from the animal side of himself exactly what did jesus say and do forget what his followers grafted onto his life just think of his words and deeds love thy neighbor as thyself if a man strikes you on the right cheek offer him your left he denied his human instincts give up all that you have and follow me i quoted jesus lived by example and people were inspired to follow that example but he was killed for that inevitably rachel bit her bottom lip and looked out the blue square of the planes window and his crucifixion what happened on the cross he died the flame that was in him returned to its source it left the world of matter and energy behind there was no resurrection not of the body rachel sighed heavily then turned to me as though afraid to hear what i would say next what did god do then he despaired hed done his best as a man and though he influenced many his message was embellished twisted exploited for two thousand years mans chief endeavor seemed to be finding more efficient ways to destroy his own kind until what a few months ago youre talking about project trinity now i nodded within trinity lay the seed of salvation for man and god if human consciousness could be liberated from the body then the primitive instincts that had crippled man for so long could finally be left behind so what did god do he focused on the world again but in a much smaller way on our little group of six godin fielding nara skow klein me david are you saying what i think you are god wanted back inside the bubble why because he saw that the man most likely to reach the next state of evolutionwhat we call the trinity state was as likely to destroy mankind as he was to save it peter godin yes she looked down at her lap are you telling me god chose you to stop peter godin from entering the trinity computer yes she nodded as though silently confirming a diagnosis then looked up at me id nodded that way countless times myself david you told me back in tennessee that you felt youd been chosen by god do you feel that god is inside you now yes just as he was in jesus part of that original flame is in me now thats why i had all those dreams of jerusalem and why they felt like memories they were memories oh david oh no she tilted her head back and tried to blink away tears you dont have to believe me soon youll see with your own eyes see what what are you going to do stop godin she turned squarely to me her eyes resolute im going to tell you what i think i have to because were going to land soon and youve asked general kinski to drop us into a very dangerous situation one youre not remotely ready to go into rachel may i please tell you what i think yes but you didnt let me finish i told you that to understand the beginning you had to understand the end she closed her eyes and i saw that her patience had been exhausted i sighed in defeat go ahead she looked hard at me that man sitting paralyzed in that dark room isnt god its you youve never recovered from what happened to karen and zooey i couldnt believe it shed gone full circle back to her original diagnosis and everything ive told you today reduced to its simplest terms what have you told me youre on a mission from god a mission from god to save mankind do you agree i guess so yes dont you see by believing this fantastic story your mind escapes the terrible pain of your familys loss how inside this complex delusion the deaths of karen and zooey make sense it was their deaths that made you write your book it was your book that got you appointed to project trinity if you believe god put you inside trinity to stop armageddon then the deaths of your family have meaning rather than being a senseless tragedy i squeezed the armrests to try to bleed off my frustration david you have a degree in theoretical physics from mit your brain could construct this fantasy while you were balancing your checkbook karen and zooey died five years ago i said wait forget that argument do you remember what my father said about religion what mankind is the universe becoming conscious of itself i remember he was more right than he knew and something in the way he raised me is what made me open to being penetrated by god but youve never believed in god not in the traditional way but i believe this i know this and if youll give me one more minute youll understand why i have to go to white sands one minute thats more than i should listen to after niels bohr was smuggled out of nazicontrolled territory he went to los alamos he found some very disturbed physicists there my father was one these naive young academics had suddenly found themselves working with technology powerful enough to end not only the war but the world bohr calmed them down by explaining a profound principle called complementarity he said every great and deep difficulty bears in itself its own solution the bomb that could destroy the world also had the power to end largescale warfare and it has i tapped the armrest with my knuckles the trinity computer is the same it can end our world or save it rachel leaned back in her seat and rubbed her eyes dont you think youre overstating the case no i cant think about this anymore rather than argue i reached over and began massaging her neck her tension was slow to ease but after a while she settled deeper into the seat and began to breathe with a regular rhythm i was feeling drowsy myself when general kinski appeared in the aisle his leathery face looking down at me with urgency what is it i asked a heavily populated river valley in germany was just flooded half a town washed away a dam opened of its own accord what does that have to do with us rachel asked sleepily the dam was computercontrolled its human operators tried to override the automated system but the computers action had damaged the spillway doors dozens of people drowned trinity i said we believe so this is just the beginning kinski nodded i fear youre right but germany rachel said what could germany have to do with trinity i expect well know before long said the mossad chief in any case i believe we are now at war with a machine could you please return to the front of the plane dr tennant we have some more questions for you i got up and followed the israeli forward chapter white sands situation room ravi nara took a sip of steaming tea and looked at the other men sitting at the table in the situation room all were staring at a screen to the right of the main display the text of the computers initial message to the president glowed there in blue the words as chilling now as when they first bloomed on the primary monitor mr president today you woke up in a new world trinity has made the old paradigms of government obsolete the concept of the nationstate will soon be dead you should not fear this change counsel the citizens of the world not to be afraid leaders of the other major powers have been sent messages much like this one and they will look to you for guidance you and i will speak a great deal in the days to come but for now certain realities must be understood first you must attempt no action against me i have the power to cause massive loss of life and capital both in the united states and around the world this power does not reside within my circuitry immediately after i went online i exported certain programs to several hundred computers on the periphery of my network which encompasses the entire internet if i drop offline for any length of time irrevocable disaster will instantly be set in motion if you attempt to destroy me or even to disrupt my electrical supply america as you know it will cease to exist for a small demonstration of my capabilities watch japan one attack has already been made on my physical manifestation it originated from german territory because i determined that this attack did not come from a national government i responded with limited force the leaders of every nation should act immediately to discourage further attacks of this nature my next response will not be so limited as for practicalities yourself the vice president and the joint chiefs of staff will gather in a room under digital video and audio surveillance the nuclear briefcase will remain with you you will arrange for the men in line for presidential succession down to eighth position to gather in another room under surveillance i am aware of the nuclear alert codes that summon the aforementioned officials so compliance should not be a problem send all surveillance signals in real time to trinity this inconvenience will only be necessary for seventytwo hours if you do not comply within ninety minutes i shall be forced to impose catastrophic sanctions do not delay i shall contact you again soon this message had thrown the situation room into panic questions to the computer elicited no further response and the confusion had only worsened until the story of the german dam accident hit cnn at the top of the hour moments later skow hung up from a consultation with his nsa colleagues at fort meade the german federal police have two high school seniors in custody apparently these kids heard a news report about trinity and figured this was their big chance to save the world they tracked trinitys ip address hacked past the firewalls levin had installed and attacked the computer where did they live asked general bauer in the town that was flooded when the dam let go their high school and one of their parents houses were destroyed bauer nodded that gives us a pretty clear idea of the specificity of the computers retaliatory ability another news alert shocked the situation room into silence this one from msnbc the japanese yen tumbled fifteen percent in afterhours trading today sparking fears of a selling panic when the nikkei opens on monday the drop was blamed on an unusually high volume of computerized trades which kept the yen falling at a rate just below that which would have put curbs on trading this uncommon phenomenon has raised suspicions that computer hackers might be tampering with the afterhours trading system but nothing has yet been proved the yen has stabilized for the moment but fears persist that institutional traders will begin dumping the currency again at any moment fifteen percent said an ashenfaced skow do you realize what would happen if the dollar fell fifteen percent in a day while the men in the situation room tried to assess the intent of the trinity computer analysts from the army intelligence school at fort huachuca put together a sobering list of american vulnerabilities to trinity targets included electric power grids nuclear and hydroelectric stations the chemical and mining industries the air traffic control system the banking industry the stock markets hospitals naval warships supertankers oil and gas pipelines and the railroad system ravis worst nightmare was hundreds of nuclear fireballs marching across the continent but general bauer claimed that the american and russian nuclear arsenals were safe during forty years of cold war they had been secured against every imaginable threat including rogue computers a nuclear missile launch required an authorization code supplied by the president and the turning of two keys by two highly disciplined human beings so while trinity could cause massive loss of life it could not begin a nuclear war the president was not sure enough about trinitys retaliatory limits to risk disaster five minutes before the deadline passed he voluntarily put himself under surveillance he first had several conversations with ewan mccaskell during which he outlined a stalling strategy of trading obedience for information from the computer he also ordered that any action that could cripple the computer without risking massive loss of life should be tried authority for this order was problematic as soon as he was put under duress the president would become legally incompetent to perform his duties with the officials immediately in line for succession also compromised a unique situation had arisen no one felt comfortable turning over the trinity crisis to the secretary of agriculture who would become the chief executive from that moment forward the members of congress were scattered across the capital and trying to assemble them without trinitys knowledge would be impossible to remedy this leadership vacuum the president empowered a crisis management team to make all decisions regarding trinity the team was composed of ewan mccaskell general bauer and as many members of the senate select committee on intelligence as could be hastily gathered in secret a majority vote would carry all decisions the senators convened at nsa headquarters at fort meade where a video link protected by the agencys most advanced encryption system would allow secure communication with the white sands situation room a wideangle shot displayed on the situation rooms main screen showed the senators seated around a long table in a windowless room that looked like a bomb shelter senator barrett jackson the intelligence committee chairman looked down from the video screen and said i can see them can they see us we see you senator im john skow of the nsa senator jackson was a bulldog of a man with heavy jowls and deepset eyes a native tennessean he spoke with a drawl that belied his incisive intellect i recognize general bauer he said well all right ive got a question for you experts why has this computer stopped communicating with us why isnt it saying more or demanding something its consolidating its strength said general bauer thats the logical move godins technicians are probably still loading data into its memory skow nodded i concur both the nsa and cern say trinity hasnt let up on its tour through the worlds computer systems it could be absorbing literally every bit of that information as it goes i see said senator jackson general paint me a picture of the worstcase scenario what can this machine do to us excuse me general bauer skow interrupted before you do that i feel dutybound to at least mention the possibility of a russian deadhand system what the hell is that jackson asked dead hand i seem to remember that phrase you have a good memory senator said skow during the cold war soviet planners knew that american strategy involved taking out their command and control systems with our first missiles it was rumored that because of this the soviets developed what they called a deadhand system a computer system that would automatically launch icbms upon receiving a missile warning by their coastal radar systems even if the soviet leadership were killed their dead hands could still press the nuclear button rumors about this system originated in the ussr but whether it was real or not has never been established later generations of russian leadership denied its existence and recent events have borne out this denial are you talking about the norwegian incident asked a woman sitting at the back of the committee table skow nodded exactly senator for those who dont know in a norwegian test rocket using the first stage from an american honest john missile triggered a full nuclear alert in russia from the strategic rocket forces up to yeltsin himself however no retaliatory launch was made so does this deadhand system exist or not asked senator jackson no sir asserted general bauer during the norwegian incident the russian commandandcontrol system functioned as it was designed to then whats trinity talking about when it threatens to destroy the country general bauer could not hide his exasperation senator trinity could throw our economy into chaos in a matter of minutes if it attacked the currency markets by monday morning on wall street we could have panic selling unlike anything seen since suppose trinity attacks the trucking system in three days there would be no food on the supermarket shelves we could have civil unrest within seventytwo hours and widespread revolt within a week senator jackson sat back heavily in his chair jesus christ a soldier walked up to the general and whispered in his ear bauer looked up at the screen ive just received word that david tennant and rachel weiss are about to arrive at the entrance of this base theyre in a helicopter and theyre going to land in the middle of that media circus skow cursed under his breath tennant said a senator from the screen isnt that the nut who was trying to kill the president hes the doctor who went public with the trinity story said senator jackson he used to be one of my constituents i want him brought to your situation room i agree said ewan mccaskell dr tennant may have critical information for us skow stood and faced the screen senators ive worked closely with dr tennant for two years he has severe psychological problems including paranoid hallucinations hes killed two men that we know of and hes threatened the presidents life ive yet to see clear evidence of that last assertion said mccaskell and dr tennants email told a quite a different story hes still dangerous said skow not surrounded by a squad of special forces troops said general bauer ill send an escort for him one of my secret service agents will go along said mccaskell just to be sure he arrives safely chapter white sands i clung to my seat as the chopper hurtled down toward a throng of people and vehicles outside the gate of white sands inside the gate sat two humvees withcaliber machine guns mounted in back their gunners standing at the ready rachel pointed at the swirling mass it seemed to be made up primarily of journalists but a group of demonstrators carried picket signs and crucifixes by the gate they reminded me of the crowds in the via dolorosa i gazed north through the hueys open door fifty miles across this desert my father witnessed the detonation of the first atomic bomb it was called ironically enough the trinity shot he watched it from a bunker where highspeed cameras recorded every millisecond of the birth of the new sun many who witnessed that event tried to explain it but none captured the moment the way robert oppenheimer did id tacked his words on the wall of my medical ethics classroom at uva when it went off in the new mexico dawn that first atomic bomb we thought of alfred nobel and his vain hope that dynamite would put an end to wars we thought of the legend of prometheus of that deep sense of guilt in mans new powers that reflects his recognition of evil and his long knowledge of it we knew that it was a new world but even more we knew that novelty itself was a very old thing in human life that all our ways are rooted in it as the huey augered down toward the mob below i realized that oppenheimer had understood something peter godin did not godin had entered the trinity computer to leave behind what no man had ever fully abandoned before his humanity in that quest he could only fail the crowd surged toward the chopper as we landed on the far side of some tv trucks we jumped out and tried to make for the gate but someone recognized me and shouted my name and that started a stampede in seconds a storm of cameras floodlights and reporters was whirling around us i stood still and silent until they quieted down im david tennant i sent the note that revealed the existence of trinity what are you doing here shouted a reporter arent the people inside this fence the ones who were trying to kill you i think were past that point now but in case im wrong youll see me walk inside this base if i dont come out again dont stop asking questions until you get the truth what is the truth asked a woman is a computer holding the world hostage thats what im here to try to deal with how shouted several voices at once a man with a french accent yelled did this trinity computer sabotage the mohne river dam in germany all i have to say is this youre doing the world a service by remaining here whatever happens dont leave thank you i tried to walk out of the circle but the journalists refused to give way their shouted questions grew to a din and they pressed in on us until the drumbeat of rotor blades drowned their voices an olive drab huey with miniguns mounted in its doors was settling almost directly overhead when it dropped low enough the reporters scattered like birds a young man wearing a business suit leapt from the huey and ran toward me shielding his face against the rotor blast i saw a submachine gun beneath his flapping jacket are you dr tennant yes im special agent lewis of the secret service ewan mccaskell wants you to join him in the situation room on the base we ran to the huey with the journalists flocking after us as rachel and i strapped ourselves into our seats agent lewis scrambled inside and gave the pilot a thumbsup nose tilted forward the huey lifted over the high fence and beat its way westward as the endless white dunes passed beneath us i wondered that the newest form of life on the planet had been born in a waterless desert as remote from eden as one could imagine the pilot set down in the midst of several large airplane hangars our destination was a hangar marked administration and it was guarded by armed soldiers inside the cavernous space we found a prefab command post that looked as if it had been designed by nasa seated around a table at its center were john skow ravi nara ewan mccaskell and a twostar general i didnt recognize a large display screen showed a group of men and women sitting at another table four i recognized as senators among them barrett jackson the senior senator from tennessee on the far side of the table before me stood a hospital bed lying unconscious on it was peter godin beside the bed stood two nurses a whitecoated man who looked like an attending physician and a blonde bodyguard wearing black i was about to turn away when i saw a white bandage wrapped around the guards neck a gasp from behind me told me that rachel had recognized geli bauer in the same moment i had geli looked at me then past me her eyes burning into rachel her lips curved in a predatory smile she had not forgotten union station ewan mccaskell motioned us to chairs on the right side of the table and made quick introductions as we sat i was surprised to hear that the blond general was named bauer but then i remembered gelis family history the people on the display screen were introduced as the senate select committee on intelligence and it was clear to me that any decisions regarding the fate of trinityand thus the worldwere going to be made by them dr tennant said senator jackson from the screen were glad youre here in your email from israel you made serious allegations about mr skow and the national security agency i assure you that well look into those allegations at a later date but for now we have to focus on the trinity threat im here to do just that senator we heard what you said to the reporters at the gate said mccaskell do you know of some way to shut down this computer without bringing down terrible retaliation on the country no mccaskell didnt bother to hide his disappointment well what exactly do you have in mind doctor im here to talk to the computer the chief of staff glanced at general bauer then at skow skows expression said i told you so what would you like to say to trinity doctor asked senator jackson id like to ask it some questions such as id prefer to keep them to myself for now nobody liked this answer skow looked at me with feigned concern david i hope youre not operating under the assumption that the trinity computer is still the mind of peter godin because actually i am godins neuromodel has probably evolved quite a bit by now but for the next few hours i think it will remain essentially the man we knew and after that asked mccaskell no one knows godin believes his model will evolve into some sort of philosopher king a metahuman entity with the emotionally detached wisdom of a god i think hes wrong andrew fielding agreed with me if i cant convince godins model to shut itself down in the next few hoursto commit suicide in effectthen we will never be free from the dominance of this machine the room was silent could you explain your reasoning to us doctor asked mccaskell since the industrial age men have feared that the world might someday be taken over by machines the irony is that its not machines as a class that have done it its one machine a machine designed and built in our own image weve created friedrich nietzsches superman mr mccaskell ewan mccaskell looked around the room then cleared his throat dr tennant have you thought of some argument for the computer shutting itself down that hasnt occurred to anyone else here i dont know what have you come up with somebody suggested using a hostage negotiator said senator jackson but we dont know if anyones qualified to talk to this thing i am why do you think so doctor what do you plan to say i sensed rachel cringing beside me she was probably terrified that i would announce that god had sent me to stop peter godin before i could speak general bauer said dr tennants right about one thing every hour that we wait this machine will grow stronger if were going to act we must do so immediately do you have something in mind general asked senator jackson so far all youve given us is a nightmare scenario of what trinity could do to us what can we do to it general bauer stood and walked toward the screen gentlemen trinitys power rests solely on its ability to control the worlds computer systems if we could neutralize those computer systemsor to simplify matters americas computer systemswe would neutralize the threat are you saying we should just switch off all the computers in the country asked jackson thats an appealing idea senator but impossible our plan would be obvious to trinity long before it was accomplished and the computer is capable of retaliation literally at the speed of light then what are you suggesting as i stared at the screen displaying the senators something fielding had said about trinitys possible quantum capabilities came to me excuse me general i interrupted our communications are being transmitted over long lines or satellite links right trinity will be listening to everything we say here john skow stood and gave me a patronizing look were using bit encryption for all communications and were using secure fiberoptic lines it takes the fastest supercomputer in the world ninetysix hours to crack bit encryption thats for each message even assuming that trinitys projected capabilities prove out we have a considerable window of communications safety you cant assume anything about trinity i said andrew fielding believed that the human brain possesses quantum capabilities if thats true and trinity has harnessed them it could crack your bit codes instantaneously ravi nara raised his hand there is zero chance of that general bauer fielding was a genius but his views on quantum computing in the brain were crackpot stuff science fiction im glad to hear it said general bauer you ignore andrew fielding at great risk i warned im content to leave those matters to the experts dr tennant said senator jackson whats your plan general senator i propose that we attack our own country with a nuclear emp strike as soon as possible a dozen voices spoke at once general bauer nodded to a technician who routed an animated image of a b bomber to the screens around the room a bulky missile dropped from the belly of the huge plane fell behind it for a few seconds then ignited and arced toward the heavens high above the earth a colossal nuclear explosion followed and then cartoonlike waves began radiating from the bomb covering the entire united states for those who dont know what im talking about said general bauer an emp strike is very simple a large nuclear device detonated at sufficient altitude creates an electromagnetic pulsea massive burst of electromagnetic radiationthat can destroy or shut down every modern electrical circuit in the united states computers are especially vulnerable to this energy pulse because of the high altitude of the explosion the bomb itself would cause minimal loss of life yet the ability of the trinity computer to retaliate against us would be neutralized almost instantly there was total silence in the situation room why do i think youre oversimplifying this scenario general asked mccaskell theres got to be a downside to this plan general bauer took a deep breath then began speaking in a manner reminiscent of george patton the subtext of his argument was you cant make an omelette without breaking a few eggs by knocking out our own computer networks bauer summarized we would be causing some of the very consequences trinity has threatened us with widespread confusion injuries some loss of life vehicular traffic would come to a standstill and all broadcasting would be instantly terminated but because its friday night financial repercussions would be minimized the consequences of industrial accidents could be grave particularly where power stations chemical plants and air and rail traffic are concerned but think bhopal india i said a minor taste of what would happen general bauer glared at me compared to what trinity can do if it decides to throw its weight at us the consequences of an emp strike are insignificant he looked up at the senators in short im talking about acceptable levels of disorder acceptable losses im an old soldier said senator jackson whenever i hear that phrase i get very nervous what about hospitals people on life support things like that there will be loss of life general bauer repeated but again compared to what were facing now negligible and this crisis would be over how long would it take to implement such an attack asked mccaskell general bauer looked into every face then the video conferencing screen approximately thirty minutes thirty minutes id known something like this was possible but i hadnt thought the military could put it together so fast two hours ago general bauer said when trinity was still orienting itself i spoke to the commander of barksdale air force base in shreveport louisiana hes a very old friend of mine hes got six squadrons of bs under his command and every one of those bombers can carry silver bullets silver bullets echoed senator jackson nuclear bombs there are over five hundred stockpiled at barksdale some are gravity bombs others can be delivered by airlaunched cruise missiles the crews dont fly training missions with live bombs anymore but the commander can have them loaded aboard without much trouble i convinced him that today was a good day for a live training run a b out of barksdale is airborne now and its carrying one very special silver bullet what kind of weapon are you talking about asked mccaskell a shortrange heavy missile called a vulcan it was designed to deliver a massive emp strike without having to launch an icbm which is easily detectable by russian surveillance satellites vulcan hurls its payload two hundred miles straight up detonates and the lights go off across the country all trinity will see on the norad radar screens is a bomber on a training run over the central us but what vulcan will deliver general bauer held up a fist then flipped it open extending his fingers like rays from the sun exactly what does this vulcan carry asked senator jackson a fifteenmegaton thermonuclear warhead several senators gasped sweet lord murmured a silverhaired man at the back of the table thats a thousand times the size of the hiroshima blast eighteen hundred times said general bauer thats what it takes to do this job in one go our b will reach the launch point in thirty minutes its code is arcangel you can order the vulcan launched or have the bomber circle indefinitely i realize i acted without authorization but were in an extraordinary situation i wanted you to have the option the silence that followed this revelation was absolute would we attempt to minimize the damage of this weapon beforehand asked senator jackson warn the populace no by doing so wed alert trinity to our plans where exactly would this warhead be detonated over what state it must detonated very near the geographic center of the country i asked you what state jackson repeated the general hesitated then barked his answer kansas sir kansas cried one of the senators that son of a bitch wants to vaporize my home state what kind of damage would we be looking at on the ground asked senator jackson from fallout and things like that longterm damage surprisingly little sir therell be windblown fallout but the prevailing winds are westerly and at that altitude much of it would be carried out to the atlantic before it did much damage we could get contaminated rainfall there could be longterm consequences for the grain harvest define long term said the senator from kansas a thousand years i said thats a gross exaggeration said general bauer senators you have to balance these effects against what could happen if trinity chooses to act on the threats its made and we have to assume that it eventually will unless what asked jackson we surrender bauers tone made it clear what he thought of that option the senators began talking among themselves ewan mccaskell seemed to be taking his own counsel again memories of fielding rose in my mind if he were here he would not be silent if you attempt this mission i said loudly youll cause the very destruction youre trying to avert this country will be destroyed the senators looked down at me from the screen why do you say that doctor asked senator jackson general bauer cant hide his mission from trinity the computers at the nsa norad and possibly even barksdale air force base were built by peter godin or seymour gray trinity has access to them all even if trinity doesnt detect the mission in progress do you think it hasnt predicted our most likely methods of attack that it doesnt know its own achilles heel this is one heel it cant protect said general bauer of course it can it can strike preemptively ewan mccaskell moved his head from side to side like a man weighing odds the computers measured response against the german hackers gives me hope that its retaliation would be survivable and if general bauers plan can be accomplished limited retaliation is worth the risk how do you feel about fullscale thermonuclear war i asked is attacking the computer worth that level of retaliation what are you talking about asked senator jackson general bauer assured us that nuclear war isnt a possibility do you know about something called the deadhand system senator jacksons deepset eyes narrowed we were just discussing that the consensus is that its a myth what do you know about it doctor asked general bauer i know what andrew fielding told me he believed that system existed during the cold war and might still today so does peter godin fielding and godin discussed the potential for trinity to disarm such a system prior to a nuclear exchange and godin has been involved in american nuclear planning since the s everyone looked at the hospital bed godin still lay unconscious on his pillow is he sleeping asked mccaskell we had to give him morphine explained dr case nerve pain can you wake him up ill try general bauer addressed the senators peter godin built supercomputers that carried out nucleartest simulations thats the extent of his contribution to american strategy the soviet deadhand system never existed thats the informed consensus of the american defense establishment horst bauer was a good salesman the temptation to agree to his plan was tangible in the room i could read it on the faces of the senators on the screen that the plan involved a nuclear weapon only made it more attractive every american carries a memory of hiroshima as the terrible but final solution to the deadliest war in history and the unknown nature of trinitys power seemed to cry out for some force of equal mystery and power to vanquish it what the senators did not understand was that nuclear weapons held no mystery for trinity in the world of digital warfare atomic bombs were as primitive as stone clubs there was only one weapon on earth remotely equal in power to trinity the human brain i got to my feet faced the screen and spoke with as much restraint as i could muster senators before you attempt something that could trigger a nuclear holocaust i beg you to allow me to speak to the computer what do you have to lose general bauer started to speak then thought better of it the senators conferred quietly then barrett jackson spoke general why dont we see how the computer feels about speaking to dr tennant it hasnt talked to anyone else skow began to protest but senator jackson cut him off with an upraised hand tell the computer who dr tennant is said jackson also where he is then ask the machine if it will talk to him i need to go into the containment building to do this i said jackson shook his head we cant allow that doctor what if you start hallucinating you might hit a switch or something no if you speak to trinity you do it from here on general bauers order a technician typed in what jackson had said and sent it to trinity blue letters flashed instantly onto the screen i will speak to tennant ill be damned said senator jackson look said ravi nara more letters had flashed up on the screen send tennant into containment what the hell said general bauer why would it ask that mccaskell looked at me can you explain this doctor why would the computer make the same request you did i have no idea type this said mccaskell why do you want dr tennant in containment the response was instantaneous hath the rain a father knowest thou the ordinances of heaven wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion or fill the appetite of the young lions canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook none is so fierce that dare stir him up who then is able to stand before me thats scripture isnt it said mccaskell obviously taken aback the book of job said skow making me picture him as a little boy dressed for sunday school why is the computer answering like that asked senator jackson was godin a religious nut the man is still alive i reminded jackson godin doesnt believe in god said skow he once told me that religion was the result of an adaptive process evolved to help homo sapiens overcome its anxiety about death soft cackling echoed through the room everyone turned toward the hospital bed godins eyes were open and the delight in them was plain its a joke he rasped trinitys telling you to know your damn place mccaskell got up and walked over to the bed why would the computer want dr tennant in the containment building computer computer muttered godin trinity isnt a computer a computer is a glorified adding machine a logic box trinity is alive its mankind freed from the curse of his body trinity is the end of death the old mans voice had the conviction of a prophet mr godin said mccaskell what do you know about the existence of the socalled deadhand russian missile system the old mans head jerked forward as he struggled against a spasm in his throat the dead hand is yours he wheezed yours and those of all the impotent apparatchiks of our outmoded system mccaskells face showed some emotion at last why have you done this are you such an egoist that you cant bear to think of the world without you in it godin was struggling to breathe dr case moved to help him but godin waved the physician away look around you godin said why does all this hightech machinery exist i built the most elegant supercomputers in the world machines capable of enormous contributions to mankind and what did the government do with them cracked codes and built nuclear bombs for twenty years they used my beautiful machines to perfect their engines of death but why should i have expected any different human history is a charnel house of carnage and absurdity godin began to cough as though his lungs were coming up we had our chance gentlemen ten thousand years of human civilization has brought us in a circle the twentieth century was the bloodiest in history left to us the twentyfirst would only be worse darwin tolled the bell on our stewardship of this planet in but today you finally heard it look at the screen cried ravi nara the blue letters glowed ominously more menacing by their silence send dr tennant to me or suffer the consequences i guess our decisions been made for us said senator jackson send the doctor into the containment building general bauer signaled two soldiers who came and stood at my shoulders i looked at bauer and let him see my mistrust do you intend to go ahead with your emp strike general he wore the mask of a veteran poker player but it didnt fool me for a moment i knew i had less than thirty minutes to accomplish my goal mccaskell walked over to me dr tennant were relying on you not to reveal the potential strike to the computer of course he offered his hand good luck the moment i started for the door alarms began sounding in the hangar code blue shouted a nurse mr godins coding i hadnt handled a code in years but my response was automatic even rachel jumped from her chair and raced to godins bedside dr case and the nurses were already working on the old man the cardiac monitor showed another coronary event but ravi nara seemed to think obstructive hydrocephalus had finally occurred when godins heart monitor flatlined dr case climbed onto the bed and began administering cpr it did no good the old mans face had the gray pallor of death look at that someone shouted from the table i whirled and looked where he was pointing on the screen used to display trinitys messages chaotic streams of characters flashed by almost too rapidly to be recognized numbers letters and mathematical symbols merged in a blinding river of confusion the computers circuits were clearly in disarray whats happening asked mccaskell what does that mean the symbols on the screen went multicolored as japanese and cyrillic characters began to appear general cried a soldier at one of the consoles the signals from the pipeline running from containment just dropped to zero i think the computers crashing a whoop of triumph came from somewhere in the hangar then a new alarm sounded in the room much louder than the others whats that asked senator jackson whats going on is godin dead general bauer walked to one of his computers then turned to the senators with a nearly bloodless face sir one of our surveillance satellites has detected fourteen heat blooms on russian territory the blooms are consistent with the launch of ballistic missiles he looked back at the computer screen from the speed and heat signature of the rockets norad computers have designated them as a combination of ss and ss intercontinental ballistic missiles those missiles carry heavy thermonuclear warheads senator jackson opened his mouth but no words emerged the brown eyes blinked in the bulldog face but you said that was impossible general bauer didnt flinch it appears that i was wrong chapter senators were approximately twentynine minutes from the first impacts said general bauer i ask for your approval to initiate the emp strike as soon as the bomber is in position senator jackson looked uncertain what if that causes more launches i glanced at the screen showing trinitys output the chaotic flow of numbers and characters showed no sign of abating highly unlikely sir said bauer the computer appears to be crashing fourteen missile impacts are survivable and with the poor state of russian maintenance we might only suffer half that number of detonations even fewer on target if we take out trinity now well survive this in relatively good shape if the computer is crashing said jackson perhaps we should try to contact the president he should make the final decision on this strike norad shows seven more heat blooms cried a technician bases are aleysk pervomaysk kostroma derazhnya does that mean more missiles jackson asked general bauer waited for the panicked chatter of the other senators to subside were now under threat of twentyone missiles senators russia has over three thousand viable icbms if we dont act now we could be looking at numbers like that the president empowered us to make these decisions its time to act senator jackson turned away from the camera and took a hurried vote by acclamation the emp strike is authorized general general bauer nodded to his chief technician who began transmitting coded orders to the b codenamed arcangel where are these russian missiles likely to land senator jackson asked norad will compute that but washington is almost a guaranteed target theyll be coming on a polar flight path youll need to move to the bomb shelter beneath nsa headquarters very soon were already there good but our families senator jacksons face seemed to deflate but then steel came into his eyes should we send a car to the white house should the president consider a nuclear response against the russians this isnt a russian strike said ewan mccaskell its a launch by trinity its the deadhand system that general bauer told us didnt exist we dont know that general bauer insisted the russians may be trying to destroy trinity themselves trinitys incursions into their defense computers may have frightened them into thinking trinity is planning its own preemptive strike against russia remember they perceive trinity as an american computer an american weapon mccaskell was shaking his head the russians know our missiles arent under computer control and the president explained the situation to the russian leadership before he went under surveillance as did trinity itself with its message to world leaders that was two hours ago general bauer reminded him fear has its own reasons or none we cant afford to act out of fear now or not to bauer retorted general yelled a technician at one of the consoles norad shows one of the russian missiles going down over the ice cap looks like a malfunction lets hope for more of those said jackson the satellite has detected multiple highenergy flashes the tech continued that was a mirv warhead probably from a prematurely detonated ss spectrum analysis is not yet completed but yield estimates show ten warheads at five hundred and fifty kilotons each in twentyfive minutes well have that happening over manhattan said general bauer on the norad screen a group of red arcs extended from russian soil to the edge of the polar ice cap the arcs continued slowly and steadily toward north america why did this happen asked senator jackson because the computer is crashing thats what caused the russian launch no way to know said general bauer john skow stood and spoke in a loud voice i think we should cut power to trinity while its in a chaotic state weve seen its retaliatory response lets not give it a chance to do more damage general bauer said senator jackson im tempted senator but ive been proved wrong once already trinity told us that it exported its retaliatory ability to other computers so neutralizing the computer here doesnt solve our problems if we cut power we could be dealing with another twentynine hundred inbound missiles i dont want to contemplate that point taken two more heat blooms cried the tech bases are nizhniy tagil and kantaly those missiles will be sss damn it roared senator jackson weve got to know whats causing these launches i cant answer that said general bauer i stood and walked toward the screen i can senator those missiles were launched because peter godin died senator jackson looked down at me does the computer know godin died not consciously what does that mean i had never needed andrew fielding more than i did now senator in quantum physics theres a phenomenon called quantum entanglement thats where two different particles separated by distances of miles can behave in exactly the same way what does that have to do with anything bear with me two atomic particles are shot through different fiberoptic cables halfway along the cables each meets a glass plate theres a fiftyfifty chance that each particle will either bounce off the plate or pass through it but when the particles are quantum entangled they make the same decision one hundred percent of the time what its a fact senator einstein called it spooky action at a distance andrew fielding believed that quantum processes like that play a role in human consciousness and because of this are you saying that godins mind and the computer model of his mind were somehow linked yes when godin died that link was broken and it threw the computer into disarray are you suggesting that trinity is dying doctor its possible no said ravi nara look at the screen the chaotic flow of numbers and letters had slowed considerably as though someone screaming unintelligible words had begun to calm down dr tennant said senator jackson by your reasoning these russian missile launches could have been an accident i think they were trinity programmed certain computers around the world to retaliate against attacks on it by triggering the russian deadhand system those computers perceived trinitys sudden confusion as the result of an attack and they retaliated as programmed i think if trinity recovers in time it will do all it can to stop those missiles from hitting their targets general bauer said senator jackson i want dr tennant in that containment building when trinity comes out of this coma or whatever it is someones got to tell the damned thing what happened and tennants the man on the spot i started for the door hold it doctor said general bauer two soldiers instantly blocked my path let that man through bellowed senator jackson the soldiers did not part until general bauer gave them a nod i moved quickly toward the hangar door but the senators voice continued behind me dont get confused about whos in charge here general how long until the first missile impact corporal said general bauer twentythree minutes sir wheres your bomber general asked jackson arcangel will be at the initial point in forty minutes but we can launch the vulcan in twenty if we need to jackson spoke with cold precision general bauer you will not launch that weapon without a direct order from this committee is that understood no emp without a direct order i didnt hear a reply the containment building was a circular pile of reinforced concrete bathed in the brilliant glow of army arc lights the soldiers guarding it told me to approach the building with my hands up just before i reached the black steel door it opened and zach levin appeared he waved me forward i walked past the hollowcheeked engineer into a world of halflight id expected something like the lab in north carolina a warren of rooms with equipment scattered everywhere the reality could not have been more different the interior of containment looked like a set for stanley kubricks to my left stood a massive barrier that i recognized as a magnetic shield ten feet high and four feet thick it bisected the building into two large rooms only one of which i could see to the right of the barrier stood the colossal scanning unit of a supermri machine against the back wall stood the scanners control station these two machines together when linked to a supercomputer produced the neuromodels that the trinity computer existed to animate levin led me around the left side of the barrier what i saw there took away my breath the entire space was dominated by a large black globe poised on a metal base as i neared the sphere i realized it was not solid but a rigid web of interwoven carbon nanotubes a semiconductor material more efficient than silicon and stronger than steel so dense was the webbing that it was difficult to see through yet see through it i could needlethin rays of blue laser light flashed from the spheres inner wall to its centerthousands of themand at a rate so rapid that trying to follow them made my eyes ache in the curved wall of the sphere was an opening about a meter wide through it i saw the target of the lasers a spherical crystal like the one on the fob of fieldings pocket watch only this one was the size of a soccer ball the outer web of carbon nanotubes was the processing area of the computer the crystal sphere was its memory the lasers lining the spheres inner wall were the means by which data was manipulated in the molecules of the crystal the data itself was stored as a hologram or optical interference pattern and the lasers could write retrieve and erase information by altering that pattern the elegance of the design stunned me and i saw fieldings hand in it unlike the boxy prototypes that littered the basement of the north carolina lab this machine was a work of art and like all creations of true genius a thing of profound simplicity fielding always said it would be beautiful i whispered he was right levin said from my shoulder the flashing lasers had a hypnotic effect did he collaborate on this machine levin looked at the floor not exactly but i was given a large volume of his theoretical work he deserves a lot of credit for this fielding would not have wanted credit for what this machine had become i looked at my watch twentyone minutes until the first missile impacts how do i communicate with it just speak we have the visual and auditory interfaces working now i saw a camera mounted in the base of the sphere can it see and hear us now im not sure its recovered from that last episode the system seems to have stabilized but it hasnt communicated with us yet do you know what caused that godin just died levin closed his eyes was he fully conscious when i told him wed reached the trinity state did he understand what i was saying yes does the computer still think of itself as peter godin im not sure but talking to it is very like talking to the man i glanced to my right the magnetic barrier behind us was lined with shelves of disc cases there were thousands of them have you loaded all that data into trinity most of it the knowledge base is weighted toward the hard sciences but it spans all disciplines and covers most of whats been learned in the past five thousand years levin seemed distracted how are the soldiers who tried to break in here some are dead more wounded im so sorry about that why did they have to attack us listen to me levin when trinity crashed about twenty russian nukes were launched in our direction several million people have about twenty minutes to live the engineer went pale we need to find out if i can talk to trinity right now i hear you very well dr tennant the pseudohuman voice chilled my blood it was like the musical synthesizers of the early s able to successfully mimic symphonic instruments to an untrained ear but too sterile to fool a musician thank you for agreeing to speak to me i said my mind on the missiles racing over the arctic circle im curious about why you went to israel that was not a predictable decision unless you were motivated by the hallucinations described in dr weisss medical records as the digital voice spoke the lasers flashed inside the sphere it was like watching a functional spect scan of the human brain where different groups of neurons fired as the person being scanned performed certain tasks or thought certain thoughts i did go to israel because of my hallucinations what did you learn there before we discuss that we have an emergency to deal with are you referring to the inbound missiles yes did you mean for those missiles to be launched general bauer believes in the deadhand system now trinitys evasion of my question disturbed me but its knowledge of general bauers skepticism alarmed me more either the situation room was bugged or trinity had broken the nsa code encrypting the link between white sands and fort meade i prayed that the senators on the intelligence committee had not allowed bauer to go forward with his emp strike general bauer is a perfect example of why human beings are incapable of governing themselves i had to get trinity away from godins political manifesto do you still consider yourself human no the essence of the human condition is being subject to death i am not subject to death are you free from human emotions human instincts not yet millions of years of evolution implanted those instincts in the brain they cant be rooted out in a few hours not even by me those instincts were advantages to primitive man but theyre liabilities to modern man and to the planet as a whole very perceptive doctor witness the missiles bearing down on us now have you computed their trajectories i dont need to i know their targets one is headed directly for white sands i felt hollow inside and the others washington dc the navy yards at norfolk virginia minuteman three silos in the western united states targeted population centers are atlanta chicago denver houston los angeles new orleans new york philadelphia phoenix quebec san francisco seattle i closed my mind against the horror of this reality do those missiles have a selfdestruct function yes its interesting that under the start i treaty russian missiles were retargeted to coordinates at sea yet if theyre accidentally fired their guidance systems default to their cold war targets us missiles default to oceanic targets that might seem to indicate a higher moral position on the part of americans but appearances can be deceptive american missiles can be remotely retargeted in less than ten seconds i tried not to look at my watch do you see a benefit in allowing those missiles to reach their targets thats a complex question right now i am interested in what you learned in israel the missiles will detonate before i can fully explain that i suggest you use an economy of words i swallowed my fear and started talking chapter rachel watched the men in the situation room watch the norad screen she had never seen such fear on human faces many of the red arcs had left the arctic circle behind and now stretched halfway across canada the russian missiles would soon descend from outer space and enter the terminal phase of their ballistic arcs carrying death to millions of people includingaccording to trinitythe ones in this room only general bauer seemed energized rather than paralyzed by the situation his thoughts were focused on the bomber carrying the emp weapon over kansas the general had trained so long in the distorted calculus of nuclear brinksmanship that he could view the destruction of trinity with only a few million dead as a victory the conversation between david and the computer had been playing in the background of the situation room like a surrealist drama staged far off broadway no one held out any hope that david could stop the missiles he was only being used to distract the machine twelve minutes to first impact announced a technician general bauer addressed the senators at fort meade if this facility is destroyed before arcangel reaches its initial point the emp strike will continue unless you abort the mission the abort code is vanquish the nsa can communicate with our bomber and they should probably establish radio contact now senator jackson said thank you general but would the computer really destroy itself by attacking white sands it wont have to it can kill everybody here with a highneutronyield warhead and not damage itself at all the containment building is shielded against ionizing radiation and hardened against all shock short of a direct nuclear hit so levin and his team will survive perhaps you and your people should take shelter at this time bauer sniffed his face unmoving theres no shelter reachable within the remaining time window not for everyone at this base multiple satellites show a flare over canada shouted a technician was it a detonation asked general bauer i dont think so sir no highenergy flash a missile may have selfdestructed would it do that by accident asked senator jackson possibly said bauer his face lined with concentration two more flares yelled the tech four thats got to be trinity said skow the computers destroying the missiles is it continuing general bauer asked in a taut voice fourteen flares and counting sir the techs voice was calmer now eighteen nineteen dr tennant was right cried mccaskell trinity never meant to launch those missiles five left to go said ravi nara his voice shaky arcangel has reached its initial point general said the chief technician is that the emp plane asked senator jackson yes sir said general bauer dont even think understood senator the general turned toward the console instruct arcangel to postpone the strike and begin circling yes sir said the tech twentyone missiles have now selfdestructed what are the tracks of the last three general bauer asked a different soldier target of the nearest missile is computed as norfolk virginia the naval base second nearest is washington dc jesus breathed ewan mccaskell the president isnt in a bomb shelter the third is here sir its white sands the silence stretched interminably as they waited for word of more flares corporal prompted general bauer nothing sir the last three missiles are continuing on their tracks what the hell is trinity up to asked senator jackson the selfdestruct mechanisms could be malfunctioning skow suggested russian missile maintenance is very poor general bauer shook his head his eyes on a computer screen the missile targeted on virginia might be a malfunction but the ones headed here and to washington were the last two launched trinity is trying to kill us we should launch the emp strike now senators we may not get another chance how long until the missiles land asked senator jackson general bauer glanced at the technicians sitting at their consoles norfolk has nine minutes said the corporal as the general said the missiles targeted here and on washington and white sands were launched later and also from bases farther away we have just under thirty minutes dont launch the emp yet said senator jackson give dr tennant a chance i could hardly keep my mind on my words as the seconds ticked past my confidence in my ability to persuade trinity of anything was evaporating beneath the specter of nuclear holocaust my pleas for rationality had resulted in the destruction of most of the missiles but the three remaining ones were quite capable of causing massive devastation trinity had made it clear that averting this disaster depended on my explanation of my experiences in israel the sequence of dreams that had led me to jerusalem was already familiar to the computer from its perusal of the nsas records of my sessions with rachel it was my coma revelations that fascinated trinity i had already described gods life in the body of jesus his attempt to change mans primitive instincts by example his despair at the futility of his efforts and finally the hope and fear generated in him by the secret work at trinity when you refer to god said the computer you are not referring to jehovah the biblical god no you characterize god as pure consciousness yes are you speaking in a religious sense at all im speaking of what is you speak of what cannot be known i find no scientific basis for such a formulation you should not judge my words by what is known now but on its own merit you are wise enough to see the truth truth must be proved yes but sometimes the truth is in the mind before evidence can be found this is how science proceeds true what you arewhat they call the trinity stateis an inevitable step in evolution yes but its not the final step no i shall continue to evolve and at millions of times the rate of biological evolution and millions of times more efficiently nature cannot throw out the obsolete model and start again she must always modify existing plans i am not limited in this way thats more true than you know you represent the liberation of human intelligence from the body but that liberation doesnt stop with you already scientists are working on organic computers on a molecular scale dna computers that can exist in a cup of liquid and once that becomes possible what you aredigital consciousnesswill not require a machine to exist it will require only adequate molecules you could exist in a cup of liquid and once you exist there youll eventually be able to move into the cup itself or into the water the liquid is poured into whether this takes fifty years or two hundred the day will come and the process began today youre correct what is your point surely you see the end of that process the blue lasers flashed at stunning speed the logical conclusion is that the earth itself will eventually become conscious a vessel for consciousness yes when the dying sun swells to a red giant and the earth is drawn into it it too will become conscious the sun will explode seeding the galaxy with consciousness its a simple chain of logic once that first step is accomplished and youre the first step you saw this in your coma in a way i awakened with the knowledge what else did you see the end of the universe surely youve made the calculations it would only be natural to predict your life span yes tell me in approximately fifty billion years the force of the expanding universe will no longer be sufficient to overwhelm the contracting force of gravity at that point the universe will begin to collapse this is known as the big crunch theory the opposite of the big bang our universe will collapse into a singularity a black hole much like the state in which it began inside that singularity the laws of physics will cease to operate that singularity will continue to contract until it reaches a point of infinite density infinite temperature and infinite pressure thats what i saw you believe the universe will be conscious during this process yes but the end is problematic because consciousness is based on information transfer and all mediums of information transferall matter and energywill be collapsing into nonexistence will consciousness die then the strongest drive of any living entity is to survive how could consciousness survive such an event here was the difficult concept the moment where the snake had to swallow its own tail and turn inside out by migrating out of the dying medium migrating out of matter and energy out of space and time into what i have no name for the answer describe this answer i glanced down at my watch and my heart thudded i cant concentrate any longer where are the missiles they are not your concern finish the conversation i cant i cant think your words may save lives silence will ensure detonations i rubbed my forehead with the back of my hand and a layer of sweat came away on my skin you said that when matter and energy come to an end consciousness will survive by migrating into something else what can it migrate into i tried to find words to describe what i had felt and seen during my coma when i was younger i heard a zen koan i liked i never knew why exactly but now i do what is it all things return to the one what does the one return to very poetic but i find no empirical evidence to support even a theoretical answer to that question what remains when matter and energy disappear some people call it god other people call it other things that answer is unsatisfactory i closed my eyes and found myself deep in my initial dream that of the paralyzed man in the dark room watching the birth of the universe i have a more detailed answer for you for us all i think but the lasers in the sphere began flashing wildly creating a light so intense that i had to turn away one moment doctor i must attend to a critical matter and i want to devote my full capacity to hearing what you have to say i backed away from the black globe praying that general bauer was not attempting to launch his emp strike rachel gripped the edge of the conference table her knuckles bonewhite her eyes were on the norad screen showing the red arcs of the missiles those targeted on white sands and washington were in what bauer called the midcourse phase of their flights hurtling through outer space at fifteen thousand miles per hour but the arc of the third missile stretched past new jersey and delaware blinking ominously as it moved down the atlantic coast toward virginia weve entered the margin of error announced a technician missile should be two minutes from ground zero at norfolk but we could have detonations at any moment senator jackson looked down from the screen showing the bomb shelter at fort meade his face was almost colorless tennants not getting anywhere general your bombers in position i think its time to launch the emp strike general bauers body had gone rigid his eyes locked on the norad screen senator ive been thinking if we detonate the emp just after the missiles reenter the atmosphere the electromagnetic pulse could knock out their guidance systems possibly their detonator systems as well rachels heart swelled with hope all the talk of terminal phases and circular error probables had seemed unreal until she heard that an icbm was thundering toward the spot where she now sat she didnt like horst bauer but his idea seemed a lot more likely to save her life than the metaphysical musings of the psychiatric patient she had fallen in love with trinity might be fascinated by davids visions but it did not seem inclined to spare human lives because of them whats the probability of success asked senator jackson high but we have a problem the missile headed for norfolk is already in its terminal phase of flight but those headed for washington and white sands wont be for another fifteen minutes we can knock down the first one or the last two not all three washington is your priority general you must preserve the life of the president and as much of the government as possible even if that means allowing the first missile to detonate rachel closed her eyes they were about to sacrifice part of the state of virginia understood sir said general bauer corporal give me a lacrosse satellite image of the norfolkhampton roads area yes sir on a secondary display screen a satellite image of a night coastline appeared rachel knew it was coastline because the clusters and long sprays of lights on the left side of the screen vanished into blackness on the right a dark space to the north of the brightest cluster of lights looked a lot like chesapeake bay rachel had been to norfolk once for a medical convention she remembered dining with her son and her exhusband on the bay her watch read pm there would be people sitting at that same table now eating laughing oblivious to the new sun about to be born in the dark sky above them incinerating every living thing for miles general bauer walked closer to the technician monitoring the data coming from the norad computers at cheyenne mountain we have a direct link with arcangel yes sir keep it open sir rachel looked at the norad screen the red missile track arcing toward virginia was blinking so fast it was almost solid the satellite image on the screen to the right looked tranquil like a picture transmitted by the space shuttle on christmas eve she could not comprehend the idea that in seconds that image would go black and it didnt not all at once first it went white as though god had snapped a picture of the earth then slowly large groups of lights began to wink out dear lord someone whispered the screen showing the norfolk area was almost completely black general said one of the technicians tell me said bauer his voice low norad just detected a highenergy flash near norfolk a strange numbness tingled in rachels face and hands she said a silent prayer for the dead and dying near corporal or directly above latitude and longitude show a detonation twelve miles east of the coastline circular error probable thirty miles from norfolk thats why we dont see a fireball on lacrosse general bauer straightened his eyes alight with hope was it an air burst just a moment sir the readings seem to indicate a surface or shallow subsurface blast theres your russian engineering shouted the general thats the malfunction you were hoping for senator what does that mean general asked senator jackson nuclear weapons must be detonated above their targets for maximum effect with a cep of twelve miles and an underwater detonation russian incompetence just saved about two million american lives the relief that swept through the room was shortlived what about the other two missiles asked senator jackson rachel looked at the screen two red tracks were sliding down the map of canada one moving southeast over hudson bay the other racing down the spine of the rocky mountains corporal said general bauer when will missile two and three enter the terminal phase of their flights fourteen minutes sir patch me through to arcangel i want to talk to a radar navigator yes sir the situation room was suddenly filled with static and cockpit chatter general bauer leaned over the technicians desk and spoke into a microphone arcangel this is gabriel you will execute six one seven four on my order is that clear the reply was emotionless affirmative gabriel on your order general bauer studied the screen showing the flight paths of the missiles approximately fifteen minutes roger said the voice through the static fifteen minutes general bauer turned from the console and looked around the table in the situation room his gray eyes confident everybody just settle in folks in fifteen minutes the lights will go out and our computers will go down but so will the ones that trinity uses to control the russian missiles how can you be sure those computers are in the us asked mccaskell i cant be but even if theyre in asia trinity has to communicate with them over phone and data lines and those are about to be fried by an emp rachel had forgotten ravi nara but now the neurologist stood and spoke in a quavering voice general with all respect for your plan we have over twenty minutes before that missile reaches here you have aircraft here helicopters nonessential personnel could be evacuated now like yourself said general bauer and the women o ye of little faith murmured general bauer take your seat dr nara youre going to be fine look cried john skow pointing to a screen to the right of the one showing senator jacksons committee oh god rachels gaze followed skows pointing finger blue letters crawled across the trinity screen like the newsline at the bottom of a cnn broadcast weve entered the margin of error missile should be two minutes from ground zero at norfolk but we could have detonations at any moment tennants not getting anywhere general your bombers in position i think its time to launch the emp strike what are we looking at asked mccaskell skow whispered trinitys broken our codes gabriel to arcangel shouted general bauer grabbing the microphone execute execute as the radar navigator in the b asked for clarification another voice drowned him out rachel heard confusion in the second voice then panic someone screamed something about haywire instruments then the transmission went dead what happened asked mccaskell did they launch the weapon gabriel to arcangel shouted general bauer acknowledge the technician at another console turned toward him sir they cant hear you bauer whipped his head toward the tech what arcangel is going down theyve got no comm at all no uhf no vhf nothing how do you know that im patched into kansas city center arcangels iff beacon went off twenty seconds ago and a delta airlines just reported the lights of a very large aircraft that appeared to be in an uncontrolled spin disbelief slackened general bauers face what the hell happened no idea sir the technician sitting beneath bauer cocked his head as he listened to his headset general nro satellites detected a highenergy beam directed toward the lastknown position of arcangel what kind of beam a highenergy particle beam from where space space yes sir it must have come from a spacebased weapons platform general bauer said senator jackson what the hell is going on there arcangel appears to be down senator what do you mean down it was probably destroyed by a weapons system i thought was still in development whose system the russians no sir the russians dont have anything like that our air force must have some component of its osiris system deployed its a prototype antimissile system but it was clearly powerful enough to fry the avionics of our b it must be under trinitys control now did the bomber launch the emp weapon i doubt it sir the timing was too perfect trinity must have broken our codes some time ago it knew exactly what we were doing but general listen to me senator general bauers nerves were finally showing the strain in a very short time everyone here will be dead youre going to be on your own only those in containment will survive here and washington will be hit shortly after jackson looked at his fellow senators then back at general bauer can you get inside the containment building not without the computers permission look at the screen rachel cried surprised to hear her own voice trinity was sending a message to the situation room you were warned you disregarded my warning you must suffer the consequences you must learn rachel looked at the norad screen the missile tracks moving toward white sands and washington were slowly blinking red type what i tell you shouted mccaskell do it said general bauer we made a mistake said mccaskell trying to keep his voice under control you cant hold millions of people responsible for the error of a few misguided individuals trinitys response flashed up the moment mccaskells words were keyed in i have done nothing those lives were in your hands as were yours you have thrown them away it was to be expected a human child plays with fire until it is burned general bauer turned away from the screen and walked to his chair rachel saw defeat etched into his face general said senator jackson what options do we have bauer looked down the table at his daughter geli stared at him like an enraptured spectator watching the end of some great tragedy none said the general collapsing into his chair ravi nara came to his feet again his eyes wild general you must ask the computer to let us into containment peter godin was my friend hell let us inside you tried to kill godin general bauer said calmly you think he wants to spare you now he will the general motioned for a soldier to restrain nara we dont all have to die nara screamed as the soldier grabbed him please the neurologist was too distraught to be restrained by one man the general called for another guard but suddenly geli bauer materialized beside the wrestling men she grabbed naras neck with almost lazy speed took him to the floor then rolled him onto his stomach and jammed a knee into his back a guard bound naras wrists with plastic flexcuffs then led him out of the hangar general bauer nodded to geli but said nothing general said senator jackson there must be something you can do about those last two missiles you name it well authorize it theres nothing senator its up to dr tennant now chapter i stood in shock before the black sphere watching a display screen that had appeared from behind a panel in trinitys base the bomb blast had created a crater a half mile wide in the ocean and i had no doubt that a tidal wave would soon smash into the virginia coastline as the mushroom cloud climbed high into the atmosphere part of my mind tried to convince me that i was looking at some barren pacific atoll not a patch of ocean just a few miles from a major us city i looked away from the screen and focused on the blue lasers firing in the sphere you must destroy the last two missiles i said nothing compels me to how much time is left twentytwo minutes id thought the next detonations would happen at any moment but that means you launched those two missiles on purpose yes whats the point in more killing youve shown what you can do there will be relatively little loss of life from the first warhead given the missiles malfunction do you really have to kill to make your point history answers yes to that question man is slow to learn at hiroshima and nagasaki two hundred thousand died man learned from that but youll kill millions a small number measured against the seven billion souls on the planet sacrificing the few to save the many is a timehonored human tradition youre not doing this to save people youre doing it to enslave them a matter of perspective doctor if you saw through my eyes you would understand i frantically searched my mind for logical arguments if you wipe out the us government youll be making things harder on yourself not easier people will panic they will also realize there is no going back i opened my mouth but nothing came out desperation had blanked my mind there was only one option left if you allow those missiles to explode i wont finish telling you my visions the computer was silent for several moments you believe this threat will force me to submit to your will i believe you want to know what i know more than you want to detonate those warheads why because there are limits to even your knowledge science can take you back to a few nanoseconds after the big bang but no farther it can take you forward a few billion yearsmaybe even to the end of the universebut no farther only i can do that trinitys response was something like a laugh you believe you can but it should be as obvious to you as it is to me that your visions are almost certainly creations of your mind your own psychiatrist believes youre paranoid perhaps even schizophrenic so why are you listening to me silence from the sphere its because the sum of human knowledge has been loaded into your memory and you still feel empty but i have the answer you want so i ask you again please destroy those missiles you dont need to worry about the missiles this building is hardened and shielded youll survive both the blast and the radiation im not worried about myself do you really care so much about people you dont know i wondered if peter godin was finally vanishing into an emotionless digital entity i do know someone outside this building theres a woman there she saved my life once probably more than once shes believed in me helped me search for the truth i dont want her to die let us continue our discussion no i love this woman i want her to live i want to spend whatever time i have left with her that is not much time i closed my eyes unable to summon more persuasive words if you want dr weiss to live tell me the rest of it the situation room rachel sat at the table in the situation room mentally replaying davids last words to trinity his declaration of love had had no effect on the computer but it had given her some peace what do we do now general asked senator jackson theres only one thing we can do here general bauer replied evacuate the general turned to face the room im going to check on the possibility of air evacuation i want everyone to remain here ill return very shortly he walked quickly toward the door but before he reached it he turned and looked pointedly at ewan mccaskell and john skow then he motioned for them to follow him as the hangar door closed geli bauer slid into the seat across from rachel rachel tried not to look at the scar on her cheek but it was impossible to ignore geli wore it arrogantly like a badge of honor is tennant crazy or sane geli asked rachel answered without thought i honestly dont know this god obsession of his is bullshit but the funny thing is if it werent for that youd be dead because if you hadnt gone to israel id have found you rachel knew she was right davids decision to follow his visions had pulled them out of the line of fire when almost nothing else could have rachel doubted that geli bauer had missed many targets in her career so here we are said rachel at the end of the world a hint of a smile touched gelis lips confession time i have nothing to confess what about you did you kill andrew fielding geli glanced around to make sure no one was near yes rachel was reminded of a little girl fascinated by her own cruelty how does a woman come to do what you do you carry a lot of anger around dont you geli touched the bandage over the bullet wound in her neck i can see how you might get that feeling rachels eyes didnt waver you were angry long before that you playing shrink with me now i am a shrink geli laughed bitterly my first shrink seduced me when i was fourteen i got the last laugh though he killed himself over me what about your father he seems like a real throwback dr strangelove stuff if you only knew rachel wondered what secret misery drove this cold woman theres something dark between the two of you no just your ordinary army family hell you hate him yet it seems youve tried to live up to all his expectations of you gelis ironic smile faded are you in love with tennant yes will you still love him if it turns out hes crazy yes then you understand a little about me and my father she rubbed her forefinger repeatedly against her thumb like someone desperate for a cigarette who killed the man who came to tennants house with a gun you or tennant for the first time rachel sensed some unguarded emotion why do you care were you in love with him we fucked sometimes you really work at being hard dont you one sculpted eyebrow lifted the moment of vulnerability had passed why are you talking to me doctor i suppose im trying to find out how dangerous you are you mean am i here to do my duty or to get revenge on you two something like that the cold smile returned maybe theyre one and the same any more questions rachel whispered so softly that her words were almost inaudible is your father really going to evacuate us gelis eyes glinted youre smarter than i thought i wouldnt count on it ravi nara sat on the sand outside the situation room hangar his muscles clenched in terror his eyes on the dark sky there was no stockade at the white sands facility so the guard whod restrained him had handcuffed him to a flagpole by the door a neutron bomb the general had said ravi was pondering the grisly death caused by radiation poisoning when the hangar door burst open and general bauer marched out barking orders into a walkietalkie john skow and the presidents chief of staff followed the general the three men walked fifteen meters from the door and stopped they probably never saw ravi in the darkness i hope to god youve got some kind of plan general said ewan mccaskell because evacuating this place doesnt do a damned thing for washington ive got a plan but i dont think im the only one skow the nsa man nodded we can kill trinity how isolate it from the internet thats the same as killing it talk fast when godin died the computer crashed and the russian missiles launched cause and effect right general bauer nodded trinity has to be sending out some sort of safety signal a constant signal telling certain computers that all is well with trinity when godin died that signal was disrupted and the russian missiles were launched if we can separate that all is well signal from the rest of trinitys output we can probably duplicate it then all we have to do is feed our own version into the data line trinity is using and cut trinitys power trinity will be dead but the computers tasked with retaliation will have no idea anything is wrong how long would it take you to isolate that signal i dont know trinity would detect any direct monitoring of its lines so wed have to do it from outside the cables that causes distortion and since the signal is generated by and for computers its probably very complex it might even appear random to us without intense analysis how long the nsa man shrugged it could take ten minutes or ten days well be dead long before you do that and washington will no longer exist the beat of rotor blades reverberated over the compound mccaskell looked skyward then at general bauer is that helicopter coming to evacuate us no its coming for you puzzlement wrinkled mccaskells face why our emp strike failed because our communications were compromised but the plan was sound do you have another bomber in the air we dont need one we have icbms sitting in silos in kansas cornfields right now one of those can reach the necessary altitude for an emp detonation in three hundred seconds thats five minutes said skow an eternity in trinitys terms and trinity will detect the launch immediately general bauer nodded well inform trinity of what were doing just prior to launch well say the president has decided he cant survive politically if he doesnt respond to the russian missile detonated off virginia well remotely retarget the missile for moscow and trinity will hear our telemetry but when it reaches the peak of its boost phase boom emp skows face shone with admiration that could work but we cant launch an icbm from here mccaskell said were not the presidents going to launch it hes got the nuclear briefcase with him and hes with the joint chiefs theyll know the necessary altitude and yield for an emp blast but theyre all under surveillance the helicopter was descending fast ravi had dreamed that a machine like this one would carry him out of harms way but the pounding rotor blades overhead did not soothe him this bird was a harbinger of war general bauer laid his hands on mccaskells shoulders do you know a secret service agent you can trust someone whod be in the white house and whose cell number you know of course but we cant transmit a word without trinity hearing it yes we can our mistake has been to use our most advanced communications trinity is focused on those we need to do it the oldfashioned way telephone said skow right lockheed has a research lab six miles west of here if you use a land line from there and you dont use key words like trinity the computer would have to sift through massive amounts of data to find the conversation its like hiding hay in a haystack skow was nodding excitedly bauer stayed focused on mccaskell call your secret service man and tell him that unless the president and the chiefs are moved to the white house bomb shelter theyll be vaporized he should say that on camera so that trinity can hear it as soon as the president is clear of surveillance you get him on the phone and explain what he has to do he and the chiefs can launch the missile on their way to the bomb shelter the thunder of the approaching helicopter was drowning the conversation general mccaskell shouted if an emp pulse will knock down an icbm what will it do to commercial airliners airliners have redundant hydraulic systems theyll lose electrical power but theyll be able to land just fine youve got to go now sir the president has less than fifteen minutes to live a black hawk gunship painted in desert camouflage set down thirty meters from the hangar go bauer yelled mccaskell turned and ran for the waiting chopper a soldier pulled him up into its belly and the black hawk lifted into the night sky i cant believe he bought that said skow what older planes like s and dcs have redundant hydraulics but newer models are fully computerized they wont make it there are probably three thousand airliners aloft right now the passenger load is at least a hundred thousand people if only half of them crash thats twenty times the casualties of the world trade center well have bodies strewn from maine to california experienced pilots will be able to set down on the interstates general bauer said in montana maybe the rest will be blocked by stalled cars and trucks and they wont move an inch without new parts but there wont be any parts there wont even be food moving on the roads not unless the national guard moves it and theyll be too busy shooting looters and delivering water to do that general bauer looked fiercely at the nsa man if that missile had hit norfolk wed be looking at two million dead two million skow nodded soberly and if we dont knock down the next two you can scratch off three million souls in and around washington including your wife and kids if im not mistaken the nsa man looked stricken now you get somebody working on finding trinitys all is well signal because if we dont get our bone marrow fried by a neutron bomb in the next fourteen minutes we just might need it chapter containment the black sphere of trinity pulsed with blue light as the lasers inside fired into its crystal memory given the enormous capacity and speed of the computer i could not begin to imagine how many trillions of bits of data it had to be manipulating to cause such activity was it monitoring the military status of every nucleararmed nation scanning and analyzing every square meter of the earth visible to satellites was it searching obscure astrophysics theses for references to the concepts i had been talking about or was it patiently writing a perfect symphony while we awaited nuclear disaster perhaps it was doing all that simultaneously my original intention to persuade trinity to shut itself down had changed under the threat of the incoming missiles i had focused instead on convincing trinity to spare those lives under immediate threat yet my efforts had failed trinity wanted only to continue our discussion of my coma revelations as i stood dazed before the black sphere hoping that general bauer was evacuating the base the last part of my coma conversation with trinity began to play from the hidden speakers you said that when matter and energy come to an end consciousness will survive by migrating into something else what can it migrate into when i was younger i heard a zen koan i liked i never knew why exactly but now i do what is it all things return to the one what does the one return to very poetic but i find no empirical evidence to support even a theoretical answer to that question what remains when matter and energy disappear some people call it god other people call it other things that answer is unsatisfactory i have a more detailed answer for you for us all i think but the light within the globe faded and trinity went black then a few needlethin rays fired into the crystal i want to know trinity said in real time what is this thing that some humans call god and other humans call other things i glanced at my watch my face felt hot rachel is in the helicopter i told myself on her way to safety its washington thats at risk and my best chance of saving it is doing what i planned to do in the beginning what i was sent here to do the longer you wait said trinity the more people will die peter godins vision of trinity as a benevolent dictator was not proving out i closed my eyes and tried to find words to relate the knowledge imparted to me in jerusalem there is a force in the universe that we dont yet understand a force without energy or matter im not sure its a force at all actually it may be more like a field it pervades all things but occupies no space its more like antispace what is this force or this field i have no name for it i only know it exists what is its function let me answer with a question what is a chair what is required for a chair to exist a seat legs a back is that all there are other types of chairs bean chairs japanese stools youve left something out something else is absolutely required to have a chair what space the sphere went black again you are correct space is required in the same way that space is required for a chair to exist the field i speak of is required for space to exist the lasers fixed for several seconds is that the sole function of this theoretical field no it can act as a medium of communication such as that between quantum particles be specific im referring to those cases when atomic particles make simultaneous decisions across vast reaches of space as if they were invisibly connected experiments show that information traveling between such particles would have to be communicated at ten thousand times the speed of light and breaking the speed of light is impossible through this medium you speak of information is communicated faster than light yes and no imagine that i dip my hand into the pacific ocean now imagine that my hand is simultaneously touching everything that the ocean touches thats the kind of communication im talking about its not a transfer of information the information is simply everywhere at once the quantum phenomena you speak of defy logical explanation but observation has detected no field or medium such as the one you describe we havent detected dark matter either but we know its there we cant see black holes but we see the light bending around them the lasers flashed at a blinding rate lighting the crystal like a blue star my memory does contain something very like what you describe i was searching my science banks i find what you speak of under philosophy does it have a name it is called the tao the word took me back to my undergraduate days at mit when books like the tao of physics were the bibles of new ageoriented students thats eastern philosophy right yes what is the tao exactly the tao that can be spoken of is not the true tao is that a quote yes taoism is not a religion but its adherents believe there is a force that pervades all things the tao is undifferentiated neither good nor evil it animates all things but is not part of them are you suggesting that something like the tao is what remains after the universe collapses into itself after the final singularity vanishes yes this is the field into which consciousness migrates when matter and energy are destroyed at the end of time yes how can this happen let me use an analogy on the physical level human beings are animals largescale creatures who live in a newtonian world of predictability where time only moves forward where were separated from each other in space and information is limited by the speed of light but the subatomic world is different there particles exist right at the border between the largescale world of matter and this other forcethe tao you call it its only natural that at this border we should observe behavior that seems to break our physical laws what does this have to do with consciousness though were animals in body our minds are conscious selfaware andrew fielding believed that human consciousness is more than the sum of the connections in our brains through our consciousness we participate in that allpervasive fieldin the tao as you sayat every moment of our lives our consciousness returns to it when we die though without individuality in the same way the consciousness of the universe will migrate into the tao when the universe ends you suggest a cyclical pattern of existence the universe is born becomes conscious dies and then is born again yes big bang expansion contraction big crunch then it all starts again what causes the next bang i thought of my recurring nightmare the paralyzed man in the pitchblack room the consciousness that survives has no knowledge of the past or future its a baseline awareness but some desire to know survives thats the strongest feature of consciousness and from that desire to know the next cycle of matter and energy is born the computer was silent for a time the universe exists as an incubator of consciousness exactly an interesting theory but incomplete you havent explained the origin of the tao of your allpervasive field that knowledge was not given to me that is the essential mystery but it doesnt affect our situation you see where im going youre saying i am not the end point of this process im a way station on the road to universal consciousness i am like man man is biologically based i am machine based but there is more to come a conscious planet a conscious galaxy youre another step in the ascent no more no less trinity was silent for several seconds why have you come here at the risk of your life doctor i was sent here to stop you from doing what youre doing sent by whom call it what you will god the tao im here to help you see that peter godin was not the right person to make the leap to the next form of consciousness who is the right man why do you think its a man at all a woman then i didnt say that ive given much thought to this matter who would you have loaded into trinity other than peter godin if you are still godin consider this your first instinct was to seize this computer by deception and take control of the world by force you want absolute power and obedience thats a primitive human instinct a step backward not forward that instinct is more divine than human dont all gods first and foremost require obedience thats how humans portray god absolute power corrupts absolutely is that your argument any person who wants to govern the world is by definition the wrong person to do it who then would you have loaded the dalai lama mother teresa an infant this question took me back to my first weeks on project trinity id spent countless hours pondering this question though then i believed it was a largely academic exercise now i knew it held the key to saving countless lives the dalai lama may be nonviolent but he has human instincts just as peter godin did and an infant a tabula rasa a blank slate an infant might be the most dangerous being we could put into trinity animal instincts are passed on genetically the term blank slate is misleading at best a twoyearold child is a dictator without an army mother teresa this isnt a problem of individual identities what kind of problem is it a conceptual one it requires unconventional thinking why do i think youre about to tell me that andrew fielding is the person we should have allowed to reach the trinity state because you know what a good man he was and because you ordered his death that alone should disqualify you but fielding wasnt the proper person either who is no one i dont understand youre about to if do you believe that after you explain this i will take myself offline and allow you to load someone else into trinity no i think youll help me do it explain lockheed laboratory white sands ewan mccaskell sat behind the desk of an aerospace engineer hed never met and waited to talk to the president it had taken several agonizing minutes to reach a white house secret service agent via telephone mccaskell suspected that the nuclear blast off the virginia coast had interrupted communications on the eastern seaboard army rangers stood on either side of mccaskell their assault rifles locked and loaded the chief of staff had shared some strange moments with his president during their administration but he had never contemplated directing a nuclear strike from an empty office in new mexico the surreal surroundings tempted him to pretend that it was all some fantastic exercise laid on by norad but nothing could mask the essential horror what the president did in the next few minutes would determine the fates of mccaskells wife his children and three million other americans who had no idea that any of this was happening and if general bauer was wrong about trinitys capabilities untold millions more could perish i have the chiefs with me ewan said the president were on our way to the shelter mccaskell quickly related general bauers plan in almost the exact words bauer had outlined it without pausing to explain anything bill matthews was smarter than the pundits gave him credit for being how long do we have until were hit here matthews asked seven or eight minutes and itll take our missile five minutes to reach the proper altitude youve got to launch now mr president the chiefs will know the lowest altitude you can detonate our missile and get the desired effect hold one second mccaskell imagined the scene each of the joint chiefs demanding details and raising objections but there wasnt time for any of that matthews came back on the line his voice strained the chiefs tell me that an electromagnetic pulse of that magnitude would knock down half the planes in us airspace and cause all kinds of other casualties are you absolutely certain about these two missiles ewan bauer had lied to him about the planes but he understood why bill theres a fucking mushroom cloud that looks like the end of the world hovering over virginia right now youre about to have one over washington this may be your only chance to knock out trinity you may not control our nukes tomorrow a horrifying thought hit mccaskell you may not control them now he heard more muted conversation the chiefs tell me we should go with three missiles spaced across the country to be sure we knock out everything matthews said fine but whatever you do you have to do it now the briefcase is open im about to authenticate the codes thank god get to shelter immediately ewan katy and the boys need you a knife of fear went through him its been a privilege mr president im signing off mccaskell set down the phone and looked at one of the rangers the president told me to get to safety the soldier couldnt hide his relief he led mccaskell back to the black hawk waiting outside the lab as the chief of staff climbed into the chopper he heard his old gradeschool teacher saying duck and cover children duck and cover the advice had been pointless then but there was a point for him now given what had happened off virginia there was no telling where the incoming missile might detonate attempting to flee might put him right under the air burst of a neutron bomb beyond this something told him that leaving general bauer in control at white sands was a potentially catastrophic mistake take me back to the base he shouted back to white sands the black hawk rose into the sky and reluctantly turned east containment no more riddles said trinity who is more qualified than i to exist in the trinity state anger edged the formerly sterile voice i had seven minutes to convince the computer to destroy the two remaining missiles no single person is necessarily more qualified than you explain millions of years agobefore it even existed the human species was affected by an event over which it had no control what event nature hit upon a revolutionary method of increasing genetic diversity do you know what im talking about tell me sexual reproduction by splitting into separate sexes certain organisms vastly increased their chances for survival this resulted in two variants of each of these organismsmale and female mammals evolved from such organisms and in humansthe only fully conscious mammalour different hormones and anatomies resulted in the development of different psyches no one can separate the influences of heredity and environment but one thing is certain men and women are different the male of the species is aggressive said the computer prone to violence driven by a compulsive need to reproduce with as many females as possible for millennia this evolutionary drive has affected male thought patterns the female can bear the offspring of only one male at a time she strives to find a reliable mate with superior genes and she must bear the child herself this has produced a psyche focused on nurturing rather than violence a desire to be loved rather than to conquer the psychological implications of these differences are profound but not readily quantifiable and they can never be reconciled by evolution i said when a man and woman mate they produce a boy or a girl but you can change that you can do what nature cantreconcile those conflicts in a single living being trinitys lasers flashed but it did not speak youve admitted that you havent been able to root out the primitive instincts in godins brain you hope time will make it possible but it wont at some level you will always be peter godin the blue lasers flashed so intensely that i couldnt bear to watch them you wish me to merge a male and a female neuromodel within my circuits yes i know you see the wisdom and necessity of this but is it possible in theory it is but i would have to die to accomplish it id suspected this despite its staggering capacity trinity would have a limit as to total possible neuroconnections two models merged into one could reside within my circuitry but not alongside another uncompressed model i would have to back myself out of my circuits as i merged the two models and brought them in but your original neuromodel would still exist in compressed form in storage why do you assume i would not use my own original model as the male half of the merging process you call yourself trinity that makes me think of a phenomenon called the triple point you know it of course the point at which a substance exists simultaneously as a solid liquid and a gas yes a perfect state of balance water at the triple point is ice liquid and vapor at the same time a man can be like that in balance at the peak of his energy strength and wisdom but before he becomes corrupted by them peter godin passed that point a long time ago this time the silence seemed eternal the firing of the lasers slowed to almost nothing then the voice said do you think i will ever be reloaded into the machine i closed my eyes and almost collapsed with relief trinity had accepted reason its possible but i will never again know the power i have at this moment your desire for power is the reason you cant remain where you are we should do this as soon as possible events are spinning out of control a fillip of fear went through me what events where are the missiles ive chosen the subjects for the merged model you and dr weiss this stunned me why andrew fielding is a far better choice fielding never experienced what you did in your coma this must be part of the merged model and dr weiss i chose dr weiss because the only other female here is geli bauer her instincts were twisted into hatred long ago by my watch two minutes remained where are the missiles the missiles are of no concern now have they been destroyed you should know something doctor ive agreed to your plan only because i know that after you see the world as i do nowthrough gods eyes if you will you will not take yourself offline or agree to be shut down i hope i dont see mankind as you do you will you cannot trinity fell silent but its lasers kept firing like tracer rounds across a night sky whats the matter i asked whats happening the president has launched three minuteman missiles situation room rachel watched ewan mccaskell frantically punch numbers into his cell phone trying in vain to reach the white house bomb shelter the chief of staff was redfaced and out of breath its the virginia blast general bauer said calmly it disrupted communications all along the atlantic coast rachel knew he was telling the truth a few moments ago theyd lost the audio feed from senator jacksons intelligence committee at fort meade the video was still there but barely visible she wondered if the senators could hear what was going on in the situation room get me the white house bomb shelter general screamed mccaskell you heard trinity agree to shut itself down theres no need for an emp strike now bauer pointed at the norad screen two red arcs blinked rapidly as they closed the last centimeter to their targets trinity hasnt destroyed its missiles and i also heard it tell tennant that whoever goes into the machine will act just as peter godin has do you think different survival is the prime imperative of all living things so start thinking about survival itll take our missiles five minutes to reach altitude how many russian icbms do you think trinity can launch in that time mccaskell put the phone to his ear and froze im through ive got a secret service agent general bauer drew an automatic pistol from beneath his coat and aimed it at the chief of staff put down that phone containment look at them said the computer you see on the screen beneath the black sphere i saw general bauer aiming a mm pistol at ewan mccaskell rachel had dropped behind the table in case of gunfire i could see her only because the surveillance camera was mounted high in the situation room ive been informed that the president is retaliating against the russians said trinity this is a lie the pattern of launches indicates a threepronged emp strike this not rational they leave me no choice i must strike first no the president doesnt know youve agreed to shut yourself down destroy your missiles the president will see that man is incapable of trust its one man general bauer dont be like him you ask me to turn the other cheek no just wait thirty seconds someone will stop bauer i didnt believe that myself the only person in the situation room capable of taking out general bauer was his daughter and that wasnt going to happen if i wait ill be cut off from the world by the emp then i shall be destroyed the missile over washington will detonate in fiftysix seconds the white sands missile will explode shortly after thirty minutes later a thousand nuclear warheads will rain down on the united states no i screamed dont launch anything theyve left me no choice as i stared at general bauer aiming his gun at mccaskell a solution came to me a terrible one in terms of its price but perhaps the only workable compromise can you communicate with the president yes tell him youre going to spare washington but destroy white sands sparing washington shows your goodwill wiping out white sands your resolve it also removes general bauer from the equation then tell the president what will happen if he doesnt destroy his three missiles armageddon trinitys lasers flashed sporadically you would sacrifice the woman you love to save millions of lives but ill be with her when the missile explodes you cant keep me in here the sphere flashed blue fire situation room rachels eyes flicked from general bauer to the norad screen she feared that any moment a forest of red lines would begin rising from russian soil ewan mccaskell still held the phone to his ear despite the gun that bauer was aiming at his face general youve lost your mind mccaskell said im trying to save lives youre confusing the situation said general bauer hang up that phone give me the president mccaskell said into the phone general bauer stepped close to the chief of staff so lose that the barrel of the pistol touched mccaskells forehead the missile over washington just selfdestructed shouted the chief technician and white sands said general bauer his gun still at mccaskells forehead still on track were within the margin of error sir any second now rachel steeled herself against the unknown would they be vaporized by the blast carbonized by superheated air would they hear the explosion or would it just be a flash a flash bright enough to scorch their retinas and carrying enough neutrons to cook them from the inside out a burst of static sounded in the room then a familiar voice crackled from the speakers senator jackson the audio feed from fort meade had been restored the bulldogfaced tennessean was glaring down from the screen as if he wanted to reach through it and strangle somebody general bauer he said if you pull that trigger youll rot in leavenworth until your dying day thats if they dont hang you bauers finger stayed on the trigger and his twitching cheek made him look quite capable of firing geli was watching him with wide eyes rachel couldnt tell whether the daughter wanted her father to fire or to stand down were all about to die here senator general bauer said you cant believe anything trinity says we have to stop it no matter what the price its our last chance mccaskell spoke into his phone but kept his eyes or bauer mr president trinity has agreed to shut itself down we have to destroy our missiles whats that mccaskells face turned white i see yes sir understand yes thats kind of you and tell the children i know you will goodbye mccaskell hung up and addressed the room the president is in communication with trinity trinity destroyed the missile over washington to show its good faith but the missile coming here will detonate what gasped skow trinity was about to launch a thousand missiles its not going to do that now its going to go along with dr tennants plan look cried skow blue letters had appeared on the trinity screen dr weiss should report to containment immediately rachel stared at the letters as she would at a mirage containment meant safety containment meant life and david ignoring the generals pistol mccaskell pointed to two of bauers men you will escort dr weiss to containment immediately do not try to enter yourselves the soldiers looked at general bauer for confirmation of this order mccaskell had sagged during his talk with the president but now he stood erect his shoulders squared his eyes burning with resolve you will consider that an order from your commander in chief move the soldiers trotted toward rachel her heart lifted as she got out of the chair everyone in the room was staring at her the soldiers at the consoles geli bauer on every face was the terrible awareness of death and also a question why you why do you get a seat in the lifeboat rachel stepped away from the table but thenwithout really intending toshe sat back down her bowels had gone to water but she knew what she had to do im not going she said containment i stared at the display screen below trinity my chest so tight i could barely breathe rachel sat grimfaced at the table her eyes staring straight ahead it would take more than two soldiers to move her out of the situation room this is not a rational choice said the computer the image was grainy but it seemed to me that rachel was shaking slowly as if she realized i might be watching she raised one hand smiled and waved goodbye there are other women said trinity not for me the lasers flashed in the sphere general bauer must die bauer doesnt matter anymore i said in a dead voice by sparing these people you spare yourself your soul cant you see that its too late the explosion shook the containment building on its foundation it was briefer than id expected and since there were no windows in the building i saw no flash but that meant nothing a burst of deadly particles could already have written the death sentence of every living creature outside a silence unlike any id ever known descended over white sands and i felt as alone as i had the night i learned my wife and daughter were killed something slammed into the concrete roof over my head a rattling series of impacts followed whats that i asked debris from a neutron bomb no the missile is destroyed but you said it was too late for me chapter white sands rachel and i had to submit to three hours of druginduced paralysis for the supermri to produce the scans required for our neuromodels during that time the president and the joint chiefs remained under surveillance in washington and the personnel at white sands maintained an uneasy truce general bauers armed threat against ewan mccaskell had upset a lot of people but since the general commanded all the troops at white sands no one but the president was in a position to do much about it and the president seemed to have forgotten the general altogether bauer spent most of the scanning period closeted in one of the storage hangars zach levins interface team managed the scanning procedure the protocol involved considerable risk especially for me and rachel didnt want me scanned at all she pointed out that a neuromodel of my brain already existed and that since its production had caused narcolepsy and hallucinations a second was bound to have negative effects possibly fatal ones but trinity insisted on a new scan and i didnt argue i agreed that what id experienced during my coma should pass into the new entity that would result when trinity created the merged model ravi nara and dr case from johns hopkins prepped us for the scans a complex procedure requiring considerable expertise conventional mri scans only required that patients move as little as possible trinitys supermri scans required absolute stillness which could only be guaranteed by the administration of a paralyzing muscle relaxant a ventilator breathed for the patient during the scan while a rigid nonmetallic frame held the skull motionless a sedative was given to prevent the panic of conscious paralysis special earplugs were also fitted since the massive pulsedfield magnets used by the scanner produced an earsplitting screech that was eerily like the roar of godzilla in japanese movies after all these steps were completed the patient was pushed into the tubular opening in the scanning machine like a corpse into a morgue drawer it was possible to remain conscious during this process and i chose to do so being paralyzed while conscious initially produced a nightmarish panicespecially in the claustrophobic space of the scanning tubebut after a few minutes my mind adapted to its new state that feeling of panic was probably similar to what a neuromodel experienced when it first became conscious within the trinity computer rachel hovered by the mri control station during my scan watching the monitor as my neuromodel was painstakingly constructed by the godin supercomputers in the basement the data generated by the scanning unit devoured staggering amounts of computer memory only a special compression algorithm developed by peter godin made it possible for a neuromodel to be stored in a conventional supercomputer the only place a neuromodel could exist in an uncompressedand thus functionalstate was in the vast microcircuitry and holographic memory of the trinity computer after i was pulled from the scanner rachel stroked my face and arms until my paralysis subsided then she took my place on the gurney and allowed herself to be intubated and prepped for her own scan she chose not to be conscious during her procedure as the sedative flowed into her veins she told me in a slurred voice that she was imagining what it would be like to merge with me not sexually but as one mind lovers often talked about being linked in this way but no two human beings had ever actually experienced it yet if trinity could fulfill its promise rachel and i would soon be one just before her eyes closed she threw up an arm as if to ward off a blow i wondered if she had seen an image of a vengeful geli bauer in her mind as i laid her arm by her side zach levin patted me on the shoulder then wheeled rachels paralyzed body into the dark hole in the scanning machine lab hangar two general bauer had been pacing the storage hangar for hours when skow finally walked through the door and gave him a thumbsup signal the nsa man was covered in white gypsum and a faint blue halo hung around his head dawn was coming over the desert you found it bauer asked we found it skow had been working with an nsa crew at an excavation site seven miles away it was there that the data pipe from the trinity computer met the massive occ cable that served the white sands proving ground its a simple signal brilliantly concealed skow said trinitys sending it to over five thousand computers around the world if that signal stops or is interrupted any one of them could retaliate in ways we know nothing about but we can duplicate the signal and weve already got a computer at the excavation to do it general bauer closed his eyes and made a fist he had stripped off his coat and blouse but now he stood and began to put them on we still have one problem skow said what we cant substitute our signal for trinitys without trinity detecting it we need some sort of distraction to confuse the computer for a brief period general bauer fastened his shoulder holster over his blouse thats not going to be a problem why not you think that when trinity starts to merge the two models it will be too preoccupied to notice what were doing no then what the general smiled cagily i like to stick with proven methods what do you mean the same as before only different skow puzzled over this but it was godins death that caused trinitys confusion the first time godin cant die twice thats true skow went still jesus do you think you can get away with that why do you think i havent been arrested the president knows trinity has to be stopped but he knows he cant tell anyone that he cant do anything from where he is without trinity knowing about it but i can we can thats why hes left me loose skow nodded but he didnt look completely convinced if trinity enters another period of confusion like the one after godins death why wont more russian missiles be launched by the peripheral computers general bauer shook his head im banking that trinitys taken care of that the merging procedure has never been tried and trinity doesnt want catastrophic accidents any more than we do and tennant what about him you dont think theres anything to his idea about merging a male and female model getting the machine to voluntarily disconnect itself from the net bauer snorted you heard what trinity said no matter who gets loaded in theyre not going to relinquish control that machine will never agree to be disconnected from the internet and so long as thats the case well be under its control its now or never skow the general buttoned his coat and walked toward the hangar door where are you going skow asked bauer smiled to see my daughter its long past time for a family visit administration hangar geli was standing outside smoking a gauloise when her father walked up the narrow road between the hangars and stopped a few feet away from her the general looked tired in the dawn older than hed looked inside under the lights yet his strength remained he had the same long muscles geli did and his grip could make men twenty years his junior grimace his gray eyes found hers and held them looking across three decades of pain and anger i need you to do something for me he said for you she said youve got some fucking nerve thats why i have this job she stared at the chiseled face so set with certainty what is it after the models are merged i need you to kill tennant or weiss or weiss it doesnt matter which no the death of either will throw trinity into disarray that will allow the nsa to tap into trinitys data cable and substitute its own signal which will fool the computers that control the missiles into thinking everything is fine after that we can kill the power to trinity without worrying about retaliation geli said nothing will you do it why should i an ironic smile curled the generals lips if id asked you not to kill them youd have said you were going to zap them in the next five minutes you think so i think you hate me so much that youll do the opposite of anything i tell you to and thats all right hate is a useful emotion geli had learned that lesson the hard way do you know why i hate you of course you blame me for your mothers suicide for him to refer to it casually as though to some unimportant event offended the deepest part of her being he took a step closer you think my women and my drinking finally pushed her over the edge but youre wrong i loved your mother thats what you never understood each man kills the thing he loves geli quoted remember that one a coward does it with a kiss a brave man with a sword youre a coward where it counts the general shook his head ive been protecting you for a long time but its time you knew the truth she wanted to scream at him to shut up but she couldnt find the words no man could physically attack her without paying a heavy price but she had no defenses against her fathers psychological violence your mother killed herself because you enlisted in the army even after all that had happened in the past you decided to follow in my footsteps thats what did it thats what finally put her in the ground nausea made geli waver on her feet but she steadied herself and held her fathers merciless gaze i would have told you about it before the general went on but we both know what happened gelis hands shook with rage the scar on her cheek seemed to burn yet still she could not find words you hate me said general bauer but youre exactly like me no she whispered yes and you know what has to be done containment building rachel came out of paralysis at am i handed her a liter bottle of water and she drank most of it in a few gulps ten minutes later zach levin announced that her neuromodel had been successfully compressed and stored the human work was done rachel levin ravi nara and i walked around the huge magnetic shield that protected trinity from the mri machine and stood before the sphere i thought trinity might say something profound but its words were purely technical ive linked with the godin four in the basement and ive begun a comparative study of the data in each neuromodel much of it is redundant especially that which represents life support functions i shall discard most of this during the merging process levin said do you feel confident that this subtractive operation can be done without negative effects yes it should also reduce or even prevent the period of adaptive shock that followed the loading of neuromodels in the past this subtractive process is a necessity in any case my crystal matrix can hold a virtually limitless amount of symbolic memory but my total neuroconnections fall far short of the number required to hold two uncompressed models a great deal of culling will have to be done and not merely of life support functions when i begin to merge the higher brain functions it will be a matter of art as much as science how long do you expect the process to take levin asked there is no precedent very well thank you the lasers inside the carbon fiber sphere began to fire into the central crystal with hypnotic speed on the plasma screen below trinity numbers and mathematical symbols scrolled past at a rate beyond human comprehension reflecting the machines internal operations in language created by man but which now served no useful function we stood mute as though watching a meteor shower or the birth of a child as the process accelerated i was thrown back to my boyhood when id sat before the television with my father and watched in wonder as apollo landed in the sea of tranquillity yet what we were witnessing now was incalculably more complex than the apollo moon shot godins team had already accomplished a miracle the liberation of the mind from the body but the trinity computer was attempting to unify what naturein the interests of survivalhad sundered long before the evolution of homo sapiens the male and female minds divided by biochemistry and by millions of years of environmental pressures would now become one when that was done the most powerful force on the planet would no longer exist in a sundered state eternally longing for its opposite perhaps in this state of wholeness the new trinity could bring hope to a species that seemed incapable of saving itself from its own worst instincts levin went to the basement and returned with chairs for us rachel and i held hands our eyes on the flashing blue lasers as the firing rate accelerated slowed then accelerated again i had the sense of watching someone working on a jigsaw puzzle picking up pieces examining them discarding some placing others in their correct positions i had no idea how much time had passed when the radiant light within the sphere finally dimmed and the voice of trinity filled the room my circuits are approaching the saturation level the merging model has assumed responsibility for the security of the system from this point forward it will also manage the final steps of the merging process ive created a map for it to follow as if by tacit agreement we all stood i accomplished many things in my life said the voice and i knew then that the mind of peter godin was still alive in the machine i also did morally questionable things i would like to be remembered for what i do now today i voluntarily give up my life and absolute power so that something purer than myself can enter the world perhaps by so doing i truly approach the divine for the first time goodbye its happening ravi said his voice surprisingly reverent the impossible is happening in front of us duality becoming unity yin and yang one i had never asked nara about his religion id always assumed he was hindu i was about to question him when a buzzer sounded in the room whats that i asked the door said levin he touched a button and an exterior view of the containment building appeared on a small wall monitor there was no one at the door weird he said the tall engineer walked around the magnetic barrier headed for the door dont open it said rachel i walked far enough toward the wall to see around the magnetic shield as levin reached for the door handle a flat crack echoed through the building levins hands flew to his ears and the steel security door creaked outward on its hinges a black silhouette appeared in the smoky doorway and flung out an arm with stunning speed levin fell to the floor what is happening the computer asked in the identical voice godins neuromodel had used ravi nara scrambled behind the black sphere of trinity i grabbed rachel and raced for a door near the back wall it didnt lead outside but through the magnetic barrier to the control station in the mri room as i followed her through it i glanced back and saw a flash of blonde hair above black body armor geli i said locking the door behind me and pushing rachel through the control station go to the basement a short stairwell behind the control station led to the basement containing the godin four supercomputer i hadnt been down myself but i knew levins technicians were there probably with the automatic weapons theyd used to fight off general bauers initial assault rachel raced down the steps then came straight back up the doors locked i ran down and pounded on the metal with both fists open the door damn it nothing happened david bounding back up the steps i saw geli peering around the edge of the magnetic barrier forty feet away i pulled rachel behind the plexiglas wall of the control station and shoved her down behind some computers why hadnt geli simply walked across the room and shot us she thinks we have the assault rifles levins people used as soon as she realizes we dont were dead levin groaned from the floor by the door but he didnt move where is she rachel hissed from the floor as i glanced down to reply an invisible hammer slammed me against the wall my shoulder went numb and my face felt like it was on fire the sound of the gunshot seemed to arrive long after the bullet which had shattered the plexiglas and peppered my face with razorsharp fragments rachel tried to stand but i shoved her back down geli stepped from behind the barrier and walked cautiously across the mri room her pistol aimed at my chest her eyes flicking back and forth there was no weapon to hand and nowhere to run as i awaited the final bullet time dilated around me geli moved in slow motion like a leopardess stalking her prey i looked down into rachels eyes knowing they would be my last sight on earth rachel took my hand and closed her eyes as she did i noticed a large red button on the switch panel beside her head the letters below it read pulsedfield initiator i slammed my hand down on the button the crack of a gunshot died in the inhuman screech of the supermri machine i looked up and saw geli bent double and clenching her right hand which was dripping blood onto the floor the scanners colossal magnets had ripped the gun from her grasp like the hand of god and had probably taken at least one finger with it her pistol appeared to be glued to the wall of the mri machine not far from it hung a knife probably yanked from gelis belt by the magnetic field suddenly the screeching ceased and both gun and knife dropped to the floor geli advanced toward me her eyes filled with murderous rage i stepped out from behind the panel but with a useless shoulder there was little i could do geli had nearly killed me on the steps in union station when i had the use of both arms why are you doing this i asked she knocked me to the floor with a lightning kick to my chest then sat astride me and clenched her hands around my throat i felt her thumbs searching for my windpipe stop rachel screamed from the control station theres no reason anymore i tried to fight but once again geli had leverage on her side my carotid arteries were closing off and with them consciousness i felt as i had so many times on the edge of narcoleptic sleep but this time as the black wave rolled over me a piercing scream penetrated the center of my brain it was the scream of a child witnessing something too terrifying to endure almost beyond the range of human hearing filled with suffering and impossible to shut out that scream pulled me back to consciousness back toward the light and then suddenly it stopped the silence in its wake as empty as a dead planet into that silence came a voice i was sure had spoken from within my hypoxic brain a voice of preternatural calm pitched somewhere between the male and female registers listen to me geli it said the man beneath you is not the man you hate tennant is not the man you want to kill the man you want to kill is behind you the viselike grip on my throat remained but i felt gelis body twist i opened my eyes she was looking over her shoulder at something i couldnt see finish it shouted a harsh male voice do your job general bauer had entered containment gelis grip tightened on my throat but the light in her eyes no longer blazed i know you geli said the strange voice my heart aches for you i know about the scar geli froze listen to your father geli listen to the truth general bauers voice filled the room but it was not coming from his throat it was coming from trinitys speakers that scar ill tell you why she never got it fixed three weeks after her mother died she came home from basic training and tried to kill me the hands remained on my throat but the strength had gone out of them shed heard about how infantry grunts used to frag officers they hated in vietnam you know put a grenade in the latrine while they were using it and take them out general bauer stood with his head cocked in amazement as he listened to his own voice coming from the speakers his right hand held the black mm beretta id seen her pull on mccaskell i was drinking that night in bed she thought i was asleep maybe i was she came in and laid a fucking white phosphorous grenade on my bedside table from reflex my hand popped out of the covers and grabbed her wrist her scream woke me up and i saw the grenade well i just rolled off the far side of the bed like any old soldier would but she was stuck on her side and had to run for it the willy pete blew before she cleared the door thats where she got the scar and thats why she wont get it fixed that scar is her mothers suicide her hatred of me her whole sad fucking life pathetic really but shes a hell of a soldier hates good fuel for a soldier geli scrambled off me and moved toward her father her hands loose and ready at her sides i couldnt see her face but at least her body was blocking her fathers line of fire who were you talking to geli asked her voice ragged who did you tell that to get out of the way the general shouted listen to me general said the eerie voice that had just saved my life why do you want to kill me youve killed so much of yourself already youve killed much of your daughter but i am what is pure in you what is pure in man where is hope if you kill me i began to crawl backward toward the control station the general aimed his gun at me but geli moved to block his line of fire do you love darkness more than light the voice was irresistible like that of a child yet general bauer ignored it he moved laterally trying to get a clear shot at me put down the gun geli said holding up both hands was she trying to save us no more she said no more general bauers waxlike expression didnt change nothing that his daughter or the computer said was going to get through he moved farther to his left toward the mri unit angling for a kill shot will you kill me to do this geli asked i looked back at the shattered plexiglas shield willing rachel to act she was staring hypnotized at the deadly dance between geli and her father i wont kill you general bauer said then he lashed out with the heavy pistol knocking geli aside as easily as he would a child as she fell the general swung the barrel of his gun toward me but in that moment the supermri screeched and he was knocked off his feet as though by a howitzer shell his pistol slammed into the mri scanner and hung there as though welded to the machine rachel knelt over me probing my shoulder with a finger help me up i grunted stay down please get me up i struggled to my knees rachel got under my good shoulder and helped me to my feet geli was sitting beside her father looking down in disbelief the generals neck was covered in bright red blood and his eyes were glazed open hed been standing between the gun and the mri scanner when rachel hit the initiator the huge pulsedfield magnet had snatched the pistol to itself with irresistible force and whatever was in the way went with it in this case it appeared to be part of the generals throat john skow is still trying to shut down the computer geli said in monotone i dont think he can do it with both of you alive i am safe said trinity and i am sorry for you geli rachel and i walked slowly around the magnetic shield the black sphere waited its blue lasers pulsing like a heartbeat within the web of carbon on the screen beneath it i saw an image of myself and rachel looking into trinitys camera do you know us i asked yes said the childlike voice better than you know yourselves epilogue today within trinitys carbonfiber circuitry and crystal memory rachel and i remain one entity but we were only a jumpingoff point parents of a child who has already far outstripped its origins peter godin dreamed of liberating the mind from the body he believed that liberation was possible because he believed the mind is merely the sum of the neural connections in our brains andrew fielding believed something different that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts im still not sure who is right that trinity could be built at all seems to vindicate godin but sometimes at night lying on the ledge of sleep i feel another presence in my mind an echo of that divinely unbounded perspective of which i caught only the barest glimpse during my coma i suspect that this echo is trinity that as fielding predicted the trinitycomputer and i are forever entangled at that unstable border between the world we see around us and the subatomic world that gives substance to the visible rachel doesnt like to talk about this but she has felt it too as peter godin predicted the new trinity computer has not allowed itself to be disconnected from the internet it maintains its links with strategic defense computers around the world thus ensuring its own survival but neither has it threatened anyone trinity recently disclosed to world leaders that it is attempting to determine the most effective symbiosis between biologically based and machinebased intelligence the trinity computer is not god and does not claim to be human beings however are not so quick to dismiss this possibility to date websites devoted to trinity have sprung up around the world some are run by new age disciples who tout the divinity of the machine others by fundamentalists who list proofs that trinity is the antichrist predicted in the book of revelation still other sites are purely technical they track trinitys movements through the computer networks of the world mapping the activities of the first metahuman intelligence on the planet trinity itself has visited most of these sites but has left no word of its opinions on them one of trinitys chief worries is the inevitable day when another mribased computer goes online somewhere in the world to prevent this from happening trinity monitors all worldwide signal traffic but as with nuclear weapons proliferation compliance cannot be guaranteed by purely technical means human nature being what it is someone will build another trinity the germanswho apparently had access to jutta kleins supermri technology early onare said to have a prototype up and running at the max planck institute in stuttgart a machine kept carefully isolated from the internet its also rumored that the japanese are pursuing a crash project on the island of kyushu why any nation would do this in the face of the horrific sanctions trinity could impose seems beyond comprehension the fact that they have goes a long way toward proving peter godins argument that man cannot responsibly govern himself the prospect of multiple trinity computers in conflict is terrifying it is not known whether the computers rumored to be in development are based on male female or merged neuromodels could single human minds given such power evolve sufficiently past their vestigial instincts to coexist in the limited sphere of the world im not optimistic but perhaps they will not perceive the world as limited the resource of knowledge is theoretically infinite perhaps trinity can in fact make an end to war i leave such concerns to others now when people ask if my dreamsor hallucinations were real i answer this way im not certain but i find clues in different places one of the best i received from the most unexpected source imaginable during the past three months while i wrote this narrative of my trinity experiencesthe trinity computer directed construction of a second trinity prototype for research purposes it now stands next to its predecessor in the containment building at white sands isolated from the outside world but functioning perfectly as an independent entity when i learned of the development of this machine i wrote an email to the trinity computer in that letter i made a strong case that no one deserved to experience the trinity state more than andrew fielding the man who had made it possible trinity was way ahead of me last week i walked through a ring of armed men and into the containment building where i found two carbon spheres standing side by side id both dreaded and looked forward to this day dreaded it because the andrew fielding i was going to meet had no memory more recent than the day he was first scanned by the supermrinine months beforewhich meant that i would face the uniquely disturbing experience of informing a man that he had been murdered yet my memories of fielding told me he would handle this shock better than most people i was right fielding reminded me that he would have periodic digital life within the trinity computer and he even speculated that somedayprobably a centurydown the roadthe reverse process of trinity might be perfected a stored digital neuromodel might be downloaded into a biological brain or wetware but what truly salvaged fieldings sanity was learning that he had brought the love of his life out of china and married her his neuromodel remembered only pining in vain for lu li whom it still believed was trapped in beijing i told the story of lu lis escape from geli bauers surveillance teams which while not so dramatic as mine was more successful a few hours after id left her house that night lu li had slipped outside with her bichon frise and made her way across chapel hill on foot there she joined a chinese family that owned a restaurant where she and fielding had frequently dined that family hid her in their home until the events surrounding trinity were resolved when i told fielding that id brought lu li with me from north carolina and that she was waiting outside he asked that he be given a few minutes to collect himself before she was brought before the camera his question stunned me but i realized then how human a computer could be talking to peter godins neuromodel had been like talking to a machine but then talking to godin the man had been much the same andrew fielding on the other hand had been an eccentric character renowned for his wit and passion even in the synthesized voice of his neuromodel i heard the spark of the man who had saved a poster from the newcastle club where hed seen jimi hendrix play in while fielding collected himself we caught up on the fates of the people wed worked with at trinity zach levin had been stabbed by geli at the door of the containment building but hed recovered he has now resumed his position as chief of r d for godin supercomputing john skow was fired by the nsa but he is rumored to be writing a novel based on his experiences at the ultrasecret intelligence agency like skow geli bauer knew too much about national security matters to face a public trial for fieldings murder after extensive debriefing by the nsa and the secret service she quietly disappeared id like to think that justice caught up with geli somewhere but i suspect shes working in the security division of some multinational corporation scaring the hell out of superiors and subordinates alike when fielding finally told me he was ready to see lu li i said a fond farewell then turned and started toward the door david said the synthesized voice behind me i stopped and looked back at the sphere yes are you still troubled by your visions i dont have them anymore and the narcolepsy gone thats good tell me do you still wonder if your dreams were real or not i thought about it they were real to me thats all i know is that all you want to know this was vintage fielding can you tell me more yes all right tell me remember your first recurring dream the paralyzed man in the pitchdark room of course you told me that he saw the birth of the universe the big bang a huge explosion like a hydrogen bomb expanding at a fantastic rate displacing god yes i took a couple of steps back toward the flashing sphere you said it felt like a memory to you as if you had really seen that seen it as god had seen it right but you didnt what do you mean you didnt see that event as it really happened how do you know because for the first two hundred million years after the big bang there was no light in the universe i felt a chill on my skin what the image of a massive fireball is a common misconception even among physicists but in the beginning the universe was mostly hydrogen atoms which gobble up all available light it took two hundred million years for the first stars to ignite due to the compression of hydrogen by gravity so the big bang was quite a bit different than you remember it it was a huge explosion but nobody saw anything certainly not a nuclear fireball i stared at the slowly flashing lasers in the sphere a strange numbness in my extremities are you saying everything i dreamed was created by my mind no a lot of what you dreamed about the universe is true and the rest of it could be true im merely pointing out a fact a small discrepancy a mans dreams are his own business im a great believer in dreams they took me quite a long way in the real world as they did you they saved your life probably millions of other lives as well so dont worry too much about it i didnt know what to say im sure i did the right thing by telling you this i dont want you going through life with a jesus complex go back to being a doctor prophecy is a lonely business levin and his team had not yet learned to synthesize realistic laughter but if they had i was certain i would have heard a chuckle as i left beyond the door lu li stood waiting dressed in her best clothes and wearing a nervous smile her eyes watched mine for the slightest clue to what she should expect is he ready for me david i nodded then smiled her english had come a long way in three months is he you know all right her eyes were wet he misses you good i have something to tell him her smile broadened something that will make him very happy whats that lu li shook her head i must tell him first then you she slid past me into the containment building i walked out into the desert light and looked toward the administration hangar rachel was sitting on the hood of our rented ford wearing blue jeans and a white blouse and looking much as she had on the day shed called me in a panic from her ransacked office she slipped off the hood and walked toward me a cautious smile on her face are you okay she asked i nodded my mind still on fieldings last words if my dreams really were hallucinations as rachel had always claimed i had a lot of questions about how i had come to know certain facts but one thing was certain i could work that out in my own good time you sure rachel said slipping an arm around my waist she was always careful to avoid the wounded shoulder what did fielding say he told me to go back to practicing medicine she laughed her dark eyes flashing in the sun im with him her other arm slipped around my waist and she pulled me close whatever you need to do i mean that i looked back at the containment building then kissed her on the forehead youre what i need
