jack higgins sheba in bc the roman general aelius gallus tried to conquer southern arabia and succeeded only in losing most of his army in the awesome region known as the empty quarter the rubh al khali amongst the survivors was a greek adventurer named alexias centurion in the tenth legion who walked out of the desert carrying with him a secret of the ancient world as astonishing as king solomons mines a secret that was lost for two thousand years until berlin march one as rain drifted across berlin in a great curtain on the final evening of march a black mercedes limousine moved along wilhelmstrasse towards the new reich chancellery which had only opened in january hitler had given them a year to complete the project his orders had been obeyed with two weeks to spare admiral wilhelm canaris chief of military intelligence the abwehr leaned forward and wound down the window so that he could obtain a better view he shook his head incredible do you realize hans that the frontage on vossstrasse alone is a quarter of a mile long the young man who sat next to him was his aide a luftwaffe captain named hans ritter he had an iron cross second and first class and was handsome enough until he turned his head and the dreadful burn scar was visible on his right cheek and there was a walking stick on the floor at his feet the unfortunate result of his having been shot down by an american volunteer pilot while flying with the german condor legion in the spanish civil war with all those pillars herr admiral the marble its more like some marvel of the ancient world instead of a symbol of the new order canaris shrugged and wound up the window everything passes hans even the third reich although our beloved fiihrer has given us a thousand years he took a cigarette from his case and ritter gave him a light as always slightly alarmed at the mocking in the older mans voice as you say herr admiral yes its a bizarre thought isnt it one day people could be wandering around whats left of the chancellery tourists just like they inspect the ruins of the temple of luxor in egypt saying i wonder what they were like ritter was thoroughly uncomfortable now as the mercedes drove through the gilded gates into a court of honour and moved towards the steps leading up to the massive entrance if the herr admiral could give me an idea of why weve been called i havent the slightest notion and its me he wants to see not you hans i simply want you on hand if anything unusual turns up shall i wait in the car ritter asked as they pulled up at the bottom of the steps no you can wait in reception much more comfortable and youll be able to feast on the new art forms of the third reich vulgar but sustaining the kriegsmarine petty officer who was his driver ran round to open the door canaris got out and waited courteously for ritter who had considerably more difficulty his left leg was false from the knee down but once on his feet he moved quite well with the aid of his stick and they went up the steps together the ss guards were troops of the leibstandarte adolf hitler and wore black dress uniform and full white leather harness they saluted smartly as canaris and ritter passed inside the hall was truly remarkable with mosaic floor doors seventeen feet high and great eagles carrying swastikas in their claws a young hauptsturmfuhrer in dress uniform sat at a gold desk two orderlies standing behind he jumped to his feet herr admiral the fiihrer has asked for you twice my dear hoffer i didnt get his summons until half an hour ago canaris said not that that will do me any good this is my aide captain ritter look after him for me of course herr admiral hoffer nodded to one of the orderlies take the herr admiral to the fiihrers reception suite the orderly set off at a sharp pace and canaris went after him hoffer came round the desk and said to ritter spain yes ritter tapped his false foot i could still fly but they wont let me what a pity hoffer said and led him over to the seating area youll miss the big show you think it will come ritter asked easing himself down and taking out his cigarette case dont you and by the way no smoking fiihrers express order damn ritter said for his pain was constant and cigarettes helped sorry hoffer said sympathetically but coffee we do have and its the best he turned went to his desk and picked up the phone when the guard opened the enormous door to hitlers study canaris was surprised at the number of people in the room there were the three commandersinchief goering for the luftwaffe brauchitsch for the army and raeder for the kriegsmarine there was himmler von ribbentrop generals like jodl keitel and haider there was a heavy silence and heads turned as canaris entered now that the admiral has deigned to join us we can begin hitler said and i will be brief as you know the british today gave the poles an unconditional guarantee of their full support in the event of war goering said will the french follow my fiihrer undoubtedly hitler told him but they will do nothing when it comes to the crunch you mean invade poland haider who was chief of staff at okw said what about the russians they wont interfere let us say there are negotiations in hand and leave it at that so gentlemen my will is fixed in this matter you will prepare case white the invasion of poland on september the ist there were shocked gasps but my fiihrer that only gives us six months colonelgeneral von brauchitsch protested ample time hitler told him if there are those who disagree speak now there was a profound silence good then get to work gentlemen you may all leave except for you herr admiral they all filed out and canaris stood there waiting while hitler looked out of the window at the rain finally he turned the british and the french will declare war but they wont do anything do you agree absolutely canaris said we smash poland wrap things up in a few weeks once its done what is the point of the british and french continuing theyll sue for peace and if not hitler shrugged then ill have case yellow imple mented well invade belgium holland france and drive the english into the sea theyll come to their senses then after all they are not our natural enemies i agree canaris said having said that it occurs to me that i should demonstrate to our english friends as soon as possible that i do mean business canaris cleared his throat exactly what do you have in mind my fiihrer hitler gestured towards the huge map of the world that hung on the far wall come over here herr admiral and let me show you when canaris returned to the reception hall at the chancellery an hour later hoffer was seated behind his desk with the two orderlies there was no sign of ritter the ss captain stood up and came to greet him herr admiral my aide canaris asked hauptman ritter was badly in need of a smoke he went back to your car my thanks canaris said til find my own way he went out of the huge doors and stood at the top of the steps buttoning his greatcoat looking out at the rain he went down the steps and had the rear door of the limousine open before his driver realized what was happening and climbed in beside ritter my office he called to the driver then closed the glass partition ritter started to stub out his cigarette as they drove away and canaris sat back never mind just give me one of those things i need it ritter got his cigarette case out and offered a light is everything all right herr admiral i saw them all leave i was worried the fiihrer hans gave us his personal order to invade poland on september the ist my god ritter said case white exactly he has been negotiating with the russians who will do a deal theyll let us get on with it in return for a slice of eastern poland and the british oh theyll declare war and im sure the french will go along the fiihrer however is convinced they will do nothing on the western front and for once i agree theyll sit there while we wrap up poland and his feeling is that once its an accomplished fact we can all get round the negotiating table and get back to the status quo britain as he informed us is not our natural enemy do you agree herr admiral hes right enough there but the british are a stubborn lot hans and chamberlain is not popular since munich his own people despise him canaris stubbed out his cigarette if there was a change at the top churchill for example he shrugged who knows and what would we do implement case yellow invade the low countries and france and drive whatever army the british had brought across the channel into the sea there was a pause before ritter said could this be done i think so hans as long as the americans dont interfere under the fiihrers inspired leadership we have reoccupied the rhineland absorbed austria and czechoslovakia plus one or two bits and pieces i have no doubt well win in poland but afterwards herr admiral the french the british ah well now we come down to why the fiihrer kept me back when everyone else left a special project herr admiral you could say that he wants us to blow up the suez canal on the ist of september the day we invade poland ritter in the act of snapping his cigarette case open said good god canaris took the case from him and helped himself he got the idea from this colonel rommel who commanded the fiihrers escort battalion for the occupation of the sudetenland he thinks highly of colonel rommel and with reason and there is a certain mad logic to the idea i mean the suez canal is the direct link to the british empire cut it and all shipping to india the far east and australia would have to go by way of africa and the cape of good hope the military implications speak for themselves but herr admiral how on earth would we get men and equipment into the area canaris shook his head no hans youve got it wrong were not talking direct military action here were talking sabotage the fiihrer wants us the abwehr to blow up the suez canal on the day we invade poland put the damn thing out of action close it down so fully that it would take a year or so to open it again what a coup it would shock the world ritter said more to the point it would shock the british to the core and make them realize we mean business at least thats the way our beloved fiihrer sees it canaris sighed of course how the hell we are to accomplish this is another matter but well have to come up with something at least on paper and thats where you come in hans i see herr admiral the limousine pulled in to the kerb outside the abwehr offices at tirpitz ufer the petty officer hurried round to open the door for canaris and ritter scrambled out after him the young luftwaffe officer was frowning slightly canaris said are you all right tine herr admiral its just that theres something stirring at the back of my mind something that could suit our purposes really canaris smiled and led the way up the steps pausing at the door well that is good news but sooner rather than later hans remember that and he led the way inside it was perhaps an hour later and canaris was seated at his desk working his way through a mass of papers his two favourite dachshunds asleep in their basket in the corner when there was a knock at the door and ritter entered with a file in one hand and a rolledup map under his arm he limped forward leaning on his stick could i have a word herr admiral on this suez canal venture canaris sat back so soon hans as i said there was something at the back of my mind and when i got to my office i remembered a report i received last month from a professor of archaeology here at the university professor otto muller hes recently returned from southern arabia intends to go back there soon he needs additional funding and what has this to do with us canaris asked as the herr admiral knows all german citizens working abroad have to make a report to us here at abwehr headquarters of anything of an unusual nature that they may have come across so allow me herr admiral ritter went across to the map board on the far wall unrolled the map under his arm and pinned it in place it showed egypt and the suez canal the whole of southern arabia the red sea and the gulf of aden as you can see herr admiral the british in aden the yemen and then various arab states along the gulf of aden and the indian ocean dhofar and the oman well canaris asked examining the map you will notice dahrein a port on the gulf coast this is where muller was working from it belongs to spain rather like goa on the indian coast the spaniards have been there for four hundred years i can imagine what the place is like canaris said north across the border with saudi arabia is the rubh al khali the empty quarter one of the most awesome deserts on earth and this is where muller was operating yes herr admiral but what on earth was he doing there are remains of many ancient civilizations in the area inscriptions and graffiti on the rocks muller is an expert on ancient languages he uses a latex solution to take impressions which are brought back here to the university and what has this to do with the suez canal hans bear with me herr admiral the area around there called saba has long been associated with the queen of sheba my god canaris said and returned to his desk now its the bible he took a cigarette from a silver box i always understood that except for the biblical reference there has never been actual proof that she existed oh she did exist i can assure you ritter said there was a cult of the arabian goddess asthar their equivalent of venus in legend the queen of sheba was high priestess of that cult and built a temple out there in the empty quarter in legend canaris said muller has found what he thinks could be the ruins of it herr admiral naturally he kept his discovery quiet such an event would rival the discovery of tutankhamens tomb in the valley of the kings archaeologists would descend from all over the world as i said he returned to berlin for funding but made a full description of his find in his report to abwehr canaris frowned but where is this leading this place is unknown herr admiral hidden out there in the desert used for supplies an aircraft it could provide a base for a strike against the canal canaris got up and went to the map he examined it and turned a thousand miles at least from that area to the suez canal more like twelve hundred herr admiral but im sure i could find a way canaris smiled you usually can hans all right bring muller to see me when herr admiral why now of course tonight i intend to sleep in the office anyway he returned to his papers and ritter went out professor otto muller was a small balding man with a wizened face tanned to the shade of old leather by constant exposure to the desert sun when ritter ushered him into the office to meet canaris muller smiled nervously exposing goldcapped teeth canaris said that will do hans ritter went out and canaris lit a cigarette so professor a remarkable find tell me about it muller stood there like a nervous schoolboy i was lucky herr admiral ive been working in the shabwa area for some time and one night an old bedouin staggered into my camp dying of thirst and fever i nursed him back to life i see theyre a strange people cant bear to be in debt so he repaid me by telling me where shebas temple was payment indeed tell me about it i first saw it as an outcrop of reddish stone out there in the vastness of the empty quarter the herr admiral must understand that there are sand dunes out there that are hundreds of feet high remarkable as i got closer we entered a gorge i had two bedouin with me as guards we had journeyed by camel there was a flat plain very hardbaked then a gorge a broad avenue of pillars and the temple tell me about that which muller did talking for a good halfhour while canaris listened intently finally the admiral nodded fascinating captain ritter tells me you made an excellent report to abwehr i hope i know my duty herr admiral im a party member indeed canaris observed drily then you will no doubt be pleased to return to this place with suitable funding and do what you are told to do this is a project the fiihrer himself is interested in muller drew himself up at your orders herr admiral good canaris pressed a button on his desk well keep you informed ritter entered herr admiral wait outside professor canaris said and waited until muller had gone out he seems harmless enough but i still have my doubts hans if you used this place as a base it would require a flight of say twelve hundred miles to the canal and what real damage could one bomber do in fact do we have a plane that could make the flight ive already had a thought ritter said but id like to explore it further before sharing it with you canaris frowned is this serious business hans i believe it could be herr admiral so be it canaris nodded i dont need to tell you to squeeze muller dry details of this dahrein placj how the spanish run it and so on at least theyre on our side which could be useful til see to it sir at your soonest hans a feasibility study ill give you three days ritter turned and limped out and canaris went back to his papers two on wednesday morning canaris after sleeping once again on the little military bed in his office was in the bathroom shaving when there was a knock at the door come in he called its me herr admiral ritter replied and your breakfast canaris wiped his face and went out to the aroma of good coffee and found an orderly arranging a tray on his desk ritter standing by the window dismissed canaris said and picked up his cup as the orderly went out join me hans ive already had breakfast herr admiral you must have risen early how conscientious of you not really herr admiral its just that i find difficulty sleeping canaris was immediately all sympathy my dear hans how stupid of me im afraid i often forget just how difficult life must be for you the fortunes of war herr admiral he laid a file on the desk as canaris buttered some toast the admiral looked up whats this operation sheba herr admiral you mean youve come up with a solution i believe so you think this thing could be done not only could it be done herr admiral i think it should be done really canaris poured coffee into the spare cup then i insist that you have a cigarette and drink that while i see what youve got here ritter did as he was told and limped across to the window the rd of april soon it would be easter and yet it rained like a bad day in november his leg hurt but he was damned if he was going to take a morphine pill unless he really had to he swallowed the coffee and lit a cigarette behind him he heard canaris lift the telephone the reich chancellery the fiihrers suite the admiral said and added after a moment good morning canaris i must see the fiihrer yes most urgent there was a longer pause and then he said excellent eleven oclock ritter turned herr admiral excellent hans this plan of yours you can come with me and tell the man yourself ritter had never ventured beyond the main reception area at the chancellery before and what he saw was breathtaking not only the huge doors and bronze eagles but the marble gallery which was four hundred and eighty feet long the fiihrers special pride as it was twice as long as the hall of mirrors at versailles when they were admitted to the fiihrers enormous study they found hitler seated at his desk he looked up something important i trust i think so my fiihrer canaris said this is my aide captain ritter hitler took in the scarred face the stick the medals rose came round the table and took ritters hand as a soldier i salute you he went back to his chair and ritter overwhelmed stammered what can i say my fiihrer canaris intervened the question of the suez canal captain ritter has come up with an extraordinary plan in fact what is the most extraordinary thing about it is its simplicity he laid the file on hitlers desk operation sheba hitler leaned back arms folded in an inimitable gesture til read it later tell me captain ritter ritter licked dry lips well my fiihrer it all started with a professor of archaeology at the university called muller and an extraordinary find he made in southern arabia fascinating hitler said his eyes glowing for his passion for architecture was intense id give anything to see that temple he sat back but go on captain you use the site as a base but how does that advance the cause the essence of the plan is its absurd simplicity a single plane a bomber trying to attack the canal is an absurdity one can never be certain of accuracy so hitler said there is a twoengined amphibian called the catalina an american plane that can drop wheels and land on the ground as well as water it has an extraordinary cruising range better than sixteen hundred miles carrying a bomb load of one and a half thousand pounds impressive hitler said and how would such a plane be used as i say absurdly simple my fiihrer the plane lands at our site in the desert and takes on not bombs but mines it flies to egypt and lands on the suez canal itself there the crew offload many mines which will drift on the current i would suggest somewhere near kantra as a good spot the crew will of course sink the catalina leaving on board a large quantity of our latest explosive helicon which will do an enormous amount of damage to the canal itself i need hardly point out that the mines floating down will meet ships travelling north from lake timsah i think we may count on several sinking and thus causing a further blockage there was silence for a while as hitler sat there staring into space and then he smacked a fist into his palm brilliant and as you say absurdly simple he frowned but this plane this catalina can you get hold of one there is one available for sale in lisbon my fiihrer i thought we could buy it and start our own airline in bahrein a spanish company naturally im sure there would be plenty of coastal trade hitler got up came round the desk and clapped him on the shoulders quite i like this man herr admiral put his plan into force at once you have my full authorization my fiihrer canaris led the way to the door turned and forced himself to give the nazi salute lets get out of here he whispered to ritter turned and opened the door as they went along the marble gallery canaris said you certainly covered yourself with glory there naturally ill authorize the necessary funding for the catalina but it occurs to me that there might be a problem regarding a suitable crew of course there is no reason why germans should not be flying for a spanish airline but much better if they were spanish ritter said and where would you procure them the ranks of the ss herr admiral they have many spanish volunteers of course canaris said it would be perfect i have already tracked down a suitable pilot a man with much combat experience in the spanish civil war he is at present employed as a courier pilot by the ss im seeing him later this morning at gatow airfield good ill come with you and see for myself canaris said and led the way down the marble stairs carlos romero was twentyseven a saturnine rather handsome young man son of a wealthy madrid wine merchant he had learned to fly at sixteen had joined the spanish air force at the earliest possible moment and trained as a fighter pilot when the civil war came he had opted for franco not because he was a dedicated fascist but because thats what people of his class did hed shot down eleven planes and had the time of his life hed even flown with the german condor legion suddenly it was all over and he didnt want that and then hed got a whisper that the ss were taking spanish volunteers a pilot with his record they had snapped up without hesitation employing him mainly on courier duties ferrying highranking officers so here he was at the controls of a small stork spotter plane a thousand feet above berlin an ss brigadefuhrer behind him he called the tower at gatow received permission to land and drifted down towards the airfield bored out of his skull mother of god he whispered softly in spanish there must be something better than this there was of course and he found it when he went into the mess and took off his flying jacket revealing a welltailored ss uniform in field grey he had a small spanish shield on his left shoulder and wore the spanish order of merit for gallantry in the field and an iron cross first class for his exploits with the condor legion he was aware of canaris first because of his high rank although he did not recognize him but ritter he did and went forward with genuine pleasure hans ritter by all thats holy ritter got up to greet him leaning on his stick and shook hands you look well carlos spain seems a long time ago i heard about your leg im sorry ritter said admiral canaris head of the abwehr romero got his heels together and saluted an honour herr admiral join us herr hauptsturmfuhrer canaris waved to the mess steward champagne bollinger for preference and three glasses he turned to romero you are a courier pilot i understand do you like that to be frank herr admiral these milk runs of mine bore me to death then well have to see if we can find something more rewarding for you canaris said as the champagne arrived tell him hans romero finished reading the file and closed it his face was pale and excited as he looked up canaris said are you interested interested romero accepted a cigarette from ritter and his hand shook herr admiral im willing to go down on my knees and beg canaris laughed no need for that ritter said the catalina would not present you with a problem good god no an excellent aircraft to fly and what about a crew romero sat back thinking about it i could manage with a second pilot and an engineer and where would we find them canaris asked right here in the spanish legion of the ss like myself herr admiral i can think of two suitable candidates right now javier noval a fine pilot and juan conde an aircraft engineer of genius ritter made a note of the names excellent ill have them transferred to abwehr duties along with yourself what about the explosives and the mines romero asked well have them delivered by some suitable freighter ritter told him there should be no problem in a place like dahrein you will naturally build up your credentials during the runup to september coastal trade freight that kind of thing romero nodded slowly but i do have a suggestion when the time comes we could make the transfer of the mines at sea i could land beside the freighter with no problem from there a direct flight to the base would simplify the whole thing excellent canaris stood up i think you should meet our friend professor muller you can come back to town with us drop me off on the way and then continue to the university from now on you deal with captain ritter in all things at your orders herr admiral good canaris said and he turned and led the way out mullers department at the university was housed in a vast echoing hall filled with artefacts of every description egyptian mummies statues from rome and greece amphorae retrieved from ancient wrecks at the bottom of the mediterranean it was all there ritter and romero browsed while muller sat at his desk in his glass office and read the operation sheba file finally he got up and went to join them ritter turned well what do you think muller was highly nervous tried to smile and failed miserably a wonderful idea herr hauptman but i wonder if i have the qualifications you need i mean im not a trained spy im just an archaeologist this will be done professor and by direct order of the fiihrer does this give you a problem good heavens no mullers face was ashen romero clapped him on the shoulder dont worry professor ill look after you ritter said thats settled then when hauptsturmfuhrer romero leaves from lisbon in the catalina you go with him so make your preparations ill be in touch ritter limped away his stick tapping the marble as they moved along the hall to the entrance romero said to him hes a nervous little bastard ritter hell come to heel and thats all thats important they went out of the main entrance and stood at the top of the steps til make arrangements for the immediate transfer of you and noval and conde today youll leave for lisbon tomorrow in civilian clothes naturally ill arrange priority seats on the lufthansa flight as regards the purchase of the catalina our man at the german legation will be your banker once youve checked the plane out report back to me on the embassy secure phone ill expect to hear from you by thursday at the latest mother of god but you dont hang about hans do you i could never see the point ritter said and started down the steps to the mercedes the river tagus as someone once said is the true reason for the existence of lisbon with its wide bays and many sheltered anchorages it was from here that the great flying boats the mighty clippers left for america and it was here attached to two buoys about three hundred yards out to sea from the waterfront that carlos romero found the catalina he had arrived at the dock close to the avenida da india together with javier noval and juan conde ten minutes early for the appointment with the owners agent a man called da gama they stood at the edge of the dock looking out at the amphibian it looks good to me said noval a tough young man around romeros age who wore an old leather flying jacket conde was older than either of them thirtyfive and stocky he also wore a flying jacket and looked across at the catalina shading his eyes from the sun what do you think juan can you handle it just try me a motor boat nosed in to the dock and a man in brown suit and panama hat waved from the stern senor romero he called in spanish fernando da gama come aboard they went down the steps and joined him and he nodded to the boatman who took the motorboat away she looks good da gama suggested she looks bloody marvellous romero told him whats the story a local shipping line had the idea of regular flights down to the island of madeira purchased the cataliria in the united states last year it has performed magnificently but they wanted to concentrate on passengers and the capacity is limited too limited for there to be any money in it may i ask what your requirement would be romero stayed very close to the truth general freight in the red sea and gulf of aden flying as far as goa perhaps its a new venture i know that area da gama said the catalina would be perfect they bumped alongside a small floating dock and as the boatman killed his motor noval and conde grabbed a line and tied up da gama opened the cabin door and led the way in romero looked into the cockpit with conscious pleasure took one of the pilots seats and reached for the control column noval took the other seat and examined the instrument panel what a beauty da gama conde at his shoulder opened a file ill just give you approximate dimensions length sixtythree feet height twenty wingspan a hundred and four the twin engines are pratt and whitney twelve hundred horsepower each cruising speed a hundred and eighty miles an hour remarkably long range without freight it is possible to fly for four thousand miles before the need to refuel i cant think of another aircraft that could do this neither can i romero told him and got up you can take us back now as they scrambled into the motor boat da gama tried the usual tack of course a number of people are interested the motor boat pulled away and romero said drop the sales pitch my friend just draw up the contract ill give you my lawyers name we sign tomorrow and youll receive a cheque for your asking price satisfied da gama looked astonished but of course senor romero took out a cigarette and accepted a light from noval he looked back at the catalina and blew out a long plume of smoke looks like were in business boys he said baron oswald von hoyningenheune was minister to the german legation in lisbon an aristocrat and career diplomat of the old school he was no nazi and like most of his staff was thankful to be as far away from berlin as possible initially wary of the strange spaniard who was a hauptsturmfuhrer in the ss and resigned to following orders from berlin he had been pleasantly surprised had taken to romero he rose to greet him now as the spaniard entered his office my dear romero it went well couldnt have been better da gama will be in touch with the lawyer you gave me you provide the funding and we conclude tomorrow ill need to speak to captain ritter at abwehr headquarters at once by the way of course the baron reached for the red secure phone on his desk and placed the call it shouldnt take long he stood up cognac why not romero lit a cigarette and sat on one of the sofas the baron handed him a glass and sat opposite all very intriguing this business and also highly secret but of course im not prying in fact id rather not know he raised his glass but ill drink to your success anyway at that moment the red phone rang romero said with your permission but of course ill leave you to it the baron went out and romero picked up the phone hans is that you who else ritter said how did it go perfect romero told him a superb aircraft i couldnt be more pleased tell the admiral were on our way ritter knocked on the door and went in canaris was drinking tea one of the dachshunds on his lap he looked up what is it hans romero has just spoken to me from lisbon herr admiral the catalina is perfect and the sale will be concluded tomorrow excellent canaris nodded do an additional report bringing everything up to date and ill make an appointment for us to see the fiihrer at once herr admiral as ritter limped to the door canaris called oh and hans yes herr admiral well take muller with us the summons came sooner than they had expected and took them to the chancellery for an appointment at ten oclock that night they picked up muller at the univer sity on the way and the news that he was to meet the fiihrer shocked him completely when they reached the reception area of hitlers suite the aide on duty rose to greet them i understand you have a report for the fiihrer herr admiral thats right canaris said the aide held out his hand he would like to read it before seeing you of course canaris gave him the file the aide opened the door and went in canaris nodded to the other two and they sat down muller was trembling slightly and canaris said are you all right for gods sake how do you expect me to feel admiral this is the fiihrer were talking about what do i say as little as possible canaris told him and added with some irony remember hes a great man and behave accordingly the door opened and the aide appeared gentlemen our fiihrer will see you now the room was a place of shadows and hitler sat at the enormous desk with only the light of a single brass lamp he was reading the file closed it and looked up still brilliant herr admiral an absolutely firstclass job captain ritter really deserves all the credit no herr admiral i think after all this that major ritter would be more appropriate in fact i warn you that i could well steal him for my own staff he stood up and ritter said the obvious thing you do me too much honour my fiihrer hitler came round the corner of his desk and approached muller professor muller isnt it an amazing discovery and you sacrifice it for the sake of the reich and muller shaking almost uncontrollably said exactly the right thing for you my fiihrer for you hitler clapped him on the shoulders a great day is coming gentlemen the greatest in germanys history he walked slowly away and the desk lamp threw his shadow across the huge map of the world he stood there arms folded you may go gentlemen canaris nodded to the other two jerked his head and led the way out later after dropping muller off at the university canaris told the driver to take them back to tirpitz ufer as they turned into a side street they came to a cafe on the corner windows lighted e canaris cleaned forward stop here he turned to i ritter a nightcap coffee and schnapps well toast your promotion major my pleasure herr admiral the cafe was almost deserted and the proprietor was overwhelmed he ushered them to a booth by the window and hurriedly took the order canaris pulled out his cigarette case and proffered it to ritter who took one and gave him a light he was pleased the admiral said and blew out smoke muller was a mess though hes not strong enough i agree ritter said we need a professional to back him up the proprietor brought coffee and schnapps on a tray and canaris waved him away youll have to find somebody an old abwehr hand somebody reliable no problem herr admiral you know this thing is so simple it could work canaris said and poured schnapps from the bottle into two glasses i agree ritter said canaris nodded theres only one problem and whats that herr admiral it wont win us this coming war my friend nothing can do that you see hans were all going straight to hell but heres to your promotion anyway he raised the glass of schnapps and drained it at a single swallow dahrein august three the wind blowing across the gulf from africa still carried some of the warmth of the day to kane as he stood on the deck of the launch listening there was no moon and yet the sky seemed to be alive to glow with the incandescence of millions of stars he breathed deeply inhaling the freshness and followed a school of flyingfish with his eyes as they curved out of the sea in a shower of phosphorescent water a door opened and light from the saloon momentarily flooded out as piroo the hindu deckhand came up the companionway with a mug of steaming coffee kane sipped some of it gratefully thats good the kantara is late tonight sahib piroo said kane nodded and checked his watch almost two am i wonder what the old devil ohara is playing at perhaps its the whisky again kane grinned more than likely as he finished his coffee piroo touched him on the arm i think she comes sahib kane listened intently at first he was conscious only of the slap of the waves against the hull of the launch and the whisper of the wind and then he became aware of a muffled gentle throbbing across the water in the distance he saw the green pinpoint of light that was the starboard navigation light of the kantara not before time he said softly he went into the wheelhouse and switched on the navigation lights and when he pressed the starter the engine coughed into life he waited until the steamer was almost upon them before he opened the throttle gently and took the launch forward on a course which would bring them together the old freighter was doing no more than two or three knots and piroo put out the fenders as kane took the launch in close a lascar appeared at the rail and tossed down a line which piroo quickly secured a rope ladder followed a moment later and kane cut the engines and went out on deck the high ruststreaked side of the kantara reared into the night the single stack a long black shadow above as he climbed the ladder kane wondered and not for the first time exactly what it was that kept this heap of scrapiron floating he scrambled over the rail and said in hindi wheres the captain the lascar shrugged in his cabin he quickly climbed a companionway to the upper deck and knocked on the door of the captains cabin there was no reply after a moment he opened it and went in the cabin was in darkness and the stench was appalling he fumbled for the light switch and turned it on ohara was on his bunk he lay on his back in singlet and pants mouth open exposing decaying yellow teeth empty whisky bottles rolled across the floor with the motion of the ship and kane wrinkled his nose in disgust and went out on deck another lascar was waiting for him the mate he say you go to bridge the man said kane crossed the deck quickly and climbed an iron ladder to the bridge guptas the mate was at the wheel his turbaned head disembodied in the light from the binnacle kane leaned in the doorway and lit a cigarette how long has he been like that guptas grinned ever since we left aden it should take him at least two days to sleep this one off what a way to run a ship kane said what happened this time anyway why didnt you call at dahrein on the runin from bombay as usual we had cargo for mombasa guptas told him after that aden skiros wasnt too pleased kane said i presume youve got the stuff all right guptas nodded they should be bringing it up now by the way we have a passenger this trip a passenger kane said incredulously on this tub an american woman guptas said she wanted to leave aden in a hurry we were the only ship available and the catalina wasnt due for a week kane flicked his cigarette in a glowing spiral into the night then i wont hang about no sense in waking her up she might get curious guptas nodded in agreement i think that would be wise a strange thing happened just before dawn yesterday what was that the catalina romeros catalina we saw it on the horizon about thirty miles out it landed beside some portuguese freighter they were offloading crates so whats the difference between that and what were doing now so romeros doing a little smuggling too kane shrugged weve all got to get by ill see you next month and he went down the ladder to the deck he leaned over the rail and watched two lascars lower an oil drum down to piroo on the deck of the launch a voice said quietly from behind do you happen to have a light he turned quickly she was rather tall and the smooth rounded face might have suggested weakness had it not been for the firm mouth she wore a scarf and a light duster coat he held out a match in his cupped hands rather late for a promenade round the deck she blew smoke out and leaned against the rail i couldnt sleep the facilities for passengers on this ship are strictly limited that i can believe a strange place to meet a fellowamerican he grinned we pop up everywhere these days she leaned over the rail and looked down at the launch thats your boat i presume he nodded im a deepsea fisherman out of bahrein got caught in a storm and ran out of fuel its lucky the kantara came along i suppose it is she said her perfume hung disturbingly in the air and for some reason he could think of nothing more to say and then piroo hailed him from the launch and he smiled til have to be going ships that pass in the night she said he went down the ladder quickly and piroo cast off the line the kantara pulled away from them at once and when he looked up he could see the woman in the yellow glare of the deck lights leaning over the rail watching them until they faded into the night he dismissed her from his mind for the moment because there were more important things to think of the twogallon oil can stood on the deck where piroo had left it kane checked it quickly and then went below to the saloon piroo had the air tank ready and kane stripped to his shorts and the hindu helped him on with it they went up on deck piroo vanished into the wheelhouse and emerged with a large powerful spotlamp on a long cable specially designed for underwater use which plugged into the boats lighting system a ring bolt had been welded to each end of the oil can and piroo threaded a manilla rope through them as kane pulled on his diving mask and gripped the mouthpiece of his breathing tube firmly between his teeth he took the lamp in one hand and vaulted over the side for a moment he paused to adjust the flow of oxygen and then he swam down in a long sweeping curve that brought him underneath the hull the sensation of being alone in a silent world of floating in space was somehow accentuated by the circumstances the water gleamed with a sort of phosphorescent fire all around him and transparent fish attracted by the lamp glowed in its light after a moment the oil can dropped down through the water he grabbed the manilla rope with one hand and quickly passed it through two more ring bolts set in the keel of the launch he turned from securing it and paused held by the wonder of the scene the sea seemed alive with fish incandescent glowing like candles in its depths a school of barracuda flashed by like silver streaks and then an eightfoot shark swung into the beam of the lamp and poised there watching him as it moved forward he pulled his breathing tube from his mouth emitting a stream of silvery bubbles the shark altered course with a flick of its tail and disappeared into the gloom he swam up to the surface quickly and piroo pulled him up over the low rail everything all right sahib kane nodded as he unstrapped the tank no trouble at all one shark and he was only trying to be playful the hindu grinned teeth flashing in the darkness and handed him a towel and kane went below the water had been surprisingly cold and he rubbed himself down briskly and then dressed when he went back on deck the wind was freshening and piroo brought him more coffee as he drank it kane caught a last glimpse of the kantaras navigation lights on the horizon and remembered the woman she had certainly been attractive and he wondered what she was doing on an old tub like the kantara there could be no satisfactory answer of course for a moment he seemed to catch a faint touch of her perfume on the night air he smiled wryly and going into the wheelhouse started the engines and took the launch forward into the night four they came into bahrein in the early afternoon as the launch rounded the curved promontory crowded with its white houses a twomasted dhow lateen sails bellying in the gulf breeze moved out of harbour on the long haul across the arabian sea to india the kantara was unloading at the jetty on the white curve of the beach fishermen sat patiently mending their nets and a few children played naked in the shallows kane cut the engines and signalled to piroo who was standing in the stern anchor ready in his hands it disappeared into the green waters of the harbour with a splash for a moment longer the launch glided forward and then with a gentle tug it came to a halt fifty or sixty yards from the crumbling stone jetty that formed the east side of the harbour piroo disappeared into the cabin and kane stepped out of the wheelhouse he lit a cigarette and walked slowly along to the stern where he stood with one foot on the brass rail the peak of his battered and saltstained cap pulled well forward to shield his eyes from the intense glare of the sun he was a tall powerful man in faded blue denims and sweatshirt his brown hair was bleached by the sun and badly needed cutting and there was a three days growth of beard on his chin the sundried skin of his face was drawn tightly over prominent cheekbones and his eyes were deepset in their sockets calm and expressionless always staring into the middle distance or beyond the next hill as if perpetually searching for something as he looked across the harbour a small rowing boat appeared from between two moored dhows the brawny arab who pulled on the oars was being urged on by a fat bearded official in crumpled khaki uniform and white headcloth there was a slight cough from behind and kane reached out a hand without turning round piroo passed him a large ginsling in which ice tinkled and said gently perhaps captain gonzalez will wish to search the boat sahib kane shrugged thats what hes paid for he sipped the drink slowly savouring its coldness with conscious pleasure and watched the boat approach as it bumped against the side of the launch gonzalez smiled up at him his face shiny with sweat a paper japanese fan fluttering in his right hand in a vain effort to keep the flies at bay kane grinned down at him looks as if the heats getting to you juan gonzalez shrugged and replied in perfect english only duty compelled me to put in an appearance on the quay in my official capacity when the mail boat came in from aden he mopped his face with a corner of his headcloth where are you from this time kane finished his drink and handed the glass to piroo who was still standing at his elbow mukalla he said i had some letters to deliver for marie ferret gonzalez kissed his fingers ah the delightful mademoiselle ferret we are privileged men here on earth a glimpse of paradise are you carrying any cargo kane shook his head we tried for a shark on the way back but he took half my line as well as the hook gonzalez raised a hand and rolled his eyes you americans so energetic and for what are you coming aboard to check kane said gonzalez shook his head would i insult a friend he waved to the oarsman to push off i hurry home to a tall drink and the cool hand of my wife kane watched the boat disappear amongst the mass of moored fishing dhows that floated a few yards from the beach after a while he tossed his cigarette down into the water and turned from the rail i think ill go for a swim he said get the deck swabbed down piroo afterwards you can go ashore to visit that girl of yours he went below to the cabin and changed quickly when he came back on deck he was wearing an old pair of khaki shorts and a corkhandled knife in leather sheath swung from the belt at his waist piroo was standing by the rail hauling vigorously on a rope and a moment later a large canvas bucket appeared he emptied its contents over the deck and threw it back into the water kane didnt bother with a diving mask he went past piroo on the run and dived cleanly over the rail at this point the harbour was some twenty feet deep and he swam down through the clear green water revelling in its coolness for a brief moment he hovered over the bottom and then he kicked against the white sand and started up when he had almost reached the surface he changed direction slightly until he was underneath the hull the twogallon oil can still hung suspended beneath the keel as he had left it he examined it and then quickly surfaced piroo was standing at the rail the canvas bucket in his hands kane nodded briefly took a deep breath and dived again when he reached the oil can he took out his knife and slashed the rope which secured it in place at that moment the canvas bucket bumped against his back and he pulled it towards him with his free hand and pushed the oil can inside he jerked twice on the rope and the bucket was hoisted smoothly to the surface he was in no hurry he swam down to the white sand of the harbour bottom again and then floated lazily upwards in a stream of sparkling bubbles when he surfaced and hauled himself over the rail the deck was deserted a towel was lying on top of the hatch neatly folded and waiting for him he quickly dried his body and as he went below he was rubbing his damp hair briskly piroo was squatting on the floor of the cabin the oil can was between his knees and he expertly prised open the lid with a chisel his hand disappeared inside and came out holding a bulky oilskin package he raised his face enquiringly shall i open sahib kane shook his head well let skiros have that pleasure after all hes paying better get rid of that can though the hindu took the can and went up on deck kane hefted the package in his hands for a second a slight frown on his face then he dropped it on to the table and went and lay on the bunk tiredness flooded through him in a sudden wave and he remembered that he hadnt slept for the past twentyfour hours he closed his eyes and relaxed there was the unmistakable bump of a boat against the side of the launch and piroo appeared in the doorway it is selim sahib for a moment kane sat on the edge of the bunk a frown on his face and then he slipped a hand under the pillow and took out a calibre colt automatic he pushed it into the waistband of his pants brushed past piroo and went up on deck a tall arab was climbing over the rail he was dressed in immaculate white robes and his headcloth was bound with cords of black silk cold eyes flashed in a swarthy face and his mouth was thin and twisted by an old scar which disappeared into the beard what the hell do you want kane demanded selim fingered the silver haft of the curved jambiya at his belt skiros sent me he said i have come for the package then you can bloody well go back to skiros and tell him to come himself kane said im particular who i have on my boat one day you will go too far selim said softly one day i may have to kill you im frightened to death the arab controlled his anger with difficulty the package kane pulled the colt from his waistband and cocked it get off my boat in the sudden dangerous silence which followed a cask boomed hollowly from across the harbour as a labourer rolled it along the wharf selims hand tightened over the hilt of his jambiya and kane took a quick pace forward lifted a foot and pushed him back over the low rail the two arab seamen who were sitting at the oars of the heavy rowing boat hastily pulled their master over the stern where he sprawled for a moment coughing up water sodden robes clinging to his body kane stood with a foot on the rail the colt held negligently in one hand for a moment selim glared up at him and then he snapped his fingers and the two oarsmen pushed off from the launch faces expressionless on the other side of the rusty freighter at the jetty a large threemasted dhow was moored which kane recognized as selims boat the farah the rowing boat moved slowly towards it and after watching for a few moments he turned from the rail piroo shook his head slowly and his face was troubled that was a bad thing to do sahib selim will not forget kane shrugged let me worry about that he yawned lazily as the tiredness took hold of him again i think ill sleep for a while let me know when skiros turns up piroo nodded obediently and squatted on the deck his back against the rail as kane went below he pushed the colt back under the pillow poured himself a drink and then lit a cigarette and went to the bunk he lay with his head against the pillow staring at the roof of the cabin watching the blue smoke twist and swirl in the current from the air conditioner and thought about selim he was well known in every port from the red sea to the persian gulf he traded in anything that would make him a profit gold arms even human beings that was the part of his activities which kane couldnt stomach there was still a heavy demand for slaves particularly female in most arab countries selim did his best to satisfy that demand his speciality was young girls kane wondered how selim would react if the farah happened to meet with an accident one dark night it could be simply arranged a charge of that plastic waterproof explosive he had used on the salvage job at mukalla would do the trick it was a pleasant thought his eyes closed and the darkness moved in on him he had slept for no more than an hour when a gentle pressure on his shoulder caused him to awaken piroo was standing by the bunk kane pushed himself up on one elbow what is it skiros the hindu nodded gravely he is waiting on the jetty sahib kane swung his legs to the floor stood up and stretched okay youd better bring him across in the dinghy he went up on deck the hindu at his heels skiros was standing on the edge of the jetty his face shaded by a large panama hat he was wearing a soiled white linen suit and a slight breeze lifted from the water against him moulding his grotesque figure as piroo dropped down into the dinghy and sculled rapidly towards him the greek raised his malacca cane and called cheerfully is it safe for me to come across ive already had one bath today kane waved a hand ill have a drink waiting for you he watched skiros negotiate the iron ladder pinned to the side of the jetty and safely step into the dinghy and then he went below he had just finished mixing two ginslings when the dinghy bumped against the hull of the launch a moment later skiros creaked heavily down the stairs and entered the cabin he flopped into a chair with a groan why the hell do you have to anchor your boat in the middle of the harbour why cant you tie up at one of the jetties like everybody else sweat stained his jacket in great patches and trickled along the folds of his fat face he produced a red silk handkerchief and mopped the worst of it away then removed his panama and proceeded to fan himself his hair was shiny with pomade and carefully combed and his tiny black eyes sparkled with cunning kane handed him one of the drinks you should know me by now i dont trust anybody in this damned town lets say i prefer to have a moat around me skiros shook his head crazy americans i shall never understand you he sipped appreciatively at his drink and then placed it carefully on the table i believe you had a little trouble with selim kane lit a cigarette i wouldnt call it trouble i simply tossed him off my boat since when has he been working for you anyway the greek shrugged and took his time over lighting an oily black cheroot i find him useful now and then he does the odd trip to india for me when its necessary i only sent him this afternoon because i was busy with something else kane frowned well dont send him again i dont like his smell i once picked up four slaves he dumped overboard three miles out in the gulf when a british gunboat was on his heels skiros shrugged and raised one hand in a gesture of submission all right so you dont like the way he makes his money but take a tip from me hes lost a lot of face over the way you treated him this afternoon from now on id be extremely careful if i were you kane pushed the oilskin package across the table lets get down to business skiros produced a clasp knife and proceeded to cut open the package carefully did you have any trouble kane shook his head i was at the rendezvous just after midnight the boat was late and ohara was drunk as usual guptas was in charge he told me something interesting what was that they saw the catalina about thirty miles out offloading from a portuguese freighter skiros laughed so romeros developed sticky fingers too that interesting what about customs when you came in kane shrugged no trouble there gonzalez didnt even come on board all that business with the oil can under the keel was a waste of time skiros shook his head nothing is a waste of time in this work one day when you least expect it he will take it into his head to perform his duties conscientiously he removed the outer wrappings of the package as he spoke and revealed a neat stack of indian rupees as skiros counted the bundles kane shook his head til never understand this racket gold smuggled into india rupees smuggled out skiros smiled its all a question of exchange in this modern world it is really so easy to make money one doesnt need to steal at all his face was shiny with sweat once more he held his hands lightly over the stack of banknotes and sighed ah my friend if you knew the effect money has on me when i moved here from goa six months ago id no idea what a gold mine the place is kane poured himself another drink why dont you try spending some of it once in a while skiros shrugged i started life on a mountain farm in northern greece the fields were more stones than soil my mother was an old woman at twentyfive and one year when the crops failed in the drought my two sisters died of starvation it is something i have never forgotten that is why i live only to make money i gloat over the size of my bank balance i begrudge every penny i have to pay out kane grinned while were on the subject of paying out ill take my cut now dollars as usual if you dont mind skiros laughed so that the flesh trembled on his huge body but i would never forget you my friend after all you are an essential part of my whole organization the kingpin i believe you call it skip the flattery and lets have the cash kane said skiros produced a bulging wallet and proceeded to count out hundreddollar bills his hands were sweating and he placed each bill reluctantly upon the table when he had reached twenty he paused then added five more there you are my friend he said we agreed on two thousand but i give you a bonus of five hundred dollars let no man say skiros does not reward good service kane swept the bills into the table drawer you old spider you know damned well most of it will come back to you either over the bar at your hotel or across the gambling tables skiros laughed again his face crinkling so that the eyes almost disappeared and pushed himself to his feet now i must go he moved to the door and then paused but i am forgetting some important news he turned slowly a woman came in from aden on the boat this afternoon an american named cunningham mrs ruth cunningham extremely pretty she has been asking for you x kane stiffened a surprised frown crossing his face i dont know anyone called cunningham skiros shrugged she appears to know you or to know of you at least she is staying at my hotel i told her i would be seeing you and she asked me to give you a message she would like you to come to the hotel she said it was most impoitant kane still frowned down at the table leaning forward his weight on his hands after a slight pause skiros said you will come kane straightened up and nodded sure ill come ill be there some time this evening skiros nodded good i shall tell her he smiled dont look so worried perhaps she is only a tourist maybe she wishes to charter your boat to go spearfishing along the reef kane nodded slowly yes youre probably right but he didnt believe that was the reason not for a moment and after skiros had gone he went back to the bunk and lay staring at the ceiling groping back into the past trying to place ruth cunningham but it was no good the name meant nothing to him he glanced at his watch it was just after three and for a little while longer he lay there then with a sigh of exasperation he swung his legs to the floor and started to dress he pulled on his faded denims and a sweatshirt and went up on deck piroo was lounging against the rail head bowed against his chest so that only the top of his white turban was visible kane stirred him slightly with one foot and the hindu came awake at once and rose easily to his feet im going ashore kane said what about you piroo shrugged i think not sahib later perhaps i will row you across to the jetty and then return with the dinghy it would be wiser selim might return kane nodded maybe youve got a point if he does youll find my colt underneath the pillow dont hesitate to use it ive got more friends round here than he has he dropped over the side into the dinghy and piroo took the oars and pulled rapidly towards the crumbling stone jetty when they reached it kane stepped on to the iron ladder and climbed it quickly as his eyes drew level with the top of the jetty he saw a woman sitting on a large stone a few feet away watching him he moved forward and she got to her feet and came to meet him she was dressed in an expensive white linen dress a blue silk scarf was bound round her head peasantfashion and she wore sunglasses when she removed them he recognized her at once as the woman he had met on the kantara the previous night she smiled uncertainly and there was puzzlement in her voice you again but i was looking for captain kane captain gavin kane thats me he said youll be mrs cunningham what can i do for you she frowned and shook her head in bewilderment mr andrews the american consul in aden advised me to look you up he told me you were an archaeologist that you were an expert on southern arabia he smiled slightly i presume you mean i dont look the part andrews was right on both counts i am an archaeologist among other things and i do know something about southern arabia in what way can i help you she stared out over the harbour a slight frown on her face and then she turned and looked at him coolly from steady grey eyes i want you to find my husband and im willing to pay highly for your services he reached for a cigarette and lit it slowly how high she shrugged and said calmly five thousand dollars now and another five when and if you find him for several moments they stood looking at each other and then he sighed lets discuss this over a cold drink i know just the place and he took her arm and they went along the jetty to the waterfront five they didnt talk much on the way to the hotel ruth cunningham replaced her sunglasses and gazed about her with obvious interest and kane employed the time in studying her as they turned off the jetty and moved along the waterfront he decided that skiros had been wrong she was not pretty she was beautiful the long slim lines of her were revealed to perfection by the simple linen dress as she walked it had been a long time since he had talked to a woman like her to a woman of his own kind the hotel was a tall slender building with a crumbling facade and one narrow entrance that fronted on to the street inside an ancient fan slowly revolved in the stifling heat and he led the way across the entrance hall and into the bar there was no one there and the french windows which gave access to the terrace outside creaked in the slight breeze from the harbour ruth cunningham removed her sun glasses and frowned isnt there any service in this place kane shrugged there isnt a great deal of action around here most people sleep during the afternoon they figure its too hot to do anything else she smiled well they say travel broadens the mind he went behind the bar why dont you go and sit on the terrace while i get you a drink theres a wind coming in from the sea you might find it a little cooler she nodded walked out through the french windows and sat down in a large cane chair shaded by a gaudy umbrella kane opened the ancient icebox that stood under the bar and took out two large bottles of lager so cold the moisture had frosted on the outside he knocked off the caps on the edge of the zinctopped bar poured the contents into two tall thin glasses and went out to the terrace she smiled up at him gratefully when he handed her the glass and quickly swallowed some of the beer she sighed id forgotten anything could be so cold this place is like a furnace frankly i cant imagine anyone living here from choice he offered her a cigarette oh it has its points she smiled slightly im afraid theyve escaped me so far she leaned back against the faded cushions of her chair mr andrews told me you were from new york that you were a lecturer in archaeology at columbia he nodded that was a long time ago she said casually are you married he shrugged divorced my wife and i never hit it off ruth cunningham flushed im sorry i brought it up i hope i havent upset you on the contrary he said we all make mistakes my wifes was in assuming that university professors are well paid and yours mine lay in imagining i could be content with the ordered calm of academic life id only stuck it for lillians sake she set me free in more ways than one and so you came east not at first the air corps was offering a fulltime flying course for one year then four on the reserve i did that trained as a regular pilot it was after that i came out here i was in jordan with an american expedition six years ago then i did some work for the egyptian government but it didnt last long i came to dahrein with a german geologist who needed someone who could speak arabic when he left i stayed dont you ever feel like going back home to what he said an assistantprofessorship trying to teach ancient history to students who dont want to know has dahrein anything better to offer he nodded theres something about the place that gets into your bones this was once arabia felix happy arabia it was one of the most prosperous countries in the ancient world because the spice route from india to the mediterranean passed through here now its just a barren waste but up there in the hills and north into the yemen is the last great treasure hoard for the archaeologist city after city some standing in ruins like marib where the queen of sheba probably lived others buried beneath the sand of centuries so archaeology is still your first love she said very much so but we didnt come here to talk about me mrs cunningham isnt it time we got on to the subject of your husband she took a slim gold case from her purse selected a cigarette and tapped it thoughtfully against her thumbnail its difficult to know where to begin she laughed ruefully i suppose i was always rather spoilt kane nodded it sounds possible what about your husband she frowned i met john cunningham back home at some function or other he was an englishman from the school of oriental studies in london lecturing at harvard for a year we got married kane raised his eyebrows just like that she nodded he was tall and distinguished and very english id never met anything quite like him before and when did the trouble start she smiled slightly youre very perceptive captain kane for a few moments she stared down into her glass to be perfectly honest almost straight away i soon discovered that id married a man of strong principles who believed in standing on his own two feet that sounds reasonable enough she shook her head and sighed not to my father he wanted him to join the firm and john wouldnt hear of it kane grinned well bully for john what happened after that she leaned back in her chair we lived in london john had a research job at the university of course it didnt pay very much but my father had given me a generous allowance to enable you to live in the style to which you were accustomed he said and there was something suspiciously close to amusement in his voice she flushed slightly that was the general idea and your husband didnt like it she got to her feet walked to the parapet and looked out across the harbour no he didnt like it one little bit her voice was flat and colourless and when she turned to face him he realized she was very near to tears he accepted the arrangement because he loved me she came back to the table and sank down into her chair kane gently placed his hand on hers would you care for another drink she shook her head slightly and he shrugged and leaned back in his chair she pushed a tendril of hair back into place with one hand in a quick graceful gesture and continued you see my father was a selfmade man he had to fight every inch of the way and he told john pretty plainly that he didnt think much of him and how did that affect your husband she shrugged i insisted on living in the way id been used to and it took my own money to do it john began to feel inadequate gradually he withdrew into himself he spent more and more time at the university on his research i think in some crazy kind of way he hoped he might make a name for himself kane sighed that makes sense and then he walked out on you i suppose she nodded he didnt come home from the university one night he left a letter for me in his office he told me not to worry something very important had come up and he had to go away for a few weeks it still doesnt explain why youre looking for him here in bahrein im coming to that she said i received a package four days ago from the british consul in aden it contained some documents and a letter from john in it he said that he was leaving on the coastal steamer for bahrein from here he intended to go upcountry to shabwa hed left the package with the consul with strict instructions to forward it to me if he hadnt claimed it himself within two months kane stared at her in complete surprise but shabwas a badsecurity area he said right on the edge of the empty quarter one of the greatest deserts on the face of the earth what on earth was he doing up there for a moment she hesitated and then said slowly have you ever heard of asthar captain kane he frowned slightly an ancient arabian goddess the equivalent of venus she was worshipped in the time of the queen of sheba she nodded thats right the queen of sheba was also high priestess of the cult there was a moment of stillness between them before she continued in a calm voice my husband had reason to believe that out there in the empty quarter are the ruins of the great temple sheba built in honour of the goddess asthar for a little while there was silence as kane looked at her in astonishment and then he shook his head oh no mrs cunningham if thats what your husband was looking for its no wonder you havent heard from him there isnt a damned thing out there except sand heat and thirst my husband knew differently you see he made an amazing discovery some months ago part of his research work entailed the translation of ancient arabic manuscripts and parchments many of which had come from st catherines monastery on mount sinai while working on one of these he noticed it had been used before and the older script partially erased by using specialized equipment available at the university he managed to make a copy of the original writing kane was beginning to get interested was that also in arabic she shook her head no it was in greek an account of a special mission performed by a greek adventurer called alexias he was serving as a centurion in the tenth legion of the roman army she leaned back in the chair have you ever heard of a roman general called aelius gallus he nodded quickly he tried to conquer southern arabia in bc got as far south as sheba and sacked the city of marib on the way back he had a rough time lost most of his army in the desert she nodded according to alexias they moved much farther south to timna and then marched on shabwa it was there that aelius gallus heard of shebas temple it was supposed to lie close to the ancient spice route between shabwa and marib which cuts across a corner of the desert there were fantastic tales told of the wealth of the place alexias was commissioned to lead a small body of cavalry into the desert on a lightning raid they were to rejoin the main army at marib she paused and kane said well go on did he find it or didnt he she smiled oh he found it all right the route across the desert was marked by seven stone pillars and the temple was about eighty or ninety miles from shabwa it lay in a gorge in a great outcrop of rock which according to alexias reared unexpectedly out of the sand dunes when they arrived the temple was deserted except for one old priestess who tended the flame on the high altar the scouting party who were first into the place were so disappointed at not finding the treasure they tortured the old woman to make her talk alexias arrived too late to prevent it she died cursing them in the silence which followed kane was conscious of a sudden irrational shiver he said did they manage to find the temple treasury she shook her head it was too well hidden they spent two days searching for it without success and then started back to shabwa the first night out they were caught in the open by a terrible sandstorm it raged for more than a day they lost some of the horses and had to double up when they reached the first well they found it had been poisoned she raised her shoulders slightly and shrugged cutting out the messy details only alexias came out of the desert alive and walking on his own two feet he must have been quite a man kane said she nodded ill let you have the translation of his manuscript to read you can judge for yourself he doesnt explain how he rejoined the army but he obviously managed it successfully he ended up as commander of the fort at beersheba in palestine writing an account of his adventures kane got to his feet and walked across to the edge of the parapet he looked out across the harbour to the gulf of aden beyond shrouded in its perpetual heat haze the catalina swung in across the town and splashed into the waters of the harbour beyond it a freighter moved slowly across the horizon towards the indian ocean and three dhows in formation swooped in towards the harbour like great birds he saw none of these things before him stretched the empty quarter and somewhere in its fastness was shebas temple when he lit a cigarette his hands were trembling and his body was seized by a strange excitement it was a feeling he had experienced only twice before in his life in both instances he had been a member of an expedition on the brink of an important discovery but this this was different it was something momentous the find of a lifetime something to rival knossos or the discovery of tutankhamens tomb in the valley of kings when he turned to face her he was surprised at the steadiness of his voice have you any idea of the importance of all this if what you tell me is true she frowned i suppose you mean the treasure to hell with the treasure he came back to the table and dropped into his seat all we know about the queen of sheba is contained in the bible there hasnt been a single inscription found referring to her by name not even in marib which is supposed by most experts to have been her capital such a discovery would create a world sensation and not only in academic circles i see she said slowly that explains why my husband kept his discovery to himself kane snorted the damned fool only a properly equipped expedition can handle this sort of thing successfully but dont you see she said he was trying to prove something to me this had to be his own discovery alone and unaided if fame came to him then he had achieved it by his own efforts owing help to no man kane laughed harshly if he tried to penetrate the empty quarter on his own then he was a fool if he hasnt died of thirst hes probably lying facedown in the sand somewhere with his throat cut deep pain appeared in her eyes and she nervously clasped and unclasped her hands you said shabwa was a badsecurity area captain kane what exactly did you mean by that he shrugged the borders of the aden protectorate and oman are in dispute with saudi arabia theres been constant tribal friction for years military security in the area is handled by the british and believe me theyve had their hands full because they cant be everywhere at once theyve labelled certain places badsecurity areas in other words they cant be responsible for what happens to anyone stupid enough to go there when she looked across at him her face was troubled and shabwa is one of these areas kane nodded very much so people do visit the area of course at the moment theres an american geologist called jordan up there looking for oil hes managed to survive by tossing maria theresa silver dollars around like confetti and surrounding himself with a picked band of cutthroats who make sure he stays alive because its to their own advantage have you ever been there he nodded often but then im pretty well known amongst the tribes in that area theyre mostly musabein and friendly enough if they take to you the trouble is that the fringes of the empty quarter are inhabited by outlaws men cast out by their tribes for various reasons mostly unpleasant if they get hold of you theyll skin you alive and peg you out in the sun nice people there was complete horror on her face and you think something like that must have happened to my husband he shrugged theres a fairtoeven chance she shuddered violently and buried her face in her hands kane got to his feet and stood beside her a hand on her shoulder believe me mrs cunningham im only trying to be honest with you anything could have happened to him she pushed herself to her feet and stared up into his face one hand clutching his arm but he could be alive it is possible isnt it for a moment he was going to tell her just how slim that chance was and then he smiled and patted her reassuringly sure its possible she started to cry kane slipped an arm around her shoulder and led her gently into the bar i think it would be a good idea if you went to your room and rested for a while ill make a few enquiries i might be able to find something out if your husband was in dahrein two months ago someone must have seen him she nodded slightly as they went out into the hall and mounted the stairs to the first floor when they reached the door of her room she took a key from her purse and fumbled at the lock kane took it gently from her opened the door and followed her inside there were several suitcases standing in one corner of the bare room and she went across and opened the top one after a moments search she came back a bulky envelope in one hand this is the translation of the manuscript she said i think youll find it rather interesting he slipped it into his pocket and smiled til see you this evening around seven for a drink i may have some news for you she smiled til be waiting i think ill try and get some sleep in the meantime for a moment he matched her smile with his own and then he gently closed the door six he moved along the corridor and as he reached the head of the stairs a door clicked open behind him a voice said so you and mrs cunningham got together sooner than you had intended skiros was standing in the doorway of his private room a cheroot clamped firmly between his teeth a faint smile on his face kane nodded slowly i thought id better find out what she was after the greek removed his cheroot and groaned mother of christ but its hot how about joining me in a drink for a moment kane was about to refuse and then he changed his mind very little happened in dahrein that skiros didnt know about he nodded and moved forward come to think of it i could use one if you make it long and cool skiros turned back into the room wiping his face with his handkerchief he sagged down into a large wicker chair by the window and gestured towards a table on which stood several bottles and a pitcher of icewater you mix the drinks my friend he said i havent enough energy to lift the bottle kane closed the door and went over to the table he quickly mixed two large ginslings and handed one to the greek skiros swallowed half of it and grunted christ that was good at the beginning of each year i tell myself it will be my last in this accursed hole i swear on the grave of my mother that i will go home to greece but he sighed deeply and shrugged his shoulders why dont you kane said skiros grinned exposing a row of decaying teeth because i am greedy because i can make so much money so very easily here he sipped some more of his drink and went on but i might ask you the same thing what can be the attraction of a place like dahrein for a man like you he grinned and his eyes sparkled could it be the admirable mademoiselle ferret kane shrugged calmly women mean nothing to me skiros im in dahrein for the same reason you are i can make money here very easily and taxfree there arent many places left where one can do that these days skiros chuckled and avoid europe the war you think it will come kane asked of course everything hitler wanted hes got why should poland be different not my affair kane said nor mine skiros drained his glass and what of the beautiful mrs cunningham it isnt every day we get so charming a visitor in dahrein kane helped himself to a cigarette from an ivory box on the table didnt she tell you why shes here skiros shook his head she came straight to the hotel from the boat after shed booked in she asked for you at once she didnt give a reason i assumed at first that you must be old friends to be frank i thought that perhaps your past was catching up on you kane walked across to the window he stood looking out over the harbour and spoke without turning round shes looking for her husband apparently he ran out on her the last she heard he was making for here skiros grunted in surprise but why would he come here kane turned to face him and shrugged hes a lecturer in archaeology at one of the english universities apparently he wanted to visit the ruins at shabwa skiros frowned but only that crazy american jordan manages to survive up there kane nodded thats true but what about professor muller hes been hunting for rock inscriptions in that area for months now hes managed to survive somehow skiros snorted bah the german swine he spat on the floor and then rubbed it into the carpet with the toe of one shoe he is protected by the devil but one day he will go too far one day they will find him with a bullet in the head kane shrugged is he in town at the moment skiros nodded yes he came in last night by road he drove past the hotel about eleven oclock just as i was having someone kicked out kane went to the table and helped himself to another drink you dont know anything about this guy cunningham then skiros shrugged his great shoulders im afraid not when was he supposed to arrive here when kane told him he frowned for a moment and then shook his head no i cant remember him kane swallowed his drink and walked to the door i think ill go and see muller he might have run across him he opened the door and skiros said but why should you go to all this trouble my friend i confess i am puzzled kane turned and grinned he held up one hand and rubbed his thumb across his fingers in the universal gesture that is readily understood in every corner of the world for money he said what else when he emerged from the hotel into the street it was still quiet and deserted but the sun enveloped him in an invisible cloak that caused the sweat to spring from every pore soaking through his shirt and pants he walked slowly along the shady side of the street towards mullers house frowning slightly as he considered his conversation with skiros if cunningham had landed in dahrein it was strange skiros didnt know of it it was a small town and not much escaped him but perhaps cunningham had never reached dahrein perhaps hed changed his mind after all there was only the letter to his wife to go on on the other hand that theory didnt hold water hed left aden on the mail boat the british consul had cor firmed that he must have landed in dahrein perhaps hed already made arrangements to go upcountry and hadnt bothered booking in at the hotel from what his wife had said he couldnt have had a great deal of money mullers house was in a narrow alley on the north side of the harbour the entrance was set in a high wall and kane pulled on an ancient bell chain several times as he waited for a response he thought about the german muller had arrived in dahrein the first time about a year previously a stiff perfectly mannered prussian he was interested in graffiti the ancient rock inscriptions which were to be found throughout the mountains he constantly made long expeditions by truck penetrating deep into some of the wildest country on the border he seldom took more than two or three arabs with him and carried no weapons he was considered by the musabein to be mad and this probably accounted for his continued existence no true believer would dare eternal hell by laying hands on one of the afflicted of allah the door opened and an arab servant in clean white robes stood to one side bowing deeply as kane entered he moved into a pleasant courtyard in the centre of which a fountain sparkled in the sun above his head a balcony jutted out from one of the firstfloor windows and muller appeared and looked down at him a pleased smile appeared on his face and he waved cheerfully ah kane my good friend the very man come up come up at once kane followed the servant inside the house he led the way upstairs to a narrow corridor opened a door and stood to one side motioning kane through muller was standing beside a large table in his shirt sleeves when he bowed he almost clicked his heels he smiled i have something that will interest you ive taken a latex squeeze of an inscription i found in a gorge near shabwa give me your opinion on it kane examined the long strip of rubber the professor was using a new method of copying his inscriptions a latex solution brushed on to the rock hardened quickly in the sun and peeled away in a long strip carrying with it a perfect copy kane examined the inscription with interest after a moment he looked up quatabanian isnt it the german nodded yes i found it on a rock face not far from an ancient camel trail i havent had time to translate it properly but it seems to refer to a war with the kingdom of sheba sometime during the seventh century bc kane sat on the edge of the table you know thats the third time youve been in the shabwa area to my knowledge during the past four months dont you think youre asking for trouble muller snorted i have no interest in who runs the country so long as i am left alone the tribesmen know it and dont bother me kane shrugged dont say i didnt warn you tell me have you run across any europeans in the shabwa area during the past couple of months muller looked at him in surprise only jordan that crazy fellowcountryman of yours why do you ask theres a woman in town looking for her husband kane told him an archaeologist called cunningham hes supposed to have gone upcountry to shabwa about two months ago no ones heard of him since the german threw back his head and laughed harshly nor are they likely to if he went alone but what did he want at shabwa kane shrugged i understand he was looking for graffiti like you i can do without the competition thank you muller got to his feet and walked across to the window a frown on his face no im afraid i havent come across this man he shook his head its rather strange im sure i would have heard if there was another european in the mountains kane nodded yes thats what i cant understand even skiros hasnt heard of him and thats saying something muller shrugged im sorry i cant help you thats all right kane said im beginning to think the guy never arrived here in the first place the german nodded it certainly looks like it kane went back downstairs and the servant appeared at once from the cool darkness of a rear corridor and escorted him to the door when it had closed behind him he stood for a moment in the hot street thinking about his next move there was really only one thing left to do for the moment he could check with captain gonzalez he would certainly remember if a european named cunningham had landed from the mail boat during the past two months he walked back through the town the way he had come passed the hotel and continued along the waterfront towards the north jetty the spaniards house was next to it and looked down over the beach kane knocked at the door and it was opened almost immediately by a heavily veiled woman she showed him into a cool inner courtyard where he found gonzalez stretched comfortably on a divan a can of beer in one hand the contents of which he was pouring into a tall glass he looked up and said cheerfully see you have caught me in the act already i am becoming a slave to your american habits will you join me kane shook his head not this time if you dont mind he sat on the end of the divan pushing his cap to the back of his head and gonzalez said it is not often you honour my humble house with a visit captain kane presumably you are in need of my assistance kane grinned as a matter of fact i am an expression of complacency appeared on the spaniards face and he leaned back against the cushions with a sigh ah sooner or later everyone comes to me i trust you will not accuse me of pride if i tell you that few things happen in dahrein that i do not get to know about sooner or later kane nodded i know and thats why im here theres a woman in town a mrs cunningham gonzalez nodded this is so she got off the mail boat from aden today shes looking for her husband he wrote to her two months ago telling her he was coming to dahrein he intended to go upcountry to shabwa she hasnt heard from him since the spaniard frowned what was this mans name cunningham you say he shook his head slowly im afraid she must have made a mistake no one by that name has landed in dahrein are you absolutely sure about that kane demanded gonzalez shrugged how could i be mistaken do i not meet every boat for a moment kane was going to argue but he decided it wasnt worth it that the spaniard didnt check half the boats he should was common knowledge in dahrein getting him to admit that fact was something else entirely he pulled his cap down over his eyes and sighed thanks anyway it looks as if mrs cunningham made a mistake gonzalez nodded wisely it is a thing women commonly do kane stood outside the house as the door closed behind him and looked out across the harbour to the launch he could see piroo squatting against the stern rail and knew that the hindu would be watching him he felt tired really tired he slipped a hand into his hip pocket and pulled out the envelope ruth cunningham had given to him he looked at it thoughtfully and came to a sudden decision there was only one other person in dahrein who might have some information about the elusive john cunningham that was marie ferret he had to see her anyway but his visit could wait until the evening when it was cooler he walked along to the end of the jetty and piroo tumbled over the stern into the dinghy and sculled it towards him kane dropped down into the little boat and the hindu started to pull back towards the launch any visitors while ive been away piroo shook his head all is quiet sahib it is too hot for any but a fool to be abroad kane grinned and the little hindus face clouded with dismay i am sorry sahib he said i have a foolish tongue kane shook his head and pulled himself up over the rail of the launch no i think youve hit the nail on the head this time piroo im dead tired im going below for a sleep wake me around eight will you piroo nodded and kane went below into the coolness of his cabin he mixed a drink stripped the clothes from his body and went and lay on the bunk the envelope ruth cunningham had given him in his hand he took out the typed translation of the manuscript and started to read it was an absorbing story and he read steadily for an hour until he had finished it for a little while he lay staring at the roof of the cabin and thinking about alexias a welldefined personality had emerged from the pages to stand before him it was that of a brave and aggressive physically tough man highly intelligent and a natural leader there had been a touch of the dreamer in him also kane reread the portion of the manuscript in which alexias described his feelings on first setting out into the desert in search of the temple the mans character emerged strongly in the light of his own words a born adventurer always restless always gazing beyond the next hill always searching for something and never finding it had he been looking for shebas temple or had he really been searching for something else his own true self perhaps the self that most men went through life without ever meeting he turned to the last page of the manuscript and read again the final sentence so alexias senior centurion of the tenth legion commander at beersheba end this account lest other men should be tempted to follow the seven pillars to shebas temple a word of warning for my poor comrades those seven pillars led only to death kane stared up at the roof watching the dust dancing in the sunshine that streamed through the porthole above his head and thought about the greeks words there was an ethiopian proverb that said something about the road to hell being marked by seven pillars and the ethiopians had conquered southern arabia for a while for a brief moment he wondered whether there could possibly be a connection but dismissed the notion as improbable the ethiopian conquest had come much later he was still thinking about it as he drifted into sleep he came awake suddenly and lay staring into the darkness some special sense deep in his subconscious had sounded an alarm and he lay on the bunk fingers curled tightly wary as any animal that knows the hunter is near he became aware of the smell first stale and faintly rancid olive oil or perhaps a grease of some sort and then he heard the breathing and there was a faint curse as someone stumbled against the table he waited hardly daring to breathe and stared up through halfclosed eyelids at the bright beam of moonlight which streamed in through the porthole and then the breathing was very close and he saw the upraised knife gleam in the moonlight he twisted and lifted his knee sideways it connected with his assailants stomach and there was a subdued grunt his right hand fastened about the mans wrist and he twisted sharply there was a cry and the knife fell to the floor kane scrambled from the bunk hands reaching for his assassins body but the mans torso was slippery with oil and kanes hands failed to secure a grip the man twisted like an eel and dashed for the entrance as he came out on deck piroo jumped to bar his way there was a grunt of pain from the little hindu as their bodies collided and the killer ducked under his arm and dived over the rail kane stood listening intently but could hear no sound he turned slowly are you all right the little hindu was almost weeping sahib i am shamed this man boarded the launch and almost killed you while i slept kane patted him on the shoulder dont be damned silly he was probably a professional theyre the only ones who oil their bodies before going on a job dont worry about it get the dinghy ready and well pay a call on our friend selim he went below and dressed quickly and when he came back on deck he was carrying the colt automatic in his jacket pocket it was time someone cut selim down to size he decided as they crossed the harbour and rowed between the fishing boats towards the farah the dinghy bumped against the side of the great dhow and he told piroo to wait mounted a rope ladder quickly and climbed over the rail the deck was deserted underneath the sterndeck a door opened into the captains cabin and he approached cautiously for a moment he hesitated outside listening and then he kicked open the door and went in the colt ready in his right hand two arabs were sitting crosslegged on cushions beside a low table which contained a coffeepot and several tiny cups they glanced up in alarm and he held the gun steady on them where is selim he demanded in arabic one of them shrugged he left this afternoon i think he went upcountry to visit friends for a moment kane gazed at them suspiciously as he lowered the colt and started to move away he became aware of a familiar odour it was the stale rancid smell of olive oil he turned slowly and faced the men take off your robes they looked at each other in alarm and the one who had spoken started to protest kane moved forward quickly a savage look on his face do as i say the one who had done the talking shrugged and started to remove his outer garments but the other suddenly made a break for the door kane stretched out a foot and tripped him and as the man scrambled to his feet hit him across the face with the barrel of the colt the heavy foresight slashed open the mans cheek and he slid to the deck moaning kane slipped the colt into his pocket and walked to the door he turned and said calmly to the other man tell selim hell get out of dahrein if he knows whats good for him he closed the door behind him crossed the deck and dropped down into the dinghy is everything settled sahib piroo said kane nodded i think you might say that you can take me to the jetty now im going into town he stood on the jetty and listened to the sound of the dinghy disappearing into the darkness as the hindu rowed away and then he turned and walked along the waterfront to the hotel and his appointment with ruth cunningham seven the hotel was ablaze with lights and the foyer was crowded with people kane pushed his way through to the entrance of the casino skiros was sitting at a table by the window his eyes moving rapidly from table to table gleamed with satisfaction as the dealers raked the chips across the green baize covers when he saw kane a smile appeared on his face and he waved kane nodded briefly and turned away the bar was doing a brisk trade and romero noval and conde the catalina crew were sitting there in flying jackets romero waved and kane joined them run any good cargos lately romero asked the pot calling the kettle black kane said guptas told me he saw you and some portuguese freighter offloading thirty miles out romero smiled we all need to make a living amigo take care kane said if he saw you so could someone else щщi sheb a щщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщ he walked away noval said hes right romero shrugged no problem a few more days and it will all be over lets have another drink the corridor was quiet and the noise from below sounded curiously muted and unreal as if it came from another world a light showed through the transom window above her door and he knocked softly and waited it was opened almost immediately and she looked out she was wearing a brocaded housecoat in heavy silk tied with a crimson sash at the waist her hair hung loosely to her shoulders and her face was pale and drawn as if she had slept badly she smiled and stood to one side and he went in she closed the door and leaned against it her eyes gazing into his searchingly after a few moments she sighed you havent got any news for me have you for a fraction of a second he hesitated and then he shrugged im afraid not she moved across to a wicker chair by the window and there was an edge of desperation in her face surely youve managed to find out something this is a small town somebody must have known him kane shrugged thats the peculiar thing about the whole business nobody seems to have heard of your husband i finally had a talk with the customs chief here he swears your husband hasnt disembarked in dahrein during the past two months but thats impossible she said we know he has kane shook his head we know he intended to come here we know he got on the boat at aden he may have gone on to another port mukalla for instance do you think thats possible he shrugged anythings possible on the other hand im still not convinced your husband didnt land in dahrein captain gonzalez is inclined to skimp his duties if he meets half the boats that come in here hes doing well but he wont admit it she looked up at him eagerly then you think my husband may have landed here after all kane nodded if he landed and went straight upcountry the same day it would explain why no one has heard of him an expression of relief appeared in her eyes and she relaxed against the cushions im sure thats what must have happened she smiled wanly whats the next move he went across to the window and looked down into the crowded street theres one more person left to see he said marie ferret ruth cunningham looked up at him in surprise a woman but how can she help kane smiled no ordinary woman i can assure you marie ferret is halffrench halfarab shes the head of a trading organization which stretches from zanzibar to singapore a very remarkable woman she has regular trucks going up to the shabwa area if your husband wanted to get there in a hurry thats the way he would go there was a strange smile on her face when she looked up at him is she a friend of yours kane shrugged i know her he said shell give me any information she has he walked to the door if its not too late when i get back ill drop in again she stood up quickly and moved across to the table ive written a letter to the consul in aden telling him ive found you all right she laughed rather selfconsciously he asked me to do so he didnt seem too happy about my coming here on my own he slipped the letter into his pocket and grinned maybe he had a point ill see you later he went downstairs crossed the foyer and entered the casino skiros was still sitting by the window cheroot between his teeth and glass at his elbow kane slipped into the opposite chair looks like youre having a good night skiros smiled i do not complain luckily the world is full of fools who do not understand that the house always wins what of mrs cunninghams husband have you managed to trace him yet kane shook his head gonzalez says he hasnt landed here but you know how much one can rely on his word im going to see marie ferret now she might know something as he got to his feet he took ruth cunninghams letter from his pocket and pushed it across the table put that in the mail bag for me its important skiros nodded and snapped his fingers at a waiter youre just in time im sending a boy down to the jetty now the mail boat sails on the tenoclock tide he gave the letter to the waiter with a brief command have you time for a drink kane shook his head another time skiros ill probably be back later on to see mrs cunningham again skiros smiled and the flesh creased around his eyes i trust you will remember that this is business shes a very attractive woman kane didnt to bother reply he turned and forced his way through the crowd crossed the foyer and went out into the cool night as he walked along the centre of the narrow street he thought about the greeks last remark it would be foolish to deny that ruth cunningham was an attractive woman and yet since that brief feeling of excitement and unease when they had first met on the jetty he had been conscious of no physical feelings about her she was the first woman of his own kind he had met for years and yet she left him completely unmoved but then women were something he was extremely careful about after all lillian had seemed a very pleasant girl during those first few months before they got married remembering what had come after the thought that she was no longer a part of his life filled him with a conscious pleasure and he paused on a street corner to light a cigarette it was the best part of the day the hour of the dove they called it the lights of the ships in the harbour were mirrored in the water and from a nearby cafe came the sounds of music and laughter as someone celebrated a wedding arabs in colourful robes crowded sidewalk tables sipping coffee from delicate cups talking endlessly amongst themselves with the advent of night the street had become a bazaar with stalls that sold everything from handmade brassware to cooked food there was an air of excitement of vitality in the air and the night like smooth velvet brushed his face as he pressed through the crowd gradually the streets emptied as he moved away from the centre and climbed steadily through narrow cobbled alleys towards the promontory which curved out towards the sea marie ferrets house was perched on the extreme end of the finger of rock looking out over the harbour it was a twostoreyed building with a flat roof standing in an acre of garden surrounded by a high wall kane paused outside a solid ironbound door and pulled the bell chain after a while there was a movement on the other side and the door swung open noiselessly the man who stood revealed presented an extraordinary figure a fullblooded somali his ebony face was topped by a flowing mane of black hair he stood six foot six and was broad in proportion a giant of a man in white robes his mouth twisted in a grin and he moved to one side motioning kane to enter kane smiled and said in arabic is your mistress at home jamal the somali turned from the door and nodded he had been branded in the centre of the forehead as was customary with slaves in certain parts of the yemen he had tried to escape from his master and on being caught had had his tongue cut out in the market place as a warning to others his second attempt at escape had been more successful dying from thirst in the desert he had been found by marie perret who had nursed him back to health he had been her shadow ever since he led the way along a flagged path between the fig trees to a covered terrace motioned kane to a chair and disappeared inside the house kane inhaled the freshness of the garden it was a riot of colour and the night air was heavy with the scent of flowers several palms lifted their heads above the wall and gently nodded in the cool breeze leaves etched against the night sky and a fountain splashed into a fish pool amongst the trees there was a light step behind him and he turned quickly and rose to his feet as marie perret walked out onto the terrace she was a small graceful girl of twentyfive and the soft contours of her body were accentuated by the jodhpurs and khaki bushshirt she was wearing her hair was black an inheritance from her arab mother as were the wide almondshaped eyes and rather full mouth the rest of her was pure french and she smiled gaily and flung herself down into a chair how are you gavin what a wonderful night ive just been for a ride kane grinned and offered her a cigarette when he had given her a light she leaned back in her chair did everything go all right in mukalla he took a letter from his inside pocket and handed it across sorry i was forgetting i saw your agent there yesterday he gave me that for you as she read it he watched her covertly marvelling at the change of expression on her face cold businesslike and purposeful since the death of her father when she was only twenty she had ruled perret and company too with a rod of iron from the red sea to the pacific her name was a legend scrupulously honest but shrewder than any bazaar trader she frowned slightly and called ahmed here a moment a heavily built greyhaired arab came out onto the terrace he wore european clothes and held a pen in one hand as though disturbed from some important work he was the general manager of the firm and an old and trusted friend of her fathers he smiled and nodded to kane and marie handed him the letter read that will you gavin has brought it from mukalla laval says he can take all the sesame oil he can get if we move fast we can buy up all available stocks ahmed nodded and was about to go back inside when kane said just a moment ahmed perhaps you can help me ahmed turned with a smile and said in perfect english what is it gavin theres a mrs cunningham in town at the moment shes looking for her husband when she last heard of him he was supposed to be coming to dahrein but no one seems to know anything about him ahmed frowned for a moment and then nodded cunningham john cunningham yes i remember him he wanted to go upcountry to shabwa when was this kane demanded the arab shrugged about two months ago he turned to marie and explained it was when you were in bombay this englishman landed from the boat and visited me at the office he wanted to go to shabwa i warned him of the dangers but he wouldnt listen we had a convoy of four trucks taking equipment to jordan i let him go with them and when did he return marie said ahmed shrugged im afraid i have no knowledge on that point as far as i remember he paid to be taken to bir el madani the nearest arab village to shabwa what happened to him after that i do not know he turned to kane im sorry i cant be more helpful gavin kane shook hs head youve been a lot of help at least i know this guy got as far as bir el madani before that i couldnt even prove hed landed in dahrein ahmed smiled well if youll excuse me ive got a lot of work on my hands after he had gone back into the house marie said what on earth could this man cunningham be doing in the shabwa area kane shrugged he was an archaeologist probably looking for rock carvings on his own she said incredulously surely not only a fool would attempt to travel in that area alone or a man who was looking for something really important kane said as soon as the words were out of his mouth he regretted them but it was too late she leaned across a slight frown on her face and said youre holding something back arent you hadnt you better tell me what its all about he sighed and got to his feet i suppose i had for one thing you might be able to help for another now that youve scented a mystery you wont rest content until youve wormed it out of me she stood up with a soft laugh dear gavin you know me so well by now lets walk in the garden and you can unburden yourself they went down the steps and walked through the trees her hand resting lightly on his arm and he inhaled her sweetness and was aware of feelings he had not experienced for a long time he began to talk starting with the arrival of ruth cunningham and ending with an account of alexias and his journey into the desert when he finished they were sitting on a seat by the fountain and there was silence for a while somewhere a bird called through the night and marie sighed its certainly a fantastic story dont you believe it kane said she shrugged the important thing is that cunningham did what do you intend to do now kane shrugged til go up to shabwa question the headman at bir el madani and find out what happened to cunningham marie stood up and they started to walk back towards the house personally i dont think you or anyone else will ever see john cunningham again kane nodded youre probably right but his wife wont rest content until she knows for sure marie leaned against the balustrade of the terrace i agree with you however i think i can help to get this thing cleared up quickly im flying to bir el madani in the morning to see jordan about some equipment he needs hes boring a test hole about fifteen miles from there hes had his men lay out a rough airstrip for me im only taking jamal theres room for you and mrs cunningham if you want to come along kane felt suddenly elated that would be excellent jordan will be waiting to take me to his camp by truck i expect to be there all morning you can borrow the plane three hours should give you ample time in which to make a quick survey of the area it would certainly save mrs cunningham a rough trip by truck kane said i was worried about that i dont think shes up to it is she pretty marie said he shrugged skiros certainly thinks she is but you are more interested in her money the fee shes offering me to find her husband is certainly attractive but im intrigued by the story about that temple marie laughed lightly the eternal seeker will you ever be content with what is on this side of the hill gavin probably not he said i suppose thats the main reason archaeology interested me so much when i was a kid thats why i stay on here when each year i swear ill leave theres so much to do as long as one has the money of course which means working for skiros occasionally but beggars cant be choosers he grinned if it comes to that why do you stay you could make your headquarters in a more congenial spot bombay for instance she shrugged this is an ancient land and my mother was of an ancient people its in my blood i suppose he dropped his hands on to her shoulders and smiled youre a wonderful girl he was suddenly conscious of the warmth of her body through the thin material of her shirt for several moments they remained like that staring into each others eyes and then the smile slowly faded from her face kane pulled her towards him and she made no attempt to resist his mouth fastened on hers and she melted into him alive and warm after a while he pushed her away from him holding her at arms length damn you he said softly she smiled faintly sensing the turmoil in his mind my poor gavin have i disturbed the ordered pattern of your existence but women are the devil you should know that by now im only too well aware of that fact he assured her would you like a drink he struggled with temptation and won i dont think it would be advisable she took his arm and they went down the steps and through the garden to the gate she opened it and smiled up at him seven oclock at the airfield and dont be late i want to get an early start standing there in the moonlight she looked utterly and completely desirable he sighed and said look im sorry for what happened she reached up quite suddenly and kissed him on the mouth but im not she said and pushed him through the door for a little while he stood there in the darkness his hand raised to the bell chain and then he turned away and walked down through the darkness towards the town when he reached the hotel he went up to ruth cunninghams room and knocked on the door there was no reply after trying again he opened the door and went inside but the room was empty he went back downstairs and into the bar skiros was sitting by the window a drink in front of him gazing pensively out into the night kane crossed the room and stood over him the greek looked up and smiled did you have any luck kane nodded ive managed to trace him as far as bir el madani he went up with one of marie ferrets convoys skiros raised his eyebrows in surprise so he actually did land in bahrein i must say im surprised what do you intend to do next were flying up with marie in the morning kane said ive been up to mrs cunninghams room to tell her but she isnt there skiros nodded into the darkness she passed this way only a few minutes ago i think youll find her on the beach kane thanked him and went on to the terrace it was cool and the slight breeze carried the faintest trace of salt spray with it he went down the steps to the sand and walked towards the white line of surf his eyes searching the moonlit beach he paused slightly at a loss and her voice came clearly from his left over here щщщщщщщщщщщщщщщiщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщ srieba щщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщ she was leaning against a fishing boat as he approached she said have you any news for me he lit a cigarette the match cupped between his hands against the wind and nodded yes i think everythings going to be all right now ive traced your husband as far as a small arab village about ten miles from shabwa were flying up there with marie ferret in the morning i should be able to learn something more definite from the headman she gave a sigh of relief and leaned against him a hand on his arm my god thats marvellous she sank down into the soft sand and kane sat beside her and gave her a cigarette the match flared in his hands illuminating the strong line of her jaw and tears glistened in her eyes he took her hand and said gently look everythings going to be fine she took a deep breath as if trying to get control of herself and nodded i dont know how im ever going to be able to repay you for what youve already accomplished youll have no difficulty i assure you he grinned wryly and got to his feet and now i think youd better get some sleep mrs cunningham weve got an early start she didnt argue and he saw her to the terrace of the hotel he made arrangements to pick her lip at sixthirty and then walked along the waters edge to the jetty piroo was squatting on a stone head nodding he came awake quickly and smiled a welcome teeth gleaming in the darkness as they rowed across to the launch kane told him about his trip to bir el madani on the following day youll be in complete charge he said as he clambered over the rail and stood on the deck of the launch keep a sharp lookout for trouble particularly from selim he left piroo on deck securing the dinghy and went down to his cabin it was dark and quiet and the moonlight crept in through the porthole and touched him with ghostly fingers he lay down on the bunk and stared up at the cabin roof and thought about marie for a moment the darkness was touched by her presence and she seemed to smile at him as he drifted into sleep eight the fishing boats were slipping out through the harbour entrance towards the gulf as kane turned off the jetty and moved along the waterfront he lit a cigarette the first of the day and coughed as the smoke caught at the back of his throat he felt tired and there was a slight ache behind his right eye for a moment he paused watching the fishing boats dip into the gulf current white sails shining in the early morning sun and then he continued towards the hotel he was wearing khaki pants and shirt and a battered felt bush hat on impulse he had slipped the colt into his hip pocket before leaving the launch he had many friends amongst the tribesmen of the shabwa area but one could never be too sure ruth cunningham was standing on the steps of the hotel when he arrived she was wearing a white blouse open at the neck and cream whipcord slacks her hair was bound with the same blue scarf she had worn on no that first occasion and when she smiled she looked extremely attractive will i do she demanded spreading her arms slightly kane nodded decorative but serviceable he glanced at his watch well have to step on it i dont want to keep marie waiting they didnt speak much as they walked through a maze of narrow alleys and emerged on the edge of town she had dark smudges under her eyes as if she had not slept well and there was a strained anxious look to her that he didnt like the airstrip was a quarter of a mile outside dahrein in the opening of a narrow pass which cut deeply into the mountains it was not an official stopping place for any of the major airlines and had been constructed as an emergency strip by the spanish air force there was one hangar a crumbling decrepit building in concrete with a roof of corrugated iron they could see the plane squatting on the runway from a long way off a de havilland rapide painted scarlet and silver its twin engines were already ticking over as they approached jamal was sitting in one of the rear seats and marie jumped down to the ground and came to meet them kane made the introduction and the two women shook hands in its very kind of you to help in this way ruth cunningham said marie shrugged its nothing mrs cunningham nothing at all im going up to bir el madani on business anyway she turned to kane a slight smile on her face and her eyes sparkled i hope you slept well gavin sorry to rush you but i promised jordan id be there by seventhirty ruth cunningham climbed into the seat next to jamal who stared stolidly ahead and ignored her marie slipped into the pilots seat and then turned enquiringly to kane would you like to fly her he nodded and she stepped into the passenger area making room for him he taxied slowly along the ground and turned into the wind a moment later and the end of the airstrip was rushing to meet them he pulled the column back slowly and the rapide lifted into the pass rock walls flashing by on either side the air was bumpy as they flew out of the pass for a fortyknot wind was blowing across the mountains they climbed through heat haze that already blurred the horizon and levelled off at six thousand feet to cross the coastal range beyond the mountains the sky was a brilliant sapphire and within half an hour the real desert appeared in the distance its colours varying between burnished gold and deep red щщщщщщї щщщщщщщщщщщщщщїщщщщщщщщ heb a щщщщщщ щщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщ suddenly they were passing over a tall oil derrick surrounded by a group of tents and several vehicles and then ruth cunningham cried excitedly look theres a truck down there kane glanced out of the window and saw a truck moving at high speed in the direction in which they were flying a little later a dark splotch appeared in the distance within a few minutes it had increased into a clump of green palm trees and a scattered group of flatroofed houses the airstrip was a narrow slot between two dunes with a windsock on a tall pole at one end kane circled once and then turned into the wind for a perfect landing between two rows of empty oil drums as he taxied to the far end of the airstrip the truck appeared from among the houses and moved towards them in a cloud of dust kane switched off the engines opened the door and jumped to the ground he turned and handed the two women down in turn as the truck braked to a halt a few feet away and a man slid from behind the wheel and came to meet them he was young with a bronzed reckless face and his fair hair was closely cropped he was dressed in sunbleached khaki and a revolver was slung low on his right hip in a black leather holster his teeth flashed in a ready smile and he cried the devil himself what brings you up here kane grinned and punched him on the shoulder i was hoping you might be able to help us jordan he halfturned and indicated ruth cunningham mrs cunningham here is looking for her husband we know he arrived in bir el madani two months ago he intended to visit shabwa for a few days she hasnt heard from him since jordan took her hand his face serious im sorry to hear that mrs cunningham he frowned slightly for a moment or two and then shook his head no i cant say ive heard of your husband the headman of the village might be able to help she turned to kane and he nodded i know the headman here omar bin naser if he knows anything hell tell us jordan led her towards the ford pickup truck and handed her in thats settled then ill drop you and mrs cunningham in the village kane well see you sometime this afternoon marie and i have a hell of a lot to discuss marie squeezed into the front seat beside ruth cunningham and kane and jamal sat in the back under the canvas awning as they moved away kane glanced casually over his shoulder and saw an arab in faded russet robes and red headcloth appear from behind a dune and urge his camel across the airstrip he slid to the ground and stood by the plane kane tapped jordan on the shoulder pull up a minute will you jordan halted the truck and they all turned and looked back the arab was examining the plane closely and then he looked up and gazed towards them kane scrambled out of the truck til see what he wants it may be just idle curiosity but you never can tell with bedouins as he approached the plane the arab advanced to meet him hand resting lightly on the silver hilt of his curved jambiya kane halted a few feet away from him and said in arabic what are you doing here are you looking for someone the arabs face was lined and drawn the pupils of his eyes were like pinpricks and his lips were necked with foam i have a letter for one named kane he said in a dead voice kanes hand slid round to the butt of the colt as he spoke i am he where is the letter the arab pulled the jambiya from its sheath and the blade flashed in the hot sunlight kane took a quick step back and tried to draw the colt the foresight snagged on the lining of his hip pocket and he cursed and ducked under the swinging blade reaching for the arabs throat for a moment they swayed locked together kane trying to twist the weapon from the mans grasp and then the arab lifted his knee viciously kane hung on grimly and they fell to the ground rolling over and over he could hardly breathe and yet everything assumed a sharper definition and he was acutely aware of the stink of the mans unwashed body of the madness in the staring eyes in the distance a woman screamed and he was conscious of something digging painfully into his right buttock it was the colt and he wrenched it free from his pocket rammed the barrel into the arabs stomach and pulled the trigger twice as thejambiya was raised to strike the force of the bullets fired at such short range lifted the man backwards kane tried to get up but there was a roaring in his ears someone cried his name he grabbed for the planes wing hauling himself erect and another arab came into his range of vision running towards himjambiya raised above his head kane tried to lift the colt but his arm seemed to have lost its strength and then jordan arrived on the scene the geologist dropped to one knee beside him rested the barrel of his heavy revolver across his left forearm and fired so fast that four shots sounded like one continuous roll of thunder the arab kept coming right into the line of fire the bullets thudding solidly into his body and then when he was almost upon them he seemed to lurch sideways and fell on to his face for several moments there was complete silence and then kane heard a cry behind him he turned still holding onto the wing for support and saw marie running towards him her face was white and drawn and she clutched his arm gavin are you all right he patted her on the hand reassuringly thanks to jordan the geologist was bending over the man he had killed and he turned a puzzled frown on his face how the hell did he keep on coming i didnt miss once kane turned the body over with his right foot the face was contorted in agony the lips foamflecked and curled back exposing stained teeth havent you ever come across anyone who looks like this before jordan shook his head but marie moved forward and looked down this man has been drugged with quat he must be a hired assassin kane nodded thats the way i see it when i asked the first man what he wanted he told me he had a letter for a man called kane but why the hell should anyone want to kill you jordan said and what is this stuff quat anyway kane lit a cigarette its a narcotic stimulant found in the leaves of a shrub from these parts when the leaves are chewed the user feels alert and confident used regularly it gradually has an effect on the physical appearance jordan frowned whats this bit about hired assassins kane shrugged id have thought youd have known about that by now if you want to kill a man in this country you dont do it yourself you hire a professional jamal had been busy searching the body of the first man kane had killed now he turned and came towards them a leather bag in one hand which he handed to his mistress marie looked inside and then held it forward silently so that the others could see its contents it was stuffed with silver coins jordan whistled and marie said gravely there must be the equivalent of two or three thousand maria theresa dollars here gavin someone must want you dead very badly kane nodded soberly yes and i think i know who it is i had a runin with selim yesterday one of his men had a try last night when i was sleeping marie frowned but how would he know that you would be at bir el madani this morning kane considered the fact and then nodded youve got a point there anyway to hell with it it didnt come off and somebodys paid a lot of money out for nothing he groaned and wiped a hand across his mouth i could use a drink ive got a flask in the truckjordan told him come to think of it i could do with a swallow myself he grinned and shook his head and i was worried in case being a geologist turned out to be boring as they walked back towards the truck an excited crowd of people swarmed past them and moved towards the dead bodies where the hell did they spring from jordan said anyone would think they knew something was going to happen they very probably did kane told him ruth cunningham looked sick and her face was pale are you all right she said to kane he nodded im sorry you had to see that she seemed to find difficulty in speaking and clambered back into the front seat where she sat nervously clasping and unclasping her hands jordan had been examining the bag of coins jamal had found on the body of the first assassin and he looked at kane enquiringly what happens to this little lot you hang on to it for now kane told him im sure well find a use for it later jordan grinned pietty good pay under the circumstances he produced a brandy flask from a compart ment under the dashboard took a long swallow and handed it to kane compliments of the house kane raised the flask and toasted him silently he choked as the brandy burned its way down into his stomach and he climbed into the rear of the truck i havent thanked you yet that was nice shooting back there jordan slipped behind the wheel and drove towards the village i was raised on a ranch in wyoming he turned the truck into the wide main street and braked to a halt outside the largest house scattering a herd of goats kane got down and ruth cunningham followed him after weve had our talk with omar well take a flight over the shabwa area he said to marie she nodded take care gavin and dont go too far out into the desert its bad flying country she glanced at her watch lets see with any luck we should be back here just after noon kane smiled well be back by then easily there was a grinding of gears and the truck shot away in a cloud of dust kane turned to speak to ruth cunningham and found the headman of the village standing outside his door waiting to welcome them you honour my poor house captain kane he said in arabic kane smiled always i come when i need something my friend but let us go inside the sun is hot and the events of the past halfhour have given me a great desire to sit down omar led the way into his windowless mudbrick home the house was divided into two rooms in one were kept the goats and chickens belonging to the family and the other was the general living room at night omar and his family simply lay down in their robes on rush mats and slept despite the obvious poverty of the place omar bin naser had the native courtesy and instinctive dignity of the arab he motioned kane and ruth cunningham to two cushions and clapped his hands within a few moments a woman entered the room wearing a long black outer robe which also closely veiled her face she carried a brass pot in her left hand and three cups in the other after the customary feigned refusals that courtesy demanded kane accepted a cup and nodded slightly to ruth cunningham who followed suit the woman poured a few drops into their cup and waited for approval it was yemeni mocha the finest coffee in the world kane smiled and held out his cup which the woman promptly filled omar waved her away and kane offered him a cigarette which the headman accepted eagerly when it was drawing to his satisfaction he sat back with a sigh and said courteously in what way may i help you kane nodded to ruth cunningham i seek this ladys husband he said he came here about two months ago can you tell us anything about him omars eyes sparked with interest and he inclined his head to ruth cunningham with a pleasant smile and said to kane presumably the woman does not understand arabic when kane nodded he went on a man did come here some two months ago he arrived with a convoy of trucks one day they went on to the camp of the american jordan but this man stayed in bir el madam where did he go from here kane said omar shrugged who knows he was mad quite mad he wanted to journey from shabwa to marib by camel he needed guides and did you help him kane said omar nodded the camels i could supply but the guides were another matter no one ventures into the empty quarter as you know unless he is a hunted man with a price on his head then he went alone the headman shook his head there was a mad bedouin passing through here at the time a rashid you know what they are like anything for adventure proud reckless men he volunteered to go with the englishman and have you heard of them since kane said omar smiled faintly captain kane their bones are bleaching in the sun at this moment it is the only end for those who are foolish enough to venture into the empty quarter for a little while kane sat there frowning and then he got to his feet and gave ruth cunningham a hand have you found anything out she demanded anxiously he nodded plenty your husband was here he managed to get camels and a bedouin of the rashid tribe to accompany him he told omar he intended to cross the empty quarter from shabwa to marib her eyes were troubled and kane patted her reassuringly on the arm and turned to omar many thanks my friend but we must go now i shall fly this lady to shabwa and then a little way out into the desert perhaps we shall discover something omar nodded and accompanied them to the door as they emerged into the street several villagers passed dragging a crude cart on which lay the two assassins their robes were dabbled with blood and clouds of flies hovered over them ruth cunningham shuddered violently and omar said i rejoice at your narrow escape captain kane kane turned quickly a look that was almost amusement in his eyes you knew they were waiting for me omar nodded but of course he said gently and knowing you made no attempt to prevent it omar looked pained i could not possibly interfere with another mans blood feud kane started to laugh an expression of complete bewilderment appeared on omars face and kane took ruth cunninghams arm and led her away still laughing what was all that about she said i find all this arabic frustrating you wouldnt understand he told her a private joke as they walked towards the airstrip she said that was wonderful coffee we had who was the woman his wife kane shook his head a household slave surely youre joking she said he smiled gently didnt you notice the mark of the hot iron on jamals forehead he was a slave in the yemen they cut out his tongue the first time he tried to escape there are thousands of slaves in most parts of arabia still she shuddered and they continued the rest of the way in silence when they reached the plane the only signs of the fight were several patches of blood in the sand of the runway kane pushed her into the cabin and clambered up behind he wasted no time and a few moments later they were climbing steeply into the blue sky they reached shabwa within ten or fifteen minutes and ruth cunningham looked down with an expression of disappointment on her face i cant say i find it particularly thrilling kane nodded not very imposing i agree but under the sands down there are the sixty temples the roman historian pliny wrote about a treasure trove for some future expedition he checked the compass and turned the nose of the rapide out into the desert ive set course for marib according to alexias the temple should be somewhere out here on a direct line from shabwa about ninety miles he said lets hope we come across something he took the plane down to a height of five or six hundred feet above the sand dunes hoping for tracks or some other sign that human beings had passed this way but there was nothing the desert stretched as far as the eye could see sterile savage and unbelievably lonely after some fifteen minutes ruth cunningham gave him a sudden nudge in front of them an immense sand dune that must have been seven or eight hundred feet in height lifted into the sky and kane pulled back the column slightly the engines spluttered and missed a couple of times he pulled the column back hard and the rapide lifted over the top of the sand dune with only a few feet to spare and then the engines coughed and died the utter silence which followed was broken only by the sough of the wind in the struts and then as the plane dipped sickeningly ruth cunningham screamed kane fought for control about fifty or sixty feet above the sand he managed to level out and then another great sand dune was rushing towards them hang on he said tightly and pulled on the column with all his strength the rapide swerved violently for a moment it seemed to right itself and then the left wingtips dipped to the sand the aircraft spun in a circle and there was a tearing crunch of metal kane cried a warning and braced himself to withstand the impact as they ploughed to a halt through the soft sand nine kane gave a tong shuddering sigh and wiped sweat from his eyes with the back of one hand he turned and looked into the white strained face of ruth cunningham are you all right she nodded briefly i held on tight as we went in he opened the door and jumped to the ground the nose of the rapide was halfburied in soft sand and the left wing was crumpled and useless i cant understand why we didnt catch fire he said with a frown and came back to the door and looked at the instrument panel thats funny the fuel tanks are empty she moved across the cabin and clambered out through the door whats that supposed to mean i dont really know when the engines failed it could have been lack of fuel but i dont see why i wonder what state the radios in as he climbed back into the cabin to examine it ruth cunningham said is there anyone near enough to pick up the signal he nodded jordan has a shortwave receiver at his camp he examined the set briefly and turned with a grimace im afraid weve had it they werent built to stand up to this kind of treatment ruth cunningham ran a hand over her face wearily id give anything for a drink of water we can soon fix that he said reaching behind the back seats for a large jerrycan and plastic cup this things full so water is the least of our problems he gave her a long drink and had one himself afterwards they sat in the shade of the wing smoking cigarettes and not talking after a while she turned and looked at him and said in a level voice gavin give it to me straight what are our chances a lot better than you think i reckon were about thirty miles from shabwa its no good trying to make it during the heat of the day the best thing we can do is rest up here and make a move at dusk well be able to travel a lot faster at night because of the coolness do you think theyll come looking for us he nodded confidently of course they will as soon as marie and jordan return to bir el madani and find were missing theyll form a search party those ford trucks of his are specially fitted for desert work щщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщi c t t aї she looked into his eyes searchingly and then she smiled im glad im with you gavin with anyone else i think i would have been scared really scared he smiled and helped her to her feet but there isnt anything to be scared about a few hours discomfort thats all its the sort of thing youll be able to talk about for years and the details will grow with the telling i suppose youre right her shoulders sagged and she looked tired he pushed her towards the cabin door try to sleep for a few hours youll find it cooler in there ill wake you later on this afternoon he closed the door behind her lay down in the shade of the right wing and pillowed his head on his hands he wished he felt as confident as he had tried to sound on his own and with plenty of water he would have stood a fair chance of reaching shabwa in a forced march during the night but with a woman one thing was certain marie and jordan would come looking for them but the trick lay in knowing where to look and the desert was a big place he listened to the stillness and felt the heat press down on him with a force that was almost physical and after a while drifted into a troubled sleep somewhere there was a scream of terror and something hard poked him under the chin he opened his eyes and looked along the barrel of a rifle the man on the other end was a yemeni in coloured turban his halfnaked body smeared with indigo dye at some time in the past his ears had been cropped the sign of a thief and his right cheek branded two others were dragging ruth cunningham from the cabin and as kane scrambled to his feet her shirt ripped and she fell to the ground one of the men laughed and dragged her upright by the hair the mans face had been eaten away by yaws his eyes burned out of a mass of putrefying flesh and there were two holes where his nose had once been ruth cunningham stared with horror into that ghastly face and fainted kane took a step towards her and the three yemenis all swung their rifles ominously it would be unwise to move the one with the cropped ears said in harsh guttural arabic kane moistened dry lips take us to bir el madani and there will be a rich reward for you the one with the face out of a nightmare uttered an oath and spat he took a quick step forward reversing his rifle and rammed the butt into kanes stomach one of them took the colt automatic from his hip pocket then they left him for a while his face in the sand breathing deeply and waiting for the agony to pass the three men were outlaws so much was obvious but how were they going to act that was the important thing they seemed to be having an argument and kane opened his eyes his breathing easier and tried to listen dirty brown feet encased in leather sandals appeared before his face and a hand pulled him into a sitting position he found himself facing the man with the cropped ears he squatted in front of kane rifle cocked in his arms and grinned it is time for us to go now take us to bir el madani kane urged desperately you will receive a large reward i promise you five thousand maria theresa dollars the yemeni shook his head over the border i am a dead man walking he nodded towards ruth cunningham we can make as much money selling the woman in the slave market at sana ten thousand kane said name your price she is a very rich woman in her own country the arab shook his head how can i be sure she would honour the bargain a white woman commands a high price in the yemen and what about me kane said the yemeni shrugged my friends wished to cut your throat but i have persuaded them otherwise whether you live or die is your own affair shabwa is but a short step for a strong man kane frowned i dont understand the yemeni grinned you do not remember me two years ago when the bal harith were camped near shabwa there was some question of a stolen horse if they had caught me it would have meant my life you allowed me to hide in your truck until darkness the ways of allah are strange kane remembered the incident at once he leaned forward lowering his voice help us to safety and ill see you are richly rewarded at least you owe me that the yemeni shook his head and stood up a life for a life now i owe you nothing rest content my friends wished to relieve you of your manhood at least if you are wise you will stay quiet until we have gone he joined his two companions who had already mounted their camels one of them slinging ruth cunninghams unconscious body across his wooden saddle kane stood by helplessly as they rode away from the plane and disappeared into a fold of the dunes he glanced at his watch it was just after noon which meant that he had slept for longer than he had supposed for a moment he stood there considering and rejecting possible courses of action but there was really no solution just the slightest chance that he might be able to do something with the radio he climbed into the cabin and set to work from the beginning it was hopeless and yet he kept on working long after it became obvious that the set was damaged beyond repair hoping to nurse into life a spark which would live long enough to carry a message to the outside world sweat dripped from his body and the heat in the cabin enveloped him so that he had to stop on several occasions for rest and water it was shortly after three when he finally admitted defeat he sat back wearily and started to light a cigarette at that moment he heard the sound of an engine approaching through the stillness he jumped down to the ground and stood there listening a sudden wild hope inside him it was close very close as he shaded his eyes with one hand and looked up a truck topped a dune a hundred yards away and came towards him marie was driving with jamal sitting beside her as kane went towards them she cut the engine slid from behind the wheel and ran to meet him are you all right gavin she demanded anxiously he nodded im fine but i dont understand how did you get here so quickly its a long story she said is mrs cunningham in the plane he shook his head im afraid not he quickly described what had happened and when щ щщщщщщщщщ a щщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщїщщщщщщщщщщщщщ he had finished marie looked grave if we dont catch them before darkness theres no knowing what they might do to her he nodded if we get moving straight away we should find them without much difficulty he sat beside marie in the front seat jamal climbed into the back and within a few moments they were moving following the clearly defined tracks of the three camels the truck was fitted with twelve forward gears and this coupled with fourwheel drive made it ideal for crossing the shifting sand dunes kane leaned back in his seat youd better fill me in on what happened at bir el madani i finished my business with jordan by eleven marie told him he sent jamal and me back to the village in this truck with one of his drivers when we reached the airstrip omar was waiting for us he said there was a stranger in the village a coast arab who had been heard to boast that you would not be returning and omar actually volunteered this information kane said she smiled faintly youll never understand the complexity of the arab mind gavin to kill your enemy facetoface is one thing but a trick such as tampering with the plane she shrugged to omar such a thing would lack honour j til go along with that kane said but how did you find out for certain what had happened omar pointed out the man in question and jamal took him behind a hut and questioned him he was stubborn but with his right arm broken and the threat of similar treatment to his left he saw reason kane glanced sharply at her in amazement my god you dont believe in halfmeasures do you my mother was a rashid she said calmly we are a hard people especially when the things we value are threatened to that there could be no reply and kane said hed tampered with the fuel tank i suppose he took advantage of the confusion when the villagers were swarming around the bodies of the assassins no one noticed him in the crowd did you manage to find out whod paid him she nodded just as you thought selim kane frowned he must really hate me to go to all this trouble how did you manage to find the plane so easily i knew you were flying on a direct line from shabwa to marib i took a bearing followed the compass and hoped for the best i sent jordans driver back to the camp with a note explaining what had happened kane grinned wryly youre fast becoming indispensable for once she could find nothing to say and concentrated on her driving following the twisting tracks with ease until they finally came to a broad plain of flat sand mixed with gravel which stretched away into the distance she moved into top gear and pressed her foot flat against the boards the truck raced across the flat plain in a cloud of dust and soon the three of them were coated with sand from head to foot kane helped himself to water and his eyes ceaselessly searched the plain ahead looking for the black dots in the distance which would indicate their quarry there were two rifles bracketed to the roof of the truck and he took them down and handed one to jamal the great somalis hands checked the weapon expertly and then he cradled it in his arms one finger inside the trigger guard kane gripped his tightly and stared through the windscreen out of dustrimmed eyes his mind became a blank as he waited so that he was taken completely by surprise when marie screamed in his ear and the black dots in the distance seemed to rush towards them he raised his rifle slightly and waited as they came up fast behind the three camels the man at the rear turned and looked towards them and his mouth opened in a cry of dismay he urged his camel forward marie spun the wheel and the truck moved abreast of the arabs kane raised his rifle and fired a warning shot over them and then the truck had drawn ahead as marie swerved to a halt the man with the diseased face who was carrying ruth cunningham in front of him released her so that she tumbled to the ground he raised his rifle in one hand and jamal fired a quick shot which lifted him from the saddle marie drove the truck forward and halted beside ruth cunningham she was weeping her head buried in her hands and marie spoke gently to her did they harm you in any way ruth cunningham shook her head several times and spoke with difficulty the man with the awful face kept pawing me but the one who seemed to be the leader made him leave me alone she collapsed in a flood of tears and marie led her gently to the truck and eased her into one of the seats kane walked across to the two men who sat their camels quietly under the threat of jamals carbine the man with the cropped ears grinned down at him the ways of allah are strange youre damned right they are kane told him its lucky for you you didnt harm her now get to hell out of here he stood for a little while watching them ride away and then he went to help jamal who was digging a shallow grave for the dead man when they returned to the truck ruth cunningham was still sobbing quietly on maries shoulder kane raised his eyebrows enquiringly and marie shook her head he shrugged theres no hurry well rest up for an hour before starting back he sat down in the sand his back against the side of the truck and pulled the brim of his bush hat over his eyes and gradually his head nodded forward and he dozed in what seemed to be the same moment of time he came awake to a gentle tug at his shoulder marie smiled down at him we should be making a move gavin its after six he got to his feet and looked into the interior of the truck ruth cunningham was curled up in one of the passenger seats sleeping he smiled at marie and climbed behind the wheel she and jamal went round to the other side and kane gently eased in the clutch and drove away there was a car compass fitted to the dashboard and he decided to leave the camel tracks and pursue what seemed to be a much more direct route to shabwa gradually the sun dipped towards the horizon in a great orange ball and then the night fell with its usual rapidity the sky was clear with stars strung away to the horizon like diamond chips and the moon bathed the desert in an unearthly white light marie had dozed off her head against kanes shoulder and he leaned back in his seat hands steady on the wheel and stared ahead into the night when he saw it the shock was so great that he slammed his foot against the brake bringing the truck to a halt with such force that everyone was thrown forward in their seats and brought violently awake gavin what is it marie cried in alarm he pointed over to the righthand side of the vehicle without speaking standing poised on top of a small rise throwing a long dark moonshadow across the sand was a delicate stone pillar kane got out of the truck followed by marie and walked slowly towards it when he was a few feet away his foot kicked against something with a metallic clang he picked up a couple of cans and weighed them in each hand corned beef and soup whoever it was no arab thats for sure he leaned down and picked up another object as ruth cunningham and jamal moved forward to join him for a moment they could not see what it was and then he turned and held it out towards them it was a large and very empty aluminium waterbottle ten jamal gently cleared loose sand away from the base of the pillar while kane knelt beside him directing the beam of a powerful electric torch on the work after a while the somali stopped digging and pointed kane leaned forward and saw that a long inscription in perfectly chiselled characters had emerged he studied it carefully for several minutes and then got to his feet and walked back to the truck a spiritstove flared in the slight breeze marie and ruth cunningham were heating cans of beans in a pan of boiling water kane flung himself down beside them and ruth poured hot coffee into a tin mug and handed it to him have you found anything more kane drank some of the coffee and nodded a long sabean inscription that was the language of ancient sheba by the way unfortunately i havent any books with me and im a little rusty he held out the mug for more coffee i managed to decipher one or two words asthar for example and a reference to distance which im not familiar with marie pushed back her hair with one hand and the light from the spiritstove flickering in the wind danced across her face you mean its probably a sort of milestone kane nodded its obviously one of the seven pillars mentioned by alexias but is that possible she said if that pillar was erected during the time of the queen of sheba it would be almost three thousand years old he shrugged thats perfectly possible in the dry heat of the desert ive seen inscriptions at marib over two thousand five hundred years old and they look as fresh as if the mason had chiselled them yesterday and another thing you know how frequent sand storms are here its probably been buried then uncovered again scores of times over the ages what about that waterbottle and the empty food cans ruth said handing him a plate of beans i think your husband must have left them there we know for certain that he left shabwa by camel whatever else may have happened to him i think its reasonable to assume hed have got this far but those three outlaws she said perhaps there are others like them he nodded thats true with every mans hand against them they go where no one else dares but as a rule they dont come this far out they usually hug the edge of the desert and keep within striking distance of water in any case only a european would use a waterbottle of that type the bedouins use goatskins so it was all true marie said after a short silence sheba and her temple alexias and his roman cavalrymen yes they must have passed this way kane said in the eerie silence that followed his words no one seemed to breathe and for one timeless moment he almost expected to hear the chink of harness in the distance and see the roman cavalrymen appear over the dunes alexias in the lead moonlight glinting on his breastplate as he reined in his horse and gazed out over the desert and then out of the silence there came a low vibrant hum which grew until it filled the ears and ruth cunningham turned in alarm marie placed a hand on her arm and said quickly its nothing to be alarmed about something to do with the change in temperature one layer of sand sliding over the other the singing sands kane said softly i wonder if alexias heard them also one thing is certain ruth cunningham said he wouldnt have had anyone who could have given him the scientific explanation all the same i dont think hed have been afraid kane said gently there was a short silence and he took out a crumpled packet of cigarettes the thing weve got to decide now is what do we do next marie took one of his cigarettes and leaned down to light it from the spiritstove when she sat up her face was thoughtful how far did alexias say the temple was from shabwa about ninety miles kane said and were about forty miles from shabwa he nodded and she leaned back her face half in shadow after a while she said slowly i think we should turn round and chart a course for marib even if we dont find other pillars still standing we should find this outcrop of rock which alexias described ruth cunningham turned eagerly to kane do you think we could he nodded i dont see why not weve got plenty of fuel and water if we start now we should be there by dawn theres enough moonlight and it would be a damned sight more pleasant than travelling during the day marie got to her feet that settles it then we pack up and move on right away as kane turned away she caught his sleeve you need some sleep gavin ill drive for a couple of hours you can take over later for a moment he was going to refuse and then tiredness dropped about his shoulders like a heavy blanket when they drove off half an hour later he was sprawled amongst the baggage in the rear and already asleep he awakened with a bad taste in his mouth it was bitterly cold and he sat up and leaned forward jamal dozed beside him and ruth cunningham was asleep her head lolling backwards he scrambled over into the front seat when marie turned to smile at him he saw the lines of fatigue on her face and a strange and immediate rush of tenderness moved inside him what time is it he said about threethirty he reached across and took the wheel in his hands slide out of the way and ill take over you should have wakened me an hour ago she lit a cigarette and placed it in his mouth and then she folded her arms and leaned against him her head on his shoulder all at once i feel tired he inhaled the fragrance of her and smiled lucky me she sighed contentedly this is nice they were crossing an area of flat scrubland and he drove with one hand sliding the other about her shoul der pulling her close there were many things he could have said but there was really no need to say anything after a while she raised her face and kissed him gently on one cheek my poor gavin she said and there was a glint of amusement in her eyes damn you he said damn all women she laughed softly what are we going to do about it he sighed the usual thing i suppose theres father obrien at mukalla will he suit you admirably i like father obrien she said and afterwards he shrugged that can take care of itself she seemed about to argue the point and then she shrugged as if content for the moment well see after a while she slept and kane held her close as he stared out through the windscreen and told himself wryly that life was catching up on him again it was rather pleasant to find that he didnt really mind the scrubland came to an end and he eased marie into the corner changed to a lower gear and took the truck up the steep side of a dune the moon grew paler and in the east tiny fingers of light appeared above the horizon as dawn touched the sky his eyes were gritty and sore from lack of sleep and his arms ached with the driving of the past few hours he halted on top of a large dune for a moment or two and searched the desert with field glasses as the sun lifted above the horizon flooding the sky with light it glinted on something in the distance he focused the glasses rearing out of the desert five or six miles away was a great outcrop of reddish stone he engaged a low gear and took the truck down the steep side of the sand dune once at the bottom he drove through a gap which brought him to another flat plain of sand and scrub he accelerated and drove towards the distant outcrop of rock at high speed as the truck lurched forward the others came awake quickly whats happening marie demanded anxiously he nodded into the distance were almost there ruth cunningham leaned forward her hands gripping the edge of the seat so strongly that her knuckles showed white the outcrop increased in size until it towered above them and then they entered the deep gorge which twisted into the heart of it kane braked to a halt and switched off the engine it was completely quiet and after a moment he took down one of the rifles and stepped to the ground it might be an idea if we left the truck here theres no knowing what we might find up ahead jamal took the other rifle and they started to walk along the firm bed of the gorge after a while ruth cunningham gave a startled exclamation and pointed upwards isnt that an inscription on the face of the rock as the suns rays penetrated the gorge they picked out the rock inscriptions with startling suddenness kane moved closer and gazed up after a moment or two he nodded theyre sabean all right weve certainly come to the right place he moved on the others at his shoulder they passed several more inscriptions and then rounded a shoulder of rock and paused before them stretched a broad avenue of pillars some in varying stages of ruin others still intact at the end of the avenue there was the crumbling facade of a mighty temple built into the face of the gorge itself kanes mouth went dry he could remember no other moment in his life quite like it he started forward quickly and the others trailed after him at the end of the avenue of pillars and directly in front of the temple itself was a deep pool of water crystalclear and fed from some invisible spring he flung himself down by its side and drank from his cupped hands he could hear the others coming up behind him the two women talking excitedly and he cried out this water is as cold as ice their voices ceased abruptly and as kane started to get up a reflection in the water in front of him caused him to grab for his rifle a bullet chipped the stone edge of the pool and he raised his arms above his head and climbed slowly to his feet on the other side of the pool were at least a dozen halfnaked bedouins and they were holding the very latest lee enfield rifles standing in front of them a sardonic smile on his face was selim please do not try anything foolish he said in his careful clipped english the bedouins moved quickly round the pool splitting into two groups and effectively surrounding kane and his party selim followed at a more leisurely pace one hand toying with the hilt of his jambiya the other tugging gently at his beard he paused a foot or so away and kane said softly its a small world selim nodded you are a hard man to kill he sighed heavily and his right fist shot out catching kane full in the mouth kane lay on the ground for a moment shaking his head and conscious of the threatening muzzles of the rifles that had swung towards him he wiped blood from his mouth and got to his feet slowly selim smiled the down payment on an old score the rest will come later i never forget a debt he gave a quick command and the bedouins closed in urging their prisoners forward with shrill cries as he stumbled towards the great flight of steps which led up to the temple kane considered the unexpected turn events had taken from the beginning he should have realized there was the possibility that john cunningham had survived the desert crossing that some human agency had prevented his return but why selim it didnt make sense as he mounted the top step and crossed the terrace the closer view of the temple drove other considerations from his mind it had been built into the face of the rock wall itself and the great pillars that supported the portico and flanked the entrance were at least sixty feet high marie appeared at his shoulder and her voice was filled with awe ive never seen anything like it theres nothing to touch this in the whole of arabia kane nodded strong egyptian influence i would say same style of portico as the temple at karnak it was cool and very quiet inside and his eyes soon became accustomed to the dim light the floor was constructed of rosecoloured marble and pillars of wellcut blocks of drafted masonry towered into the gloom at the other end of the imposing nave a great statue loomed out of the darkness the party paused as selim called a halt and ordered most of his men outside except for three who were obviously to be their guards he turned to kane you will all stay here if you attempt to escape or make a suspicious move of any sort the guards have orders to kill you at once okay youre the boss kane said theres one thing you might tell us before you go what happened to mrs cunninghams husband after all hes the reason were here selim shrugged he is alive and well for the moment ruth cunningham moved forward when can i see him oh please let me see him her cheeks were flushed and her eyes sparkled selim looked down into her face as if seeing her for the first time after a moment or two he shook his head slowly that is not possible at the moment if you behave yourself you may see him later you must wait here but for what kane demanded a firing squad a slit throat or a new arrival selim smiled thinly i am not here to answer questions he turned and walked away quickly and kane took the crumpled pack of cigarettes from his pocket there was one left and he drew smoke deep into his lungs as he looked up at the statue it was like nothing he had ever seen before carved from solid stone the lips were full and sensual and the eyes slanted upwards above high cheekbones and were closed as if in sleep it had a strong affinity with the statues of the hindu goddess kali which he had seen many times in indian temples he frowned slightly his mind grappling with the academic side of the problem and his eyes wandered to the high altar noticing the carved firebowl he remembered the roman cavalrymen and the old priestess who had remained to tend the flame and time seemed to have no meaning it was a circle turning upon itself endlessly marie moved beside him and said softly it gives me a strange feeling to know that he must have stood here alexias i mean kane nodded without speaking and they stayed there for a moment side by side thinking the same thoughts and then there was a sudden commotion in the entrance as kane turned a man in dustcovered khaki clothes moved towards them he wore an arab headcloth and sand goggles covered his eyes when he was a few feet away he paused and regarded them silently for a moment before removing the goggles it was professor muller he bowed stiffly i trust you ladies have not been seriously inconvenienced kane took a quick step forward but before he could speak a familiar voice said ah my good friend captain kane so you managed to get here after all and skiros stepped out of the gloom eleven it was almost noon when the two guards came to the temple for kane marie and ruth cunningham had been removed earlier that morning and shortly afterwards jamal had also been taken away alone in the temple with his guards kane had spent the time going over events again and again in his mind but it was no use he couldnt make sense of any of it if muller had stumbled across the temple by chance then why hadnt he announced his discovery it would have made him worldfamous and what about skiros and selim where did they fit in the problem offered no solution and he waited with mounting impatience until the two bedouins came for him emerging from the cool halflight of the temple he paused at the top of the steps momentarily dazzled by the strong sun one of his guards pushed him forward so that he stumbled down several steps almost losing his balance the two men seemed to find the incident amusing and kane by a supreme effort of will choked back his anger and walked docilely between them his eyes keenly searching the valley as they advanced the rock walls were covered with inscriptions and at several points he noticed the dark openings of caves quite suddenly the floor of the gorge dipped slightly and beneath them in a hollow he saw an encampment of several tents beside a green oasis of palm trees it was the numbers of men and camels which surprised kane as he moved down into the camp on every side men sweated in the hot sun loading the great beasts with heavy boxes as if preparing to move out he lost count of the tribes represented halfnaked yemenis in coloured turbans their bodies tattooed and smeared with indigo dye rashid bedouins musabein bal harith they were all there as his guards hustled him through the throng heads turned curiously they halted outside the largest tent and motioned him inside kane pulled back the flap and entered muller was sitting at a small folding table drinking coffee and examining a potsherd with a magnifying glass he looked up and smiled ah kane come in come in kane sat down on a camp stool opposite and muller lifted the pot and smiled again coffee kane nodded and the german filled a cup and pushed it across kane leaned forward arms resting on the table what have you done with the women muller looked pained we are not barbarians they are under guard in a nearby tent they will find it more comfortable than the temple thats most considerate of you kane said and what have you done with cunningham you will be joining him presently muller said calmly but first skiros wishes to see you kane said what the hell is all this about anyway muller got to his feet and reached for his hat but that is why i sent for you my friend that is what you are about to find out he pushed back the tent flap and kane followed him they moved through the oasis climbing up towards one side of the gorge the two bedouins at their heels and men passed them going down to the oasis heavy boxes on their shoulders they mounted a narrow ramp which seemed to be cut out of solid rock at the top there was the entrance to a cave with a sentry standing beside it and men worked stripped to the waist dragging out more boxes which they stacked ready to be carried down to the encampment muller brushed past them and kane followed the cave was of no great size but there seemed to be a variety of technical equipment piled on every side skiros was sitting before a complicated shortwave transmitting and receiving set as they came in he removed the earphones from his head and swivelled on his stool ah captain kane so you have arrived there was a pleasant smile on his face as if this were some kind of party and kane an eagerly awaited guest quite a setup you have here kane said skiros nodded we are rather proud of it he took a packet from his breast pocket and held it out cigarette kane took one and said dont you think its time someone told me what this is all about skiros nodded but of course why else are you here he gestured towards the stacked boxes help yourself the boxes were made of metal and painted a dull grey kane pulled one forward and undipped the lid it was expertly packed with rifles new and shining with grease from the factory the next one contained submachine guns he took one out and examined it closely it had been manufactured in germany he turned his eyes hard i underestimated you i thought maybe you were smuggling archaeological finds out of the country illegally but this skiros smiled complacently yes its quite something щщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщi c u t a щщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщ jh jj ft isnt it we were extremely lucky finding such a place thanks to muller until cunningham arrived that must have been quite a shock skiros shook his head a slight inconvenience thats all kane turned again to the stacked cases of arms and kicked one of the boxes i suppose this is why the british have been having so much trouble with the tribes on the oman border skiros smiled we do our small best but the arms are simply a payment to the tribesmen for helping us what they do with them is their own business kane looked at the boxes again those submachine guns are german mps the best so youre not even greek my mother was and her name was skiros but im proud to say my father was a german it doesnt matter what his name was kane turned and looked at muller who had been standing silently by his side and how does muller fit into the picture quite neatly skiros said he discovered the existence of this place from an old bedouin who staggered into his camp near shabwa one night dying of thirst kane said for gods sake why did you have to deal with a vulture like this muller any one of a dozen foundations in europe or america would have gladly given you financial backing muller looked embarrassed there were reasons indeed there were skiros laughed as you wont be going anywhere i see no reason not to tell you the truth my friend like me the professor is a german a good german we serve the third reich and our fiihrer adolf hitler my god kane said i work for the abwehr you know what that is german military intelligence exactly were going to win the coming war my friend the day after tomorrow is the ist of september thats when we invade poland madness kane said youll all go down to hell together i dont think so you see we have the big battalions we also have captain carlos romero and his friends who are spanish volunteers in the ss they will arrive here in the catalina tomorrow the following day they will land on the suez canal seed it with mines and blow it up that should give our english friends in egypt and london something to chew on kane struggled to take it all in i cant believe it a matter of indifference to me kane took a deep breath what happens now to you skiros shrugged for a day or two muller has a use for you but after that his voice trailed away and he sighed as if genuinely sorry that wouldnt be very wise kane said skiros raised his eyebrows slightly presumably you have a reason for saying that kane tried to sound completely sure of himself i sent a letter to the american consul at aden telling him exactly where we were going he shrugged it was a natural precaution anything can happen in the desert you know that youre lying of course kane shook his head i gave you the letter to put in the mail bag for me remember very clever my friend skiros said softly complete panic had appeared on mullers face and he subsided on to an ammunition box and wiped sweat from his face and neck with a handkerchief weve got to get out of here he said and his voice was shaking pull yourself together skiros selected a cigarette and tapped it on the packet thoughtfully kane smiled if we dont return within a reasonable period of time the american consul in aden will set the usual machinery in motion theyre bound to come looking for us skiros smiled thinly quite correct but as you your self have so helpfully pointed out the consul will make no move until a reasonable period of time has elapsed kane cursed softly because skiros was right and he knew it the troubled frown disappeared from mullers face and he sagged with relief god in heaven but youre right skiros nodded complacently you should know by now that invariably i am the american consul will make no move for at least a month we on the other hand will be out of here within two days two days muller said and he seemed to be genuinely perturbed that doesnt leave me much time i dont know if well be through by then frankly my dear muller the question of whether or not you manage to break into your wretched tomb before we leave doesnt interest me can i put kane to work with the other two muller asked skiros turned to kane im sure you wont object after all this sort of work is more in your line kane tried to think of something to say but for the moment he was beaten i guess this is your round skiros grinned goodhumouredly thats it kane be philosophical about the thing all at once his manner changed and he became brisk and businesslike and now you must excuse me i have much to do he swung round in his chair and picked up the earphones muller touched kane on the arm and led the way outside he turned to the right and walked along a broad ledge to where two armed men squatted before the entrance to another cave it was no more than four feet high and kane bent down to peer inside muller wiped sweat from his face with a handkerchief and said awkwardly im sorry about this kane im not in the mood to take confession today kane told him what am i supposed to do in here just inside the entrance was a spotlamp and the german switched it on and led the way in the cave was only thirty or forty feet across and the roof a couple of feet above their heads the powerful beam moved slowly across the wall and with startling suddenness the outlines of two human figures with bows in their hands sprang into life kane went forward and examined the figures with interest polychrome wall painting he said touching them gently with his fingers remarkably well preserved what date would you give them muller asked kane shrugged his animosity for the moment forgotten its hard to tell ive seen the same sort of thing in the hoggar mountains in the sahara but comparisons are difficult id say at least eight thousand years old are there any more the german swung the lamp picking out several rock etchings and the beam came to rest upon a pile of rubble at the rear of the cave beside a narrow opening i think you will find this much more interesting it was obviously the work of man and blocks of drafted masonry had been removed to open a passage beyond and you think this is the entrance to a tomb kane said what else could it be muller asked the temple is sabean if not older if this valley was some sort of holy place it would be natural to assume that burials took place here since entering the cave kane had been conscious of faint sounds and now a light appeared in the dark passage and jamal emerged a lamp in one hand dragging a large basket filled with rubble he stood for a moment and looked at them calmly his great body streaked with dust and sweat and then he emptied the basket and disappeared back into the darkness presumably cunningham is in there also kane said muller nodded his help although unwillingly given has been of great assistance over the past few weeks theres just one thing i cant understand kane said youve plenty of bedouins in camp why havent you used a few of them as labourers muller sighed in the first place skiros is not exactly sympathetic to my work and refuses his permission in any case they are all incurably superstitious they believe these caves to be haunted by evil spirits before kane could reply a voice interrupted from behind if you care to examine the roof youll find a much more cogent reason for their reluctance to work in here the whole damned lot is ready to fall as soon as anyone coughs the man who emerged from the passage was of medium height and wiry stripped to the waist and like jamal coated with dust from head to foot muller ignored the remark how are things progressing today cunningham no better than yesterday or the day before cunningham replied as far as im concerned were getting nowhere fast youll need a squad of labourers and pneumatic drills if you want to get anywhere with this lot i agree with you my friend but what can i do muller said however ive brought you a new recruit kane here has had a great deal of experience at this sort of thing im sure youll be able to work something out between you id like to point out that i havent eaten for some considerable time now kane said til have some food sent up later this afternoon muller told him in return i shall naturally expect to see some results he went outside leaving them alone cunningham leaned against the wall and ran a hand wearily over his face and who the hell might you be are you anything to do with the big fellow they dumped in here this morning i havent been able to get a word out of him that isnt surprising kane said he hasnt got a tongue but theres nothing wrong with his hearing as long as you can speak either somali or arabic cunningham laughed well my arabic isnt too bad ill have to bow out on the somali question kane held out his hand my name is kane he said your wife hired me to find you when she received the letter youd left with the british consul in aden cunningham straightened and his voice was strained with excitement ruth sent you have you seen her recently only a couple of hours ago kane told him shes up above with a friend of mine called marie ferret im afraid muller and skiros grabbed the lot of us how is she cunningham demanded is she all right she was in good spirits when i last saw her but very worried about you cunningham sat down on the pile of rubbish i think youd better bring me up to date old man kane spoke quickly telling him everything that had happened since his first meeting with ruth cunningham on the jetty at bahrein including what skiros had just told him when he had finished cunningham said its quite a story kane nodded i suppose it is but what happened to you cunningham laughed bitterly i was a damned fool i can see that now for various reasons it was important to me that the discovery of this place should be my own unaided work when i arrived at bir el madani i realized i couldnt hope to penetrate the desert on my own i managed to find a rashid bedouin brave enough or stupid enough to accompany me presumably you charted a course across the empty quarter from shabwa to marib and hoped for the best cunningham nodded it was surprisingly easy we had a spare camel and carried plenty of water on the second day we found that pillar the one where we discovered the aluminium waterbottle cunningham nodded we camped there for the night it was empty and i was cutting down on weight frankly i never expected to find any of the pillars left standing that was the only one we saw kane told him i did find another one cunningham said it was lying on its side halfburied what happened when you got here it was a bad business as we entered the gorge they swarmed all over us my rashid was a brave man he tried to put up a fight but they shot him down they put me into cold storage at the bottom of a disused well until skiros arrived the following day on two occasions since ive been here the catalina you mention has landed on the flat plain outside the gorge i think skiros intended to kill me but then muller arrived and suggested he might have a use for me on this job skiros let him have his way im afraid youve only postponed the evil day kane told him cunningham shrugged wearily i dont give a damn about myself its ruth im worried about kane nodded i know how you feel but were not through yet well think of something where do they put you at night cunningham laughed shortly until a week ago i slept in one of the tents under guard i tried to make a run for it one night but im afraid i didnt get very far since then ive been back in the well sounds lousy kane said cunningham shrugged at least its dry i shouldnt imagine theres been any water in the damned thing for a thousand years or more he got to his feet and stretched wed better get started muller can be surpris ingly nasty if he doesnt think enough works been done he picked up the spotlamp and led the way into the passage it was perhaps sixty or seventy feet long and sloped downwards at the far end jamal was filling a basket the blade of his shovel flashing in the lamplight there was barely enough room for two men to work sidebyside jamal turned at the sound of the approach kane slapped him on the shoulder and the somali went back to his digging as you can see conditions arent too good cunningham said kane examined the walls closely with one of the lamps and frowned ive excavated rock tombs in the mountains around shabwa but ive never come across one with an entrance like this cunningham nodded i think muller is barking up the wrong tree he doesnt even know for certain that the temple was constructed by balquis queen of sheba i do thats the one comforting thing ive heard today kane told him but i must say id like to know where this damned tunnel leads myself theres only one way to find out cunningham said handing him a shovel kane paused only to strip to the waist and then he moved in beside the somali and started to dig in berlin at turpitz ufer canaris was working at his desk when ritter came in ive just heard from skiros ritter said the admiral sat back everything on schedule absolutely what happens to romero and his friends after they leave the catalina theyll be picked up by a member of our egyptian bureau and driven straight to italian territory excellent canaris smiled not long now hans no herr admiral carry on canaris said and ritter went out twelve the moon had risen over the rim of the gorge and the valley was filled with its eerie radiance when muller had them taken down to the encampment emerging from the cave kane stretched to ease his tired muscles and paused at the sight of the temple bathed in moonlight it looked incredibly beautiful and aweinspiring but the guards apparently felt otherwise the muzzle of a rifle dug painfully into his back and he was urged on down the slope it was quiet in the valley and the shadows and loneliness moved in from the desert as they passed between the tents and entered the trees somewhere a camel coughed and an arab stood kneedeep in the pool and washed himself pausing to watch curiously as they passed on the other side of the trees they halted beside a small horseshoe of rock that surrounded a round black hole perhaps five feet in diameter a heavy rope was secured to a nearby palm tree and one of the guards picked up the free end and tossed it down into the darkness cunningham went down first straddling the rope holding it tightly between his hands and walking backwards over the rim of the hole when the somali had followed him muller turned to kane and spread his hands in a characteristic gesture i am sorry about this my friend but skiros insists he considers you to be a very resourceful man save your breath kane said coldly he picked up the rope without another word and began the descent the shaft had been hewn roughly from solid rock and his feet gripped the sides easily he paused once and looked up at the stars gleaming in the round opening and then all at once they seemed very far away and beneath him there was a slight movement hands reached out for his feet guiding him down as the shaft widened and he dropped into soft sand as he picked himself up the rope disappeared into the darkness above brushing against his face the sensation was so unpleasant that he moved back sharply and bumped into someone stay where you are cunningham said they usually send down a basket with food in it a moment later he grunted in satisfaction got it he took kane by the elbow six careful paces and youll find the wall kane moved through the darkness hands outstretched until his fingers brushed on stone he sat down back against the wall aware that jarnal was beside him and cunningham shared out the food when they had finished eating they discussed the situation have you ever tried to get out kane said cunningham got to his feet if it were daylight i could show you the shaft widens about five feet above our heads if it were not for that there might be a chance of scaling the main shaft its narrow enough and the walls are of roughly hewn stone kane fumbled in his shirt pocket and took out a book of matches as the first one flared he held it high above his head cunningham was right the bottom of the shaft widened considerably the match burned his fingers and he dropped it with a muffled curse he turned to cunningham i suppose you know were living on borrowed time weve got one more day at the most frankly weve got two choices we either get out of this hole or die im with you there cunningham said but how the hell do we manage it kane moved across to jamal squatted in front of him and started to speak slowly and clearly in arabic when he had finished the big somali squeezed his shoulder to indicate that he had understood and got to his feet kane turned to cunningham jamal is so incredibly strong he might be able to push me high enough into that shaft to get some kind of grip in the narrow part ill climb on to his shoulders and i want you to stand behind to steady me its worth a try i suppose cunningham said jamal stood beneath the shaft and kane scrambled up on to his shoulders very carefully he pushed himself erect and raised his hands above his head they just reached inside the shaft now he said in arabic and jamals great hands moved under his feet lifting him bodily into the air kane clawed desperately for a grip panic moved inside him as the somalis arms started to tremble and then his hands fastened into a crack in the rock and he heaved desperately a moment later he was securely wedged in the shaft his back against one side his feet against the other he worked his way steadily upwards pausing every so often for a rest the rough stonework dug painfully into his back but he hung on grimly and gradually the opening of the shaft increased in size until he was resting a foot or so beneath the rim he quickly pulled himself over the edge and crawled towards the rope at that precise moment two bedouins appeared from amongst the palm trees and stood in a patch of moonlight a few feet away from the shaft talking idly he had flattened himself into the sand at the first sound now he carefully inched forward into the shadows and worked his way into the trees for the moment there was nothing he could do for cunningham and jamal the two bedouins were armed and one carried a rifle crooked in his arm it would be impossible to tackle both of them he got to his feet and walked quietly away through the palm trees towards the encampment as he approached he could hear singing the bedouins were squatting round a great flaring fire and several of them danced together weaving an intricate pattern in and out of the firelight one man played on a herd boys pipe another beat monotonously on a small skin drum the rest sat crosslegged in a circle clapping their hands in time to the music and swaying their bodies rhythmically he skirted the fire keeping to the shadows and moved in among the tents the first two he examined were empty and he bypassed the largest one two guards stood before a tent on the far side of the encampment he circled round behind and crawled into the shadows at the base of the tent he could hear movement inside and then ruth cunningham murmured something he couldnt quite catch and marie replied he gently slackened one of the guy ropes and lifted the bottom edge of the tent a couple of inches by lying flat on the ground he could just see inside marie was sitting on a sleeping bag her back only six inches from him and ruth cunningham was nearer the entrance kane said softly marie dont look round tell ruth to keep on talking maries shoulders stiffened under the thin material of her shirt and then she leaned forward and spoke softly to the other girl ruth cunningham gave a startled gasp and then she seemed to get control of herself she started to talk loudly discussing what had happened and speculating on the future marie stretched fulllength on her sleeping bag and halfturned her head so that she looked directly at kane their mouths were only three or four inches apart i cant do anything at the moment im not armed he said how are they treating you so far all right but im not happy about the way selim stares at ruth he looks as if he has the worst of all possible intentions kane tried to sound reassuring well have to do something about that ive got to rejoin the others now whatever happens dont worry with any luck we should be back here in an hour to get you out he started to move away and paused tell ruth her husband is fit and well maries hand slid under the edge of the tent and caressed his face gently her eyes were like dark water full of dangerous currents that seemed to draw him in he raised the edge of the tent a little more and she pushed her face towards him until their lips met it was no kiss of passion it was the kiss of a woman who loves deeply and tenderly with every fibre of her being for a moment his hand tightened over hers and then he moved away quickly as he advanced cautiously through the trees towards the wellshaft he heard someone coming towards him he dropped flat on his face behind a tree and waited one of the men he had seen earlier walked past him so close that kane could have touched the hem of his robe when he reached the edge of the trees he could see the remaining bedouin standing by the mouth of the shaft the man had no rifle and kane waited until he turned to look along the valley and moved soundlessly across the sand the bedouin stood no chance one arm encircled his throat effectively choking back his cry of fear as kane relentlessly applied pressure for a moment or two the man struggled and then his body went limp kane dragged him across to the trees and left him lying in the shadows the rope was still lying coiled by the tree to which it was attached kane tossed it down the shaft and called softly get up here as fast as you can he waited eyes anxiously probing the trees towards the camp within a few moments cunningham was by his side and then jamal they moved into the trees and kane quickly explained the situation the two women are under guard in one of the tents the way i see it there isnt much point in trying to take over the camp without weapons i suggest we make for the cave where skiros stores his arms theres also a radio there if we cant raise mukalla or aden we can probably reachjordan sounds like the most sensible course to me cunningham said kane explained rapidly to jamal in arabic and moved off through the trees towards the encampment they skirted the fire round which most of the bedouins were still singing and dancing and crawled through the camp keeping close to the ground as they passed the rear of the largest tent kane paused as mullers voice sounded clearly on the night air he touched cunningham lightly on one shoulder and moved closer to the tent skiros was speaking now and he sounded pleased with himself im glad i got in touch with headquarters on the radio he said it was fortunate also that i was able to contact romero theyll arrive tonight but i cant see the point muller said skiros sighed you are really incredibly stupid muller our work here is finished as i told kane earlier im sure were safe for a month at least but life has a perverse habit of playing strange tricks on a man thats why were going to take this unique opportunity of flying out in the catalina with romero well all go to egypt together muller cheer up youll be part of history what about the prisoners selim interrupted kane could almost see the indifferent smile on skiross fat face til leave you to take care of the men the women will go with us in the catalina but you promised the cunningham woman to me selim said angrily ive changed my mind since then skiros said and his voice was cold dont let us forget who is running things here you can find yourself another woman what will happen to them muller said i really couldnt say skiros told him i look upon the ferret woman as a personal challenge making her see reason will be a pleasure somewhere in the distance a faint humming sounded on the night air and skiros got to his feet there is the plane gentlemen right on time take the women down to the truck selim muller and i will join you there cunningham moved suddenly but kane grabbed him by the shoulder pulled him back to the ground dont be a damned fool he whispered into his ear they crawled out through the encampment and melted into the shadows as kane led the way up the steep slope to the base of the cliff cunninham said what the hell are we going to do now theres only one thing we can do kane told him stop that plane but weve got to move fast they walked quietly along the stone ramp and cautiously approached the mouth of the cave which contained the arms a lone arab lounged against the rock rifle carelessly slung over his back he was singing a sad monotonous herding song his eyes staring up at the stars kane pressed jamal on the shoulder and the huge somali moved silently the song ended abruptly on a high note there was a sudden cracking sound as if a dry branch had been snapped and jamal lowered the dead man to the ground the cave was in darkness and kane struck a match as he led the way in there was a large spot lamp standing on top of the radio and he quickly switched it on and turned to the cases of arms there were only a few left the first two he examined were packed with rifles but the third contained submachine guns a further search disclosed a box filled with circular hundredround clips kane handed cunningham and the somali two clips each what about the radio cunningham said kane shook his head as he loaded his weapon no time for that now as they went outside there was the sound of an engine and a truck moved away towards the temple and the outlet to the desert kane cursed and started to run down the slope most of the bedouins were still gathered around the fire and he moved quickly through the shadows towards the other end of the encampment the truck in which they had arrived that morning was standing on the edge of the tents in brilliant moonlight he said quietly to cunningham shes ours you take the wheel and drive like youve never driven before they moved out of the shadows and scrambled in as cunningham pressed the starter there was a sudden shrill cry from behind kane turned as several bedouins ran forward he raised his submachine gun and fired a quick burst and they scattered into the darkness at the same moment cunningham took the truck away on a burst of speed as they topped the rise in front of the temple and hurtled towards the entrance to the gorge the catalina roared overhead undercarriage and flaps down as it pointed for a landing on the flat plain outside give it everything youve got kane cried and cunningham pressed his foot flat on the boards the truck bounced over the rockstrewn surface of the valley and he fought for control and then they were out in the open and chasing the plane over on their right and clearly visible in the moonlight was the other truck as they approached kane could clearly see selim sitting in the rear skiros and muller in front skiross face was contorted with anger and he shouted something over his shoulder to the arab as they drew abreast selim raised a rifle and fired skiros swung the other truck towards them and selim fired again kane ducked as the windscreen shattered and cunningham jerked the wheel desperately to one side and they skidded round in a complete circle for the moment they were safe and able to concentrate on the plane which was starting to touch down as romero applied his brakes dust and sand rose into the night in a great cloud sitting in the second pilots seat noval turned and grabbed romeros shoulder theres a firefight going on out there lets get out of here give me a chance for gods sake romero said and boosted power kane glanced back and saw that the other truck was overtaking them fast and cunningham swung the wheel in a halfcircle that took them into the centre of the great dust cloud that was the planes wake for several moments they drove jblind choking and coughing heads lowered against the stinging particles and then the englishman swung the wheel again and they shot out into the moonlight the catalina was now taxiing towards the valley entrance at twenty or thirty miles an hour cunningham jerked the wheel spinning the truck and a moment later they were driving on a parallel course cunningham moved closer and kane and jamal stood up and started to pour a concentrated fire into the plane at pointblank range kane could see romero high up in the nose of the aircraft the dim light from the instrument panel illuminating his face he raised his submachine gun and fired several times into the cabin romero ducked out of sight and the tail of the plane slewed round in a great arc throwing a cloud of sand into the air cunningham spun the wheel in a reflex action that took them out of harms way as the plane turned completely round and started to move out into the desert again the engine note deepening as romero prepared to take off and then the entire aircraft seemed to shake from side to side and slewed violently to the left a moment later it lurched forward on to its nose and ploughed into the sand for about a hundred yards before coming to rest in a mass of twisted metal orange tongues of flame leaping upwards into the night there was an explosion followed by another as the tanks went up cunningham turned the wheel quickly turning away as fingers of flame reached out to touch them and pieces of twisted metal hummed through the air the other truck was moving fast towards the gorge and they gave chase bounding over the ground like some living thing kane stood with one foot on the running board his eyes never leaving the taillight of the other vehicle submachine gun ready as they passed into the gorge the truck bounced high into the air as it lifted over a slight rise in the ground and he was swung violently sideways the submachine gun went flying into the night as he crashed into the soft sand and rolled over and over as the truck braked to a halt thirty or forty yards away it came under heavy fire and kane saw several bedouins appear from behind the jumbled boulders which at this point fringed the bottom of the cliffs he could hear the bullets thudding into the body of the truck and he scrambled to his feet and cried get to hell out of here cunningham get the women the truck moved away at once and kane crouched low searching desperately for his submachine gun he saw it lying in a patch of moonlight and ran forward to retrieve it there was a complete silence for a moment or two and then a stone rattled he fired into the night he threw himself behind a boulder as several shots replied whining through the air above his head and ricocheting from the cliffs as they finished he slipped behind the boulder and keeping to the shadows ran along the valley behind him they still fired blindly but for the moment he was alone he ran along the great avenue which led to the temple crossed in front of it and continued towards the oasis when he reached the rim of the hollow he paused and looked down into the encampment cunningham had halted the truck some twenty or thirty yards away from the tents and he and jamal were sheltering behind it several bedouins were moving higher up the slope on their right with the obvious intent of being able to shoot down on them as kane was about to shout a warning cunningham looked up and saw the danger he tapped jamal on the shoulder and they turned and scrambled up the slope towards the cave where the arms were keeping in the shadows for the moment they had not been seen and skiros was not aware of their departure there was a short period of silence and kane started to work his way diagonally up the slope he paused behind a boulder and looked up as cunningham and the somali reached the ledge several yemenis breasted the slope cutting them off cunningham fired a long burst to keep their heads down and he and jamal turned and ran for the shelter of the other cave kane slipped from behind the boulder and scrambled up the slope to join them praying the shadows would hide him from the valley below he heard a cry of anger from selim and immediately afterwards heavy firing commenced he was gasping for breath and he hugged the submachine gun tightly to his chest with one hand and clawed at the loose soil with the other he could hear the roars of men behind him as they started to follow and then there was a long continuous roll of thunder above his head he looked up to see cunningham crouched on the ledge submachine gun to his shoulder kane fell forward on to his face and jamals strong hands lifted him and dragged him towards the cave they stumbled inside and cunningham crouched at the entrance his face clearly illuminated by a broad tracer of moonlight which streamed through touching the entrance to the passage that was a pretty closerun thing kane said after a while cunningham nodded we couldnt pour it in hot and strong down there i was frightened we might hit the women kane nodded thats his trump card and skiros knows it several bullets whined through the entrance and spattered against the cave wall and he looked out cautiously the floor of the valley was dappled with moonlight and the enemy were clearly visible as they advanced from boulder to boulder wait until theyre halfway up the slope and fire when i give the order kane said they waited in silence skiros was in the lead and once he looked up towards them the moonlight falling clearly on his face kane grunted ill say this for the bastard hes got guts and then skiros had reached the large boulder splashed with moonlight which kane had chosen as the halfway mark now he said and pressed the trigger the three guns chattered in unison and there were screams and cries of dismay from below as several arabs rolled down the slope to the floor of the valley the rest of them retreated fast followed by skiros cursing at the top of his voice in german in the silence which followed cunningham sighed deeply well that looks like that for the moment kane shook his head he isnt going to put up with much of this ive a feeling hell come up with something nasty at any moment as he spoke skiros walked forward kane he called im not going to waste words on you ill give you fifteen minutes to come down with your hands up if you dont something unpleasant will happen to the ladies im sure you and cunningham dont want that kane touched jamal on the shoulder and the three of them got up and moved back from the entrance hes got us cold cunningham said we cant let him hurt the women kane shook his head and his eyes were grim if he wants to harm them he will and nothing we do will have any effect on him he shook his head i think hes stalling hes probably got some scheme cooking at that moment there was a movement high up on the face of the cliff outside and the stones rattled down on to the ledge in a fine spray i told you the bastard had something up his sleeve kane said and then a grenade rolled inside the entrance of the cave clearly visible in the patch of moonlight he turned pushing cunningham and the somali violently backwards into the narrow entrance of the tomb and followed them dropping to his hands and knees the grenade exploded bringing down a shower of stones into the entrance then the whole cliff seemed to tremble and the roof started to cave in muller stared up at the cloud of dust clear in the moonlight oh my god now what we get the hell out of here skiros said back to dahrein leave on selims dhow at least that bastard kane and his friends have had it i hope he takes a long time to die entombed in there but berlin the fiihrer what will happen to us nothing you fool ill get straight on the radio tell ritter the catalina crashed hardly our fault and all they need to know and the women they can come with us for the time being now pull yourself together and lets get moving he turned and went back down to the camp waving selim and the remaining bedouins to follow him in berlin canaris was standing at the window of his office having a cognac when there was a knock on the door and ritter entered the young major was pale and obviously disturbed bad news hans operation sheba herr admiral ive had a rather garbled message from skiros hes closing down and getting out there was trouble of some sort the catalina destroyed romero and his men dead how very unfortunate canaris said but the fiihrer herr admiral what will he say the fiihrer hans has a tendency to be very excited about something on monday which he has totally forgotten about by friday canaris smiled and after all he still has poland can you be certain hell react in this way ritter said of course ive had considerable experience as regards the fiihrers mental processes hans canaris went and got another glass here have a cognac when youve been in this game as long as i have you learn to take the rough with the smooth if you say so herr admiral oh but i do canaris raised his glass to the third reich hans and may it last a thousand years he laughed and if you believe that youll believe anything thirteen the cave was in complete darkness and kane took out the small book of matches he had last used in the shaft there were only three left and he struck one with fingers that trembled slightly the small tongue of flame flowered outwards picking cunninghams sweating face from the darkness the englishman laughed shakily what happens now lets have some light on the situation kane said didnt you leave the tools and a spotlamp at this end of the passage when we finished work the match burned down to his finger and he dropped it and lit another he squatted holding the match at arms length and cunningham said got it a moment later a powerful beam of hard white light flooded across to the other side of the cave slicing the darkness in two the cave had decreased in size by at least a half and a sloping bank of rubble anld stones lifted backwards completely blocking the entrance it was unpleasantly warm and the air was heavy with settling dust and the acrid tang of explosives well whats our next move cunningham said kane started to take off his shirt i should have thought that was sufficiently obvious weve got to dig and keep on digging at least weve got the tools which is something and what about our friends outside as far as theyre concerned were dead meat kane said they probably think the damned mountain came in on us they wouldnt be far wrong either cunningham told him he flashed the spot up to the roof and around the walls the whole place still looks damned shaky to me kane took the spot from him and set it down on the floor so that the beam rested upon the rockfilled entrance the only thing weve got to worry about is the battery in this spotlamp youd better pray that it holds out long enough but there was more to worry about much more they laboured feverishly in the weird dustfilled light stripped to their waists sweat pouring freely from their naked bodies jamal was a tower of strength his great hands lifting unaided rocks which kane and cunningham could not have moved together time ceased to have any meaning as they worked on fingers bruised and raw finally jamal who was working a little in advance of kane gave a strange animal moan and moved backwards what is it kane demanded in arabic the somali turned the whites of his eyes shining in the light of the lamp he pointed and kane crawled forward into the narrow cutting they had cleared into the heart of the rockfall the beam from the spot picked out an immense slab of stone weighing at least three or four tons which stretched across their path firmly wedged into place with rocks of varying sizes cunningham crouched at his shoulder and whistled softly my god we havent a hope in hell of moving that thing he had stated the obvious and there was no answer they moved back slowly and slumped down against the wall beside the entrance to the passage kane sat looking at the beam of the spot for a moment and then he leaned down and switched it off no sense in wasting the battery cunningham laughed lightly and kane knew that he was near to breakingpoint its damned warm in here i wish i had a cigarette neither of them had put it into words and yet it lay between them like a sword the unspoken undeniable fact that they were finished that there was no hope left їщ щщщщщщїщщщщщщщщщщїщщщщщщщ sheb a щщщщщщщщщїщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщ the darkness settled upon them with a weightless pressure something seemed to move through it in a soundless wave and a strange sibilant whispering echoed through the cave as if someone had sighed and the sounds were moving on for ever like the ripples in a pool kane shivered and pushed the thought away from him it was unhealthy to give way to despair too soon he had to keep his mind active he had to think of something other than this box of darkness he started to think about the past letting his thoughts drift back examining each milestone in his life the good and the bad only once before had he been in such a hopeless position second pilot on an army air corps dcj flying to guam in the pacific theyd come down in the pacific ten people including passengers and one liferaft sharks nosing around within an hour by the third day they were down to four by the seventh day two and just when hed thought he was about to die thered been a droning noise in the sky hed looked up and there it was a catalina coming in to land twice in his life catalinas had been significant one had saved him the other he had destroyed and then home he remembered that first day flying into la guardia and seeing new york again but where was home was it an apartment overlooking central park was it his fathers farm in connecticut it was neither of these places it did not exist in fact but only in the heart and he had searched for a long time never finding always seeking maries face seemed to flame out of the darkness at him and he laughed softly at least one good thing had come out of all this he knew now that she was important to him more important than anything in his life the thought of her was warm and comforting rather like the kiss she had given him earlier but he would never be able to tell her these things now he got to his feet to stretch his aching limbs and a cold finger of air from the passage touched his flesh and he shivered it was a moment before its exact significance struck home and he dropped on his knees and searched in the darkness for the lamp cunningham blinked in the sudden glare whats the matter theres a current of cold air blowing from the tunnel kane told him cunningham frowned thats impossible where could it come from theres only one way to find out kane said he explained the situation to jamal in arabic and then followed cunningham along the passage to the spot where they had finished work earlier in the day the englishman dropped to his knees in front of the pile of rubble and stone that blocked the passage and cried out at once youre right kane i can feel cold air on my body kane dropped down beside him and was at once aware of the pressure of air against his bare chest one things for sure he said muller was wrong whatever else it might be this isnt the entrance into a rock tomb then where the hell does it lead cunningham demanded kane grinned to a better hole than this thats for certain jamal had gone for the tools and now he returned and kane and cunningham started to dig the space was confined and after a while the somali pulled them out of the way to manhandle a large stone with his bare hands a hole appeared and air came through in a sudden rush jamal carefully lifted several other stones out of the way and then he was on his belly and crawling forward kane held the spot on him and he and cunningham watched the somali vanish after a short time his head appeared and his mouth opened in a huge grin he beckoned to them and cunningham dropped to his stomach and crawled forward followed by kane on the other side of the barrier of stones the passage was clear but the roof was considerably lower and they had to walk bent double kane followed the englishman closely holding the spotlamp extended in front of him they came to the end of the tunnel and crawled out on a shelving bank of shale it sloped steeply down for fifty or sixty feet into the dark swirling waters of a river that welled up from the base of the cave and flowed out through a narrow gap between rocks kane swung the spotlamp in an arc the roof was shrouded in darkness and must have been of great height and the stone walls were black and grim and sweated moisture cunningham squatted on his haunches heels digging into the loose shale there doesnt seem a great deal of choice does there that about sums the situation up kane told him you wait here and ill go back for the guns when he returned jamal and the englishman were at the waters edge and as kane slithered cautiously down the steep bank the somali backed slowly into the river cunningham grasping both his hands the water rose to his waist and then stopped he advanced carefully hands extended in front of him after touching the opposite wall with his fingertips he waded back a broad grin on his face cunningham laughed excitedly it looks as if our lucks beginning to turn lets hope so kane said їщщщщщщщщщщщщщщїщщщщщщїщщщщщщщщщщщ s h e b a щщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщ he distributed the guns and gavejamal the spotlamp the somali led the way and he and cunningham slipped down into the water and followed it was bitterly cold and after a while the water lifted to kanes armpits at first he held the submachine gun high above his head but soon his arms began to ache with the effort and he slung it over one shoulder allowing it to dangle in the river gradually the current increased in force as the gap through which the river was running narrowed he was only a foot or so behind cunningham and he could see jamal in front holding the spotlamp high out of the water the roof seemed to come down to meet him and he realized that it was only two or three feet above his head he pushed furiously as the current lifted him and then he seemed to slide downwards in a rush and the water covered his head his feet touched bottom and he kicked upwards then he surfaced to the light shining in his eyes and his knees banged against a gently sloping bank of shale he stayed there for a moment his chest heaving painfully after a time he realized that cunningham lay beside him and jamal gave them a hand up and they stood kneedeep in water shivering in the intense cold the river had emptied into a large round pool and the only apparent exit a narrow slot in the rock was blocked by a wall of dressed stones which stood some three feet above the surface of the water this looks as if its been here a hell of a long time cunningham said kane nodded but what purpose does it serve thats the question he took the spotlight from jamal and pulled himself up on top the wall was perhaps ten feet high and water oozed through numerous cracks and ran down a steep incline the sound of it echoing through the darkness this must have been the route the river followed originally kane said the wall was placed here to change its direction he shone the lamp down on the dark waters of the pool that means they must have constructed an artificial exit for this lot but why cunningham said god knows the reason isnt important now but finding a way out of this place is kane placed his submachine gun on the wall and gave cunningham the lamp let me have as much light as you can im going down to take a look he dropped into the water took a deep breath and went under the pool was about ten feet deep and the light from the spotlamp filtering down enabled him to find what he was looking for almost at once it was the entrance to a low arched tunnel some four feet high he pulled himself in and went forward his fingers brushed against the smooth slimy sides and then it was dark utterly dark and he turned in a panic and swam back towards the faint light of the lamp and surfaced rasping for air whats it like cunningham demanded kane waded out of the water and stood kneedeep on the bank of shale beside the wall bloody murder theres a tunnel thats hardly big enough to crawl through i swam along it for a few yards but it didnt seem to be getting anywhere he pulled himself up on to the wall and cunningham turned the beam of the lamp into the slot below once again we dont seem to have a great deal of choice do we climbing down presented no problem there were plenty of footholds where the mortar between blocks of stone had crumbled away leaving a score of deep cracks through which water trickled steadily the steeply inclined floor of the slot was slimy and treacherous to the feet and kane led the way cautiously for some fifty yards until the roof closed in on them and they were faced with a dark opening they moved inside and stood ankledeep in water and he flashed the lamp from side to side as the beam splayed across smooth walls thousands of tiny chisel marks sprang into view the river must have created this passage in the first place cunningham observed but someones certainly done a hell of a lot of work on it since kane moved forward slowly a strange excitement stirring inside him the sound of the river faded behind them and they were alone in a dark and mysterious world the passage twisted and turned moving down all the time and the water gradually deepened as they rounded a corner they came to an offshoot at one side cunningham glanced at kane enquiringly and kane shrugged may as well take a look they moved into a room about ten feet square with walls of drafted masonry great storejars each almost as tall as a man stood like silent sentinels on either side grain jars kane said as he turned away the beam of the lamp fell across the far wall and figures leapt to life in vivid colour the painting depicted some ancient triumph prisoners most of whom seemed to have short curling beards moved together in a column legs shackled backs bowed against the whips brandished by soldiers in fishtailed breastplates and helmets my god cunningham said have you ever seen anything like it only in the nile valley kane told him certainly not in arabia they moved out into the passage and continued past several other store rooms finally coming into a wider pillared passage the walls of which were covered with paintings at one point kane halted beside a nook inside which stood several clay jars with painted sides as he lifted one down to examine it cunningham moved forward excitedly theyre funeral urns arent they kane nodded the whole things beginning to click into place those grain jars and now these offerings to the gods for a safe journey we must be coming to a tomb he lifted the round lid of the jar and looked inside it was empty probably oil or spices or something like that gone with the years cunningham took down another jar which also proved to be empty kane was about to turn away when he noticed a smaller one the top held in place by clay seals standing on a small shelf at the back of the nook he put down the lamp with one hand and lifted the jar with the other as he stepped back it slipped from his fingers and smashed against the stone floor of the passage he lifted the lamp and as he directed the beam on the floor there was a glint of gold amongst the sharded pieces of clay and a flash of green fire he dropped to one knee and carefully picked it up it was a beautiful gold necklace and pendant carefully set in the gold filigree were three perfect emeralds sparkling in the lamplight cunningham whistled softly theyd give their eyeteeth to have that in the british museum kane took out his handkerchief and wrapped it carefully about the necklace knotting the ends before placing it in his pocket he picked up the lamp again ive an idea theres more up ahead much more he moved on quickly and they descended a short flight of steps and faced a bronze door by now the water was thighdeep and cunningham waded forward to lift the locking bar and he and jamal pulled the heavy door slowly outwards the bronze swing pins were set in holes drilled in the solid rock and the door swung open effortlessly with a slight eerie cracking sound for a moment kane stood there a wave of greyness sweeping through him as if by instinct he knew that they were on the verge of something tremendous and then cunningham pushed him forward impatiently fourteen they entered a large chamber which was about three feet deep in water it was otherwise completely empty but the walls were covered with paintings kane swung the beam of the lamp slowly along carefully examining them and something jumped out at him with the force of a physical shock the particular scene depicted a king standing before his throne at the top of a flight of steps around his neck was suspended the star of david he was holding out his hands in welcome to a woman who advanced to meet him her long train carried by twelve maidens for a moment she seemed to float out of the darkness but it was only a trick of the light she gazed out at him remote and austere her beauty fixed for eternity and he stared back above the painting was an inscription in sabean he translated it slowly and when he had finished the wall seemed to undulate and a strange quiet whisper rippled through the room as though her voice called to him across time itself he stretched out a hand and leaned his head against the cold stonework and behind him cunningham said what does it say kane pulled himself together it says solomon the great king greets balquis cunningham seemed to lurch to one side and jamal moved in quickly and caught him in the light of the lamp the englishmans face looked white and drawn the eyes suddenly enormous balquis he whispered queen of sheba he pulled away from jamal and moved forward and touched the painted figure very gently with his fingertips when he spoke there was awe in his voice a biblical legend and weve brought her to life kane turned and waded towards the far end of the chamber and the rays of the lamp picked out another entrance flanked by carved pillars in place of a door there was a wall of large dressed stones cunningham moved beside him what do you think he said and his voice was strained and unnatural i said there was a strong egyptian influence here kane told him there must be a stone burial chamber on the other side cunningham seemed to have difficulty in speaking he swallowed and said do you think it might be hers щ anythings possible in this business kane said you know that as well as i do cunningham nodded several times and turned and looked back towards the wall painting waves caused by their movement through the water rippled across the room and splashed against the wall and his breath hissed sharply between his teeth he grabbed the lamp from kanes hand plunged forward water foaming around him and dropped to his knees at the base of the painting of solomon and balquis he gave a cry of anguish the water kane its spoiling it part of the paintings gone already kane took the lamp from him and pulled him to his feet without saying anything thank god weve made the discovery when we have cunningham said another couple of years and that dam back there would have been down and the river flowing in everything would have been ruined i know kane said calmly cunningham laughed wildly for gods sake man dont you realize what weve found here the greatest archaeological discovery ever made well be worldfamous thats hardly likely kane said because the way things look you may never get the chance to tell anybody about it he turned from the sudden shock on the englishmans face gave the lamp to jamal and they waded towards the door cunningham stayed there in the middle of the chamber and they were already moving back along the passage before he started to follow as they ducked through the low entrance and climbed the steep incline to the wall that dammed in the pool cunningham caught up with kane and grabbed him by the shoulder his face was white and strained taut with anxiety weve got to get out of here now kane we must find a way finding a way is simple enough kane said i realize that now the problem for you will be whether youre willing to take it jamal quickly climbed the wall and then reached down and pulled them up in turn kane took the lamp and played the beam down into the pool and cunningham said you mean the underwater tunnel but you said it was impossible it wouldnt be if there was no water in it kane said cunningham frowned i dont understand its really quite simple we go back upriver for the tools we left in the cave the walls already in a pretty shaky state it wouldnt take us long to demolish enough of it to drain the pool and send the river back on its old course cunningham still had that slight frown on his face but you must be joking it would flood the passage and the main chamber probably even seep into the tomb those wall paintings wouldnt last a day under water theyd be destroyed for ever i know kane said patiently on the other hand i cant see that we have a great deal of choice im assuming of course that you still have an interest in your wifes welfare cunningham flinched as if he had received a physical blow he turned away as kane continued theres no need for you to come jamal and i can manage but im afraid well have to take the lamp ill try to be as quick as possible dont worry about me cunningham said without turning round ill be fine for a moment kane hesitated wondering whether the englishman intended to do something silly and then he shrugged and turned and explained the situation quickly in arabic to jamal the somali took the lamp and led the way back up the rock slide and into the dark mouth of the tunnel through which the river emptied into the pool the journey was not as bad as kane had thought it would be except for one or two deeper places where the gap narrowed and the current seemed to be trying to press him back with an implacable hand when they reached the steep bank of shale and scrambled up to the mouth of the tunnel which had granted them their freedom from the cave it had a strangely unfamiliar look like some place visited once and briefly years before and never again kane carried the three picks and jamal the hammers and crowbars and they went down the bank and entered the water again the return journey seemed only to take minutes and as jamal carefully negotiated the slide down into the pool the beam of the lamp splashed out across the wall there was no sign of the englishman they dropped the tools quickly and kane took the lamp and called cunningham the sound of his voice rebounded from the narrow walls of the cave but there was no reply he was about to call out again when there was the sound of a boot on stone in the darkness below he shone the beam down into the slot and picked out cunningham coming up the steep incline the englishman looked up at him calmly shading his eyes against the light you were quicker than i thought where the hell have you been kane demanded cunningham turned and looked back down the incline to the entrance to the tunnel i went for another look without a light kane said incredulously cunningham smiled and all at once the strain seemed to have left his face i couldnt see her but i knew she was there he took a deep breath down here at the base looks a good place to start some of these stones are halfrotten kane couldnt think of anything to say he nodded to jamal and went over the wall and the somali passed the tools down to them and they started work it took them half an hour to lever out the first stone and jamals great strength proved invaluable the pressure of the water pushed the stone the last few inches like a cork from a bottle and a great foaming jet splashed out into the slot and rushed down into the darkness below once the gap had been made the rest was easy jamal reached in water cascading over his back and pulled the next stone away by hand within a moment they were kneedeep in water and kane turned quickly to cunningham now weve made the breach the whole damned lot might come down wed better get back on the other side out of harms way they climbed over the wall and stood on the bank of shale and sand that had been formed by the years in the corner of the wall and the cave and gradually the level of the pool dropped by now the river as it emerged from the slide was finding its new exit and the wall started to vibrate with the shock after about half an hour it sagged in the centre and then cascaded outwards into the slot already the top of the tunnel was showing and within another ten minutes there was no more than two feet of water in it the somali took the lamp and ducked into the tunnel and kane slipped the sling of his submachine gun over his shoulder and followed as he plunged forward into the darkness water swirling around his knees he thought of the men who had worked here in the bowels of the earth all those years ago worked in the darkness patiently perhaps for years that their queen might have a secure restingplace in death the river emptied into a wide lake with startling suddenness and he found himself swimming again jamal held the lamp high above his head and its rays picked out a row of carved pillars on the far side and a landing stage the somali reached it first and heaved himself up with easy strength in spite of the fact that the water level of the lake had obviously dropped several feet he then knelt down and pulled up kane and cunningham in turn kane took the lamp and moved forward between the pillars and entered a wide passage which sloped gently upwards a few moments later the beam from the lamp splayed itself against a blank wall he dropped to one knee and examined it closely from the look of it this central block pivots he said to cunningham he spoke rapidly in arabic to jamal and the somali dropped to his knee and pushed against the great stone wall with all his strength it refused to budge the somali gave a grunt and his back ridged muscles standing out like cords still the stone remained immobile kane dropped to his knees and leaned a shoulder against the stone and cunningham moved in on the other side for a moment it was as if they were faced with all the power in the world as if something supernatural was determined they should not leave and then the stone turned with a groan kane scrambled to his feet and looked about him they were standing in the temple and the stone was one of those set in the base of the high altar they pushed it back into place moved outside and stood on the terrace the morning sun bright in their eyes the gorge lay still and calm about them and cunningham frowned its damned quiet most of the bedouins pulled out with that caravan yesterday afternoon kane reminded him the rest have probably made an early start this morning he led the way cautiously towards the encampment using what cover was available when he neared the edge of the hollow he got down on his belly and crawled the rest of the way the encampment no longer existed tents trucks everything had gone for a moment he lay there a frown on his face and then jamal tapped him on the shoulder and pointed beyond the oasis to where a faint tracer of smoke lifted into the morning air kane led the way down into the hollow unslinging his submachine gun as they neared the trees a camel coughed and there was the sound of laughter on the other side of the oasis two bedouin tents still stood with at least a dozen camels hobbled near by one man squatted before a small fire on which he was cooking and three more stood kneedeep in the pool and washed themselves kane turned to cunningham and said quietly you come in from the rear of the tents jamal can work his way round to the other side of the pool and ill go in from here he waited until they were in position and then stepped from behind a tree and went slowly forward he stopped a yard or so away from the fire the bedouin was stirring something in the pot he laughed looked up to call to the men washing and saw kane the laughter died in his throat do as youre told and you wont be harmed kane told him in arabic the man stood up slowly and shrugged i am not a fool he was older than kane had at first thought with a fine intelligent face seamed with wrinkles and an irongrey beard his three companions waded out of the pool to join him and jamal and cunningham moved in behind them where are the others kane demanded it was thought that you were dead the old man said the two franks and their men left in the trucks before first light the yemenis went at dawn why have you stayed we are rashid the old man said simply we do not abandon our kindred my cousin is lying in one of the tents you put a bullet in his shoulder last night one of the franks removed it before they left and the women the old man shrugged they went in the trucks kane turned to cunningham did you manage to get all that the englishman nodded what do we do now the only thing we can do get after them kane turned back to the old rashid youll have to help us there was a murmur of discontent from the other three and the old man stilled them by raising a hand why should we you are our enemies because you havent any choice kane told them raising his submachine gun after weve eaten you can select your three best camels and the somali is an expert by the way the old rashid shrugged as allah wills it his three companions sat down sullenly legs crossed and he poured coffee into two battered tin mugs which he presented courteously to kane and cunningham kane drank some of the coffee gratefully and cunningham said but we havent a hope in hell of catching them kane nodded i know but if we make good time to bir el madani and get a truck from jordan we stand a good chance of reaching dahrein before they leave by god i hope youre right cunningham said fervently when i think of ruth his voice trailed away and he quickly swallowed some coffee kane tried to sound confident you dont have to worry about a thing skiros wont be in any hurry to leave dahrein theres no reason why he should be but inside he wasnt so sure skiros must be a worried man what else could explain his sudden departure perhaps hed realized that his run of luck was ending and like a good gambler was simply getting out while he was still ahead of the game kane narrowed his eyes as he looked up into the blue vault of the sky and watched a buzzard poise before wheeling down in great circles one could never be sure of anything in this life if this country had taught him anything it had taught him that fifteen they left an hour later on the three camels jamal considered to be in the best condition kane and cunningham wore the headdress and loose outer robes of the bedouin reluctantly provided by the old rashid and his companions and jamal carried two goatskins of water securely looped over the pommel of his saddle kane was riding a bull camel a large and powerful black animal which moved across the flat plain outside the gorge at an incredible rate pieces of twisted metal and fuselage from the catalina were strewn over a wide area and as they passed the fireblackened wreckage he looked at it in wonder it seemed impossible that they could have destroyed it so completely and already the memory of the incident had lost its sharpness as if it had never happened as they left the plain and entered the sand dunes he lifted a fold of his headcloth across his face as a protection against the fierce heat that rose to meet them the desert rolled ahead in great waves of sand as far as the eye could see and he eased himself into a more comfortable position in the wooden saddle and urged the camel on speed was the only thing which could help them now that and the fact that skiros would not be expecting pursuit he glanced back and saw jamal close behind followed by cunningham his face halfcovered by a fold of his robe the englishman raised a hand in a halfsalute and kane turned and concentrated on the trail ahead the camel never faltered in its stride great legs covering the ground tirelessly and he lapsed into a state that was somewhere between sleeping and waking eyes halfclosed against the glare he wondered what the germans next move would be he would probably make for dahrein secure in the knowledge that no one was left to follow him he could afford to spend several days there clearing up his affairs before moving out ahead of any enquiries set on foot by the american consul what he would do with the women was debatable kane recalled the conversation he had overheard outside the tent on the previous night what had skiros said that he looked upon marie ferret as a personal challenge kane shivered at the thought and pushed it firmly away from him sufficient unto the day for the moment it was enough to concentrate on reaching bir el madani he slouched into a more comfortable position in the saddle and urged the camel on the morning passed as in a dream and they rolled on into the afternoon like great ships floating over the sand on several occasions they had to dismount to lead their camels up the steep sides of some of the larger dunes and they stopped once to share their water and a handful of dried dates cunningham looked tired and his eyes were sore and redrimmed the thin sensitive face coated with sand kane swallowed his ration of water grimacing slightly at the acrid unpleasant taste and looked anxiously at him you managing okay cunninghams face split into a tight grin a little tired but ill be fine dont forget i passed this way going in the opposite direction they remounted and rode on the sun was high in the heavens beating fiercely across their backs with a flail of fire and kane bowed his head on his chest and let the camel find its own way he was tired very tired too much had happened during the past three or four days too much for any man he decided that he must have ridden unconscious for the rest of the afternoon because he was suddenly aware that the sun was dropping in the west and a slight wind stung his face jamal had ridden up beside him and was pulling at the reins of his camel kane slid to the ground and sat down shaking his head from side to side to bring himself awake his mouth was dry as a bone and full of dust and as cunningham threw himself wearily down beside him jamal produced one of the goatskins and handed it round they had two good swallows each and then it was empty the somali tossed the useless skin away and walked back to his camel and stood holding its bridle staring impassively into the distance cunninghams face was drawn and haggard the skin stretched tightly across the cheekbones when he spoke his voice was a dry croak like an old mans what are we going to do keep going through the night kane nodded the camels are in good condition well be feeling the shortage of water before they are we stand a better chance during the cool of the night what about skiros kane shrugged thats another point hell probably make camp soon he struggled wearily to his feet and the wind lifted sand into his face and then jamal was moving towards him quickly eyes flashing the somali cupped a hand to one ear in an unmistak able gesture and kane listened faintly borne on the wind came the sound of voices in the distance excitement moved inside him and the weariness dropped from his shoulders like an old cloak did you hear it he asked cunningham the englishman nodded perhaps something went wrong and theyve made camp sooner than they intended whatever the reason theyre in for one hell of a surprise kane said they hobbled the camels and went forward cautiously on foot the wheel tracks turned away to circle the base of a large dune and kane hesitated for a moment and then led the way up the steep side sinking kneedeep in the soft sand he covered the last few feet to the summit on his belly and raised his head cautiously seventy or eighty feet below in a hollow a tent was standing a truck was parked beside it hood raised while an arab tinkered with the engine as cunningham moved up the flap of the tent was thrown back and ruth cunningham emerged pushed by selim she seemed to have lost all hope and dragged her feet as she went towards a flaring spiritstove she picked up a pan and placed it on the stove and selim stood over her laughing cunningham halfrose to his feet and kane pulled him back behind the lip of the dune dont be a damned fool at this range youd stand as much chance of hitting her as hitting selim and if you go down on foot hell have her at the other end of his rifle before you get halfway but we must do something cunningham said desperately we cant afford to wait for darkness kanes eyes narrowed as he hunted for a solution and then a quick flare of excitement moved across his face i think ive got it he said and explained rapidly when he had finished cunningham sat up and nodded slowly its a good plan at least it stands an even chance of coming off he started to get to his feet and kane caught hold of his sleeve ill handle this you dont look too good the englishman shook his head jaw set firmly shes my wife he said simply so its my job kane didnt try to argue with him cunningham checked the action of his submachine gun and slipped it out of sight under his outer robe holding it with one hand he smiled once and then pulled back his headcloth and stood up on the summit of the dune for a moment they did not see him and he opened his mouth and cried hoarsely water water for the love of god he took one deliberate fumbling step forward and fell headlong into the sand rolling over and over down into the hollow at the first cry selim and his companions had turned in alarm snatching up their rifles kane moved cautiously forward and peered down into the hollow as cunningham rolled to a halt for a little while he lay there and then he climbed painfully to his feet and lurched forward water he moaned and pitched forward on to his face ruth cunningham sprang to her feet for a moment she stood there unbelief on her face and then she started forward selim grabbed her by the shoulder and hustled her across to the tent he pushed her inside and turned cunningham got to his knees and stretched out a hand appealingly and selim laughed he shouted something unintelligible to his companion put down his rifle and walked forward cunningham stood up and produced the submachine gun and as selim turned to run a long burst caught him full in the back the other man still stood in front of the truck rifle in hands he raised it to his hip and fired one shot wildly cunningham swung towards him a line of bullets lifting the sand in a curtain driving the man back against the vehicle he stopped firing and walked forward until he was standing over selim and then the tent flap was thrown back and ruth emerged and came into his arms kane got to his feet and stood on top of the dune looking at them and a gust of wind drove sand particles against his face he ploughed down the hill into the hollow followed by jamal cunningham held his wife close and she started to tremble as reaction set in its all right he said he cant hurt you any more selim was dead fingers clawing into the sand and kane looked down at him without pity the other man was groaning horribly and jamal knelt beside him and raised his head as kane went forward the man seemed to choke and blood poured from his mouth his head lolled back and jamal lowered him to the ground is he dead kane said the somali nodded and pointed silently at the truck along the side facing them was a neat line of bullet holes they had emptied the jerrycan of water that was bracketed to the side of the vehicle and when kane examined the engine he found it damaged beyond repair he moved back to cunningham and his wife that final burst of yours caught the truck as well im afraid well still have to rely on the camels to get us out of here how do you feel cunningham looked pale but he managed a smile a lot better now that ruths safe the wind was increasing driving the sand across the hollow and whining round the truck kane slung his submachine gun over his shoulder and said quickly щщщщ щщїщщ щ щщ щщщщщщ heba щщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщ looks as if were in for some bad weather you two get into the tent and jamal and i will get the camels he spoke briefly to the somali in arabic and they hurriedly retraced their steps and climbed up the side of the dune as they moved over the top the wind lifted in sudden fury carrying a curtain of sand with it that blotted out everything he pulled a fold of his headcloth about his face and went down the other side of the dune already their tracks were obliterated and within a few moments they were alone enveloped in a thick cloud of swirling sand it was impossible to see anything he paused eyes vainly trying to pierce the gloom then turned and cannoned into jamal he and the somali linked arms and struggled back up the side of the dune it was impossible to remain standing on top and they slid down the other side and stumbled blindly into the camp sand was already piled around the base of the tent and when kane ducked in through the flap ruth cunningham turned fear in her eyes how long will it last she demanded he pulled off his headcloth and tried to sound unconcerned an hour or two perhaps a little longer they always blow themselves out in the end theres nothing to worry about jamal carefully laced up the entrance and sat against it arms folded cunningham had an arm round his wifes shoulder and held her close how do you feel kane asked her when she spoke her voice sounded unnatural and strained like a spring too tightly wound up i never expected to see either of you again after the fighting last night skiros told us youd been buried under a fall of rock youd better bring us up to date kane said whats been happening today and why did the party split up she pushed back a tendril of hair with one hand it was pretty horrible we left the gorge this morning in the two trucks skiros muller and marie in the front one selim his man and myself in the other why were you with selim her husband asked she flushed skiros came to some agreement with him he needed selims help when we reached dahrein i dont know what it was about but i was the price selim demanded there was a short silence as cunningham slipped an arm round her shoulders kane went on but why the split she shrugged the truck had engine trouble selim had to stop to fix it and skiros and muller went on with marie they said theyd wait for us at a place called hazar near bir el madani theyll have to wait a long time for selim cunningham said she looked down at her hands twisting together nervously in her lap he kept telling me what he was going to do when we camped for the night he was so loathsome cunningham pulled her close and she turned her head into his chest and started to cry her whole body shaking with the violence of her weeping outside the wind howled driving the sand against the frail skin of the tent in a relentless fury that was somehow terrifying kane bowed his head down on his knees and relaxed breathing deeply through halfopen mouth feeling each tired muscle ease gradually it became completely dark and the wind was so violent that he and jamal had to hang on to the pole at each end of the tent to prevent it from being torn away into the night four hours later the storm departed as suddenly as it had come and kane unlaced the tent flap and crawled outside the night sky was clear and millions of stars burned in its depths like white candles the moon was full and its radiance flooded down into the hollow the sides of the tent sagged under the weight of the drifting sand and the truck was halfburied cunningham ducked out through the opening of the tent and joined him what do we do now see if we can round up the camels kane told him til take jamal with me you dont sound too hopeful cunningham said it was a bad storm i know we hobbled them but a frightened camel has surprising strength once they get into a panic they can kick themselves free of anything he called to jamal and they moved up the steep side of the dune away from the camp the view from the top was quite spectacular rolling dunes stretched away to meet the horizon and the hollows between them lay dark and forbidding thrown into relief by the white moonlight which picked out the higher stretches of ground they moved down the other side and walked forward in the general direction of the place where they had left the camels all tracks had been swept away by the storm and kanes heart sank he stopped and whistled several times the sound falling shrill on the cold night air but there was no answering cry they separated kane going one way jamal another but it was no good an hour later they returned to the camp without the camels cunningham was sitting outside the camp wearing his bedouin robes against the chill of the night he rose to meet them and as they approached his wife emerged from the tent and joined him no luck kane told them theyre probably miles away by now im afraid our last goatskin of water has gone with them as well cunningham slipped an arm around his wifes shoulders what do we do kane shrugged there isnt any choice we start walking but the nearest waters at shabwa and thats at least forty miles away cunningham said its impossible especially for ruth kane went across to the truck leaned inside the cab and unscrewed the compass from its fixing when he turned his face was grim there arent any ifs or buts about it we walk and we walk now with luck we can cover maybe twenty or twentyfive miles before daylight if we dont were finished cunninghams shoulders sagged and he turned to his wife in a way i got you into this i want you to know that im sorry she touched his face gently and smiled theres no place id rather be they might have been alone as they stood there staring into each others eyes and kane turned away quickly and went to speak to jamal sixteen a thorough search of the camp produced plenty of food but only one aluminium waterbottle when they left at midnight kane carried it slung over one shoulder split four ways its contents were virtually useless but they had no choice and he was determined it should not be used until the last possible moment he led the way at a fast pace using the compass regularly to check on direction it was bitterly cold and he felt quite fresh and full of energy it was ironic to think that within another six hours they would be exposed to the merciless rays of the sun how long they would be able to keep going after that was anyones guess it was the woman who was going to be the problem he paused to consult the compass again and looked back over his shoulder jamal was close behind with cunningham and his wife thirty yards in the rear kane started forward again trying to follow the easy way through the dunes on several occasions this proved impossible and they were forced to toil up the steep side of some sand mountain every step an effort after some two hours they came out of the dunes and moved down towards a vast flat plain that disappeared into the distance hardbaked and strewn with gravel kane paused to take a bearing and jamal came up behind and tapped him on the shoulder as kane turned the somali pointed back cunningham and his wife were a good two hundred yards away and kane sat down in the sand and waited as they approached he stood up to meet them but ruth cunningham slipped down to the ground with a heavy sigh i feel as if ive walked twenty miles im afraid weve only done eight or nine at the most kane told her we must cover at least twentyfive before the full heat of the sun hits us or we dont stand a chance its all right for you cunningham said but ruth cant stand the pace youre going too fast she quickly placed a hand on his arm gavin is only stating the obvious john dont worry about me ill be all right i know its tough kane said but its got to be done cunningham stood up well what are we waiting for it took them almost three hours to cross the plain and they moved rapidly on its hardbaked surface ruth cunningham was doing much better and when they passed out of the plain and moved into the sand dunes on the other side they were bunched closely together kane felt no fatigue at all and his long legs toughened by years of hard living strode effortlessly over the ground his mind was not on the present but on the morning and what it would bring he pushed the thought away from him and tried to think of other things it was then that he remembered that alexias had done this journey before them and without a compass he started to go over the manuscript again in his mind trying to recapture again that vivid image of the man that had come to him after reading it for the first time he must have been tough that much was obvious leather and whipcord and an unyielding will a man who believed in his destiny and in his ability to conquer all obstacles and yet were those things enough there must have been something else something which had brought him walking out of the desert on his own two feet when by all logic he should have died a woman perhaps waiting for him back home it was a question to which there could be no answer and he paused to check on their direction again it was almost five oclock and he sat down and waited for the others to catch up to him ruth cunningham looked white and drawn in the pale light of the waning moon and her husband seemed anxious he gently eased her down beside kane and jamal opened a knapsack and took out dates and boiled rice which he handed round ruth cunningham tried to wave her share away but kane took it from the somali and held it out to her you must keep up your strength she smiled wanly and put some of the boiled rice into her mouth cunningham said how far do you think weve come kane shrugged twenty to twentyfive miles we made good time across the plain cunningham looked up into the vast bowl of the sky it seems to be getting lighter dawn in an hour kane said weve got perhaps another hour after that before the sun really starts giving us trouble and then what kane shrugged well worry about that when the time comes he got to his feet and started forward again and when he glanced back over his shoulder from the top of the next dune they were trailing close behind him walking strongly they covered another seven or eight miles before the sun slipped up over the edge of the horizon a bloodred disc whose heat warmed them pleasantly chasing the cold of the night from their bones kane increased his stride his eyes on the horizon watching the sun rise into the heavens with something like despair in his heart for the first time it occurred to him that it was useless that what they were attempting was impossible if they were still walking at noon it would be a miracle the sun was an orange ball of fire and its rays burned their way into his skull he pulled the ends of the headcloth across his face leaving only the eyes free as a slight breeze lifted dust from the ground there was no air to draw into his lungs only the fiery breath of the sun searing the flesh and cracking the lips turning his throat into a dry tunnel of dust he began to think about the waterbottle and his fingers went to it as he plodded on he looked down at it imagining the coolness of the water inside its wetness the feel of it trickling down his burning throat and spreading throughout his body he pushed the bottle round to the small of his back where he couldnt see it any longer and started the slow climb up the side of a large sand dune when he reached the top his limbs were tired for the first time and he paused trembling with effort feeling the sweat trickling from every pore in his flesh draining his body of the liquid needed to live he shaded his eyes and gazed before him and suddenly he caught a flash of scarlet as the sun sparkled on something in the distance it was the wrecked rapide in which he and ruth had crashed four days previously he was filled with a sudden wild hope the plane had carried a jerrycan filled with water allowing for the lapse of time and the great heat there was still a good chance that some of it remained it occurred to him with something of a shock that he had not checked on his companions for a considerable time he turned to look back and saw jamal at the bottom of the sand dune ruth cunningham cradled in his great arms cunningham was struggling up the steep slope and his eyes burned feverishly in his swollen face he fell on his knees a few feet away from kane and passed a hand slowly across his face finally he forced himself upright and when he spoke his voice seemed to come from a great distance weve got to rest kane tried to moisten cracked lips we must keep moving cunningham shook his head stubbornly got to rest he took a wavering step forward and started to buckle at the knees as kane grabbed him his feet slipped in the soft sand and they went over the edge together rolling over and over in a cloud of dust to the bottom cunningham lay with limbs sprawled and kane dropped to his knees beside him and forced a little water between his teeth jamal appeared on top of the dune and moved down to join them he laid ruth cunningham beside her husband and looked at kane enquiringly kane explained about the plane and something glowed briefly in the somalis eyes at that moment cunningham groaned and sat up where am i what happened his voice sounded weak and lifeless as if it didnt really belong to him any more kane lifted him to his feet and slipped an arm around his shoulders dont worry he said soothingly we havent got far to go now not far at all he turned and nodded to jamal who picked up the woman again and they started to walk it took them just over an hour to reach the plane and by the time they were there cunningham had become a dead weight on kanes arm he lowered the englishman to the ground and dragged him under the shade of the wing and propped his back against the side of the plane he left jamal to handle the woman and climbed into the cabin he found the jerry can with no trouble and his hands were trembling as he carried it out something swirled inside so he quickly pulled off the metal stopper and lifted the can to his lips it tasted terrible warm and brackish but it was liquid and there seemed to be four or five pints of the stuff he crawled under the wings and poured a little of the water over ruth cunninghams face she groaned and then her eyes opened slowly the skin was stretched tightly over her flesh and her lips had cracked in several places he gently raised her head and poured a little water into her mouth she coughed and some of it seemed to trickle down her chin and then she seemed to come alive and her hands reached out for the can forcing the opening against her lips as she took a long swallow she leaned back with a sigh and kane moved across to cunningham the englishman seemed more himself and managed a weak smile sorry i was such a nuisance what happens now kane indicated the jerrycan youll find about four pints of water in there he said it should keep you going through the rest of the day cunningham frowned slightly what about you and jamal well carry on kane said we havent got any choice you and your wife cant walk any further if we stay here with you well all die if either jamal or myself gets through well get help to you as soon as possible there was silence for a moment and then the englishman smiled faintly as you say there really isnt any choice he held out his hand there doesnt seem to be much more i can say except good luck and what the hell are you waiting for for a second longer they clasped hands and then kane moved towards jamal he opened the waterbottle and swallowed half its contents he handed it across to the somali who emptied it and tossed it away in one long easy throw for a moment or two they looked into each others eyes and then they started to walk as they topped a small rise kane looked back once and then he took a deep breath and plunged down the other side the sun was a living thing that had somehow become a part of him so that they were one and marched as one it was impossible to judge how much time had elapsed since they had left the plane because time had ceased to exist and had no meaning a man couldnt walk in breastplate and greaves it was impossible better to discard them the helmet had gone a long time before and now he marched with only his sword to weigh him down the short stabbing sword of the roman soldier his riding cloak folded across his head to keep the sun from his brain he had to keep going had to get back to the general with his report duty came first as it always must with a soldier but there was another reason the girl the girl with the dark hair and milkwhite skin and the mouth that was a cool well almost as cool as the sea off the piraeus at athens where he had swum as a boy diving down into the green depths twisting amongst the fishes scaring them away in great glittering clouds and rising slowly to the surface in a spiral of bubbles he fell forward on his face for a little while he stayed there on his knees like an animal and then he was jerked to his feet and a hand slapped him across the face jamal held him steady eyes staring anxiously inio his kane tried to speak and found that he couldnt he nodded several times and started forward again the effort to march became a physical agony a pain that blossomed spreading through his entire body and then it didnt seem to exist any longer now there was only a small burning core inside that refused to let him lie down and die the wind lifted into his face blowing aside his headcloth and the sun cut sharply against the unprotected flesh and then he was on his face in the sand and jamal was lifting him again later he was lying across the somalis broad shoulders and he frowned and shook his head trying to think clearly but it was no good nothing was any good now and he lapsed into a dark vacuum of heat there was sand in his mouth and his fingers clawed at the ground but this time no hand lifted him in its strong grip this time he was on his own utterly and finally alone andjamal had gone he would never get back to that girl now the girl with the white limbs and the cool mouth the girl he had needed all his life to fuse with his being so that they became a single entity existing together savouring life to the full in the only way it can be savoured together was he gavin kane or was he alexias the greek centurion of the tenth legion and who was the one with the white arms and the cool mouth there was no answer no answer on top of earth the water spilled across his face with the shock of a physical blow trickling down into his mouth causing him to cough violently a strong hand raised him and his teeth gripped the metal rim of a waterbottle he swallowed greedily and doubled over as cramp twisted his guts he opened his swollen redrimmed eyes and found jordan supporting him across his knees in the background a truck was parked kane opened his mouth and managed to speak back there in the desert he croaked ruth cunningham and her husband youd better get to them quick jordan nodded reassuringly dont worry about a thing its all been taken care of two of my men have already gone for them in my other truck with the big somali to guide them he grinned that jamal is quite a guy but kane heard no more his eyes closed as his body twisted in a great shuddering sigh of relief and darkness flooded over him seventeen he opened his eyes slowly for a moment his mind was a complete blank and he struggled up on one elbow panic moving inside him and then he remembered and lay back with an audible sigh of relief he was lying on a camp bed underneath a low awning suspended on four poles two trucks were parked near by and there was a tent pitched several yards away as kane moved jamal who was squatting at the end of the bed got to his feel and leaned over him as their eyes met a huge smile appeared on the somalis face and kane held out his hand silently jamal took it and the smile faded from his face for a brief moment there was a feeling between them that had not existed before and then he turned away and crossed to jordan who was bending over a spiritstove in the centre of the camp jordan came towards kane a pot in one hand and a plastic cup in the other coffee sir he said with a grin kane swung his legs to the floor and sat on the edge of the bed he felt curiously weak and lightheaded and somehow everything was touched with a slight tinge of unreality and blurred at the edges he swallowed some of the coffee and shivered as it burned its way down into his stomach i have a feeling i shouldnt really be here jordan nodded thats putting it mildly kane peered out from under the awning they were camped in the foothills of the mountains and the desert rolled into the distance before them where are we about ten or twelve miles from shabwa jordan answered i made camp here in a hurry because i didnt know what shape cunningham and his wife were in how are they kane asked quickly jordan offered him a cigarette slightly dehydrated but otherwise okay ive given them both a sedative theyre asleep in the tent kane drew the smoke from the cigarette deep into his lungs lucky for all of us that you met up with jamal what were you doing so far out in the desert ive been looking for you for the past three days jordan said when marie failed to return in the truck shed borrowed the driver waited until the following morning and then came and told me i found the plane yesterday but no sign of the truck i figured it must have broken down somewhere on the return journey we were doing our best to search the area between here and the plane when we came across the somali kane glanced across at jamal who squatted by the spiritstove eating boiled rice from a bowl closely watched by jordans men i guess we owe our lives to him you can say that again jordan said but how about filling me in on this whole thing where have you been since the plane crashed and whats happened to marie briefly and with as much economy as possible kane told him of the events of the past four days when he had finished jordan shook his head skiros a nazi its the most fantastic thing i ever heard its true kane said but its marie im worried about ruth cunningham says theyre supposed to be waiting at hazar jordan frowned i passed through the place two weeks ago theres a tribe of bedouins camped there bal harith their chiefs called mahmoud a wizened old guy with a grey beard kane nodded i know the man you mean ive traded with him in the past his eyes narrowed come to think of it i heard that muller was pretty thick with the bal harith maybe he knew they were encamped at hazar jordan grinned theyre the sort of friends he and skiros would need big roughlooking guys who bare their teeth and finger their rifles every time i drive by theyd cut your throat for a pair of socks kane shook his head not mahmoud hes a bedouin of the old school very keen on his honour and the strict observance of the ancient customs he pushed himself to his feet and walked out from under the awning he felt lightheaded again and swayed slightly bracing his feet to steady himself jordan said anxiously sure you feel okay ill feel a lot better when i catch up with skiros kane told him can i borrow one of the trucks jordan shook his head no need im corning with you i happen to think quite a lot about marie ferret myself what about cunningham and his wife jordan shrugged theyll sleep for hours ill leave my men here to look after them kane was too tired to argue he called jamal over explained the situation and they climbed into one of the trucks and waited for jordan who was giving his men their instructions they drove away a few minutes later jordan behind the wheel and kane closed his eyes and leaned back in his seat it was as if all the action all the passion of the past few days had finally caught up with him draining the strength from his very bones he didnt even bother to think about what lay ahead they reached hazar in just under an hour and jordan braked the truck at the head of the wide valley and they looked down on the black tents of the bedouins whatever happens leave the talking to me kane said i know exactly how im going to handle it the palm trees of the oasis extended for several hundred yards along the valley their green fronds forming a solid roof against the rays of the sun as they drove into the encampment scattering camels and goats before them children ran towards the tents with shrill cries of alarm and tall blackbearded men in flowing robes emerged most of them carrying rifles as they drove into the centre of the camp kane straightened in his seat and jamal touched him lightly on the shoulder fifty or sixty yards away two trucks were parked jordan saw them in the same moment looks as if weve come to the right place he braked to a halt outside the largest tent and a commanding figure moved outside and stood looking towards them mahmoud was very old his flowing beard heavily streaked with silver and his skin was drawn tightly like parchment over fine bones his robes were of dazzling whiteness and the hilt of his jambiya was of finely wrought gold the tribesmen moved silently in on them surrounding the vehicle and effectively cutting off any retreat they looked anything but friendly jordan said quietly have you noticed their rifles the very latest no wonder skiros chose to wait here kane got out of the truck moved forward slowly and halted a few paces away from mahmoud for a brief moment they looked into each others eyes and then the old arab smiled and extended his hand my good friend kane it is a long time since we hunted together with the falcons kane took the proffered hand and smiled time has been good to you mahmoud each year you grow younger he turned and nodded towards jordan i bring a friend mahmouds face wrinkled with distaste i know him the young man who tears up the ground and makes the air stink with his machines an expression of discomfort appeared on jordans face but the old man smiled and made a courteous gesture with one hand on this occasion we make him welcome for the sake of a friend he turned and walked through the low entrance into the cool interior and kane and jordan followed they sat crosslegged on soft rugs and waited until a woman shrouded in black robes emerged from the rear of the tent carrying a coffeepot three cups and a bowl of boiled rice on a brass tray kane and jordan observing the usual formalities drank their coffee and ate a little of the rice dipping their fingers into the communal bowl as did mahmoud as the woman handed them a damp cloth with which to wipe the grease from their fingers kane sighed with relief all tension easing inside him whatever course the conversation took whatever happened they were now safe they had eaten and drunk with mahmoud in the midst of his tribe no harm could possibly come to them now there was a slight silence before mahmoud said politely you have come far my friend kane nodded far and fast i seek two men who have wronged me deeply a mans honour is his life mahmoud said seriously may allah guide your footsteps he has already shown me his great mercy kane replied the men i seek are here in your camp i have seen their trucks mahmoud was not visibly moved he nodded calmly there are two franks in my tents my good friend professor muller and the fat one from dahrein in what way have they offended your honour kane kept his voice flat and unemotional they have taken my woman there was quiet and the old man stroked his beard gently with one slender hand after a moment he said certainly they have a woman with them one of mixed blood she has not left their tent since their arrival she is the one kane said mahmoud got to his feet with easy grace wait here he said calmly and went outside jordan moved restlessly what was all that supposed to mean kane explained quickly its the one way we can bring skiros out into the open a woman may be just a household chattel to a bedouin but the similarity ends there to steal a mans woman is one of the most serious crimes known to these people okay ill buy that jordan said impatiently but i still dont see how its going to help before kane could reply mahmoud came back into the tent followed by muller and skiros kane and jordan rose to their feet and kane moved forward a step the expression of dismay on mullers face was ludicrous but skiros showed little emotion we saw you arrive it would appear that miracles still do happen presumably selim has been delayed indefinitely im afraid kane replied so you are old friends mahmoud said softly hardly that skiros told him this man has done me great harm one might even say he has also harmed you and your people because of his actions muller and i must leave the country there will be no more arms for the border tribes that is certainly most unfortunate and my people would not be pleased if they knew mahmoud said but kane is a guest in my tents and his safety is as much my concern as is your own skiros shrugged naturally that is your own affair but i feel i should warn you that this man is your enemy mahmoud walked away a few paces as if deep in thought and said slowly this woman you have in your tent she belongs to you skiros stiffened and muller mopped sweat from his face with a trembling hand in what way can this woman concern you the german asked mahmouds voice was quite calm kane tells me that she is not your woman that you have stolen her from him skiros shrugged carelessly i would expect him to say such a thing i see mahmoud said thoughtfully two versions of the same affair each different logically someone must be juggling with the truth there is one obvious way to find out he clapped his hands and there was a slight movement outside marie came through the entrance and stood facing them blinking her eyes in the gloom and then she saw kane an expression of wonder appeared on her face and with a slight incredulous cry she ran into his arms he held her close and ran a hand over her dark hair are you all right he said im fine just fine she touched his face gently i cant quite believe it mahmoud placed a hand on her shoulder and turned her round to face him what is your name child she faced him proudly chin uptilted marie ferret he nodded slowly i have heard of you your mother was a rashid was she not he turned away and stood slightly to one side of the group so that he could see every face clearly this man kane says that you are his woman that skiros has stolen you from him is this true she nodded and the old sheik went on are you married according to the christian custom no we are not married she said has he known you child mahmoud said gently there was a moment of stillness and kane held his breath praying that her answer would be the right one she nodded her head slowly yes i have lain with this man skiros exploded angrily its a lie this is a deliberate plot on the part of kane i told you he was my enemy mahmoud stilled him with a raised hand what woman would shame herself without reason if she has lain with him then she is his she may not belong to another she is of the blood of my people and it is our law an expression of fury appeared on the germans face but by a supreme effort of will he controlled his anger he bowed stiffly brushed aside the tent flap and went out muller at his heels jordan emitted an audible sigh of relief and kane turned to mahmoud what now the old sheik smiled i think it best if she returns to her tent and stays there under guard until our friends leave may i speak to her first kane said mahmoud nodded for a little while only he touched jordan on the shoulder and led the way outside leaving kane and marie alone she came into his arms and he held her close for a little while and then they sat down kane was suddenly tired really tired have you got any cigarettes he said she took a crumpled pack from her shirt pocket and gave him one he inhaled and gave a sigh of content that tastes good she reached over and smoothed back his hair you look as if youve been having a pretty thin time i guess you could call it that tell me about it he gave her a brief outline of events and when he had finished she gave a sigh of relief im glad the cunninghams are all right what are you going to do about skiros and muller what can i do mahmoud will hold us here after theyve left or i miss my guess he owes them that much if theyve been supplying him with guns one thing i cant understand is why skiros decided to leave the valley in such a hurry what happened i dont really know she said he was on the radio for a long time after the fighting was over when he came down into the camp he was very angry he had a long argument with selim afterwards he said wed be leaving at dawn he was probably in touch with his superiors in berlin to tell them about the loss of the plane kane said they must have got into a panic after all if he was caught and his true nationality disclosed thered be hell to pay they most likely told him to get out and fast i hope we never see him again marie said kane held out his hands and she clasped them tightly at least one good things come out of all this he said i know when im licked she came into his arms and they kissed briefly then the tent flap was thrown back and mahmoud appeared he stood to one side and marie brushed past him the old bedouin smiled you look tired i suggest a long sleep ill have you taken to your friend well talk later kane went out into the bright sunlight and a man led the way through the encampment eyes turned on him curiously and several small children ran at his heels all the way to the tent which was on the outskirts of the camp when he ducked in through the entrance he found jordan sitting crosslegged on a rug in the centre eating from a can you look terrible the geologist said cheerfully kane managed a tired grin and flung himself down on a sleeping pallet in one corner jordan was still speaking but the words didnt seem to be making any sense after a while they were simply a monotonous drone and kane was asleep he awakened slowly and lay staring into the gloom it was night and an oillamp hung from the pole above his head its radiance scattering the shadows from the centre of the tent jordan was sitting near by cleaning his revolver as kane moved he turned and a smile appeared on his face how do you feel out of this world kane said struggling into a sitting position jordan handed a bowl across youd better have something to eat kane pushed balls of boiled rice and pieces of goatmeat into his mouth and discovered he was hungry has anything been happening jordan shook his head quiet as the grave youve been lying there for about eight hours have our friends left yet they were on the other side of the camp i suppose the old boy arranged it that way i heard them drive off a couple of hours ago what do you think theyll do kane shrugged make straight for dahrein hoping to get clear before we notify the authorities are you going to try to stop them kane shook his head i dont think so ill be glad to see the back of both of them theyre finished round here anyway he got to his feet and stretched lets call on mahmoud he brushed back the entrance flap walked out into the cool night and led the way down through the quiet camp to mahmouds tent they found the old sheik sitting crosslegged on a sheepskin before the fire smoking a turkish cigarette eyes boring into the heat of the flames he greeted them with a smile so you have recovered my friend he said to kane kane sat down beside him i understand skiros and muller have left the old man nodded i promised them i would hold you here for a day i owed them that much at least skiros was a german kane said was it wise to have dealings with such a man mahmoud smiled your friend represents an american oil company if he finds oil how long will it be before we receive the benefits of socalled american aid would that be such a bad thing jordan said mahmoud shrugged in oman they have the british to protect them here we would rather protect ourselves if the germans are foolish enough to give us arms free i will accept but most of the border tribes have used those arms to attack the british in oman kane said this is what the germans wish to see happen the old man shrugged that is not my affair there was obviously no point in further discussion and kane changed the subject is there any reason why i shouldnt see the woman mahmoud shook his head she is still under guard in her tent i will take you to her myself as he led the way through the camp he said if you will take an old mans advice be careful when you return to bahrein skiros will not forget what you have done to him he paused outside the tent that contained marie ferret the guard sat crosslegged in the shadows beside the entrance head lolling forward over his chest mahmoud exclaimed in annoyance and prodded the man with his foot the guard rolled forward into the sand face turning to one side he was still alive but there was blood on his neck behind his left ear the mark of a heavy blow there was no sign of a struggle when kane looked inside the tent but she was no longer there and he turned to mahmoud and said they have taken her with them but why jordan demanded a hostage until he manages to get safely out of the country or a means of hitting at me kane shrugged the reason isnt important mahmoud touched him on the sleeve and the old sheiks eyes were troubled i am shamed that this thing should happen in my tents naturally this absolves me from my promise to hold you here for a day no one is to blame kane told him but we must leave at once where is the somali he sleeps with my bodyguard mahmoud said i will send him to you he walked back to his tent and kane and jordan hurried towards the truck what about the cunninghams jordan asked kane shrugged theyll have to fend for themselves for the time being this thing is more important he smoked a cigarette and considered the situation while jordan checked that everything was in running order it was about one hundred and twenty miles to dahrein over dirt roads and in places the going was rough skiros and muller had a twohour start unless they had a breakdown it would be impossible to catch them before dahrein jamal appeared from the darkness followed by mahmoud and several of his men the somali climbed into the rear seat and jordan slid behind the wheel and pressed the starter as the engine roared into life mahmoud leaned forward and took kanes hand as allah wills it my friend till our next meeting kane said and jordan moved into gear and the truck shot away in a cloud of dust for the first hour they followed an ancient caravan trail through the mountains jordan straining his eyes into the darkness swinging the wheel violently from time to time as the headlights picked out boulders and other obstructions in their path kane leaned back in his seat one of jordans cigarettes smouldering between his teeth despite his long sleep he was still tired but from somewhere in the depths of him he had summoned secret resources of energy some mysterious vital force that was to hold him together long enough to finish this business щщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщ щщщщщщщщщщщщщщщ щщщ s jj e j a щїщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщщ at the end of the first hour a strong wind started to blow in from the coast cutting across the mountains driving the curtain of cloud before it and the full moon appeared its rays drifting down into the valleys lighting the way before them jordan increased their speed now that he could see more clearly ahead and they hurtled along the bed of a sterile barren valley zigzagging between large boulders lurching from side to side an hour later they moved out on to a manmade road hewn out of the side of the mountain and roughly surfaced with small stones as jordan moved into a higher gear taking them forward in a burst of speed there was a loud report from the rear and the truck slewed dangerously close to the edge of the road jordan switched off the engine with a curse blowout might happen more than once on this blasted road they changed the tyre and were on their way again within ten minutes but this time kane was behind the wheel there was no room in his mind for thinking of what lay ahead he focused everything on the road in grim concentration his mind became a blank and nothing existed except the truck and the road ahead twisting and curving along the side of the mountain gradually sliding down towards the coast there was no question that he couldnt keep it up no question at all he sat hunched behind the wheel for mile after mile hands slipping in their own sweat on the rim until three hours later they came down into the great valley which opened into the sea he and jordan had not spoken for hours but now as dahrein came into sight kane said what time have you got jordan glanced at his watch about four am you feel okay kane breathed several times to clear his head and nodded i feel fine l whats our next move jordan said kane frowned i dont think theyll use the hotel mullers house is the obvious choice its more secluded all was quiet s he took the truck along the road past the airstrip and moved in through the outlying houses down towards the waterfront dahrein was shrouded in darkness and he turned the headlights full on as he drove carefully through narrow streets and twisting alleys towards mullers house at the end of the street he halted and switched off the engine wed better go the rest of the way on foot he reached for his submachine gun and led the way cautiously along the street a lamp hung suspended over the door in the wall and beneath its light a travelstained truck was parked jordan touched the engine housing briefly it was still warm they havent been here long kane nodded i know we made good time the door was locked for a moment he hesitated and then jamal touched him on the shoulder when kane turned the somali was leaning against the wall legs braced firmly kane slung the machine gun over his shoulder and scrambled up on to jamals back as he reached the somalis shoulders great hands seized his ankles and pushed he pulled himself over the wall and dropped down into the garden there were lights on in the interior of the house he stood in the darkness looking up at the windows and then he moved quickly to the door and unlocked it a moment later jamal and jordan were standing at his side he locked the door securely pocketing the key and they moved through the darkness towards the house eighteen it was quiet in the garden and a slight breeze lifted coolly across kanes cheek as he crouched behind a bush a few yards from the front door he moved forward out of the shadows and mounted the steps to the terrace followed by jordan and the somali the door opened to his touch and he walked inside submachine gun ready the light was on and from upstairs there came the sound of faint movement he turned to speak to jordan and a door clicked open on one side of the hall an arab servant in white robes entered carrying a suitcase as he saw them his eyes widened into saucers before he could cry out jamal took a quick pace forward and slammed his fist against the side of the mans jaw he slumped to the ground without a cry the case slipping from his grasp a voice called impatiently from upstairs and muller appeared on the landing for gods sake hurry boy he shouted and then he saw kane he pulled a luger from his pocket and fired one wild shot that ricocheted from the wall causing them all to duck instinctively and then he turned back into his study and slammed the door kane moved cautiously up to the landing and flattened himself against the wall he reached over quickly and tried the door it was locked jordan and jamal crossed to the other side and they waited muller made no sound kane nodded to jamal and the somali moved forward silently fired a long burst that shattered the lock and kicked the door open he jumped back to the shelter of the wall but muller made no move after a moment kane peered round the corner into the room it was empty and in the far wall another door stood open it gave on to a back stairway and he led the way moving cautiously down into the darkness the door at the bottom was closed and when he opened it he found himself standing in the garden do you think hes still there jordan whispered kane nodded he must be i locked the gate and hes too small to get over that wall without help a bullet sang through the bushes and dunted against the wall a few feet away they crouched down and jamal moved in beside them dont be a fool muller kane called there are three of us and were well armed you dont stand a chance somewhere a bird disturbed by the unaccustomed noise lifted through the bushes and there was an uneasy fluttering from the doves that perched on the roof of the house nightly wed better split up kane told jordan softly this isnt getting us anywhere but for gods sake dont start any indiscriminate firing you might get me instead of muller jordan grinned ill be careful jamal moved away to the right and kane started to crawl forward the ground was wet with dew and he got to his feet and stood in the shadow of a fig tree acutely aware of every sound and then another shot was fired and jordan cried hes making for the gate kane head him off kane moved forward quickly and came out on to the path as muller appeared some twenty or thirty feet away the german ran to the gate and vainly tried to open it as jordan emerged from the bushes and joined kane the german turned to face them despair in his eyes he held the luger close against his right thigh and kane lifted the submachine gun dont be a fool muller raised the luger and fired and jordan seemed to catch his breath sharply and stumbled sideways into kane muller raised the luger again and jamal stepped out of the bushes and fired a burst that drove the german back against the gate jordans face was twisted with pain and kane could feel blood trickling across his hand as he supported him he called to jamal and the somali lifted jordan in his arms and carried him back towards the house kane was about to follow when muller groaned he hesitated and then walked down to the gate and dropped to one knee beside the german his eyes were open and glazed with pain and his chest seemed completely shattered kane leaned down and said urgently muller can you hear me where are the others but he was wasting his time mullers eyeballs retracted and blood erupted from his mouth his head fell to one side and he lay still kane stayed there for a moment thinking and then he dragged the body off the path into the bushes and unlocked the gate he went back up the path to the house jamal had stripped jordans shirt from his body the bullet had caught him beneath the left breast but a close examination showed that it had been deflected by a rib scoring a deep groove in the flesh which bled freely but was not otherwise dangerous as jamal tore the shirt into strips and quickly bandaged the wound jordan opened his eyes dont worry about me he said youve still got skiros to think about after weve got you to a doctor kane said as jamal picked him up the young geologist fainted and kane led the way down through the garden to the truck the somali eased jordan into the back seat then climbed in beside kane as they drove away the surrounding houses were quiet and kane reflected grimly that it was a fortunate thing that in dahrein gunfire in the night was not so unique as to arouse comment he braked to a halt outside the hotel and jamal followed him in jordan cradled in his arms the foyer was deserted and a hindu nightclerk dozed behind the desk kane grabbed him by the shoulder and brought him rudely awake where is skiros the hindu spread his hands he is away sahib he has been away for several days now the man was lying kane was sure of that but for the moment he let it go is doctor hamid still living here when the clerk nodded kane went on give me a key for a room on the first floor and get him out of bed tell him its urgent the clerk moved round the desk handed him a key and went upstairs ahead of them kane quickly checked the number of the key located the room and opened the door jamal laid jordan gently on the bed and stood back jordans face was beaded with sweat and as kane anxiously examined him the door opened and a thinfaced greying arab entered he wore a dressinggown and carried a black bag he nodded briefly to kane pushed him out of the way and leaned over jordan he straightened up and opened his bag looks worse than it is he said in precise english hes a lucky man though til leave him with you then kane said til be back later to see how he is doctor hamid nodded impatiently his mind already on the task before him and kane and jamal left the room when they went downstairs the clerk was back behind his desk reading a newspaper kane went and leaned against the desk and waited the man looked over the newspaper and smiled uncertainly there is something i can do for you sahib you can tell me where skiros is kane said the hindu shrugged as i have already told you sahib i have not seen mr skiros for several days normally im a patient man kane said but youve caught me on an offnight either you tell me where skiros is or ill ask my friend here to break your arm the clerk looked at jamal and winced that will not be necessary sahib there is a limit to all things even loyalty mr skiros was here about an hour ago he took many papers from his office and a quantity of money from the safe he told me he was going away for a while that if anyone asked for him i was to say i knew nothing was marie ferret with him the clerk shook his head he made two telephone calls that is all kane glanced across at the switchboard and smiled and naturally you listened in to those calls the hindu shrugged the first was to professor muller mr skiros told him to hurry he said that everything was arranged and the second that was to captain gonzalez the customs chief mr skiros told him to come round at once and to bring all the money he could lay his hands on did he come he arrived twenty minutes later he was very angry sahib but mr skiros threatened him about what kane said the clerk shook his head i am not sure sahib it sounded as if they had been business partners kane stood there for a moment a slight frown on his face and then he nodded to jamal who had been standing impassively at his side crossed the hall quickly and went out into the street as they walked along the waterfront many things became clear to him the fact that skiros had denied all knowledge of cunninghams arrival in dahrein was understandable but that gonzalez had missed him was not so easily explained the customs chief was lazy and shirked his duties but every beggar in town was his spy and little happened that he didnt get to hear about and what about all those times kane had brought currency into dahrein for skiros gonzalez hadnt searched the boat once obviously because hed been fixed by skiros and they hadnt bothered to take kane into their confidence they had arrived at the customs chiefs house kane pulled hard on the bell chain and waited after a while there was a movement on the other side of the door and gonzalez peered out through the grill who is it he asked id like a word with you kane told him its rather urgent grumbling gonzalez unchained the door it opened slightly and jamal kicked it back against the wall when kane moved in through the gateway gonzalez was sprawled on the ground what is the meaning of this he demanded angrily kane hauled him to his feet and pulled him close wheres skiros something very like fear appeared in the spaniards eyes but he tried to bluster how should i know kane held him with one hand and turned to jamal he spoke clearly and distinctly in arabic this dog knows where miss ferret is being held prisoner make him talk the somalis great hands reached out and fastened around the spaniards shoulders a second later he was bent over one mighty knee back arched he screamed once and kane moved forward and nodded to jamal as the somali relaxed the pressure gonzalez stretched out a hand appealingly to kane tell this black devil to leave me alone not until youve told me what i want to know kane said harshly skiros and the girl are on board selims dhow the farah gonzalez said they sail with the dawn tide kane nodded to jamal and the somali dropped the customs chief to the ground where he lay groaning with pain kane hurried along the waterfront and turned on to the jetty several dhows were tied alongside but there was no sign of the farah for a moment he was filled with fear and then jamal touched him on the shoulder and pointed the farah was anchored in the middle of the harbour no other boats were moored in the vicinity and moonlight carpeted the water with silver it would be impossible to approach in a boat without being seen and they crouched low and worked their way towards the end of the jetty kane paused as he heard a slight sound he peered over the edge of the jetty and saw an arab sitting in a dinghy hidden in the shadows between two dhows is that you sahib the arab called softly kane realized that he had been mistaken for muller he started to climb down the iron ladder backwards and replied in a muffled tone yes reach out your hand to steady me he halfturned and kicked the man in the stomach as he stood up the man subsided into the bottom of the boat with a groan and kane dropped down beside him he quickly peeled off his shirt he was busy with the laces of his desert boots when jamal joined him the somali squatted beside him in the darkness and kane quickly explained the plan when he had finished there was a worried frown on jamals face but he nodded reluctantly kane stood up clad only in his khaki pants he took the knife from the belt of the arab sailor who lay in the bottom of the boat pushed it into his waistband and lowered himself into the water he started to swim out into the harbour using a powerful but quiet breaststroke he felt naked and alone as he came from the shadows between the moored dhows and moved into the silver path of the moon luckily a slight breeze was blowing in from the sea lifting the surface of the water into tiny waves which helped to hide him as he approached the farah he could see the lookout standing in the bows rifle slung from his shoulder kane swam quietly under the bowsprit and rested hands firmly wrapped round the anchor rope after a moment he started to climb hand over hand the lookout was standing on the other side of the deck looking towards the jetty kane climbed over the rail and moved on silent feet he hit the man hard across the back of the neck with the edge of his hand and the arab slid to the deck without a sound kane picked up his rifle and checked the action then moved down the short flight of wooden steps that led to the waist of the ship he paused in the shadows the crew lived in a portion of the hold and he peered inside the hatch voices were raised in laughter and there was a smell of cooking he laid down the rifle and pulled the heavy storm cover of the hatch into place securing it with metal brackets he started to get to his feet hand reaching for the rifle and from behind him there came a slight creak the cold muzzle of a revolver touched him gently in the back of the neck and skiros said very good my friend it almost came off kane turned slowly and the german smiled so old mahmoud didnt keep his promise to hold you not when he found youd taken marie kane said you touched his arab pride on the raw there a matter of indifference to me ive been waiting for muller presumably he wont be coming im afraid not kane said skiros smiled again in a way you have done me a favour he might have proved troublesome youve only anticipated my own intention that i can believe kane said drily skiros pointed to the hatch now you can open it again there seems to be no further reason to delay our departure kane removed the metal brackets as slowly as possible he pulled back the hatch and skiros called all hands on deck the arab seamen poured up from below and stood in a group talking excitedly eyeing kane in an unfriendly manner skiros called forward one who was obviously the mate and ordered him to make sail then he pushed kane along the deck towards the stern he opened the door of the captains cabin underneath the poopdeck and pushed him inside kane remembered his last visit the night the attempt had been made on his life by one of selims men the cabin looked just the same there were rugs and cushions scattered on the floor round a low brass coffee table and underneath the great stern windows a sleeping couch was freshly prepared skiros stood on the other side of the table and sighed if only you and i could have seen eyetoeye with each other hardly likely kane said youre finished no great coup the suez canal still open what will the fiihrer say he has other things on his mind the panzers rolled yesterday my friend poland is already facing the worst defeat in europe since the first world war i thought that was the one germany lost kane said skiros scowled not this time i know tomorrow the world what have you done with marie skiros took out one of his oily black cheroots and lit it awkwardly with one hand he chuckled coughing heavily as the smoke caught the back of his throat i find all this rather amusing i never thought you were the type for love and romance and all that sort of thing he took a key from his pocket moved across to a small door unlocked it and stood to one side marie ferret moved out into the room for a moment she stood there dazed and bewildered and then she saw kane and came straight to him has he harmed you kane said she shook her head no but i found his conversation as revolting as his person skiros laughed until the flesh danced across his great body i wonder how youll talk when your friend here is bait for the sharks out in the gulf he thumbed back the hammer of the revolver and centred it on kanes stomach deliberately kane looked beyond the german out through the open window his eyes on the thick rope of the stern anchor as he watched something moved and two hands appeared over the edge of the window a moment later jamal peered cautiously into the room kane concentrated everything on keeping skiros talking he slipped a hand into his pocket and took out the knotted handkerchief that contained the necklace he had found in the passage leading to shebas tomb he tossed it down on the brass coffee table kill me he said calmly and youll be making the greatest mistake of your life the german laughed harshly dont try that sort of stuff now it wont save your skin kane picked up the handkerchief and started to untie the knots see for yourself and this is only a sample shebas treasure we found it back there at the temple he held up the necklace to the light and the emeralds glowed with green fire the germans jaw went slack and an expression of awe appeared on his face holy mother of god ive never seen anything like it he snatched the necklace from kanes hand and examined it closely after a moment he looked up and a genial smile appeared on his face in the right quarter this will be worth a fortune im obliged to you they were the last words he spoke on earth he started to laugh his finger tightening on the trigger of the revolver and jamal stepped off the sleeping couch arms extended one hand fastened over the germans mouth the other struck the revolver from his grasp skiros started to struggle but jamal slipped an arm round his throat and bent him backward over one knee panic appeared in the germans eyes and his legs threshed wildly there was a sound as if a dry branch had snapped and he was still marie gave a gasp of horror as jamal lowered him to the floor and turned towards them as kane bent to pick up the fallen necklace the stern anchor passed the window and the dhow moved forward as the wind caught the great lateen sails kane gestured towards the windows and pushed jamal forward quickly theres no time to lose the somali slipped out feet first and disappeared the dhow was already picking up speed as it moved towards the harbour entrance and kane pushed marie through the window he looked back once at the body of the german who lay with his face slightly turned towards him eyes open and then took a deep breath and jumped as he surfaced the dhow was already moving away and he started to swim towards marie who was clearly visible in the moonlight she waited for him treading water when he reached her she fumbled for his hand and for a little while they stayed there like that looking at each other the dhow moved out into the open sea lateen sails billowing in the wind and kane looked again at marie and for some unaccountable reason they started to laugh he held her hand very tightly and they turned and swam slowly together through the warm night towards
