number of years ago the author of this story set out to depict life among the boys of a great city and especially among those who had to make their own way in the world among those already described are the ways of newsboys match boys peddlers street musicians and many others in the present tale are related the adventures of a country lad who after living for some time with a strange hermit goes forth into the world and finds work first in a summer hotel and then in a large hotel in the city joe finds his road no easy one to travel and he has to face not a few hardships but in the end all turns out well it may be added here that many of the happenings told of in this story odd as they may seem are taken from life truth is indeed stranger than fiction and life itself is full of romance from start to finish if there is a moral to be drawn from this story it is a twofold one namely that honesty is always the best policy and that if one wishes to succeed in life he must stick at his work steadily and watch every opportunity for advancement joe the hotel boy chapter i out in a storm what do you think of this storm joe i think it is going to be a heavy one ned i wish we were back home replied joe bodley as he looked at the heavy clouds which overhung lake tandy do you think well catch much rain before we get back and ned who was the son of a rich man and well dressed looked at the new suit of clothes that he wore im afraid we shall ned those black clouds back of mount sam mean something if this new suit gets soaked it will be ruined grumbled ned and gave a sigh i am sorry for the suit ned but i didnt think it was going to rain when we started oh i am not blaming you joe it looked clear enough this morning cant we get to some sort of shelter before the rain reaches us we can try which is the nearest shelter joe bodley mused for a moment the nearest that i know of is over at yonder point ned its an old hunting lodge that used to belong to the cameron family it has been deserted for several years then let us row for that place and be quick about it said ned talmadge i am not going to get wet if i can help it as he spoke he took up a pair of oars lying in the big rowboat he and joe bodley occupied joe was already rowing and the rich boy joined in and the craft was headed for the spot joe had pointed out the lake was one located in the central part of the state of pennsylvania it was perhaps a mile wide and more than that long and surrounded by mountains and long ranges of hills at the lower end of the lake was a small settlement of scant importance and at the upper end where there was a stream of no mean size was the town of riverside at riverside were situated several summer hotels and boarding houses and also the elegant mansion in which ned talmadge resided with his parents and his four sisters joe bodley was as poor as ned talmadge was rich yet the two lads were quite friendly joe knew a good deal about hunting and fishing and also knew all about handling boats they frequently went out together and ned insisted upon paying the poorer boy for all extra services joes home was located on the side of the mountain which was just now wrapped in such dark and ominous looking clouds he lived with hiram bodley an old man who was a hermit the home consisted of a cabin of two rooms scantily furnished hiram bodley had been a hunter and guide but of late years rheumatism had kept him from doing work and joe was largely the support of the pair taking out pleasure parties for pay whenever he could and fishing and hunting in the between times and using or selling what was gained thereby there was a good deal of a mystery surrounding joes parentage it was claimed that he was a nephew of hiram bodley and that after the death of his mother and sisters his father had drifted out to california and then to australia what the real truth concerning him was we shall learn later joe was a boy of twelve but constant life in the open air had made him tall and strong and he looked to be several years older he had dark eyes and hair and was much tanned by the sun the rowboat had been out a good distance on the lake and a minute before the shore was gained the large drops of rain began to fall we are going to get wet after all cried ned chagrined pull for all you are worth and well soon be under the trees answered joe they bent to the oars and a dozen more strokes sent the rowboat under a clump of pines growing close to the edge of the lake just as the boat struck the bank and ned leaped out there came a great downpour which made the surface of lake tandy fairly sizzle run to the lodge ned ill look after the boat shouted joe but youll get wet never mind run i tell you thus admonished ned ran for the old hunting lodge which was situated about two hundred feet away joe remained behind long enough to secure the rowboat and the oars and then he followed his friend just as one porch of the old lodge was reached there came a flash of lightning followed by a clap of thunder that made ned jump then followed more thunder and lightning and the rain came down steadily ugh i must say i dont like this at all remarked ned as he crouched in a corner of the shelter i hope the lightning doesnt strike this place we can be thankful that we were not caught out in the middle of the lake ned i agree on that joe but it doesnt help matters much oh dear me and ned shrank down as another blinding flash of lightning lit up the scene it was not a comfortable situation and joe did not like it any more than did his friend but the hermits boy was accustomed to being out in the elements and therefore was not so impressed by what was taking place the rain will fill the boat said ned presently never mind we can easily bail her out or turn her over when do you think this storm will stop in an hour or two most likely such storms never last very long what time is it ned halfpast two answered ned after consulting the handsome watch he carried then if it clears in two hours well have plenty of time to get home before dark i dont care to stay here two hours grumbled ned its not a very inviting place its better than being out under the trees answered joe cheerfully the hermits boy was always ready to look on the brighter side of things oh of course and we have a fine string of fish dont forget that ned we were lucky to get so many before the storm came up do you want the fish or are you going to let me take them id like to have one fish you may take the others not unless you let me pay for them joe oh you neednt mind about paying me but i insist came from ned i wont touch them otherwise all right you can pay me for what i caught no i want to pay for all of them your time is worth something and i know you have to support your the old hermit now all right ned have your own way yes i admit i need all the money i get is the old hermit very sick not so sick but his rheumatism keeps him from going out hunting or fishing so all that work falls to me its a good deal on your shoulders joe i make the best of it for there is nothing else to do by the way joe you once spoke to me about well about yourself went on ned after some hesitation did you ever learn anything more you need not tell me if you dont care to at these words joes face clouded for an instant no i havent learned a thing more ned then you dont really know if you are the hermits nephew or not oh i think i am but i dont know whatever became of my father does the hermit think he is alive he doesnt know and he hasnt any means of finding out well if i were you id find out some way or other im going to find out some day replied joe but to tell the truth i dont know how to go at it uncle hiram doesnt like to talk about it he thinks my father did wrong to go away i imagine they had a quarrel over it has he ever heard from your father since not a word did he write he didnt know where to write to humph it is certainly a mystery joe you are right ned and as i said before i am going to solve it some time even if it takes years of work to do it replied the hermits boy chapter ii a mysterious conversation the old hunting lodge where the two boys had sought shelter was a rambling affair consisting of a square building built of logs and half a dozen wings running to the rear and to one side there were also two piazzas and a shed where wood had been kept for winter use in another year or two this old lodge will fall down remarked ned as he gazed around him it must have been a nice place in its day returned joe what a pity to let it run down in this fashion the rain is coming around on this side now joe let us shift to the other the hermits boy was willing and watching their chance between the downpours they ran around to another portion of the old lodge it certainly is a little better here observed joe as he dashed the water from his cap a minute later the rumbling of the thunder ceased for the time being and they heard a murmur of voices coming from one of the rooms of the lodge why somebody must be here ejaculated ned who can it be two men by their voices answered the hermits boy wait till i take a look at them why not go in questioned the rich youth carelessly they may not be persons that we would care to meet ned you know there are some undesirable characters about the lake thats true not far off was a narrow window the panes of glass of which had long since been broken out moving toward this joe peered into the apartment beyond close to an old fireplace in which a few sticks of halfgreen timber were burning sat two men both were well dressed and joe rightfully surmised that they were from the city each wore a hunting outfit and had a gun but neither had any game we came on a wildgoose chase grumbled one as he stirred the fire got nothing but a soaking for our pains never mind malone returned the other who was evidently the better educated of the two as we had to make ourselves scarce in the city this was as good a place to come to as any dont you think theyll look for us here why should they we were sharp enough not to leave any trail behind at least i was reckon i was just as sharp caven you had to be otherwise you would have been nabbed gaff caven chuckled to himself we outwitted them nicely i must say we deserve credit ive spent more than half of what i got out of the deal went on pat malone for such was the full name of one of the speakers ive spent more than that but never mind my boy fortune will favor us again in the near future a crash of thunder drowned out the conversation following and joe hurried back to where he had left ned well have you found out who they are demanded the rich youth impatiently no ned but i am sure of one thing what is that they are two bad men what makes you think that they said something about having to get out of the city and one spoke about being nabbed evidently they went away to avoid arrest at this announcement ned talmadge whistled softly to himself phew what shall we do about it he asked with a look of concern on his usually passive face joe shrugged his shoulders i dont know what to do let us listen to what they have to say maybe well strike some clew to what they have been doing would that be fair to play the eavesdropper certainly if they are evildoers anybody who has done wrong ought to be locked up for it went on ned boldly with caution the two boys made their way to the narrow window and ned looked in as joe had done the backs of the two men were still towards the opening so the lads were not discovered what is this new game they heard the man called malone ask after a peal of thunder had rolled away among the mountains its the old game of a sick miner with some valuable stocks to sell answered gaff caven have you got the stocks to be sure one thousand shares of the blue bell mine of montana said to be worth exactly fifty thousand dollars phew youre flying high gaff laughed pat malone and why not so long as i sell the stocks what did they cost you well they didnt cost me fifty thousand dollars and gaff caven closed one eye suggestively you bet they didnt more than likely they didnt cost you fifty dollars what such elegantly engraved stocks as those pooh i can buy a bushelbasket full of worthless stocks for a dollar came from pat malone but that isnt here nor there i go into the deal if you give me my fair share of the earnings ill give you onethird pat and thats a fair share i think why not make it half because ill do the most of the work its no easy matter to find a victim and gaff caven laughed broadly he had a goodappearing face but his eyes were small and not to be trusted all right ill go in for a third then but how soon is the excitement to begin oh in a week or so ive got the advertisements in the papers already not in new york no its philadelphia this time perhaps ill land one of our quaker friends dont be so sure the quakers may be slow but they generally know what they are doing more thunder interrupted the conversation at this point and when it was resumed the two men talked in such low tones that only an occasional word could be caught by the two boys they surely must be rascals remarked ned in a whisper im half of a mind to have them locked up thats easier said than done answered joe besides we havent any positive proofs against them the wind was now rising and it soon blew so furiously that the two boys were forced to seek the shelter of the woodshed since they did not deem it wise to enter the lodge so long as the two men were inside they waited in the shed for fully half an hour when as suddenly as it had begun the storm let up and the sun began to peep forth from between the scattering clouds now we can go home if we wish said joe but for my part id like to stay and see what those men do and where they go to yes let us stay by all means answered the rich youth they waited a few minutes longer and then ned suggested that they look into the window of the lodge once more the hermits boy was willing and they approached the larger building with caution much to their astonishment the two strangers had disappeared hullo what do you make of that cried ned in amazement perhaps they are in one of the other rooms suggested joe at the risk of being caught they entered the lodge and looked into one room after another every apartment was vacant and they now saw that the fire in the fireplace had been stamped out they must have left while we were in the woodshed said ned maybe they are out on the lake answered the hermits boy and he ran down to the waters edge followed by his companion but though they looked in every direction not a craft of any kind was to be seen joe they didnt take to the water consequently they must have left by one of the mountain paths that is true and if they did theyll have no nice time in getting through all the bushes are sopping wet and the mud is very slippery in places they walked to the rear of the lodge and soon found the footprints of the two strangers they led through the bushes and were lost at a small brook that ran into the lake there is no use of our trying to follow this any further said joe youll get your clothing covered with water and mud i dont intend to follow answered ned just the same i should like to know more about those fellows i wish i had seen their faces yes its a pity we didnt get a better look at them but id know their voices by the time they gave up the hunt the sun was shining brightly both walked to where the boat had been left and joe turned the craft over so that the water might run out then he mopped off the seats as best he could ned wanted to go directly home and he and joe rowed the craft in the direction of riverside as they passed along the lake shore the hermits boy noted that several trees had been struck by lightning im glad the lightning didnt strike the lodge while we were there said he it was certainly a severe storm while it lasted joe by the way shall i say anything about those two men perhaps it wont do any harm to tell your father ned very well ill do it soon riverside was reached and having paid for the fish and the outing ned talmadge walked in the direction of his residence joe shoved off from the tiny dock and struck out for his home he did not dream of the calamity that awaited him there chapter iii a home in ruins as joe rowed toward his home on the mountain side a good mile from riverside he could not help but think of the two mysterious men and of what they had said they were certainly rascals he mused and from their talk they must have come from new york and are now going to try some game in philadelphia the hermits boy was tired out by the days outing yet he pulled a fairly quick stroke and it was not long before he reached the dock at which he and hiram bodley were in the habit of leaving their boat he cleaned the craft out hid the oars in the usual place and then with his fishing lines in one hand and a good sized fish in the other started up the trail leading to the place that he called home what a place to come to alongside of the one ned lives in he said to himself i suppose the talmadges think this is a regular hovel i wish we could afford something better or at least live in town its lonesome here with nobody but old uncle hiram around as joe neared the cabin something seemed to come over him and for some reason he could not understand he felt very much depressed in spirits he quickened his pace until a turn of the trail brought the homestead into view a cry of alarm broke from his lips and with good reason the little shelter had stood close to a large hemlock tree the lightning had struck the tree causing it to topple ever in falling it had landed fairly and squarely upon the cabin smashing it completely one corner of the cabin was in ashes but the heavy rain had probably extinguished the conflagration uncle hiram cried the boy as soon as he recovered from his amazement uncle hiram where are you there was no answer to this call and for the moment joes heart seemed to stop beating was the old hermit under that pile of ruins if so it was more than likely he was dead dropping his fish and his lines the youth sprang to the front of the cabin the door had fallen to the ground and before him was a mass of wreckage with a small hollow near the bottom he dropped on his knees and peered inside uncle hiram he called again there was no answer and he listened with bated breath then he fancied he heard a groan coming from the rear of what was left of the cabin he ran around to that point and pulled aside some boards and a broken window sash uncle hiram are you here joe came in a low voice full of pain the man tried to say more but could not hauling aside some more boards joe now beheld the hermit lying flat on his back with a heavy beam resting on his chest he was also suffering from a cut on the forehead and from a broken ankle this is too bad uncle hiram he said in a trembling voice ill get you out just as soon as i can be be careful joe i i my ribs must be broken gasped the hermit ill be careful answered the boy and began to pull aside one board after another then he tugged away at the beam but could not budge it raise it up joe it is crushing the life ou out of me said the hermit faintly ill pry it up answered the boy and ran off to get a block of wood then he procured a stout pole and with this raised the heavy beam several inches can you crawl out uncle hiram there was no answer and joe saw that the man had fainted from exhaustion fixing the pole so it could not slip he caught hold of the hermit and dragged him to a place of safety joe had never had to care for a hurt person before and he scarcely knew how to proceed he laid the hermit on the grass and washed his face with water soon hiram bodley opened his eyes once more my chest he groaned all of my ribs must be broken and my ankle is broken too and he groaned again i had better get a doctor uncle hiram a doctor cant help me perhaps he can i havent any faith in doctors a doctor operated on my mother and killed her but doctor gardner is a nice man he will do all he can for you i am sure urged joe well dr gardner is a good fellow i admit if you can can get him ill ill the sufferer tried to go on but could not i think i can get him but i hate to leave you alone and joe stared around helplessly he wished he had ned with him never mind give me a drink then go answered hiram bodley he had often taken doctor gardner out to hunt with him and liked the physician not a little inside of five minutes joe was on the way to the doctors residence which was on the outskirts of riverside he had left the hermit as comfortable as possible on a mattress and covered with a cloth to keep off the night air for it was now growing late and the sun had set behind the mountains tired though he was the boy pulled with might and main and so reached the dock of the physicians home in a short space of time running up the walk of the neatlykept garden he mounted the piazza and rang the bell several times whats the matter asked doctor gardner who came himself to answer the summons our cabin is in ruins because of the storm and mr bodley is badly hurt answered joe and related some of the particulars this is certainly too bad my boy said the physician ill come at once and do what i can for him he ran for a case of instruments and also for some medicines and then followed joe back to the boat you act as if you were tired said the doctor after he had watched joe at the oars for several minutes i am tired sir ive been rowing a good deal today but i guess i can make it let me row said the physician and took the oars he was a fine oarsman and the trip was made in half the time it would have taken joe to cover the distance at the dock there was a lantern used by joe and the hermit when they went fishing at night this was lit and the two hurried up the trail to the wreck of the cabin hiram bodley was resting where joe had left him he was breathing with difficulty and did not at first recognize the doctor take it off he murmured take it off it is is crushing th the life out of of me mr bodley hiram dont you know me asked doctor gardner kindly oh so its you i guess you cant do much doctor can you i im done for and a spasm of pain crossed the sufferers face while there is life there is hope answered the physician noncommittally he recognized at once that hiram bodleys condition was critical hell get over it wont he questioned joe quickly the doctor did not answer but turned to do what he could for the hurt man he felt of his chest and listened to his breathing and then administered some medicine his ankle is hurt too said joe never mind the ankle just now joe was the soft answer there was something in the tone that alarmed the boy and he caught the physician by the arm doctor tell me the truth he cried is he is he going to die i am afraid so my lad his ribs are crushed and one of them has stuck into his right lung at these words the tears sprang into the boys eyes and it was all he could do to keep from crying outright even though the old hermit had been rough in his ways joe thought a good deal of the man cannot you do something doctor he pleaded not here we might do something in a hospital but he would not survive the journey he is growing weaker every moment be brave my lad it is a terrible trial i know but you must remember that all things are for the best joe knelt beside the sufferer and took hold of his hand hiram bodley looked at him and then at the doctor i i cant live i know it he said hoarsely joe stay by me till i die wont you yes faltered the boy oh this is awful im sorry to leave you so soon joe i i thought id be be able to do something for you some day you have done something for me uncle hiram all ive got goes to you joe doctor do you hear that i do it it aint much but its something the blue box i put it in the blue box here the sufferer began to cough the blue box came from joe questioningly yes joe all in the blue box the papers and the money and the blue box is is again the sufferer began to cough i i want water he gasped the water was brought and he took a gulp then he tried to speak again but the effort was in vain the doctor and joe raised him up uncle hiram speak to me cried the boy but hiram bodley was past speaking he had passed to the great beyond chapter iv the search for the blue box three days after his tragic death hiram bodley was buried although he was fairly well known in the lake region only a handful of people came to his funeral joe was the chief mourner and it can honestly be said that he was much downcast when he followed the hermit to his last resting place after the funeral several asked joe what he intended to do he could not answer the question have you found that blue box questioned doctor gardner no sir i have not thought of it probably it contains money and papers of value joe i am going to look for it today said the boy i i couldnt look for it while while i understand well i trust you locate the box and that it contains all you hope for added the physician as luck would have it ned talmadges family had just gone away on a trip to the west so mr talmadge could offer the boy no assistance but ned was on hand and did what he could you dont know what youll do next do you joe asked ned as he and joe returned to the wreck of the cabin no well if you havent any money ill do what i can for you thank you ned you are very kind it must be hard to be thrown out on the world in this fashion went on the rich boy sympathetically it is hard after all i thought a good deal of uncle hiram he was strange in his ways but he had a good heart wasnt he shot in the head once by accident in the woods yes maybe that made him queer at times perhaps so ive got six dollars and a half of my spending money saved up you may have that if you wish continued ned generously id rather not take it ned why not if i can i want to be independent besides i think there is money around somewhere and joe mentioned the missing blue box you must hunt for that blue box by all means cried the rich boy ill help you after the death of hiram bodley joe and two of the lake guides had managed to repair one room of the brokendown cabin and from this the funeral had taken place the room contained a bed a table two benches and a few dishes and cooking utensils the floor was bare and the window was broken out it was truly a most uninviting home of course you are not going to stay here now you are alone said ned after a look around i dont know where else to go ned why not move into town perhaps i will but i want to find that blue box before i decide on anything without delay the two boys set to work among the ruins looking into every hole and corner they could think of and locate they pulled away heavy boards and logs and joe even got a spade and dug up the ground at certain points it doesnt seem to be here said ned after an hour had passed it must be here cried joe perhaps it was buried under a tree that may be true anyway i am certain it is somewhere around this cabin after that the hunt was continued for another hour and they visited several spots in that locality where joe thought the blue box might have been placed but it was all to no purpose the box failed to come to light at last the two boys sat down on a bench in front of the cabin both were tired out ned especially so joe was much downcast and his friend did what he could to cheer him up the box is bound to come to light some day said ned that is unless some of those men carried it off what men ned the fellows who helped to mend the cabin just before the funeral oh i dont think they would steal the box bart andrews and jack thompson are as honest as the day is long well its mighty queer you cant find some trace of the blue box the boys talked the matter over for some time and then ned announced that he must go home you can go with me if you wish he said it will be better than staying here all alone but joe declined the offer ill stay here and begin the hunt again the first thing in the morning he said well if you want anything come and see me joe wont you i will ned ned had come over in his own boat and now joe walked down to the lake with him his friend gone the hermits boy returned to the delapidated cabin he was hungry but he had no heart to eat he munched some bread and cheese which a neighbor had brought over he felt utterly alone in the great worlds and when he thought of this a strange feeling came over him it was a bitter night for the poor boy but when morning came his mind was made up he would make his own way in the world asking aid from no one not even ned and if i cant find the blue box ill get along without it he told himself as soon as it was light he procured breakfast and then started on another hunt for the missing box the entire day was spent in the search but without results towards night joe went down to the lake here he caught a couple of small fish which he fried for his supper all told joe had exactly a dollar and a half of his own and nine dollars which he had found in the hermits pocketbook ten dollars and a half he mused as he counted the amount over not very much to go out into the world with if i want to do anything in town ill have to buy some clothes from this it will be surmised that joe was thinking of giving up his roving life around the lake and mountains and this was true hunting and fishing appealed to him only in an uncertain way and he longed to go forth into the busy world and make something of himself he had two suits of clothing but both were very much worn and so were his shoes and his cap hiram bodley had left some old clothing but they were too big for the boy i guess ill get jasok the peddler to come up here and make me an offer for what is here he told himself jasok was a hebrew peddler who drove around through the lake region selling tinware and doing all sorts of trading it was time for him to visit that neighborhood and joe went to the nearest house on the main road and asked about the man he will most likely be along tomorrow joe said the neighbor if he comes mr smith will you send him over to my place tell him i want an offer for the things going to sell out joe yes sir what are you going to do after that try for some job in town thats a good idea hunting and fishing isnt what it used to be what do you want for the things all i can get and a brief smile hovered on joes face i wouldnt sell out too cheap jasok is a great fellow to drive a bargain if he wont give me a fair price ill load the things on the rowboat and sell them in town thats an idea do you want to sell hirams doublebarrel shot gun yes sir ill give you ten dollars for it i was going to ask twelve mr smith its a pretty good gun so it is although it is a little bit oldfashioned well bring it over and ill allow you twelve dollars answered the neighbor who was willing to assist joe all he could joe went back for the gun without delay and received his money then he returned to the cabin and brought out all the goods he wished to sell by the middle of the next day the hebrew peddler appeared at first he declared that all of the things joe had to sell were not worth two dollars very well if you think that we wont talk about it said joe briefly da vos all vorn out said jasok de clothes vos rags and de furniture an dishes was kracked if you dont want them ill take them to town and sell them i am sure moskowsky will buy them now it happened that moskowsky was a rival peddler who also boasted of the ownership of a secondhand store to think that the goods might go to this man nettled jasok exceedingly vell i likes you cho he said i vos your friend an i gif you dree dollars for dem dings you can have them for ten dollars answered the boy a long talk followed and in the end the hebrew peddler agreed to pay seven dollars and a half providing joe would help to carry the goods to the main road where the wagon had been left the money was paid over and by nightfall all of the goods were on the wagon and joe was left at the cabin with nothing but the suit on his back but he had thirty dollars in his pocket which he counted over with great satisfaction i ought to be able to get something to do before that is gone he told himself if i dont it will be my own fault chapter v a new suit of clothes on the following day it rained early in the morning so joe had to wait until noon before he left the old cabin he took with him all that remained of his possessions including the precious pocketbook with the thirty dollars when he thought of the blue box he sighed perhaps it will never come to light he told himself well if it does not ill have to make the best of it two oclock found him on the streets of riverside which was a town of fair size during the summer months many visitors were in the place and the hotels and boarding houses were crowded there was one very fine clothing store in riverside but joe did not deem it best with his limited capital to go there for a suit instead he sought out a modest establishment on one of the side streets just ahead of him was an irish couple who had evidently not been in this country many years the man entered the store awkwardly as if he did not feel at home not so his wife who walked a little in advance of her husband have you got any mens coats said she to the clerk who came forward to wait on the pair if i can get one cheap for me husband here ill buy one oh yes madam was the ready reply we have the best stock in town by all odds you cant fail to be suited so saying he led the way to a counter piled high with the articles called for and hauled them over there said he pulling out one of a decidedly ugly pattern there is one of first quality cloth it was made for a gentleman of this town but did not exactly fit him and so well sell it cheap and what is the price three dollars three dollars exclaimed the irish lady lifting up her hands in extreme astonishment three dollars youll be afther thinkin were made of money sure ill give you a dollar and a half no maam we dont trade in that way we dont very often take half what we ask for an article mike said she pull off yer coat an thry it on three dollars and it looks as if it was all cotton not a thread of cotton in that was the clerks reply not wan but a good many im thinkin retorted the irish lady as she helped her husband draw on the coat it fitted tolerably well and mike seemed mightily pleased with his transformation come said the wife what will ye take as its you ill take off twentyfive cents replied the clerk and sell it to me for two dollars inquired his customer who had good cause for her inaccurate arithmetic for two dollars and seventyfive cents two dollars and seventyfive cents its taking the bread out of the childers mouths youd have us paying such a price as that ill give you two twentyfive an ill be coming again some time we couldnt take so low as two twentyfive maam you may have it for two dollars and a half after another ineffectual attempt to get it for two dollars and a quarter the irish woman finally offered two dollars and fortyfive cents and this offer was accepted she pulled out a paper of change and counted out two dollars and forty cents when she declared that she had not another cent but the clerk understood her game and coolly proceeded to put the coat back on the pile then the woman very opportunely found another fivecent piece stored away in the corner of her pocket its robbin me ye are said she as she paid it over oh no maam you are getting a great bargain answered the clerk joe had witnessed the bargaining with a good deal of quiet amusement as soon as the irish couple had gone the clerk came toward the boy well young man what can i do for you he asked pleasantly i want a suit of clothing not an expensive suit but one guaranteed to be all wool a light or a dark suit a dark gray i can fit you out in a fine suit of this order and the clerk pointed to several lying in a heap nearby i dont want that sort i want something on the order of those in the window marked nine dollars and a half oh all right several suits were brought forth and one was found that fitted joe exceedingly well you guarantee this to be all wool asked the boy every thread of it then ill take it very well the price is twelve dollars isnt it like that in the window on that order but a trifle better it seems to me to be about the same suit ill give you nine dollars and a half i cant take it ill give it to you for eleven and a half that is our best figure then ill go elsewhere for a suit answered joe and started to leave the clothing establishment hold on dont be so fast cried the clerk catching him by the arm ill make it eleven and a quarter not a cent more than the advertised price nine and a half replied joe firmly oh but this isnt the same suit its just like it to my eye but you neednt sell it for that if you dont want it mason harris are offering some bargains i believe you can get a better bargain here than anywhere in this town or in philadelphia either answered the clerk who did not intend to let his prospective customer get away well make it an even eleven dollars and say no more about it instead of answering joe started once more for the door hold on i havent got time make it ten and a half at that price we are losing exactly half a dollar on that suit not a cent over what i offered we cant sell suits at such a loss it would ruin us then dont do it i think mason harris have some good suits very cheap and they are quite uptodate too added joe our suits are the best in town young man take this one for an even ten dollar bill i will if youll throw in one of those half dollar caps answered our hero well have your own way but its a sacrifice grumbled the clerk he wanted to wrap up the suit but afraid he might substitute something else joe insisted upon donning the suit then and there and likewise the new cap then he had the old articles of wearing apparel done up into a bundle and paid over the ten dollars youre pretty smart after a bargain said the clerk ive got to be when i strike such fellows as you was the reply you got a better bargain than that irish woman did i did if the suit is all wool but if its cotton im stuck returned our hero and with his bundle under his arm he walked from the store he had left his rowboat in charge of an old boatman named ike fairfield and now he walked down to the boathouse just in time joe said the old boatman want to earn a dollar to be sure i do answered our hero a party of ladies want a long row around the lake you can have the job all right ike i charged them a dollar and a quarter ill keep the quarter for my commission that is fair one of the ladies said she wanted somebody that looked pretty decent i think youll fill the bill with that new suit i didnt expect to wear the suit out on the lake but in this case ill keep it on answered joe i find it pays to keep well dressed when you take out the summer boarders answered the old boatman and it pays to keep the boats in good shape too where am i to get the party over to the dock of mallisons hotel one of the ladies is mallisons niece why dont they take a hotel boat all engaged two days ago its a busy season but ive got to be going you had better go over to the dock at once they want to go out at three oclock sharp very well ill be on hand answered our hero chapter vi an accident on the lake joe certainly presented a neat appearance when he rowed over to the hotel dock before going he purchased a new collar and a dark blue tie and these with his new suit and new cap set him off very well the boat had been cleaned in the morning and when the ladies appeared they inspected the craft with satisfaction what a nice clean boat said mabel mallison the niece of the proprietor of the hotel and a nice clean boatman too whispered one of her friends i couldnt bear that man we had day before yesterday with his dirty hands and the tobacco juice around his mouth the ladies to go out were four in number and two sat in the bow and two in the stern it made quite a heavy load but as they were not out for speed our hero did not mind it we wish to go up to fern rock said mabel mallison they tell me there are some beautiful ferns to be gathered there there are answered joe i saw them last week and i wish to get some nice birch bark if i can said another of the ladies i can get you plenty of it joe rowed along in his best style and while doing so the ladies of the party asked him numerous questions concerning the lake and vicinity when fern rock was reached all went ashore and our hero pointed out the ferns he had seen and dug up such as the others wished to take along an hour was spent over the ferns and in getting some birch bark and then they started on the return for the hotel id like to row cried one of the ladies a rather plump personage oh jennie i dont think you can cried another of course i can answered jennie and sprang up from her seat to take the oars be careful came in a warning from joe as the boat began to rock oh im not afraid said the plump young lady and leaned forward to catch hold of one oar just then her foot slipped and she fell on the gunwale causing the boat to tip more than ever as she did this mabel mallison who was leaning over the side gazing down into the clear waters of the lake gave a shriek oh save me came from her and then she went over with a loud splash joe was startled and the ladies left in the boat set up a wail of terror she will be drowned oh save her save her somebody it is my fault shrieked the plump young lady i tipped the boat over joe said nothing but looked over the side of the boat he saw the body of mabel mallison not far away but it was at the lake bottom and did not offer to rise its queer she doesnt come up he thought then he gave a second look and saw that the dress of the unfortunate one was caught in some sharp rocks without hesitation he dived overboard straight for the bottom it was no easy matter to unfasten the garment which was caught in a crack between two heavy stones but at the second tug it came free and a moment later both our hero and mabel mallison came to the surface oh cried two of the ladies in the rowboat is she drowned i trust not answered joe sit still please or the boat will surely go over as best he could joe hoisted mabel into the craft and then clambered in himself as he did so the unfortunate girl gave a gasp and opened her eyes oh she murmured you are safe now mabel said one of her companions and to think it was my fault murmured the plump young lady i shall never forgive myself as long as i live mabel mallison had swallowed some water but otherwise she was unhurt but her pretty blue dress was about ruined and joes new suit did not look near as well as it had when he had donned it let us row for the hotel said one of the young ladies are you all right she asked of joe yes maam barring the wetting it was brave of you to go down after mabel indeed it was cried that young lady if it hadnt been for you i might have been drowned and she gave a deep shudder i saw she was caught and thats why i went over after her answered our hero simply it wasnt so much to do all dripping as he was joe caught up the oars of the boat and sent the craft in the direction of the hotel at a good speed that she might not take cold a shawl was thrown over mabels wet shoulders the arrival of the party at the hotel caused a mild sensation mabel hurried to her room to put on dry clothing and joe was directed to go around to the kitchen but when the proprietor of the place had heard what joe had done for his niece he sent the lad to a private apartment and provided him with dry clothing belonging to another who was of our heros size that was a fine thing to do young man said the hotel proprietor when joe appeared dressed in the dry garments and his own clothing had been sent to the laundry to be dried and pressed im glad i was there to do it mr mallison let me see arent you hiram bodleys boy i lived with mr bodley yes that is what i mean it was a terrible accident that killed him are you still living at the tumbleddown cabin no sir ive just sold off the things and i am going to settle in town where i havent decided that yet i was going to hunt up a place when ike fairfield gave me the job of rowing out the young ladies i see you own the boat eh yes sir you ought to be able to make a fair living taking out summer boarders i suppose so but that wont give me anything to do this winter well perhaps something else will turn up by that time andrew mallison drew out a fat wallet i want to reward you for saving mabel he drew out two tendollar bills and held them towards our hero but joe shook his head and drew back thank you very much mr mallison but i dont want any reward but you have earned it fairly my lad i wont touch it if you want to help me you can throw some odd rowing jobs from the hotel in my way then you wont really touch the money no sir how would you like to work for the hotel regularly id like it firstrate if it paid i can guarantee you regular work so long as the summer season lasts and what would it pay at least a dollar a day and your board then ill accept and with thanks for your kindness when can you come im here already that means that you can stay from now on yes sir i dont suppose you want the job of hauling somebody from the lake every day said andrew mallison with a smile not unless i was dressed for it mr mallison still it has been the means of getting me a good position i shall feel safe in sending out parties with you for i know you will do your best to keep them from harm ill certainly do that i can promise you tomorrow you can take out two old ladies who wish to be rowed around the whole lake and shown every point of interest of course you know all the points yes sir i know every foot of ground around the lake and i know the mountains too then there will be no difficulty in keeping you busy i am glad to take you on i am short one man or will be by tonight i am going to let sam cullum go for he drinks too much well you wont have any trouble with me on that score dont you drink not a drop sir i am glad to hear it and it is to your credit concluded the hotel proprietor chapter vii blows and kind deeds several days passed and joe went out half a dozen times on the lake with parties from the hotel all whom he served were pleased with him and treated him so nicely that for the time being his past troubles were forgotten at the beginning of the week ned talmadge came to see him i am going away to join the folks out west said ned i hope you will have a good time answered our hero oh im sure to have that joe by the way you are nicely settled here it would seem yes and i am thankful for it mr mallison is a fine man to work for so i have been told you had better stick to him i shall as long as the work holds out maybe he will give you something else to do after the boating season is over a few more words passed and then ned took his departure it was to be a long time before the two friends would meet again so far joe had had no trouble with anybody around the hotel but that evening when he was cleaning out his boat a man approached him and caught him rudely by the shoulder so youre the feller thats took my job from me eh snarled the newcomer our hero looked up and recognized sam cullum the boatman who had been discharged for drinking even now the boatman was more than half under the influence of intoxicants i havent taken anybodys job from him answered joe i say yer did growled cullum it aint fair nuther to this our hero did not reply but went on cleaning out his boat fer two pins id lick yer went on the tipsy boatman lurching forward see here sam cullum i want you to keep your distance said joe sharply mr mallison discharged you for drinking i had nothing to do with it i dont drink leastwise i dont drink no moren i need yes you do it would be the best thing in the world for you if youd leave liquor alone entirely humph dont you preach to me you little imp then leave me alone you stole the job from me an im going to lick you for it if you touch me youll get hurt said joe his eyes flashing leave me alone and ill leave you alone bah snarled the other and struck out awkwardly he wanted to hit joe on the nose but the boy dodged with ease and sam cullum fell sprawling over the rowboat hi what did ye trip me up for spluttered the halfintoxicated man as he rose slowly dont you do that agin do yer hear then dont try to strike me again there was a moment of silence and then sam cullum gathered himself for another blow by this time a small crowd of boys and hotel helpers began to collect sam cullums going to fight joe bodley samll most kill joe with all his strength the man rushed at joe but the boy dodged again and put out his foot and the man went headlong now will you let me alone asked our hero coolly no i wont roared sam cullum somebody give me a club ill show him arising once more he caught up an oar and launched a heavy blow at joes head for a third time our hero dodged but the oar struck him on the arm and the blow hurt not a little joe was now angry and believed it was time to defend himself he edged towards the end of the dock and sam cullum followed then of a sudden the boy ducked under the mans arm turned and gave him a quick shove that sent him with a splash into the lake hurrah score one for joe that will cool sam cullums temper yes and perhaps it will sober him a little came from a man standing by who had witnessed the quarrel from the beginning he brought this on himself the boy had nothing to do with it sam cullum floundered around in the water like a whale cast up in the shallows the lake at that point was not over four feet deep but he did not know enough to stand upright save me he bellowed save me i dont want to drown swallow a little water it will do you good said a bystander with a laugh walk out and youll be all right added another at last sam cullum found his feet and walked around the side of the dock to the shore a crowd followed him and kept him from going at joe again ill fix him another time growled the intoxicated one and shuffled off with some small boys jeering him you treated him as he deserved said one of the other boatmen to joe i suppose hell try to square up another time answered our hero well i wouldnt take water for him joe i dont intend to if he attacks me ill do the best i can to defend myself he has made a nuisance of himself for a long time its a wonder to me that mr mallison put up with it so long he was short of help thats why it isnt so easy to get new help in the height of the summer season that is true joe expected to have more trouble with sam cullum the next day but it did not come then it leaked out that cullum had gotten into a row with his wife and some of her relatives that night and was under arrest when the boatman was brought up for trial the judge sentenced him to six months imprisonment and it serves him right said the man who brought the news to joe it must be hard on his wife well it is joe have they any children four a boy of seven and three little girls are they well off what with such a father no they are very poor she used to go out washing but now she has to stay at home to take care of the baby sam was a brute to strike her i dont wonder the relatives took a hand perhaps the relatives can help her they cant do much for they are all as poor as she is and one of them is just getting over an operation at the hospital where do the cullums live down on railroad alley not far from the water tower its a mite of a cottage joe said no more but what he had been told him set him to thinking and that evening after his work was over he took a walk through the town and in the direction of railroad alley not far from the water station he found the cullum homestead a mite of a cottage as the man had said with a tumbleddown chimney and several brokenout windows he looked in at one of the windows and by the light of a smoking kerosene lamp beheld a woman in a rockingchair rocking a baby to sleep three other youngsters were standing around knowing not what to do on a table were some dishes all bare of food mamma i want more bread one of the little ones was saying you can have more in the morning johnny answered the mother no i want it now whimpered the youngster im hungry im hungry too put in another little one i cant give you any more tonight for i havent it said the mother with a deep sigh now be still or youll wake the baby why dont dad come home asked the boy of seven he cant come home bobby he had to go away faltered the mother now all be still and you shall have more bread in the morning the children began to cry and unable to stand the sight any longer joe withdrew up the alley was a grocery store and he almost ran to this give me some bread he said and some cake and a pound of cheese and some smoked beef and a pound of good tea and some sugar be quick please the goods were weighed out and wrapped up and with his arms full he ran back to the cottage and kicked on the door who is there asked mrs cullum in alarm here are some groceries for you cried joe all paid for oh look screamed the boy of seven bread and cheese and sugar came from one of the little girls and tea mamma just what you like said another where did this come from asked mrs cullum a friend answered joe its all paid for i am very thankful now we can have some bread cant we queried the boy yes and a bit of smoked beef and cheese too said the mother and placing the sleeping baby on a bed she proceeded to deal out the good things to her children chapter viii the timid mr gussing it was not until the children had been satisfied and put to bed that joe had a chance to talk to mrs cullum she was greatly astonished when she learned who he was i didnt expect this kindness said she i understand that my husband treated you shamefully it was the liquor made him do it maam answered our hero i think hed be all right if hed leave drink alone yes i am sure of it she gave a long sigh he was very kind and true when we were first married but then he got to using liquor and and this is the result perhaps he will turn over a new leaf when he comes out of jail i hope he does if he doesnt i dont know what i am going to do have you anything to do i used to wash for two families in town but they have regular hired help now perhaps you can get more work if you advertise if youll allow me ill put an advertisement in the riverside news for you thank you i dont see what makes you so kind well i have been down in the world myself mrs cullum so i know how to feel for others did you say you used to live with bodley the hermit yes my folks used to know him he was rather a strange man after he got shot by accident yes but he was kind are you his son no he said i was his nephew but i never found out much about that oh yes i remember something about that he had a brother who lost his wife and several children are you that mans son i believe i am and you have never heard from your father not a word that is hard on you i am going to look for my father some day if so i hope you will find him so do i joe arose i must be going he paused mrs cullum will you let me help you he added earnestly why you have helped me a good deal already not one in a thousand would do what you have done after the way my husband treated you i thought that you might be short of money i must confess i am i am not rich but if you can use it i can let you have five dollars ill accept it as a loan i dont want you to give me the money answered the poor woman she thought of the things she absolutely needed now that her husband was gone the money was handed over and a few minutes later joe took his departure somehow his heart felt very light because of his generosity he had certainly played the part of a friend in need but he did not stop there early in the morning he sought out andrew mallison and told the hotel proprietor of mrs cullums condition i was thinking that you might be able to give her work in the hotel laundry he continued the hotel man called up the housekeeper and from her learned that another woman could be used to iron you can let her come and well give her a trial said he it did not take joe long to communicate with the poor woman and she was overjoyed to see work in sight without waiting for an advertisement in the newspaper ill go at once said she ill get a neighbors girl to mind the children and she was as good as her word as it happened she proved to be a good laundress and mr mallison gave her steady employment until her husband came from jail then much to his wifes satisfaction sam cullum turned over a new leaf and became quite sober and industrious joe was now becoming well acquainted around the hotel and took an interest in many of the boarders among the number was a young man named felix gussing he was a nice individual in his way but had certain peculiarities one was that he was exceedingly afraid of horses and at every possible opportunity he gave them as wide a berth as possible dont like them at all dont you know he said to joe during a boat ride cant understand them at all oh i think a good horse is very nice answered our hero but they are so so balkish so full of kicking insisted felix gussing well i admit some of them are answered joe there were two young ladies stopping at the hotel and the young man had become quite well acquainted with both of them one he thought was very beautiful and was half tempted to propose to her on the day after the boat ride with joe felix gussing took the ladies to have some ice cream and during the conversation all spoke of a certain landmark of interest located about three miles from riverside i have seen it and it is aw very interesting drawled felix then we must see it belle said one of the young ladies to her companion oh im not going to walk that far answered belle with a bewitching look at the young man you might drive over suggested felix without stopping to think twice oh yes i love driving cried one of the girls and so do i answered the other i will find out what can be done about a conveyance answered felix being a good deal of a dude and dressing very fastidiously he did not much relish visiting the livery stable attached to the hotel but early on the following morning he walked down to the place and ordered a horse and carriage to be ready at ten oclock now it must be known that felix did not intend to drive the carriage he thought the young ladies would drive for themselves since both had said that they loved driving unfortunate man he knew not the snare he had laid for himself punctual to the minute the carriage drove up to the door felix was on hand standing on the steps with politeness in his air though with trembling in his heart because so near the horses he assisted the ladies in then he handed the reins to miss belle do you wish me to hold the horses while you get in she asked sweetly till i get in ejaculated felix taken aback certainly you dont think we are going to drive ourselves do you of course you are going with us poor felix he was in for it now decidedly it required a good deal of moral courage a quality in which he was deficient to resist a ladys demand his knees trembled with fear as he scrambled in joe who was standing not far away looked on with a quiet smile on his face he realized what was passing in the dudes mind hed give ten dollars to get out of it our hero told himself the boy who had brought the turnout around looked at felix gussing earnestly take care of that horse mister said he warningly hes young and a little bit wild wild gasped the dude i i dont want to drive a wild horse oh hell be all right if you keep an eye on him went on the stable boy young and a little bit wild thought felix to himself oh dear what in the world shall i do i never drove a horse before if i get back with less than a broken neck ill be lucky id give a thousand to be out of this pickle hadnt we better start mr gussing asked one of the young ladies after a pause oh yes certainly he stammered but er you can drive if you wish thank you but i would prefer that you drive wont you drive he asked of the other young lady oh no not today but ill use the whip if you say so she answered not for the world cried the unhappy felix he is a bit wild already and there is no telling what hed do if he felt the whip at last the carriage drove off joe gazed after it thoughtfully unless i miss my guess there is going to be trouble before that drive is over he thought and there was trouble as we shall soon learn chapter ix an unfortunate outing fortunately for the unhappy felix the horse walked away from the hotel in an orderly fashion and soon they gained the highway leading to the resort the party wished to visit had the dude left the horse alone all might have gone well but he deemed it necessary to pull on first one line and then the other which kept the carriage in a meandering course i dont think mr gussing that you can be much used to driving said one of the young ladies presently thats a fact answered the dude why dont you keep to the right of the road well er the fact is this horse is a very difficult one to drive i dont believe i ever drove one which was more so as this was the first horse mr gussing had ever driven this assertion was true in every particular oh i cant travel so slow cried one of the young ladies and seized the whip and before felix could stop her used it on the steed the effect was magical the horse started up like a racer and tore through the street as if trying to win a race for a thousand dollars the dude clung to the reins in the wildest terror to his frenzied imagination it seemed that his final hour was approaching whoa he screamed jerking on the lines stop you crazy beast stop before we all get killed but the horse only went the faster and now to increase his alarm he saw a buggy approaching from the opposite direction it contained one of the town lawyers silas simms by name we shall run into that buggy screamed the fair belle oh mr gussing be careful a moment later the two turnouts came together with a crash and one wheel was torn from the buggy and the town lawyer pitched out headlong to the ground then on went the carriage with the dude and the two young ladies at a faster pace than ever let me jump out screamed one of the ladies no not yet youll be killed grace answered belle then stop the carriage alas the poor felix was already doing his best to stop the horse but his jerkings on the reins only added to the horses wildness not far along the road was a good sized brook spanned by a neat wooden bridge as the carriage neared the bridge felix pulled on the wrong rein once again the horse turned from the road proper and descended full speed into the stream itself oh now well be drowned shrieked grace but she was mistaken the stream was easily fordable so there was no danger on that score but the rate at which they were impelled through the water naturally created no inconsiderable splashing so that on emerging on the other side the dude as well as the young ladies were well drenched to the great joy of felix the contact with the water cooled the ardor of the steed so that he resumed the journey at a far more moderate rate of speed wasnt it just glorious cried belle who after the danger seemed past grew enthusiastic what a noble animal glorious echoed the dude i dont care much about such glory as for the noble animal i er i wish he was hung thats the best he deserves the dude spoke bitterly for the spell of terror was still on him had he consulted his own wishes he would have leaped from the carriage and left the ladies to their fate but the thought of the bewitching belle made him keep his seat and he resolved that if he must die he would do it like a martyr the horse went on and at last they neared the end of the short journey but here a new obstacle presented itself there was a big fence and a gate and the gate was tight shut as they could not enter the grounds without opening the gate the dude got down out of the carriage he did not hand the reins to either of the ladies but laid them over the dashboard the instant the gate was swung open the steed darted forward and brought up with a jerk against a post that happened to be in the way here he reared and plunged causing the young ladies to scream murder at the top of their voices oh my oh dear me bawled felix and took refuge behind a neighboring hedge the horse has gone crazy hell bite somebody next the cries reached some men who were not far off and they came running to the assistance of the party one caught the steed by the bridle and soon had him quieted down ill never drive that horse again said the dude not for a million dollars how are we to get home queried belle ill drive you said one of the men i know this horse he used to belong to bill perkins i know how to handle him then do so answered felix and ill pay you two dollars the man was as good as his word and to felixs astonishment he made the horse go back to the hotel without the slightest mishap then the horse was put in the stable the dude paid the bill and the party separated i shall never drive again never declared the dude to himself and it may be added that he kept his word i hope you had a nice drive said joe when he met felix that evening it was beastly dont you know was the answer that horse was a terribly vicious creature he looked to be gentle enough when he started off i think he is a crazy horse by the way mr gussing mr silas simms was looking for you you mean that lawyer who drives the spotted white horse yes felix gave a groan he says he wants damages it wasnt my fault that the horse ran into him well he is very angry about it anyway said our hero early the next morning felix gussing received a communication from the lawyer it was in the following terms mr gussing sir in consequence of your reckless driving yesterday i was thrown from my carriage receiving a contusion on my shoulder and other injuries my carriage was also nearly ruined if you choose to make a racecourse of the public highways you must abide the consequences the damage i have sustained i cannot estimate at less than one hundred and fifty dollars indemnify me for that and i will go no further otherwise i shall be compelled to resort to legal action silas simms atty felix read the letter several times and his knees shook visibly he did not want to pay over such an amount yet it struck him with terror when he thought he might possibly be arrested for fast driving he went to see mr silas simms i am very sorry he began have you come to pay demanded the attorney curtly well er the fact is dont you think you are asking rather a stiff price mr simms not at all not at all sir i ought to have placed the damages at three hundred ill give you fifty dollars and call it square no sir a hundred and fifty not a penny less not one penny look at my nose sir all scratched and my ear not a penny less than one hundred and fifty dollars and the lawyer pounded on his desk with his fist all right then ill pay you but you must give me a receipt in full answered the dude he had to wait until the bank opened that he might cash a check and then he paid over the amount demanded the lawyer drew up a legal paper discharging him from all further obligations felix read it with care and stowed it in his pocket and now let me give you some advice mr gussing said the lawyer after the transaction was concluded dont drive such a wild horse again depend upon it i never shall answered the dude it costs too much he added with a faint smile are you well acquainted with horses no then you had better leave them alone altogether i have already made up my mind to do so chapter x david ball from montana finding that joe could be depended upon mr mallison put him in charge of all of the boats at the hotel so that our hero had almost as much work ashore as on the lake during the week following the events just narrated many visitors left the hotel and others came in among those to go were felix gussing and the two young ladies the dude bid our hero a cordial goodbye for he now knew joe quite well goodbye mr gussing said joe i hope we meet again perhaps we shall although i generally go to a different place each summer well i dont expect to stay in riverside all my life i see if you make a move i hope you do well returned felix on the day after the dude left a man came to the hotel who somehow looked familiar to our hero he came dressed in a light overcoat and a slouch hat and carried a valise and a suit case ive seen him before but where joe asked himself not once but several times the man registered as david ball and put down his address as butte montana he said he was a mining expert but added that he was sick and the doctors had ordered him to come east for a rest ve heard of riverside being a nice place said he so i came on right after striking pittsburg we shall do all we can to make your stay a pleasant one said the hotel proprietor politely all i want is a nice sunny room where i can get fresh air and take it easy said the man he was willing to pay a good price and so obtained one of the best rooms in the house one overlooking the river and the lake he ate one meal in the dining room but after that he had his meals sent to his apartment is he sick asked joe after watching the man one day he certainly doesnt seem to be well answered andrew mallison it runs in my mind that i have seen him before but i cant place him went on our hero you must be mistaken joe i questioned him and he says this is his first trip to the east although he has frequently visited st louis and chicago on the following day the man called for a physician and doctor gardner was sent for ive got pains here said the man from the west and pointed to his chest do you think i am getting consumption the riverside physician made a careful examination and then said the man had probably strained himself reckon i did was the ready answer i was in the mine and a big rock came down on me i had to hold it up for ten minutes before anybody came to my aid i thought i was a dead one sure i will give you some medicine and a liniment said the doctor perhaps youll feel better after a good rest and then he left that afternoon joe had to go up into the hotel for something and passed the room of the new boarder he saw the man standing by the window gazing out on the water im dead certain ive seen him before mused our hero it is queer i cant think where doctor gardner wanted to be taken across the lake and joe himself did the job as he was rowing he asked about the man who had signed the hotel register as david ball from montana is he very sick doctor no i cant say that he is was the physicians answer he looks to be as healthy as you or i its queer he keeps to his room perhaps something happened out at his mine to unsettle his nerves he told me of some sort of an accident is he a miner he is a mine owner so mr mallison told me but he never heard of the man before the stranger received several letters the next day and then a telegram shortly after that he took to his bed i am feeling worse said he to the bell boy who answered his ring i want you to send for that doctor again ask him to call about noon yes sir answered the boy and doctor gardner was sent for without delay he came and made another examination and left some medicine ill take the medicine regularly said the stranger who was in bed but when the doctor had left he quietly poured half of the contents of the bottle into the wash bowl where it speedily drained from sight dont catch me drinking such rot he muttered to himself id rather have some good liquor any day and he took a long pull from a black bottle he had in his valise about noon a carriage drove up to the hotel and two men alighted one led the way into the hotel and asked to see the register id like to see mr david ball said he to the clerk mr ball is sick so i have heard and that is why i wish to see him ill send up your card i dont happen to have a card tell him mr anderson is here from philadelphia with a friend of his the message was sent to the sick mans room and word came down that he would see the visitors in a few minutes he says he is pretty sick and he cant talk business very long said the bell boy we wont bother him very much answered the man who had given his name as anderson joe happened to be close by during this conversation and he looked the man called anderson over with care ive seen that man too he declared to himself but where i declare he is as much of a mystery as the sick one our heros curiosity was now aroused to the highest pitch and when the two men walked up to david balls room he followed to the very doorway come in came from the room and a deep groan followed on the bed lay the man from montana wrapped in several blankets and with a look of anguish on his features feeling pretty bad eh said anderson as he stalked in i am downright sorry for you im afraid i am going to die groaned the man in bed the doctor says i am in bad shape he wants me to take a trip to europe or somewhere else this is mr maurice vane went on anderson we wont trouble you any more than is necessary mr ball i am sorry to disturb you said maurice vane he was a kindly looking gentleman perhaps we had better defer this business until some other time oh no one time is as bad as another came with another groan from the bed besides i admit i need money badly if it wasnt for that the man in bed began to cough say shut the door he went on to the first man who had come in the door was closed and for the time being joe heard no more of the conversation it must be admitted that our hero was perplexed and with good reason he felt certain that the man in bed was shamming that he was hardly sick at all if so what was his game something is surely wrong somewhere he reasoned i wish i could get to the bottom of it the room next to the one occupied by david ball was empty and he slipped into this the room contained a closet and on the other side was another closet opening into the room the men were in the partition between was of boards and as the other door stood wide open joe by placing his head to the boards could hear fairly well you have the stock he heard maurice vane ask yes in my valise hand me the bag and ill show you answered the man in bed oh how weak i feel he sighed there was a silence and then the rustling of papers and what is your bottom price for these went on maurice vane thirty thousand dollars i told mr vane you might possibly take twentyfive thousand came from the man called anderson they ought to be worth face value fifty thousand dollars said the man in bed a talk in a lower tone followed and then more rustling of papers i will call tomorrow with the cash said maurice vane as he prepared to leave in the meantime you promise to keep these shares for me ill keep them until noon ive got another offer said the man in bed well be back put in the man called anderson so dont you sell to anybody else then the two visitors left and went downstairs five minutes later they were driving away in the direction of the railroad station this certainly beats anything i ever met before said joe to himself as he watched them go ill wager all i am worth that ive met that anderson before and that he is a bad man i do wish i could get at the bottom of what is going on in the evening he had occasion to go upstairs in the hotel once more to his surprise he saw mr david ball sitting in a rockingchair calmly smoking a cigar and reading a paper he isnt as sick as he was this morning he mused in fact i dont think he is sick at all he wished to be on hand the following morning when the strangers came back but an errand took him up the lake he had to stop at several places and did not start on the return until four in the afternoon on his way back joe went ashore close to where the old lodge was located and something he could not tell what made him run over and take a look at the spot that had proved a shelter for ned and himself during the heavy storm how many things had occurred since that fatal day as our hero looked into one of the rooms he remembered the strange men he had seen there the fellows who had talked about mining stocks then of a sudden a revelation came to him like a thunderbolt out of a clear sky ive got it ive got it he cried mr david ball is that fellow who called himself malone and anderson is the man named caven they are both imposters chapter xi a fruitless chase the more joe thought over the matter the more he became convinced that he was right he remembered a good deal of the talk he had overheard during the storm although such talk had for the time being been driven from his mind by the tragic death of old hiram bodley if they are working some game what can this maurice vane have to do with it he asked himself he thought it best to get back to the hotel at once and tell mr mallison of his suspicions but as luck would have it scarcely had he started to row his boat again when an oarlock broke and so it took him the best part of an hour to make the trip where is mr mallison he asked of the clerk of the hotel out in the stable i believe was the answer without waiting our hero ran down to the stable and found the hotel proprietor inspecting some hay that had just been unloaded id like to speak to you a moment mr mallison he said its important and he motioned for the man to follow him what is it joe its about those men who called to see that sick man and about the sick man too he has gone all of them have gone what ejaculated our hero the sick man too exactly but he didnt go with the others while they were here he was in bed but right after they left he arose dressed himself and drove away where did he go to i dont know do you know what became of the other two men i do not but whats up is there anything wrong questioned the hotel proprietor with a look of concern on his face i am afraid there is answered joe and told his tale from beginning to end thats an odd sort of a yarn joe its queer you didnt recognize the men before it is queer sir but i cant help that it flashed over me just as i looked into the window of the old lodge you havent made any mistake no sir humph andrew mallison mused for a moment i dont really see what i can do in the matter we cant prove that those men are wrongdoers can we not unless they tried some game on this mr maurice vane they may have sold him some worthless mining shares that sort of a trick is rather old i think we ought to make a search for this david ball or malone or whatever his name is im willing to do that after questioning half a dozen people they learned that the pretended sick man had driven off in the direction of a village called hopedale what made him go there do you think questioned joe i dont know excepting that he thought of getting a train on the other line a horse and buggy were procured and in this mr mallison and our hero drove over to hopedale they were still on the outskirts of the village when they heard a locomotive whistle theres the afternoon train now cried joe perhaps its the one he wants to catch the horse was touched up and the buggy drove up to the railroad platform at breakneck speed but the train was gone and all they could see of it was the last car as it swung around one of the mountain bends too late mr mallison sang out the station master if i had known ye was comin i might have held her up a bit i didnt want the train jackson who got on board two ladies a man and a boy dick fadder did you know the man no what did he have with him a dress suit case was he dressed in a dark blue suit and wear a slouch hat asked joe yes and had a light overcoat with him that was our man anything wrong with him asked the station master perhaps answered the hotel proprietor anyway we wanted to see him did he buy a ticket yes to snagtown what can he want in snagtown asked joe oh that might have been a blind joe he could easily go through to philadelphia or some other place if he wanted to at first they thought of telegraphing ahead to stop the man but soon gave that plan up they had no evidence and did not wish to make trouble unless they knew exactly what they were doing i hope it turns out all right observed andrew mallison when they were driving back to riverside if there was a swindle it would give my hotel a black eye thats one reason why i wanted that man held answered joe the next day and that following passed quietly and our hero began to think that he had made a mistake and misjudged the men he was kept very busy and so almost forgot the incident among the new boarders was a fussy old man named chaster who was speedily nicknamed by the bell boys chestnuts he was a particular individual and made everybody as uncomfortable as he possibly could one day wilberforce chaster to use his full name asked joe to take him out on the lake for a days fishing our hero readily complied and was in hot water from the time they went out until they returned nothing suited the old man and as he caught hardly any fish he was exceedingly put out when he came back to the hotel your boatman is of no account he said to andrew mallison i have spent a miserable day and he stamped off to his room in high anger it was not my fault mr mallison said joe with burning cheeks i did my level best by him that man has been making trouble for us ever since he come answered the hotel proprietor i am going to ask him to go elsewhere when his week is up the insults that joe had received that day from wilberforce chaster rankled in his mind and he determined to square accounts with the boarder if he possibly could towards evening he met a bell boy named harry ross who had also had trouble with chaster and the two talked the matter over we ought to get square said harry ross i wish i could souse him with a pitcher of ice water ive got a plan said joe stopping at the hotel was a traveling doctor who came to riverside twice a year for a stay of two weeks each time he sold some patent medicines and had in his room several skulls and also a skeleton strung on wires that doctor is away said our hero i wonder if we cant smuggle the skulls and the skeleton into mr chasters room just the cheese cried the bell boy enthusiastically and let us rub the bones with some of those matches that glow in the dark the plan was talked over and watching their chance the two transferred the skeleton and the skulls to the apartment occupied by wilberforce chaster then they rubbed phosphorus on the bones and hung them upon long strings running over a doorway into the next room that evening wilberforce chaster remained in the hotel parlor until ten o clock then he marched off to his room in his usual ill humor the gas was lit and he went to bed without delay as soon as the light went out and they heard the man retire joe and the bell boy began to groan in an ominous manner as they did so they worked the strings to which the skulls and the skeleton were attached causing them to dance up and down in the center of the old mans room hearing the groans wilberforce chaster sat up in bed and listened then he peered around in the darkness ha what is that he gasped as he caught sight of the skulls am i dreaming or is that oh he started and began to shake from head to foot for directly in front of him was the skeleton moving up and down in a jerky fashion and glowing with a dull fire his hair seemed to stand on end he dove under the coverings of the bed the room is haunted he moaned was ever such a thing seen before this is wretched whatever shall i do the groans continued and presently he gave another look from under the bed clothes the skeleton appeared to be coming nearer he gave a loud yell of anguish go away go away oh i am haunted by a ghost this is awful i cannot stand it he fairly tumbled out of bed and caught up his clothing in a heap then wrapped in some comfortables he burst out of the room and ran down the hallway like a person possessed of the evil spirits come be quick or well get caught whispered joe and ran into the room followed by the bell boy in a trice they pulled loose the strings that held the skulls and the skeleton and restored the things to the doctors room from which they had been taken then they went below by a back stairs the whole hotel was in an alarm and soon mr mallison came upon the scene what is the meaning of this he demanded severely of wilberforce chaster the meaning is sir that your hotel is haunted was the answer which startled all who heard it chapter xii the particulars of a swindle this hotel haunted gasped the proprietor sir you are mistaken such a thing is impossible it is true insisted mr wilberforce chaster i shall not stay here another night what makes you think it is haunted there is a ghost in my room oh shrieked a maid who had come on the scene a ghost i shall not stay either what kind of a ghost demanded andrew mallison a er a skeleton and some skulls i saw them with my own eyes went on the victim come and see them for yourself this is nonsense said the hotel proprietor i will go and convince you that you are mistaken he led the way and half a dozen followed including wilberforce chaster who kept well to the rear just as the party reached the door of the apartment joe and the bell boy came up without hesitation andrew mallison threw open the door of the room and looked inside of course he saw nothing out of the ordinary where is your ghost he demanded i see nothing of it dont dont you see er a skeleton demanded the man who had been victimized i do not trembling in every limb wilberforce chaster came forward and peered into the room well demanded the hotel proprietor after a pause i i certainly saw them then where are they now i i dont know by this time others were crowding into the apartment all gazed around and into the clothes closet but found nothing unusual you must be the victim of some hallucination sir said the hotel proprietor severely he hated to have anything occur which might give his establishment a bad reputation no sir i saw the things with my own eyes the matter was talked over for several minutes longer and then the hired help was ordered away i shall not stay in this room insisted wilberforce chaster you need not remain in the hotel answered andrew mallison quickly you can leave at once you have alarmed the whole establishment needlessly some warm words followed and the upshot of the matter was that the fussy old boarder had to pack his things and seek another hotel that very night i am glad to get rid of him said the hotel proprietor after wilberforce chaster had departed he was making trouble all the time we fixed him didnt we said the bell boy to joe i hope it teaches him a lesson to be more considerate in the future answered our hero several days passed and joe had quite a few parties to take out on the lake the season was now drawing to a close and our hero began to wonder what he had best do when boating was over i wonder if i couldnt strike something pretty good in philadelphia he asked himself the idea of going to one of the big cities appealed to him strongly one afternoon on coming in from a trip across the lake joe found andrew mallison in conversation with mr maurice vane who had arrived at the hotel scarcely an hour before the city man was evidently both excited and disappointed here is the boy now said the hotel proprietor and called joe up well young man i guess you have hit the truth were maurice vanes first words about those other fellows asked our hero quickly thats it did they swindle you they did by selling you some worthless mining stocks yes if you will id like you to tell me all you can about those two men i will answered joe and told of the strange meeting at the old lodge and of what had followed maurice vane drew a long breath and shook his head sadly i was certainly a green one to be taken in so slyly said he how did they happen to hear of you questioned joe curiously i answered an advertisement in the daily paper said maurice vane then this man caven or whatever his right name may be came to me and said he had a certain plan for making a good deal of money all i had to do was to invest a certain amount and inside of a few days i could clear fifteen or twenty thousand dollars that was surely a nice proposition said joe with a smile i agreed to go into the scheme if it was all plain sailing and then this caven gave me some of the details he said there was a demand for a certain kind of mining shares he knew an old miner who was sick and who was willing to sell the shares he possessed for a reasonable sum of money the plan was to buy the shares and then sell them to another party a broker at a big advance in price that was simple enough put in andrew mallison caven took me to see a man who called himself a broker he had an elegant office and looked prosperous he told us he would be glad to buy certain mining shares at a certain figure if he could get them in the near future he said a client was redhot after the shares i questioned him closely and he appeared to be a truthful man he said some folks wanted to buy out the mine and consolidate it with another mine close by and then you came here and bought the stock of malone queried joe yes caven made me promise to give him half the profits and i agreed i came here and as you know malone or ball or whatever his name is pretended to be very sick and in need of money he set his price and i came back with the cash and took the mining stock i was to meet caven alias anderson the next day and go to the broker with him but caven did not appear then i grew suspicious and went to see the broker alone the man was gone and the office locked up after that i asked some other brokers about the stock and they told me it was not worth five cents on the dollar isnt there any such mine at all asked joe oh yes there is such a mine but it was abandoned two years ago after ten thousand dollars had been sunk in it they said it paid so little that it was not worth considering that is certainly too bad for you said joe and you cant find any trace of caven or malone no both of the rascals have disappeared completely i tried to trace caven and his broker friend in philadelphia but it was of no use more than likely they have gone to some place thousands of miles away yes and probably this ball or malone has joined them put in andrew mallison mr vane i am exceedingly sorry for you i am sorry for myself but i deserve my loss for being such a fool went on the victim have you notified the police asked joe oh yes and i have hired a private detective to do what he can too but i am afraid my money is gone for good you might go and reopen the mine mr vane thank you but i have lost enough already without throwing good money after bad as the saying is it may be that that detective will find the swindlers sooner or later such a thing is of course possible but i am not over sanguine i am afraid your money is gone for good broke in andrew mallison i wish i could help you but i dont see how i can the matter was talked over for a good hour and all three visited the room malone had occupied which had been vacant ever since but a hunt around revealed nothing of value and they returned to the office i can do nothing more for you mr vane said andrew mallison i wish i could do something said joe something about maurice vane was very attractive to him if you ever hear of these rascals let me know continued the hotel proprietor i will do so was the reply with that the conversation on the subject closed maurice vane remained at the hotel overnight and left by the early train on the following morning chapter xiii off for the city joe our season ends next saturday i know it mr mallison we are going to close the house on tuesday it wont pay to keep open after our summer boarders leave i know that too have you any idea what you intend to do went on the hotel proprietor he was standing down by the dock watching joe clean out one of the boats im thinking of going to philadelphia on a visit no sir to try my luck oh i see its a big city my lad i know it but somehow i feel i might do better there than in such a town as this and i am getting tired of hanging around the lake there is more money in philadelphia than there is here that is certain joe but you cant always get hold of it the big cities are crowded with people trying to obtain situations im sure i can find something to do mr mallison and by the way when i leave will you give me a written recommendation certainly you have done well since you came here but you had better think twice before going to philadelphia ive thought it over more than twice i dont expect the earth but i feel that i can get something to do before my money runs out how much money have you saved up ive got fiftysix dollars and im going to sell my boat for four dollars well sixty dollars isnt such a bad capital i have known men to start out with a good deal less when i left home i had but twenty dollars and an extra suit of clothes did you come from a country place no i came from new york times were hard and i couldnt get a single thing to do i went to paterson new jersey and got work in a silk mill from there i went to camden and then to philadelphia from philadelphia i came here and have been here ever since you have been prosperous fairly so although i dont make as much money as some of the hotel men in the big cities but then they take larger risks a few years ago a hotel friend of mine opened a big hotel in atlantic city he hoped to make a small fortune but he was not located in the right part of the town and at the end of the season he found himself just fifteen thousand dollars out of pocket now he has sold out and is running a country hotel fifty miles west of here he doesnt hope to make so much but his business is much safer im afraid it will be a long time before i get money enough to run a hotel laughed our hero would you like to run one i dont know id like to educate myself first dont you study some now i have seen you with some arithmetics and histories yes sir i study a little every day you see i never had much schooling and i dont want to grow up ignorant if i can help it that is the proper spirit lad answered andrew mallison warmly learn all you possibly can it will always be the means of doing you good the conversation took place on thursday and two days later the season at the summer hotel came to an end and the last of the boarders took their departure monday was spent in putting things in order and by tuesday afternoon work around the place came to an end and all the help was paid off in the meantime joe had sold his boat with all of his money in his pocket he called at the talmadge house to see if ned had returned from the trip to the west just got back yesterday said ned who came to greet him had a glorious trip i wish you had been along i like traveling better than staying at home all the time i am going to do a bit of traveling myself ned where are you going to philadelphia to try my luck in that city going to leave mr mallison yes the season is at an end oh i see so you are going to the quaker city as pa calls it i wish you luck youll have to write to me joe and let me know how you are getting along i will and you must write to me of course on the following day joe rowed along the lake to where his old home dock had been located and made a trip to what was left of the cabin he spent another hour in hunting for the blue box but without success i suppose ill never find that box he sighed i may as well give up thinking about it from andrew mallison our hero had obtained his letter of recommendation and also a good pocket map of philadelphia the hotel man had also made him a present of a neat suit case in which he packed his few belongings ned talmadge came to see him off at the depot the day was cool and clear and joe felt in excellent spirits soon the train came along and our hero got aboard along with a dozen or fifteen others he waved a hand to ned and his friend shouted out a goodbye then the train moved on and the town was soon left in the distance the car that joe had entered was not more than quarter filled and he easily found a seat for himself by a window he placed his suit case at his feet and then gave himself up to looking at the scenery as it rushed past joe had never spent much of his time on the railroad so the long ride had much of novelty in it the scenery was grand as they wound in and out among the hills and mountains or crossed brooks and rivers and wellkept farms numerous stops were made and long before philadelphia was gained the train became crowded nice day for riding said a man who sat down beside our hero he looked to be what he was a prosperous farmer it is answered joe goin to philadelphy i reckon went on the farmer yes sir thats where im going too got a little business to attend to i am going there to try my luck said joe he felt he could talk to the old man with confidence goin to look fer a job eh yes sir wot kin ye do if i might ask oh im willing to do most anything ive been taking care of rowboats and working around a summer hotel at lake tandy well ye wont git many boats to look at down to philadelphy and the old farmer chuckled i suppose not maybe ill strike a job at one of the hotels perhaps they tell me some hotels down there is monsterous ten an twelve stories high ye dont catch me goin to no sech place in case o fire its all up with ye if youre on the twelfth story are you going to philadelphia to stay mr bean is my name josiah bean im from haydown center i am got a farm there o a hundred acres oh is that so wots your

some property an im agoin to collect on it thats a pleasant trip to be on was our heros comment ill feel better when i have the six hundred dollars in my fist im afraid it aint goin to be no easy matter to git it whats the trouble i aint known in philadelphy an they tell me a feller has got to be identified or somethin like thet somebody has got to speak for ye wot knows ye i see perhaps youll meet some friend thets wot im hopin fer the train rolled on and presently joe got out his map and began to study it so that he might know something of the great city when he arrived there guess ill git a drink o water said josiah bean and walked to the end of the car to do so immediately a slick looking man who had been seated behind the farmer arose and followed him chapter xiv a scene on the train the slicklooking individual had listened attentively to all that passed between our hero and the farmer he waited until the latter had procured his drink of water and then rushed up with a smile on his face i declare he exclaimed how do you do and he extended his hand how do you do repeated the farmer shaking hands slowly he felt much perplexed for he could not remember having met the other man before how are matters up on the farm went on the stranger thank you very good i er i dont think you remember me mr bean went on the slicklooking individual well somehow i think i know your face answered the old farmer lamely he did not wish to appear wanting in politeness you ought to remember me i spent some time in haydown center year before last selling machines oh you had them patent reapers is that it youve struck it i remember you now youre a nephew of judge davis exactly o course o course but i cant remember your name nohow its davis too henry davis oh yes im glad to meet you mr davis i saw you in the seat with that boy went on the man we shall call henry davis i thought i knew you from the start but i wasnt dead sure going to philadelphia with us yes sir good enough mr bean wont you smoke with me i was just going into the smoker thanks but i er i dont smoke much just one mild cigar that wont hurt you im sure i love to meet old friends continued henry davis in the end the old farmer was pursuaded to walk into the smoking car and here the slicklooking individual found a corner seat where they would be undisturbed i expect to spend a week or more in philadelphia mr bean said the stranger if i can be of service to you during that time command me well perhaps ye can be of service to me do ye know many folks in the city oh yes a great many some are business friends and some are folks in high society i dont care for no high society but ive got to collect six hundred dollars an i want somebody to identify me oh i can do that easily mr bean kin ye the farmer grew interested at once if ye kin ill be much obliged to ye where must you be identified down to the office of barwell cameron on broad street do ye know em i know of them and i can find somebody who does know them so there will not be the least trouble its a load off my mind said josiah bean with a sigh ye see the money is comin to my wife she writ to em that i was comin to collect an they writ back it would be all right only i would have to be identified jest as if everybody in haydown center dont know im josiah bean an a piller in the union church down there an a cousin to jedge bean o lassindale well they have to be mighty particular when they pay out any money in the city there are so many sharpers around i aint no sharper to be sure you are not and neither am i but i once had trouble getting money is thet so yes but after i proved who i was the folks were pretty well ashamed of themselves went on henry davis smoothly so the talk ran on and at the end of half an hour the old farmer and the slicklooking individual were on exceedingly friendly terms henry davis asked much about the old man and gathered in a good stock of information when philadelphia was gained it was dark and coming out of the big railroad station joe at first knew not which way to turn the noise and the crowd of people confused him have a cab carriage bawled the hackmen paper yelled a newsboy all the evenin papers smash yer baggage called out a luggage boy not near as tall as our hero looking ahead joe saw josiah bean and the slicklooking individual moving down the street and without realizing it our hero began to follow the pair he must be some friend said our hero to himself he wondered where they were going and his curiosity getting the better of him he continued to follow them for half a dozen blocks at last they came to a halt in front of a building displaying the sign johnsons quaker hotel moderate terms for all this hotel is all right and the prices are right too joe heard the slicklooking man tell the old farmer then thet suits me answered josiah bean ill go in an git a room fer the night i think i might as well do the same said henry davis i dont care to go away over to my boarding house at fairmount park the pair walked into the hotel and joe saw them register and pass down the corridor in the company of a bell boy then our hero entered the place can i get a room here for the night he asked of the clerk behind the desk certainly what is the charge seventyfive cents that suits me the register was shoved forward and joe wrote down his name then he was shown to a small room on the third floor the building was but four stories high joe was tired and soon went to bed in the next room he heard a murmur of voices and made out that the old farmer and his friend were talking earnestly they must be very friendly was his comment and thinking the matter over he fell asleep bright and early in the morning our hero arose dressed himself and went below he had breakfast in the restaurant attached to the hotel and was just finishing up when the old farmer and the slicklooking individual came in hullo cried josiah bean what are you doin here i got a room overnight answered our hero were stopping here too this is my friend mr henry davis good morning said the slicklooking man he did not seem to fancy meeting joe they sat down close at hand and while eating the farmer asked joe half a dozen questions he spoke about his own business until henry davis nudged him in the side i wouldnt tell that boy too much he said in a low tone oh hes all right answered the old farmer joe heard the slicklooking individuals words and they made his face burn he looked at the man narrowly and made up his mind he was not a fellow to be desired for an acquaintance having finished our hero paid his bill and left the restaurant he scarcely knew which way to turn but resolved to look over the newspapers first and see if any positions were offered while in the reading room he saw josiah bean and his acquaintance leave the hotel and walk in the direction of broad street a little later joe took from the paper he was reading the addresses of several people who wanted help and then he too left the hotel the first place he called at was a florists establishment but the pay was so small he declined the position i could not live on three dollars per week he said that is all we care to pay answered the proprietor coldly it is more than other establishments pay then i pity those who work at the other places returned joe and walked out chapter xv what happened to josiah bean in the meantime josiah bean and the slicklooking individual turned into broad street and made their way to a certain establishment known as the eagles club here henry davis called another man aside say foxy do you know anybody down to barwell camerons he asked in a low tone so that the old farmer could not hear yes a clerk named chase then come down and introduce me whats the game never mind theres a tenner in it for you if it works then im on bill hush my name is henry davis all right hank returned foxy carelessly he came forward and was introduced to the old farmer in the following fashion mr richard barlow of barlow small manufacturers all three made their way to the establishment of barwell cameron and then henry davis was introduced under that name to a clerk as soon as foxy had departed the slicklooking individual turned to the clerk and called the old farmer forward this is my esteemed friend mr josiah bean of haydown center he has business with mr cameron i believe im here to collect six hundred dollars said josiah bean mr cameron writ me some letters about it very well sir sit down gentlemen and ill tell mr cameron the two were kept waiting for a few minutes and were then ushered into a private office through chase the clerk henry davis was introduced and then josiah bean all the papers proved to be correct and after the old farmer had signed his name he was given a check see here i want the cash he demanded very well said mr cameron indorse the check and ill have the money drawn for you across the street the farmer wrote down his name once more and a few minutes later received his six hundred dollars in twelve brandnew fiftydollar bills gosh them will be nice fer mirandy to look at was his comment as he surveyed the bills be careful that you dont lose them mr bean cautioned henry davis as the two left the establishment reckon the best thing i can do is to git back to hum this afternoon remarked josiah bean when he was on the street oh now you are in town youll have to look around a bit said the slicklooking individual you can take a train back tomorrow just as well let me show you a few of the sights this tickled the old farmer and he agreed to remain over until the next noon then henry davis dragged the old man around to various points of interest and grew more familiar than ever while they were at the top of one of the big office buildings henry davis pretended to drop his pocketbook how careless of me he cried got much in it queried josiah bean three thousand dollars do tell its a powerful sight o money to carry so careless like it is maybe you had better carry it for me mr bean not me i aint goin to be responsible fer nobodys money but my own an mirandys better see if your own money is safe josiah bean got out his wallet and counted the bills safe enough are you sure i thought there was only five hundred and fifty no six hundred ill bet you ten dollars on it what cant i count straight gasped the old farmer much disturbed six hundred i tell you he added after he had gone over the amount once more if there is ill give you the ten dollars answered the slick one let me count the bills all right there ye be mr davis henry davis took the wallet and pretended to count the bills hullo whats that he cried whirling around whats wot demanded josiah bean also looking around i thought i heard somebody cry fire dont say thet say lets git out o here i dont want to look at the sights all right heres your money i guess its six hundred after all answered the slicklooking individual passing over the wallet they hurried to the elevator and got into quite a crowd of people wait for me here said henry davis as they walked past the side corridor i want to step in yonder office and send a message to a friend he ran off leaving the old farmer by himself josiah bean looked around him nervously i guess that wasnt no cry o fire after all he mused well if theres a fire i kin git out from here quick enough the office building was a large one running from one street to the next on the street in the rear was a bookstore the proprietor of which had advertised for a clerk joe had applied for the position and was waiting for the proprietor to address him when on chancing to look up he saw henry davis rush past as if in a tremendous hurry hullo thats the fellow who was with the old farmer he told himself what can i do for you young man asked the proprietor of the bookshop approaching at that instant i believe you wish a clerk answered our hero have you had experience in this line no sir then you wont do i must have someone who is experienced i am willing to learn it wont do i want an experienced clerk or none at all was the sharp answer leaving the bookstore joe stood out on the sidewalk for a moment and then walked around the corner a moment later he caught sight of josiah bean gazing up and down the thoroughfare and acting like one demented whats the matter he asked matter bawled the old farmer ive been took in robbed swindled oh wot will mirandy say who robbed you thet mr davis i reckon he counted the money last an now its gone i saw mr davis a minute ago where around the corner walking as fast as he could hes got my money oh i must catch him ill help you answered joe with vigor i thought he looked like a slick one he added he led the way and josiah bean came behind the old farmer looked as if he was ready to drop with fright the thought of losing his wifes money was truly horrifying mirandy wont never forgive me he groaned oh say boy weve got to catch that rascal if we can added our hero he had noted the direction taken by the swindler and now ran across the street and into a side thoroughfare leading to where a new building was being put up here from a workman he learned that the sharper had boarded a street car going south he hailed the next car and both he and the old farmer got aboard this aint much use said josiah bean with quivering lips we dunno how far he took himself to let us trust to luck to meet him said joe they rode for a distance of a dozen blocks and then the car came to a halt for there was a blockade ahead we may as well get off said our hero he may be in one of the forward cars they alighted and walked on past half a dozen cars then our hero gave a cry of triumph there he is he said and pointed to the swindler who stood on a car platform gazing anxiously ahead chapter xvi a matter of six hundred dollars say you give me my money such were josiah beans words as he rushed up to henry davis and grabbed the swindler by the shoulder the slicklooking individual was thoroughly startled for he had not dreamed that the countryman would get on his track so soon he turned and looked at the man and also at joe and his face fell wha what are you talking about he stammered you know well enough what i am talking about answered josiah bean wrathfully i want my money every cent o it an you are agoin to jail sir you are making a sad mistake said the swindler slowly i know nothing of you or your money yes you do make him get off the car put in joe boy what have you to do with this asked the swindler turning bitterly to our hero not much perhaps answered joe but id like to see justice done i want that money went on the countryman doggedly come off the car he caught the swindler tighter than ever and made him walk to the sidewalk by this time a crowd of people began to collect whats the trouble here asked one gentleman hes robbed me thats whats the matter answered the countryman he has got six hundred dollars o mine six hundred dollars cried several and began to take a deeper interest gentleman this man must be crazy i never saw him before came loudly from the swindler that is not true cried joe he was with the man who lost the money i saw them together yesterday i am a respectable merchant from pittsburg went on the swindler it is outrageous to be accused in this fashion somebody had better call a policeman said joe ill do dat answered a newsboy and ran off to execute the errand as the crowd began to collect the swindler saw that he was going to have difficulty in clearing himself or getting away he looked around and seeing an opening made a dash for it he might have gotten away had it not been for joe but our hero was watching him with the eyes of a hawk and quick as a flash he caught the rascal by the coat sleeve no you dont he exclaimed come back here let go cried the man and hit joe in the ear but the blow did not stop joe from detaining him and in a second more josiah bean caught hold also aint goin to git away nohow exclaimed the countryman and took hold of the swindlers throat le let go came back in a gasp dont dont strangle me when a policeman arrived the swindler was thoroughly cowed and he turned reproachfully to josiah bean this isnt fair he said it was all a joke i havent got your money yes you have he is right mr bean put in joe the money i think is in your side pocket the countryman searched the pocket quickly and brought out a flat pocketbook hullo this aint mine he ejaculated he opened the pocketbook and inside were the twelve fiftydollar bills my money sure enough how in the world did it git there this man just slipped the pocketbook into your pocket answered joe i did not put in the swindler hotly you did dats right piped up the newsboy who had brought the policeman i see him do de trick jest a minit ago this is a plot against me fumed the swindler dat feller is a bad egg went on the newsboy his name is bill butts hes a slick one he is hits de country jays strong he does at the mention of the name bill butts the policeman became more interested than ever youll come to the station house with me he said sternly we can straighten out the matter there all right answered bill butts for such was his real name in a few minutes more the party including joe was off in the direction of the police station better keep a good eye on your money mr bean said our hero as they walked along ive got it tucked away safe in an inside pocket answered the old countryman the station house was several squares away and while walking beside the policeman the eyes of bill butts were wide open looking for some means of escape he had done time twice and he did not wish to be sent up again if it could possibly be avoided his opportunity came in an unexpected manner in a show window on a corner a man was exhibiting some new athletic appliances and a crowd had collected to witness the exhibition the policeman had to force his way through hi quit shovin me growled a burly fellow in the crowd not knowing he was addressing a guardian of the law make way here ordered the policeman sternly and then the fellow fell back it gave bill butts the chance he wanted and as quick as a flash he dove into the crowd and out of sight he is running away cried joe catch him put in josiah bean both went after the swindler and so did the policeman but the crowd was too dense for them and inside of five minutes bill butts had made good his escape what did ye want to let him slip ye fer growled the old countryman angrily dont talk to me growled the policeman he ought to be reported for this put in our hero say another word and ill run you both in said the bluecoat come away whispered josiah bean anyway it aint so bad ive got my money im willing to go answered joe but just the same that policeman is a pudding head he added loudly ill pudding head you cried the bluecoat but made no attempt to molest joe whose general style he did not fancy side by side josiah bean and our hero walked away until the crowd was left behind and they were practically alone im goin to count thet money again said the old countryman and did so to make certain that it was all there we were lucky to spot the rascal mr bean i didnt spot him it was you im much obliged to ye oh thats all right seems to me you are entitled to a reward joe went on the old farmer i dont want any reward but youre agoin to take it how would five dollars strike you not at all sir i dont want a cent then maybe ye wont even come an take dinner with me continued the old man in disappointed tones yes ill do that for this chase has made me tremendously hungry if ye ever come down my way joe ye must stop an call on me i will mr bean nuthin on my farm will be too good for ye joe im goin to tell my wife mirandy o this happenin an shell thank you jest as ive done a good restaurant was found not far away and there the two procured a

git no work in philadelphy come out on my farm ill board ye all winter fer nuthin went on josiah bean generously thank you mr bean you are very kind i mean it we dont live very highfalutin but we have plenty o plain good victuals ill remember what you say answered our hero an hour later he saw the countryman on a train bound for home and then he started once more to look for a situation chapter xvii joes new position all of that afternoon joe looked for a position among the various hotels of the quaker city but at each place he visited he received the same answer that there was no help needed just then this is discouraging he told himself as he retired that night perhaps ill have to go to the country or back to riverside after all yet he was up bright and early the next day and just as eager as ever to obtain a situation he had heard of a new hotel called the grandon house and visited it directly after breakfast as he entered the corridor he heard his name called and turning around saw andrew mallison how do you do mr mallison said our hero shaking hands i didnt expect to meet you here ive got a little special business in philadelphia said the hotel man i came in last night and i am going back this afternoon how are you making out its all out so far and joe smiled faintly at his own joke no situation eh thats it why dont you strike the people here its a new place and the proprietor may need help that is what i came for ill put in a good word for you joe come on andrew mallison led the way to the office and called up a stout pleasant looking man mr drew this is a young friend of mine joe bodley he worked for me this summer around the boats and also in the hotel now that the season is at an end he is trying to find something to do in the city if you have an opening i can recommend him mr arthur drew surveyed joe critically the new hotel was to be run in firstclass style and he wanted his help to be of the best he rather liked joes appearance and he took note of the fact that our heros hands were scrupulously clean and that his shoes were blacked ive got almost all the help i need but i might take him on he said slowly one of my present boys does not suit me at all he is too impudent well joe is never impudent and he is very reliable answered andrew mallison ill give you a trial thank you sir the wages will depend upon whether you board here or outside how much will you give me if i stay at the hotel four dollars a week and what if i board outside nine dollars a week can you give the boy a pretty fair room asked andrew mallison i know yoll like him after he has been here a while he can have a room with another boy that lad yonder and the proprietor of the grandon house pointed with his hand joe looked and saw that the other lad was gentlemanly looking and rather pleasant it will suit me to stay here i think he said anyway i am willing to try it when can you come to work right away or at least as soon as i can get my suit case from where i have been stopping then come in after dinner and ill tell you what to do and turn you over to my head man randolph come here at the call a bell boy came up this is another boy who is to work here said arthur drew he will room with you thank you mr drew ill be glad to get rid of jack sagger said frank randolph whats your name he went on to our hero joe bodley mine is frank randolph i guess well get along all right i hope so frank said joe and shook hands there was a little more talk and then joe left to get his dress suit case and a few other things which belonged to him by one oclock he was back to the grandon house and just in time to see andrew mallison going away i am much obliged mr mallison for what you have done said our hero warmly youre welcome joe answered the hotel man i take an interest in you and i trust you do well here i shall do my best after andrew mallison had gone joe was shown around the hotel and instructed in his various duties occasionally he was to do bellboy duty but usually he was to be an allaround helper for the office i think youll like it here said frank randolph its the best hotel ive ever worked in mr drew is a perfect gentleman i am glad to hear it frank answered our hero the room assigned to the two boys was a small one on the top floor of the hotel but it was clean contained two nice cots and joe felt it would suit him very well frank had hung up a few pictures and had a shelf full of books and this made the apartment look quite homelike im going to buy some books myself this winter said joe and when i get time i am going to do some studying im studying myself joe i never had much schooling returned frank are you alone in the world no my father is living but he is rather sickly and lives with an uncle of mine over in camden he cant work very much and that is why i have to support myself are you alone yes i think my father is living but i cant locate him the next day and for several days following joe pitched into work in earnest many things were strange to him but he determined to master them as speedily as possible and this pleased arthur drew that boy is all right he said to his cashier i am glad that andrew mallison brought him to me jack sagger was awfully angry at being discharged said the cashier it was his own fault i cannot afford to have a boy around who is impudent what the cashier said about the discharged lad was true jack sagger was mad clear through and he attributed his discharge solely to joe ill fix dat pill he said to one of his chums he aint going to do me out of my job an not suffer fer it what are you going to do jack asked the companion ill mash him dats wot ill do answered jack sagger he was a big rawboned lad several inches taller than joe his face was freckled and his lips discolored by cigarette smoking he was a thoroughly tough boy and it was a wonder that he had ever been allowed to work in the hotel at all he had a fairly good home but only went there to sleep and to get his meals joe i hear that jack sagger is going to make it warm for you said frank one monday afternoon i suppose he is angry because i got his position is that it yes what is he going to do i dont know exactly but hell hurt you if he can if he attacks me ill do what i can to take care of myself answered our hero that afternoon he was sent out by mr drew on an errand that took him to a neighborhood occupied largely by wholesale provision houses as joe left the hotel jack sagger saw him deres dat country jay now said sagger nows your time to git square on him jack said nick sammel his crony right you are nick come on going to follow him yes till i git him where i want him going to mash him sure when i git through wid him his own mother wont know him went on jack sagger boastfully maybe hell git the cops after you jack ill watch out fer dat nick an you must watch out too answered jack sagger are you sure you kin best him he looks putty strong huh cant i fight didnt i best sam nolan and jerry dibble thats right jack just let me git one chanct at him an hell run away you see if he dont but he shant git away until i give him a black eye an knock out a couple of his front teeth fer him concluded the boaster chapter xviii joe shows his muscle all unconscious that he was being followed our hero went on his errand to a wholesale provision house that supplied the grandon hotel with meats and poultry he felt in good spirits and so whistled lightly as he walked arriving at the place of business he transacted his errand as speedily as possible and then started to return to the hotel he was just passing the entrance to a factory yard when he felt a hand on his shoulder and wheeling around found himself confronted by jack sagger nick sammel and half a dozen others who had gathered to see their leader polish off the country boy what do you want demanded joe sharply you know well enough wot i want country exclaimed jack sagger i do not you took my job away from me an im goin to pay you fer doing it mr drew had a perfect right to discharge you jack sagger he said you were impudent and he didnt want you around any more you cant preach to me country do you know wot im goin ter do no im going to make you promise to leave dat job will yer promise no den you have got to fight and jack sagger began to pull up his rather dirty coat sleeves supposing i dont want to fight went on our hero as calmly as he could yer got ter do it country or else make dat promise ill make no promise to you den take dat as jack sagger uttered the last words he launched a blow at joes nose but our hero ducked and the blow went wide of its mark give it to him jack show him what you can do keep off came from joe if you dont youll get hurt hear dat now jack pitch in quick before anybody comes thus urged jack sagger struck out once more landing on joes chest then our hero drew back and sent in a blow with all his force it took the other boy squarely on the chin and sent him staggering against a friend if ever there was a surprised boy that boy was jack sagger he had expected that to polish off joe would be easy and he had not anticipated such a defense as had been made he righted himself and gazed stupidly at our hero wot did yer hit me fer he gasped you keep off or ill hit you again answered joe there was a pause and sagger sprang forward trying to catch joe around the arms but our hero was too quick for him and ducked once more then he hit the bully in the ear and gave him another blow in the left eye ouch roared jack sagger dont oh my eye have you had enough demanded joe who was commencing to warm up pitch in fellers came from jack sagger throw him down aint you going to do it alone queried nick sammel in wonder not unmingled with a suspicion that joe would not be as easy to handle as anticipated i ive got a a heartburn came lamely from sagger it come on me all at onct if it wasnt fer that id do him up all alone youre a fraud and you havent any heartburn cried joe youre afraid thats all if you want to fight stand up and well have it out dont you call me afraid said sagger but his voice had lost much of its bullying tone youre a big coward jack sagger after this i want you to leave me alone aint you fellers going to pitch in demanded sagger turning to his cohorts the first boy to hit me will get paid back with interest said joe sharply i dont like to fight but i can do it if i have to one or two had edged forward but when they saw his determined air they slunk back go on and fight him jack said one this is your mixup not ours you said you was going to do him up brown put in another aint i got the heartburn blustered the bully i cant do nuthin when i git that wait till im well then ill show him if you ever touch me again jack sagger ill give you the worst thrashing you ever had said joe loudly remember i am not the least bit afraid of you the best thing you can do is to keep your distance humph i dont want to quarrel with anybody but i am always ready to stick up for my rights just you remember that so speaking joe backed out of the crowd that opened to let him pass several of the boys wanted to detain him but not one had the courage to do so as soon as he was clear of his tormentors he hurried back to the hotel how did you make out asked mr drew its all right sir and theyll send the things tonight sure answered joe he hestitated for a moment i had a little excitement on the way how was that jack sagger and some other boys followed me up and wanted to polish me off you dont look as if they had done much polishing and the hotel man smiled no jack sagger got the worst of it i guess hell leave me alone in the future you mustnt fight around the hotel joe this was on the way to jackson bells sir i was bound to defend myself to be sure sagger came to me yesterday and wanted to be taken back but i told him no that i wouldnt have such an impudent fellow around as the winter season came on the hotel began to fill up and joe was kept busy from early in the morning until late at night and so was frank randolph the two boys were firm friends and on sunday went to sunday school together and also to church when their hotel duties permitted of it in the corridor of the hotel joe one day met the timid felix gussing the young man who had once had so much trouble in driving a horse how do you do mr gussing said our hero politely why if it isnt joe cried the young man and smiled what are you doing here i work at this hotel now is it possible didnt you like it at riverside yes but the place is shut up for the winter ah i see are you stopping here sir yes i came in an hour ago i have business in philadelphia maybe youre buying horses said joe slyly no no no more horses for me ejaculated the dude i er this is of more importance no more was said just then but later our hero met felix gussing again and on the day following had an errand that took him to the young mans room joe you are quite a wise boy perhaps i can confide in you said felix gussing after some talk on other subjects ill be glad to be of service to you mr gussing i have a delicate problem to solve sometimes a young man can give better advice than an older person went on the dude dont flatter me mr gussing i am in love went on the young man flatly yes sir i am quite sure the young lady loves me then i suppose you are going to get married there is an obstacle in the way oh perhaps i had better tell you the whole story if youll listen to me went on the dude certainly ill listen said joe ive got a little time off and then felix gussing told his tale of woe as will be found in the next chapter chapter xix one kind of a duel her name is clara and she is the daughter of major thomas botts sampson of the regular army began felix gussing then her father is a military man exactly and that is the trouble and the dude gave a groan it is this way when i went to see major sampson he greeted me very cordially until i disclosed the object of my visit sir said he this is a matter which requires consideration have you gained my daughters consent i have i answered so far so good said he but there is one thing more have you served in the army no said i or fought a duel no then he told me to remember that he had served in the army and that his daughter was the daughter of an army man one who had gone through many battles after that he said he was resolved that his daughter should marry only somebody who had proved himself a man of courage what did you do then asked joe becoming interested what could i do i am er no army man no fighter evidently the major wants a fighter for a soninlaw and felix gussing groaned once more youll have to become a fighter said joe no no i am a er a man of peace cried the dude in alarm mr gussing i think i can arrange matters for you said joe struck by a certain idea what can you mean joe i mean that i can prove to major sampson that you are a brave man do that joe and i shall be your friend for life gasped the dude will you wait until tomorrow mr gussing certainly but do not keep me in suspense too long this may cost you a little money i dont care if it costs a hundred dollars then i am sure i can fix it up for you answered joe there was stopping at the hotel a man named montgomery he had at different times been an auctioneer a bookagent a schoolmaster and a traveling salesman he was just now selling curiosities and joe felt that he would be only too glad to do felix gussing a good turn if he were paid for it our hero had a talk with this man and the upshot of the matter was that montgomery and the dude were introduced on the following morning i think i can help you mr gussing said the curiosity man who it may be mentioned here was a tall and importantlooking personage i was once in the army what can you do questioned the dude hopefully will it be worth fifty dollars to you if i aid you in winning the consent of major sampson to wed his daughter decidedly this is also joes plan so you will have to pay him too i dont want any money put in our hero joe shall have ten dollars if your plan wins out but how is all this to be accomplished continued felix gussing we will take the earliest possible opportunity to visit major sampson said ulmer montgomery well when we are all together well get into some sort of an argument you shall call me a fool and ill slap you in the face then you shall challenge me to a duel a duel why sir i er i never could shoot you and i dont want to be shot myself my dear mr gussing you dont understand me dont you comprehend the pistols shall be loaded with powder only ah thats the idea exclaimed the dude much relieved yes you see it will only be a sham duel so far as we are concerned but will in the most harmless fashion possible prove you to be a man of honor and courage major sampsons scruples will vanish and you will have the pleasure of gaining his daughters hand in marriage i agree mr montgomery the plan is a famous one is it yours or is it joes joes but it will fall to me to help carry it out said the jackofalltrades who did not lose sight of the fifty dollars that had been promised to him on the following day felix gussing and mr montgomery took themselves to major sampsons residence where the stranger was introduced as a curiosity hunter from chicago he wishes to look at your collection of swords said the dude i shall be delighted to show them said the major who was a person of great selfimportance ah this is a fine sword from the holy land said mr montgomery handling one of the blades i dont know where it came from said the major it was presented to me by a friend from boston that is a russian sword said the dude i know it by its handle that sword is from the holy land insisted mr montgomery anybody is a fool to talk that way cried felix gussing ha do you call me a fool sir stormed montgomery gentlemen put in the major i think i am not a fool sir and i want you to know it bellowed ulmer montgomery its an outrage to call me such take that sir and he slapped felix gussing lightly on the cheek gentlemen this must cease cried the major coming between them in my house too disgraceful he has got to apologize to me roared the dude acting his part to perfection never shouted montgomery if you will not i demand satisfaction i i will fight you in a duel a duel yes a duel pistols at ten paces went on felix gussing well well came from the major in amazement can i do less demanded the wouldbe soninlaw my honor is at stake then stand by your honor by all means cried the military man who at times was as hotblooded as anybody during the talk the majors daughter had come upon the scene oh felix what does this mean she demanded i am going to fight this this fellow a duel pistols at ten paces answered felix firmly felix she gasped you will not you cannot fight for my sake do not clara answered the dude smiling affectionately upon her for your sake i would forego any personal gratification but i must not suffer a stain upon the honor well said exclaimed the major felix is behaving well i couldnt have done better myself i admire his courage and i give him free permission to wed you after the the but father if he should be killed faltered the fair clara never fear clara all will go well interposed felix more words followed but the dude pretended to be stubborn and so did ulmer montgomery both went off to arrange about the duel and the major insisted upon it that he must be on hand to see the affair come off matters were hurried along with all speed and it was arranged that the duel should take place on the following morning at ten oclock in a country spot just outside of the city joe was invited to go along and carried the pistols and two others were let into the secret including a doctor who went fully prepared to attend to any wounds that might be inflicted it did not take long to load the pistols with powder only great care was taken so that major sampson should not suspect the truth major said felix in a trembling voice if i if anything serious happens to me tell clara that that i died like a man noble boy i will i will answered the military man when i give the word gentlemen you will both fire said one of the seconds very well answered both of the duelists ready one two three fire both pistols were simultaneously discharged when the smoke cleared away it was ascertained that both parties were unharmed gentlemen are you satisfied asked the seconds i am answered ulmer montgomery quickly then i shall be put in felix gussing and now that this affair is at an end mr montgomery will you shake hands he added with pleasure mr gussing was the reply i must say in all frankness i am sorry we quarrelled in the first place perhaps i was wrong about the sword and perhaps i was wrong both of you were wrong put in the major i hunted up the letter that came with the blade it is an old spanish weapon let us all call the affair off and mr montgomery shall come to claras wedding to mr gussing with all my heart cried montgomery and there the little plot came to a finish chapter xx attacked in the dark joe the plot worked to perfection said felix gussing on the day following i have to thank you and here are twenty dollars for your trouble i dont want a cent mr gussing answered our hero i did it only out of friendliness to you i hope you have no further trouble in your courtship oh that was all settled last night clara and i are to be married next week we are going to send out the cards today you see went on the young man in a lower tone i dont want to give the major a chance to change his mind or to suspect that that duel was not just what it ought to have been does he suspect anything as yet not a thing then you are wise to have the wedding as quickly as possible when we are married i am going to let clara into the secret i know shell enjoy it as much as anybody well you had better warn her to keep mum before her father he looks as if he could get pretty angry if he wanted to as you wont take any money for this joe wouldnt you like to come to the wedding im afraid it will be too hightoned for me mr gussing no it is to be a plain homelike affair clara wants it that way the major has some country cousins who will be there and they are very plain folks then ill come if miss sampson wishes it so it was arranged that joe should attend the wedding and as he was in need of a new sunday suit he purchased it at once so that he could use it at the wedding youre in luck joe remarked frank when he heard the news and that suit looks very well on you in some manner it leaked out among the boys that joe was going to the wedding and two days before the affair came off jack sagger learned of it he immediately consulted with some of his cronies and it was unanimously resolved to watch for joe after the wedding was over and chastise him severely for the manner in which he had treated the gang well fix him said sagger suggestively at the proper time joe took a car to the sampson home and was there introduced to a dozen or more people the wedding proved an enjoyable affair and the elegant supper that was served was one long to be remembered it was nearly eleven oclock when joe started for the hotel again he had thought to take a car but afterwards concluded to walk a walk will do me good after such a hearty supper he told himself if i ride home i wont be able to sleep at the corner the sagger crowd was waiting for him one gave a low whistle and all slunk out of sight until joe had passed several blocks had been covered when our hero came to a spot where several new buildings were in the course of construction it was rather dark and the street lights cast long and uncertain shadows along the walk joe had just started to cross a wooden bridge over an excavation when he heard a rush behind him before he could turn he was given a violent shove push him into de cellar hole came in jack saggers voice stop cried joe and it must be admitted that he was greatly alarmed but no attention was paid to his words and over the side of the bridge he went to fall a distance of a dozen feet and land in a pile of dirt with one lower limb in a puddle of dirty water down he goes he heard in the voice of nick sammel wonder how he likes it youre a mean low crowd cried joe as he stood up he was covered with dirt and the cold water felt anything but agreeable on such a frosty night as it chanced to be dont you dare to crawl out of dat said sagger if yer do well pitch yer in agin wont we fellers sure we will was the cry de next time well dump him in on his head growing somewhat accustomed to the semidarkness joe counted seven of his tormentors all standing on the edge of the cellar hole into which he had so unceremoniously been thrown several of the youths had heavy sticks i suppose ill have to retreat he reasoned i cant fight seven of them he turned to the rear of the cellar hole and felt his way along into the deepest shadows presently he reached a partly finished building and crawled up some planks leading to one of the floors he is running away he heard jack sagger cry come on after him said another of the crowd lets take his new coat and vest away from him added a third the entire party dropped down into the hole and ran to the rear in a hunt after our hero in the meantime joe was feeling his way along a scaffolding where some masons had been at work as it happened the entire party under jack sagger walked toward the unfinished building and came to a halt directly under the scaffolding joe saw them and crouched back out of sight where is de country jay he heard one of the crowd ask hes back here somewhere answered jack sagger we must find him an thump him good youll not thump me if i can help it said our hero to himself joe put out his hand and felt a cask near by it was half filled with dirty water being used for the purposes of making mortar a tub of water was beside the cask tit for tat he thought and as quickly as it could be done he overturned the cask and the tub followed joes aim was perfect and down came the shower of dirty water directly on the heads of the boys below every one was saturated and each set up a yell of dismay oh say im soaked he trun water all over me ugh but dats a regular ice bath dat is thats what you get for throwing me into the hole cried joe after this you had better leave me alone ive got some mortar in me eye screamed jack sagger dancing around in pain oh me eye is burned out im wet to de skin said nick sammel with a shiver oh say but its dead cold aint it waiting to hear no more joe ran along the scaffolding and then leaped through a window of the unfinished building a street light now guided him and he came out through the back of the structure and into an alleyway from this he made his way to the street ill have to hurry he reasoned if they catch me now they will want to half kill me dont let him git away he heard sagger roar catch him catch him hold on there you young rascals came a voice out of the darkness what are you doing around these buildings a watchman had come on the scene with a lantern in one hand and a heavy club in the other we aint doin nuthin said one of the boys maybe youre the gang that stole that lumber a couple of nights ago went on the watchman coming closer aint touched yer lumber growled jack sagger were after anudder feller wot hid in here said sammel thats a likely story i believe you are nothing but a crowd of young thieves grumbled the watchman every night somebody is trying to steal lumber or bricks or something ive a good mind to make an example of you and have you all locked up we aint touched a thing cried a small boy and began to back away in alarm at once several followed him heres a barrel of water knocked over and everything in a mess youve been skylarking too im going to have you locked up the watchman made a dash after the boys and the crowd scattered in all directions sagger received a crack on the shoulder that lamed him for a week and sammel tripped and went down taking the skin off of the end of his nose oh me nose he moaned its busted entirely run cried sagger if you dont youll be nabbed sure and then the crowd ran with all their speed scrambling out of the hole as best they could they did not stop until they were half a dozen blocks away and on their way home we made a fizzle of it dat trip said sagger dolefully its all your fault growled one of the boys i aint goin out wid you again you promise big things but you never do em oh jack s a gasbag dats wot he is was the comment of another and he walked off by himself presently one after another of the boys followed suit leaving jack sagger to sneak home a sadder if not a wiser lad chapter xxi days at the hotel perhaps those fellows have learned a lesson they wont forget in a hurry remarked frank to joe after he learned the particulars of the attack in the dark i hope they dont molest me further answered our hero if theyll only let me alone ill let them alone that sagger is certainly on the downward path said frank if he doesnt look out hell land in jail what frank said was true and less than a week later they heard through another hotel boy that jack sagger had been arrested for stealing some lead pipe out of a vacant residence the pipe had been sold to a junkman for thirty cents and the boy had spent the proceeds on a ticket for a cheap theater and some cigarettes he was sent to the house of correction and that was the last joe heard of him with the coming of winter the hotel filled up and joe was kept busy from morning to night so that he had little time for studying he performed his duties faithfully and the hotel proprietor was much pleased in consequence joe is all right he said to his cashier i can trust him with anything thats so and he is very gentlemanly too replied the cashier ulmer montgomery was still at the hotel he was now selling antiquaries and our hero often watched the fellow with interest he suspected that montgomery was a good deal of a humbug but could not prove it at length montgomery told joe that he was going to the far west to try his fortunes the man seemed to like our hero and the night before he left the hotel he called joe into his room i want to make you a present of some books i own said ulmer montgomery perhaps youll like to read them they are historical works thank you mr montgomery you are very kind i used to be a book agent but i gave that up as it didnt pay me as well as some other things and you had these books left over yes the firm i worked for wouldnt take them back so i had to keep them and now you are selling curiosities at this ulmer montgomery smiled blandly not exactly joe i only sell curiosities or antiquities when i am hard up on other occasions i do like other folks work for a living i dont quite understand i dropped into selling curiosities when i was in the south and hard up for cash i wanted money the worst way and i well i set to work to raise it maybe youd like to hear my story i would mind you i dont pose as a model of goodness and i shouldnt advise you to follow in my footsteps but i wanted money and wanted in badly so i put on my thinking cap and i soon learned of a very zealous antiquary living about five miles from where i was stopping he was wealthy and a bachelor and spent no inconsiderable portion of his income on curiosities and you went to him said joe becoming interested i at once determined to take advantage of this gentlemans antiquarian zeal i will own that i had some qualms of conscience about imposing upon the old gentleman but i didnt know of any other way to procure the money i absolutely needed having made all of my preparations i set off for mr lelands house to disguise myself i put on a pair of big goggles and an oldfashioned collar and tie i understand mr leland that you are in the habit of collecting curiosities i said quite right sir said he i have got together some few and he gazed with an air of pride at the nondescript medley which surrounded him i have in my possession i proceeded two or three of great value which i had hoped to retain but well i need money and so i must part with them much as i wish to call them mine but i wish to see that they get into the proper hands and i have been told that you are a great antiquarian understanding the true value of such things and so pray show them to me at once cried the old man eagerly i have traveled a good deal and been a pilgrim in many climes i went on i have wandered along the banks of the euphrates and dipped my feet in the currents of the nile i have gazed upon ruined cities yes yes show me what you have he cried eagerly here is a curiosity of the highest order i said opening a paper and showing a bit of salt about the size of a walnut this is a portion of the statue of salt into which lots wife was turned is it possible cried the antiquary taking the salt and gazing at it in deep veneration are you quite certain of this i am i answered it is a portion of the wrist i broke it off myself the hand was already gone and did he buy it questioned joe in astonishment he did and gave me fifty dollars in cash for it but that wasnt fair mr montgomery the seller of bogus curiosities shrugged his shoulders perhaps not but i was hard up and had to do something did you sell him anything else i did a walking stick which i had procured in connecticut it was covered with strange carvings and he mistook them for hieroglyphics and gave me ten dollars for the thing i dont see how you could have the nerve to do such things mr montgomery well a man can do lots of things when he is driven to do them i admit the deals were rather barefaced but as i said before i had to do something some day when i am rich ill return the money to the old fellow added the impostor he left the hotel that morning and it may be said here that joe did not meet him again for several years christmas came and went at the hotel and our hero received several presents from his friends including a pair of gloves from ned talmadge and a fivedollar gold piece from felix gussing some of the regular boarders at the hotel also remembered him and how do you like married life asked joe of felix gussing we are getting along very nicely said the dude have you told your wife about the duel yet no and i dont think i shall added felix gussing you see she er she thinks me a very brave man and and you dont want her to change her opinion finished joe with a smile why should i joe oh i dont know as there is any reason excepting that they usually say men and their wives should have no secrets from each other mr montgomery is gone i see said the dude changing the subject yes sir then you are the only one who knows of this secret you wont tell will you no sir we are having troubles enough as it is went on the dude both my wife and i find housekeeping rather troublesome it is hard to obtain proper servants and she does not care to do the work herself why dont you go to boarding perhaps we will later on with the new year came a heavy fall of snow and soon sleighs big and little were in demand then came a slight fall of rain which made the sidewalks a glare of ice got to be careful announced frank to joe if you dont youll go down on your back i intend to be careful answered our hero i have no wish to break any bones that afternoon joe was sent on an errand to a place of business half a mile away on returning he chanced to stop at a street corner to watch a number of children who had made a long slide for themselves as he stood watching a man came along bundled up in a great coat and wearing a slouch hat and blue glasses the man was walking rapidly as if in a hurry that fellow looks familiar to me thought joe wonder who he can be he watched the stranger cross the street then the fellow happened to step on the icy slide and in a twinkling he went down on his back his hat flying in one direction and a bundle he carried in another hurrah down goes the gent sang out a newsboy standing near come here an ill pick yer up said another street urchin you rascals you fixed this on purpose so i should fall cried the man starting to get up can i help you questioned joe coming up and then he gave a start as he recognized the fellow it was pat malone alias david ball from montana chapter xxii about some mining shares how do you do mr ball said our hero coolly eh whats that questioned malone in amazement then he recognized joe and his face fell i have often wondered what became of you went on our hero let me help you up i that is who are you boy demanded malone getting to his feet and picking up his hat and his bundle you ought to remember me i am joe bodley i used to work for mr mallison at riverside dont know the man or the place said pat malone coolly you have made a mistake then perhaps i had better call you malone not at all my name is fry john fry how often do you change your name mr fry dont get impudent i am not impudent i am only asking a plain question i never change my name at that moment joe saw a policeman on the opposite side of the street and beckoned for the officer to come over hi whats the meaning of this ejaculated pat malone officer i want this man locked up said joe and caught the rascal by the arm that he might not run away whats the charge asked the bluecoat he is wanted for swindling boy are you really crazy no i am not who are you asked the policeman eyeing joe sharply my name is joe bodley i work at the grandon house i will make a charge against this man and ill bring the man who was swindled too thats fair talk said the policeman i guess youll both have to go to the station with me im willing said joe promptly i i cannot go i have a sick wife i must get a doctor stammered pat malone let me go the boy is mistaken youll have to go with me but my sick wife you can send for your friends and they can take care of her i have no friends we are strangers in philadelphia i dont want to go pat malone tried to move on but the policeman and joe detained him and in the end he was marched off to the police station here joe told what he knew and malones record was looked up in the rogues gallery youve got the right man thats sure said the desk sergeant to our hero now where can you find this mr maurice vane i have his address at the hotel answered our hero if i can go ill get it and send mr vane a telegram bring the address here and well communicate with mr vane our hero agreed and inside of half an hour a message was sent to maurice vane notifying him of the fact that pat malone had been caught mr vane had gone to new york on business but came back to philadelphia the next day when he saw that he was caught pat malone broke down utterly and made a full confession telling in detail how the plot against maurice vane had been carried out it was not my plan said he gaff caven got the mining shares and he arranged the whole thing where did you get the shares steal them demanded maurice vane sharply no we didnt steal them we bought them from an old miner for fifty dollars the miner is dead now can you prove this yes then do so why i dont care to answer that question but if you can prove to me that you and caven came by those shares honestly i wont prosecute you malone i will prove it was the quick answer and that very afternoon pat malone proved beyond a doubt that the shares had belonged to himself and gaff caven when they sold them to maurice vane that is all i want of you said maurice vane i shant appear against you malone then those shares must be valuable after all queried the swindler perhaps they are i am having them looked up i am glad of this opportunity of proving that they are now my absolute property if caven and i sold you good stocks we ought to be kicked full of holes grumbled malone that was your lookout not mine returned maurice vane mind i dont say the shares are valuable but they may be and if so i shall be satisfied with my bargain humph where do i come in you dont come in at all and you dont deserve to if i didnt swindle you you cant have me held for swindling i dont intend to have you held you can go for all i care maurice vane explained the situation to the police authorities and that evening pat malone was allowed to go he threatened to have somebody sued for false imprisonment but the police laughed at him better not try it on malone said one officer remember your picture is in our rogues gallery and then the rascal was glad enough to sneak away the next day he took a train to baltimore where after an hours hunt he found gaff caven we made a fine mess of things he said bitterly a fine mess what are you talking about pat asked caven do you remember the mining stocks we sold to maurice vane certainly i do well he has got em yet all right he can keep them we have his money too and gaff caven chuckled id rather have the shares eh i said id rather have the shares gaff we put our foot into it when we sold em do you mean to say the shares are valuable demanded gaff caven thats the size of it who told you this nobody told me but i can put two and two together as quick as anybody well explain i was in philadelphia when i ran into that hotel boy joe bodley what of that he had me arrested then they sent for mr maurice vane and vane made me prove that the shares were really ours when we sold them to him i thought id go clear if i could prove that so i went and did it then vane said he wouldnt prosecute me for the shares might be valuable after all but the mine is abandoned maybe it is and maybe it isnt i guess mr maurice vane knows what he is doing and we were fools to sell out to him if that mine is valuable im going to have it cried gaff caven he can have his money back and the rascal who had overreached himself began to pace the floor maybe he wont take his money back then ill claim the mine anyway pat and you must help me what can you do go out to montana just as soon as the weather is fit and relocate the mine if its any good we can find some fellows to help us hold it somehow im not going to let this slip into maurice vanes hands without a struggle talk is cheap but it takes money to pay for railroad tickets went on malone ive got the dust pat enough to fight vane off if he should come west i think so i met a rich fellow last week and i got a loan of four thousand dollars without security and malone winked suggestively exactly oh he was a rich find answered gaff caven and gave a short laugh im willing to go anywhere im tired of things here its getting too warm for comfort then let us start west next week after i can finish up a little business here i am willing and so the two rascals arranged to do maurice vane out of what had become his lawful property chapter xxiii the fire at the hotel on the day following the scene at the police station maurice vane stopped at the grandon house to interview our hero i must thank you for the interest you have taken in this matter joe said he it is not every lad who would put himself out to such an extent i wanted to see justice done mr vane answered our hero modestly things have taken a sudden change since i saw you last summer went on maurice vane perhaps it will be as well if i tell my whole story id like first rate to hear it after i got those shares of stock i felt that i had been swindled and i was very anxious to get hold of the rascals but as time went on and i could not locate them i resolved to look into the deal a little more minutely and see if there was any chance of getting my money or a portion of it back i should have done the same i wrote to a friend out west and he put me in communication with a mining expert who set to work to find out all about the mine the expert sent me word late in the fall that the mine was in his opinion located on a vein of gold well worth working what did you do then i wanted to go west at once and look into the matter personally but an aunt died and i had to settle up her estate and see to the care of her two children and that held me back then winter came on and i knew id have to let matters rest until spring are you going out there in the spring yes as early as possible too i hope you find the mine a valuable one mr vane i place great reliance on what the mining expert said for he is known as a man who makes no mistakes then if the mine proves of value youll have gotten a cheap piece of property after all yes indeed wont those swindlers be mad when they hear of this most likely my lad but they have nobody to blame but themselves i bought their shares in good faith while they sold them in bad faith is your title perfectly clear now absolutely so then i hope the mine proves to be worth millions thank you my boy id like to own a mine like that myself would you well perhaps you will some day its not likely a hotel boy doesnt earn enough to buy a mine and our hero laughed if i find the mine worth working and open up for business how would you like to go out there and work for me id like it very much mr vane very well ill bear that in mind answered the possessor of the mining shares why dont you buy up the rest of the mining shares first i am going to do so if i can locate them perhaps the owners will sell cheap i shall explain the situation and make a fair offer i do not believe in any underhand work was the ready answer then you are not like some men i have met said joe and told about ulmer montgomery and his socalled antiquities that man will never amount to anything joe mark my words he will always be a hangeron as we call them in the business world i believe you sir honesty pays in the long run a rogue may make something at the start but sooner or later he will find himself exposed maurice vane remained at the hotel for a week and then left to go to chicago on business from that point he was going to montana as soon as the weather permitted after that several weeks slipped by without anything unusual happening during those days joe fell in again with felix gussing we are going to move to riverside said the dude if such he may still be called although he was a good business man i have rented a house there the old martin place and if you ever come to the town you must visit us thank you i will answered our hero my wife thinks a great deal of you and you must stop at the house during your stay at riverside went on felix gussing a change came for joe much quicker than was anticipated one night late in the winter he was just preparing to retire when he smelt smoke he ran out of his room and to an air shaft and saw the smoke coming up thickly the hotel must be on fire he thought if it is ill have to notify the management he jumped rather than ran down the several stairways to the hotel office here he told the proprietor and the cashier an examination was made and the fire was located in the laundry go and awaken all the guests said mr drew and joe ran off to do as bidden other boys did the same and before long the guests were hurrying through the hallways and down the elevators and stairs by this time the smoke was coming thickly and presently a sheet of flame burst through at the rear of the hotel the fire alarm had been given and several engines and a hookandladder company dashed on the scene are your guests all out demanded a police officer i believe so answered mr drew im going to take a look around said joe and darted upstairs once more he visited room after room only to find them empty from the rear of the hotel came the crackling of flames and down in the street the fire engines were pounding away sending their streams of water into the structure on the third floor of the building our hero came across an old lady who was rather queer in her mind the lady was also lame and walked with great difficulty oh joseph what is the trouble she cried the hotel is on fire mrs dalley come let me help you out on fire oh i must save my canary and the old lady started back for her room you havent got time mrs dalley come with me i cannot let my dear dick perish answered the old lady firmly joe looked along the hall and saw that the flames were moving swiftly toward the room the old lady had occupied to enter the apartment would be highly dangerous you simply cant go after the bird madam he said come with me my bird my bird screamed mrs dalley and tried to run or rather hobble towards her room despite the smoke that was now rolling over her head you must come with me exclaimed joe and drew her back she tried to struggle and then without warning fainted in his arms the burden was a heavy one but our hero did not shirk the task before him he half dragged and half carried the unconscious lady to the nearest staircase and almost fell to the bottom the smoke on the second floor was so thick he could scarcely see but he kept on and went down another flight and reached the office he could hardly breathe and the tears were running down both cheeks hullo there boy came the call of a fireman as he appeared through the smoke better get out of here help me with this lady answered joe a lady oh all right and in a moment more the fireman had mrs dalley over his shoulder and was carrying her out joe came close behind the lady was taken to a nearby drug store where she speedily revived by the prompt efforts of the fire department only a small portion of the hotel was burnt but the whole building was watersoaked and all of the boarders had to move out and then the place was closed up out of a place once again thought our hero rather dismally whats to do next this was not an easy question to answer he looked around for another opening but finding none resolved to pay a visit to riverside i can call on the gussings and on ned he thought i know all of them will be glad to see me and maybe mr mallison will be wanting to make some arrangements for next summer i suppose hell run the boats as usual going to leave philadelphia eh said frank do you intend to come back joe i dont know yet frank well i wish you luck i wish you the same if you go to work for mallison this summer maybe you can get me a job too ill remember that answered our hero his preparations were soon made and then he boarded a train for riverside he did not dream of the surprises in store for him chapter xxiv the blue box at last after calling on the gussings and being invited to remain there for several days joe took himself to ned talmadges residence ned was very glad to see him and had to give all the particulars of another trip he had made to the west i had a splendid time said ned i wish you had been along then you like the west ned indeed i do better than the east perhaps ill go west some day went on our hero and told his friend of what maurice vane had said i saw some mines while i was out there continued ned i went to the very bottom of one mine i can tell you i felt a bit shivery being so far underground i suppose the miners get used to it it would be a joke on those swindlers if that mine should prove of value went on ned after a pause i hope for mr vanes sake it does prove valuable now your hotel is burnt out what are you going to do i havent made up my mind ned perhaps ill come back here to work for mr mallison then well be together again next summer that will suit me the boys had a good time together and then joe said he would like to pay a visit to his old home on the mountain side ned readily consented to go along but i dont imagine youll find much of the old cabin left he added there was still a little ice in the lake but they rowed to the spot without great difficulty and made their way to the tumbledown cabin it was not an inviting sight and it made joe feel sober to view the locality joe you never heard anything of that blue box did you asked ned after several minutes of silence no it ought to be somewhere in this vicinity its gone and that is all there is to it said our hero and gave a long sigh the boys tramped around the vicinity for a good half hour and then sat down on a hollow log to eat a lunch they had brought along let us build a fire beside the old log said ned it will help to keep us warm joe was willing and the two boys soon had some leaves and twigs gathered and placed some goodsized branches on top to make the blaze last then they began to eat and to warm themselves at the same time this log would make a good hidingplace for some wild animal remarked ned can anything be inside its not likely ned the smoke would drive out any living creature im going to get a stick and poke into the log both boys procured sticks and began to poke at the log presently they felt something move and a halfdazed snake came into view theres your animal ned exclaimed joe oh a snake keep him away roared ned badly frightened he cant hurt you he is too stiff from the cold answered our hero and quickly dispatched the snake with a stone do you suppose there are any more in the tree asked the rich boy still keeping at a distance more than likely ill poke around with my stick and see be careful i am not afraid joes stick had something of a crotch on the end of it and with this he began to rake among the dead leaves that had blown into the hollow log he brought out a great quantity but no more snakes showed themselves i reckon he was the only one after all ned the log is burning said ned an instant later see the smoke is coming out of the hollow my stick is caught said joe pulling hard on something i guess well i declare he gave a jerk and from the hollow came a square object covered with smoking dirt and leaves what is it unless i am mistaken it is a tin box oh joe the blue box joe did not answer for he was brushing the smoking leaves and dirt from the object as he cleaned it off he caught sight of some blue paint on one end the box was badly charred from the fire its the blue box sure enough said joe and we came close to burning it up groaned ned oh joe i am so sorry its not your fault ned i was as much to blame as anybody but who would look for the box out here perhaps some wild animal carried it off that may be joe had the box cleaned off by this time it was still hot at one end and smoking he tried to pull it open but found it locked the contents will burn up before i can open it cried joe he did not know what to do and in desperation began to pry at the box with his stick and his jackknife then the box broke open scattering some halfburnt papers in all directions the boys picked the papers up and also a small bag of buckskin when joe opened the bag he found it contained exactly a hundred dollars in gold thats a nice find said ned anyway you are a hundred dollars richer than you were joe began to peruse the halfburnt documents but could make little or nothing out of them he saw his own name and also that of a certain william a bodley and an estate in iowa was mentioned what do you find joe i cant tell you ned the papers are too badly burnt let me look at them our hero was willing and the two boys spent an hour in trying to decipher the documents it is certainly a puzzle said the rich boy why not let my father look over them joe was willing and after wrapping up the documents with care and pocketing the hundred dollars in gold joe led the way back to the boat the wreck of the blue box was left behind for it was rusty and worthless that evening mr talmadge ned and joe spent two hours in going over the documents and trying to supply the parts which had been rotted or burnt away they were only successful in part i do not wish to say much about this joe said neds father but it would seem from these papers that you are the son of one william a bodley who at one time owned a farm in iowa in the township of millville did you ever hear hiram bodley speak of this never we might write to the authorities at millville and see what they have to say i wish youd do it they may pay more attention to you than to a boy ill write at once father hadnt joe better stay here until we get a reply put in ned he may do so and welcome answered mr talmadge the letter was dispatched the next day and our hero waited anxiously for the reply it came five days later and was as follows your letter of inquiry received there was a william a bodley in this township twelve years ago he sold his farm to a man named augustus greggs and then disappeared before he sold out he lost his wife and several children by sickness nobody here seems to know what became of him joseph korn that is short and to the point said mr talmadge but it is not satisfying it does not state if this william a bodley had any relatives so far as known i guess the authorities did not want to bother about the matter said joe why dont you visit millville joe questioned ned i was thinking i could do that it wouldnt cost a fortune and ive got that hundred dollars in gold to fall back on besides my regular savings you might learn something to your advantage came from mr talmadge i think it would be money well spent father cant i go with joe asked ned no ned you must attend to your school duties then joe you must send me full particulars by mail said the rich boy of course ill do that ned replied our hero it was arranged that joe should leave riverside on monday and ned went to the depot to see him off i wish you the best of luck joe called out ned as the train left the station i dont know of a fellow who deserves better luck than you do chapter xxv joe visits chicago joe found millville a sleepy town of three or four hundred inhabitants there was one main street containing two blocks of stores a blacksmith shop a creamery and two churches when he stepped off the train our hero was eyed sharply by the loungers about the platform anything i can do for you asked one of the men the driver of the local stage will you tell me where mr joseph korn lives joe lives up in the brown house yonder but he aint home now hes doing a job of carpentering can you tell me where up to the widow fallows place take you there for ten cents very well and our hero jumped into the rickety turnout which went by the name of the millville stage the drive was not a long one and soon they came to a halt in front of a residence where a man wearing a carpenters apron was mending a brokendown porch theres joe said the stage driver laconically the man looked up in wonder when joe approached him he dropped his hammer and stood with his arms on his hips this is mr joseph korn i believe thats me young man i am joe bodley you wrote to mr talmadge of riverside a few days ago i came on to find out what i could about a mr william a bodley who used to live here oh yes well young man i cant tell you much more n i did in that letter bodley sold out house goods and everything and left for parts unknown did he have any relatives around here not when he left he had a wife and three children a girl and two boys but they died did you ever hear of any relatives coming to see him a man named hiram bodley not me but augustus greggs who bought his farm might know about it ill take you to the greggs farm for ten cents put in the stage driver again a bargain was struck and a drive of ten minutes brought them to the farm located on the outskirts of millville they found the farm owner at work by his wood pile sawing wood he was a pleasant appearing individual come into the house he said putting down his saw im glad to see you and when our hero had entered the little farmhouse he was introduced to mrs greggs and two grownup sons all of whom made him feel thoroughly at home to tell the truth said mr greggs i did not know william bodley very well i came here looking for a farm and heard this was for sale and struck a bargain with him was he alone at that time questioned joe he was and his trouble seemed to have made him a bit queer not but what he knew what he was doing did you learn anything about his family he had lost his wife and two children by disease what had happened to the other child was something of a mystery i rather supposed it had died while away from home but i was not sure have you any idea at all what became of william bodley not exactly once i met a man in pittsburg who had met a man of that name in idaho among the mines both of us wondered if that william a bodley was the same that i had bought my farm from did he say what part of idaho he did but i have forgotten now do you think he was a relative of yours i dont know what to think it may be that he was my father your father yes and joe told his story and mentioned the documents found in the blue tin box it does look as if he might be your father said augustus greggs maybe youre the child that was away from home at the time his other children and his wife died do you think anybody else in this village would know anything more about this william bodley no i dont but it wont do any harm to ask around that stage driver knows all the old inhabitants perhaps some of them can tell you something worth while upon urgent invitation joe took dinner at the greggs farm and then set out to visit a number of folks who had lived in millville and vicinity for many years all remembered william a bodley and his family but not one could tell what had become of the man after he had sold out and gone away maybe you had better advertise for him suggested one man it will cost a good deal to advertise all over the united states replied joe and for all i know he may be dead or out of the country joe remained in millville two days and then took the train back to the east ned was the first to greet him on his return to riverside what luck he asked anxiously none whatever was the sober answer oh joe thats too bad i am afraid i am stumped ned they walked to the talmadge mansion and that evening talked the matter over with neds father i will arrange to have an advertisement inserted in a leading paper of each of our big cities said mr talmadge that will cost something but not a fortune you must let me pay for it said our hero no joe you can put this down to neds credit you two are such good chums and mr talmadge smiled quietly the advertisements were sent out the following day through an advertising agent and all waited for over two weeks for some reply but none came its no use said joe and it must be admitted that he was much downcast in the meantime he had seen andrew mallison and the hotel man said he would willingly hire him for the summer as soon as the season opened and also give frank randolph a situation you had better be my guest until that time said ned to our hero when he heard of this thank you ned but i dont wish to remain idle so long the very next mail after this talk brought news for our hero a letter came from maurice vane asking him if he wished to go to montana i am now certain that that mine is valuable wrote the gentleman i am going to start west next monday if you wish to go with me i will pay your fare and allow you a salary of ten dollars per week to start on i think later on i will have a good opening for you that settles it i am going west cried joe as he showed the letter to his chum well i dont blame you was the reply i know just how nice it is out there youll be sure to get along before going to bed joe wired his acceptance of the offer and in the morning received a telegram from maurice vane asking him to go to chicago to the palmer house that settles it im off said our hero and bought a ticket for the great city by the lakes without delay then he said goodbye to the talmadges and the gussings and boarded the train at sundown joe was now getting used to traveling and no longer felt green and out of place he had engaged a berth and took his ease until it was time to go to bed arriving at chicago he made his way without delay to the palmer house he found the hotel crowded and had some difficulty in getting a room mr maurice vane had not yet arrived i guess ill leave a note for him thought our hero and sauntered into the readingroom to pen the communication while joe was writing two men came into the room and sat down behind a pillar that was close at hand they were in earnest conversation and he could not help but catch what was said you say he is coming west said one of the pair yes he started yesterday and he has found out that the mine is really valuable i think so anyway he is quite excited about it he sent a telegram to that boy too the hotel boy you mean yes so the talk ran on and joe at length got up to take a look at the two men they were gaff caven and pat malone at once our hero drew out of sight again how can you get the best of vane gaff asked malone after a pause there is but one way malone and that is can i trust you havent you trusted me before we must caven paused we wont talk about it in this public place come to my room and ill lay my plan before you then the two arose and left the readingroom as rapidly as they had entered it chapter xxvi how a satchel disappeared they certainly mean mischief joe told himself after the two men had vanished he saw them enter an elevator but did not know at what floor they alighted looking over the hotel register he was unable to find the names of either caven or malone or even ball evidently the rascals were traveling under other names now theyll bear watching he concluded i must put mr vane on guard as soon as he comes in he gave up the idea of leaving a note and took his station in the corridor of the hotel after waiting about two hours he saw a wellknown form approaching dresssuit case in hand mr vane oh joe so youre here already im glad i wont have to wait for you im afraid you wont be able to get a room mr vane but you can have mine i telegraphed ahead for a room joe do you know that your enemies are here went on our hero my enemies gaff caven and pat malone but they are traveling under other names have they seen you i think not sir mr vane soon had his room assigned to him and he and our hero passed up in the elevator as soon as they were in the apartment by themselves joe related what he had seen and heard they are certainly on my trail mused maurice vane and they must have kept pretty close or they wouldnt know that i had asked you to accompany me they have some plot mr vane have you any idea what it is no sir excepting that they are going to try to do you out of your interest in that mine maurice vane and joe talked the matter over for an hour but without satisfaction then they went to the dining room for something to eat we start for montana in the morning said the gentleman i think the quicker i get on the ground the better it will be for me although maurice vane and joe did not know it both were shadowed by caven and malone the two rascals had disguised themselves by donning false beards and putting on spectacles they leave in the morning said caven malone we must get tickets for the same train and if possible the same sleeping car its dangerous work grumbled pat malone if you want to back out say so and ill go it alone i dont want to back out but we must be careful ill be careful dont fear answered the leader of the evil pair at the ticket office of the hotel maurice vane procured the necessary tickets and sleeper accommodations to the town of golden pass idaho he did not notice that he was watched a moment later gaff caven stepped up to the desk i want a couple of tickets to golden pass too he said carelessly yes sir let me see what sleeper did that other gentleman take number sir berths and then give me and or and went on caven and here you are sir said the clerk and made out the berth checks without delay caven hurried away followed by malone well be in the sleeping compartment right next to that used by vane and the boy chuckled gaff caven pat it ought to be dead easy have you the chloroform yes twice as much as well need when can we leave the train at three oclock at a town called snapwood we can get another train two hours later on the northern route all unconscious of being watched so closely maurice vane and joe rode to the depot and boarded the train when it came along joe had been looking for caven and malone but without success i cannot see those men anywhere he said they are probably in hiding said his employer the train was only half full and for the time being caven and malone kept themselves either in the smoking compartment or in the dining car it was dark when they took their seats and soon the porter came through to make up the berths for the night i must confess i am rather sleepy said maurice vane so am i returned our hero i am sure i can sleep like a top no matter how much the car shakes then both of us may as well go to bed at once so it was arranged and they had the porter put up their berths a few minutes later maurice vane took the lower resting place while our hero climbed to the top although very tired it was some time before joe could get to sleep he heard maurice vane breathing heavily and knew that his employer must be fast in the land of dreams when joe awoke it was with a peculiar dizzy feeling in his head his eyes pained him not a little and for several minutes he could not remember where he was then came a faint recollection of having tried to arise during the night but of being held down i must have been dreaming he thought but it was exactly as if somebody was keeping me down and holding something over my mouth and nose he stretched himself and then pushed aside the berth curtain and gazed out into the aisle of the car the porter was already at work turning some of the berths into seats once more joe saw that it was daylight and consulted the nickel watch he carried eight oclock he exclaimed ive overslept myself sure mr vane must be up long ago he slipped into his clothing and then knocked on the lower berth he heard a deep sigh mr vane eh oh joe is that you what time is it eight oclock what maurice vane started up ive certainly slept fast enough this trip are you getting hungry waiting for me i just woke up myself oh maurice vane stretched himself my how dizzy i am i am dizzy too sir it must be from the motion of the car probably although i rarely feel so and i ride a great deal i feel rather sick at my stomach too went on the gentleman as he began to dress joe had just started to go to the lavatory to wash up when he heard his employer utter an exclamation joe yes sir did you see anything of my satchel you took it into the berth with you i dont see it it must be somewhere around i saw it when you went to bed yes i put it under my pillow both made a hasty search but the satchel could not be found the dresssuit case stood under the seat and joes was beside it this is strange can i have been robbed was there much in that satchel mr vane yes those mining shares and some other articles of value then we must find the satchel by all means ill question the porter about this the colored man was called and questioned but he denied having seen the bag by this time quite a few passengers became interested has anybody left this car asked maurice vane the genmen that occupied numbers and sah said the porter when did they get off bout three oclock sah when de train stopped at snapwood i havent any tickets for snapwood said the conductor who had appeared on the scene then they must have had tickets for some other point said joe that looks black for them the porter was asked to describe the two men and did so to the best of his ability then another search was made and in a corner under a seat a bottle was found half filled with chloroform its as plain as day to me said maurice vane joe i was chloroformed perhaps i was too thats what gave us the dizzy feeling and those two men must have been caven and malone in disguise finished our hero chapter xxvii joe makes a discovery who are caven and malone asked the conductor of the train while a number of passengers gathered around to hear what maurice vane and our hero might have to say they are two rascals who are trying to do me out of my share of a mine explained maurice vane i had my mining shares in that satchel if you wish ill telegraph back to snapwood for you went on the train official how many miles is that a little over two hundred what is the next stop of this train leadington when will we get there in ten minutes a telegram was prepared and sent back to snapwood as soon as leadington was reached the train was held for five minutes and it was learned that nobody had been seen at the station there at three in the morning as the night operator and station master were away there being no passengers to get on the train bound west maurice vane was much disturbed and did not know what to do to go back and look for them at snapwood may be a mere waste of time said he on the other hand i dont feel much like going on while the shares are out of my possession if you wish it mr vane ill go back said joe you can go ahead and if anything turns up i will telegraph to you this pleased the gentleman and he said joe could go back on the very next train the conductor was again consulted and our hero left the train bound west a quarter of an hour later here is some money said maurice vane on parting youll need it and he handed over two hundred dollars oh mr vane will i need as much as this perhaps if you see those rascals you may have a long chase to capture them do not hesitate to spend the money if it appears necessary to do so long before noon our hero was on the way east on a train scheduled to stop at snapwood he went without his dresssuit case and carried his money in four different pockets the train was almost empty and the riding proved decidedly lonely in a seat he found an omaha paper but he was in no humor for reading when noon came he took his time eating his dinner so that the afternoons ride might not appear so lasting about halfpast two oclock the train came to an unexpected halt looking out of the window joe saw that they were in something of a cut close to the edge of a woods the delay continued and presently one passenger after another alighted to learn the meaning of the holdup joe did likewise and walked through the cut toward the locomotive the mystery was easily explained on one side of the cut the bank had toppled over the tracks carrying with it two trees of good size a number of train hands were already at work sawing the trees into pieces so that they might be shifted clear of the tracks joe watched the men laboring for a few minutes and then walked up the bank to get a look at the surroundings then he heard a whistle and saw a train approaching from the opposite direction it came to a halt a few hundred feet away as the delay continued our hero walked along the bank of the cut and up to the newlyarrived train the latter was crowded with passengers some of whom also got out did that train stop at snapwood he asked of one of the passengers it did was the answer did you see anybody get on no but somebody might have gotten on i wasnt looking thank you looking for a friend no said joe and moved on without delay our hero ran to the front end of the newlyarrived train and got aboard as he walked through he gave every grown passenger a close look at the end of the third car he came upon two suspiciouslooking individuals who were gazing at a bit of paper in the hands of one joe came closer and saw that the paper was a mining share caven and malone as sure as fate he murmured to himself what had i best do next while joe was trying to make up his mind caven chanced to glance up and his eyes fell upon our hero he gave a cry of dismay and thrust the mining share out of sight whats the matter asked malone in a low tone look there pat that boy no but it is how did he get on this train i dont know but its unpleasant enough for us do you suppose vane is around asked malone nervously he may be the two men stared around the car only some women and children were present the men having gone out to learn the cause of the delay perhaps we had better get out went on malone all right they arose and satchel in hand started to leave the train stop cried joe and caught caven by the arm let go of me boy ejaculated the rascal and tried to pull himself loose i wont let go gaff caven if you dont it will be the worse for you i am not to be trifled with you must give up that satchel bah if you dont im going to have you arrested who is going to arrest me here sneered the man who had robbed maurice vane dont you know we are miles away from any town i dont care give up the satchel or ill call the train hands ill give up nothing boy stand out of my way gaff caven gave joe a violent shove which sent our hero up against a seat then he turned and ran from the car with pat malone ahead of him stop them cried joe as soon as he could recover stop the thieves others took up the cry but before anything could be done caven and malone were out of the car and on to the tracks both stared around in perplexity for a second come on we cant afford to waste time here cried caven and ran for the bank of the cut up which he scrambled hastily with his confederate at his side joe saw them make the move and was not slow to follow near at hand was a tall western young man with bronzed features and a general outdoor manner say cried our hero will you help me to catch those two men they are thieves and i want them arrested if youll help me catch them ill pay you well for your trouble ill go you stranger answered the western young man readily you are certain of your game yes that satchel has their plunder in it they robbed a friend of mine this suits me then friend well round em up in short order by this time caven and malone had gained the woods looking back they saw joe coming behind accompanied by the westerner hes after us and he has got somebody to help him ejaculated malone well i reckon we can run as fast as they can answered gaff caven come ahead he led the way along a trail that ran through the woods and came out on a winding country road beyond was another patch of timber this way pat said he well have to take to the woods again they are too close for comfort cant we climb a tree or hide in a hollow questioned the confederate well see said caven they pushed on harder than ever and passed in among some tall trees then they came to a tree that was bent over up you go cried caven and gave his confederate a boost into the tree then he hauled himself up now climb to the top he went on and malone did as requested caven followed suit and both hid themselves among the thick branches they wont find us here said malone after ten minutes had passed dont make a noise whispered caven after that they remained silent from a great distance came a shouting and the whistling of locomotives the trees were being hauled from the car tracks a little later they heard more whistling and then the two trains passed on their way the trains have gone whispered malone do you think the boy got aboard one of them no i dont answered his companion he is too determined a lad to give up so easily he must be still looking for us chapter xxviii from out of a tree caven was right joe and his newlymade friend were still in the woods doing their best to locate the two rascals they had found the trail but lost it in the patch of tall timber and were gazing around when they heard the trains leaving the cut there goes our outfit friend said the westerner and there wont be another train along for several hours its too bad but it cant be helped answered our hero but ill pay you for all time lost mr plain bill badger is my handle stranger my name is joe bodley what about these two varmin you are after they were trying to rob a friend of mine of some mining shares answered joe and gave a few details well i vow cried bill badger that mine is close to one my dad owns they say it aint of much account though mr vane thinks it is valuable he has had a mining expert go into the matter with great care then thats a different thing were you bound for the mine yes and so was mr vane we were on the train together when he was robbed i see i was going out to my dads mine then perhaps we can journey together after we get through here said joe im willing i like your looks shake and the pair shook hands although a westerner bill badger knew no more about following a trail than did our hero consequently they proceeded on their hunt with difficulty reckon weve missed em said bill badger a while later dont see hide nor hair of em anywhere its too bad if they got away answered joe perhaps what was that the cracking of a tree limb had reached their ears followed by a cry of alarm a limb upon which pat malone was standing had broken causing the fellow to slip to another branch below hush dont make so much noise said caven in alarm gosh i thought i was going to tumble out of the tree to the ground gasped malone when he could catch his breath they are coming i can see them whispered gaff caven be as quiet as a mouse in a moment more joe and bill badger stood directly under the tree i think the noise came from near here said joe i agree answered the westerner at that moment our hero looked up and saw a mans arm circling a tree limb far over his head they are up there he shouted sure yes i just saw one of them then weve got em treed came with a broad grin from bill badger whats the next turn of the game we have got to make them both prisoners all right have you got a shooting iron no but i can get a club then do it and ill use this if its necessary and the young westerner pulled a pistol from his hip pocket i wish we had some ropes with which to tie them continued joe heres a good big handkerchief thats an idea my handkerchief is also good and strong you do the powwowing and ill do the shooting if its necessary said bill badger joe looked up into the tree again but could see nobody caven he called out i know you are up there and i want you to come down to this remark and request there was no reply if you dont come down we may begin to fire at you went on our hero oh say do you think hell shoot whispered malone in sudden alarm no shut up returned caven are you coming down or not went on joe still there was no reply ill give em a shot to warn em said bill badger and fired into the air at random dont shoot me roared pat malone please dont ill come down well you come down first caven you stay up there for the present after this there was a pause and presently pat malone came down out of the tree looking sheepish enough up with your hands cried bill badger and confronted by the firearms the hands of the rascal went up in a hurry then joe took his handkerchief and stepped up behind malone the hands were lowered and crossed and our hero tied them firmly together at the wrists now back up to that tree yonder said our hero and dont you dare to move ill do just as you say whined malone only dont shoot me he was a coward at heart now caven you come down shouted joe i dont think i care to answered that rascal coolly if you dont come down ill come up after you with my pistol broke in bill badger maybe i can do a little shooting myself went on gaff caven ill risk that more words followed but in the end caven thought it best to descend and did so yet his face still wore a look of defiance he was compelled to turn around and his hands were also tied behind him now i want those mining shares caven said joe i havent got them where is the satchel i threw it away when you started after me down at the railroad tracks yes dont you believe that broke in bill badger at least not unless he emptied the satchel first show me the way you came said joe make him point out the satchel or make him suffer went on bill badger ive got an idea cried our hero suddenly perhaps he left the satchel in the tree thats so well if you want to climb up and look around ill watch the pair of em dont let them get away if they try it theyll go to the hospital or the graveyard replied the western young man significantly the satchel aint in the tree growled caven but his tone lacked positiveness ill soon know for certain said our hero he climbed the tree with ease having been used to such doings when living with the old hermit as he went from branch to branch he kept his eyes open and presently saw a bit of leather sticking out of a crotch he worked his way over and soon had the satchel in his possession how are you making out called up bill badger ive got it shouted our hero joyfully got the papers yes everything said joe after a hasty examination hang the luck muttered gaff caven much chagrined our hero was soon on the ground once more here he examined the contents of the satchel with care everything was there and locking the bag he slung the strap over his shoulder now whats the next move queried bill badger we ought to have these men locked up how far is it to the nearest town ten or twelve miles i reckon i dont know much about the roads why cant you let us go asked malone youve got what you want if i let you go youll be trying to make more trouble for mr vane and myself dont talk to them growled caven if you want to lock us up do so he was in an ugly humor and ready for a fight well march em along said bill badger and so it was agreed chapter xxix the fate of two evildoers are you going to let them arrest us whispered pat malone as the whole party moved through the woods towards a wagon road which ran nearly parallel to the railroad tracks not if i can help it caven whispered back we must watch our chances half a mile was covered and they came out on the road it was growing dark and there were signs of a storm in the air its going to rain said joe and he was right see here i dont want to get wet to the skin growled caven ill catch my death of cold there is a barn just ahead said bill badger let us get inside joe was willing and soon all were in the barn it was now raining at a heavy rate and they were glad to be under shelter with a barn there ought to be a house remarked our hero but i dont see any it grew still darker and the rain came down in perfect sheets the roof of the barn leaked and they had to move from one spot to another to keep out of the drippings while this was going on gaff caven was working at the handkerchief that bound his wrists and soon had it loose pat malone also liberated himself caven winked suggestively at his confederate watch me he whispered when i give the signal well knock em both down and run for it but the pistol began malone ill take care of that in moving around the old barn caven spotted a club and moved close to it suddenly he snatched the weapon up and hit bill badger on the arm with it the pistol flew into a corner and went off sending a bullet into a board run yelled caven and leaped for the open doorway malone came beside him and both ran off through the rain as fast as their legs could carry them joe was startled and made after the pair but at a groan from bill badger he paused are you badly hurt he asked he gave me a stiff crack on the arm growled the young westerner joe ran for the corner and caught up the pistol then he leaped for the open doorway stop both of you he called out stop or ill fire dont you dare shrieked pat malone and ran faster than ever behind the nearest of the trees joe aimed the weapon but before he could pull the trigger both of the bad men were out of sight go after them if you want to said bill badger ill go too you are not badly hurt queried our hero sympathetically no but if i catch that fellow ill give it to him good grumbled the young westerner both now left the barn and made after caven and malone once they caught sight of the rascals moving in the direction of the railroad tracks they are going to catch a train if they can cried our hero i hear one coming its a freight most likely was bill badgers answer he was right and soon the long line of freight cars hove into sight around a bend and on an upgrade far in the distance they beheld caven and malone scooting for the train with all speed they are going to make it sighed joe too bad they continued to run but before they could get anywhere near the tracks they saw caven leap for the train and get between two of the cars then malone got aboard also and the freight train passed out of sight through the cut that ends the chase said joe halting they were slick to get away if we only knew where they would get off we could send word ahead suggested his companion well we dont know and after this they will probably keep their eyes wide open and keep out of sight as much as possible anyway i dont think theyll bother mr vane any more its not likely im a witness to what they were up to answered the young westerner both joe and bill badger were soaked from the rain and resolved to strike out for the nearest farmhouse or village they kept along the railroad tracks and presently came to a shanty where there was a trackwalker how far to the nearest village asked our hero half a mile thank you how is it you are out here in the rain went on the trackwalker we got off our train and it went off without us oh i see too bad again our hero and his companion hurried on and soon came in sight of a small village they inquired their way to a tavern and there dried their clothing and procured a good hot meal which made both feel much better i am going to send a telegram to mr vane said joe and did so without further delay he was careful of the satchel and did not leave it out of his sight they found they could get a train for the west that evening at seven oclock and at the proper time hurried to the depot im glad i met you said joe to his newlymade friend now what do you think i owe you for what you did as we didnt land the fellows in jail you dont owe me anything said bill badger promptly oh yes i do well then you can pay the extra expense and let that fill the bill ill certainly do that said joe promptly as they rode along bill badger told something of himself and of the mine his father owned and then joe told something of his own story did you say your name is joe bodley asked the young westerner with deep interest yes and you are looking for a man by the name of william a bodley i am it seems to me i know a man by that name although the miners all call him bill bodley where is this bill bodley out in montana somewhere he worked for my father once about three years ago he was rather a strange man about fifty years old he had white hair and a white beard and acted as if he had great trouble on his mind you do not know where he is now no but perhaps my father knows then im going to see your father as soon as i can said joe decidedly mind you i dont say that this bill bodley is the man you are after joe i dont want to raise any false hopes did you ever hear where the man came from i think he told somebody that he once owned a farm in kansas or iowa this william a bodley once owned a farm at millville iowa is that so then he may be the same man after all to tell the truth he looked a little bit like you was he a good man asked joe eagerly yes indeed but some of the men poked fun at him because he was so silent and strange at times i liked him and so did father he left us to go prospecting in the mountains thus the talk ran on for half an hour when the train came to a sudden halt are we at a station asked bill badger i dont know said joe both looked out of the window but could see nothing except hills and forests we are in the foothills said the young westerner something must be wrong on the tracks more fallen trees perhaps or a landslide they have them sometimes when it rains as hard as it did today they left the car with some others and soon learned that there had been a freight collision ahead and that half a dozen freight cars had been smashed to splinters do you think it can be the freight that caven and malone boarded came from our hero on hearing this news it might be answered bill badger let us take a look our train wont move for hours now they walked to the scene of the wreck one of the cars had been burnt up but the conflagration was now under control and a wrecking crew was already at work clearing the tracks so that they might be used anybody hurt asked joe of a train hand yes two men killed they were riding between the cars tramps they didnt look like tramps but they hadnt any right to ride on the freight where are they over in the shanty yonder with a queer sensation in his heart joe walked to the little building accompanied by bill badger a curious crowd was around and they had to force their way to the front one look was enough gaff caven and pat malone lay there cold in death they had paid the penalty of their crimes on earth and gone to the final judgment chapter xxx conclusion let us go away whispered joe and moved out of the gathering without delay it was sure rough on em was bill badgers comment oh it was awful cried our hero i i didnt expect this did you nobody did it must have come sudden like on to em it makes me sick at heart to think of it i i hope it wasnt our fault not at all if they hadnt broke away theyd be alive this minute theyll never bother you or your friend again joe our hero felt weak at the knees and was glad enough to go back to the train where he sank into his seat he scarcely said another word until the wreck was cleared away and they were once more on their journey i reckon you are glad you got the satchel before this happened remarked bill badger when they were preparing to retire yes but i i wish they had gotten away its awful to think they are dead and with such bad doings to their credit joe did not sleep very well and he was up early in the morning and out on the rear platform drinking in the fresh air he felt as if he had passed through some fearful nightmare how do you like this climate asked bill badger as he came out aint it just glorious it certainly is said joe and he remembered what ned had told him i dont wonder some folks like it better than the east oh the east cant compare to it answered bill badger why i was once down to new york and boston and the crowd and confusion and smoke and smells made me sick for a week give me the pure mountain air every time the day proved a pleasant one and when he did not remember the tragedy that had occurred our hero enjoyed the ride and the wild scenery at last golden pass was reached late at night and they got off in a crowd of people joe mr vane was the answering cry and soon the two were shaking hands let me introduce a new friend mr bill badger glad to know you mr badger helped me get back your satchel went on our hero then i am deeply indebted to him in that case just drop the mister from my name drawled the young westerner joe tells me you have a mine up here my father has one too the mary jennie next to the royal flush oh yes i know the mine and i have met your father said maurice vane they walked to a hotel and there joe and his young western friend told their stories to which maurice vane listened with keen interest the gentleman was shocked to learn of the sudden death of caven and malone it was certainly a sad ending for them said he but as badger says they had nobody but themselves to blame for it maurice vane was extremely glad to get back his mining shares and thanked bill badger warmly for what he had done dont you mention it said the young westerner im going to hunt up dad now when you get time call and see us im coming up soon to find out about that bill bodley said joe as late as it was joe listened to what maurice vane had to tell now that caven and malone are gone i do not anticipate further trouble at the mine said the gentleman i am in practical possession of all the shares and shall have a clear title to the whole property inside of a few weeks when joe told him what bill badger had had to say about a certain man called bill bodley he was much interested yes you must find out about this man at once said he i will help you as soon as certain matters are settled the next morning proved a busy one and joe got no time to call upon bill badgers father he visited the mine and looked over it with interest during the middle of the afternoon he went back to town on an errand for mr vane he was passing a cabin on the outskirts when he heard loud words and a struggle let me go you ruffian cried a weak voice leave that money alone you shut up old man was the answer the money is all right you are trying to rob me then there was another struggle and suddenly a door burst open and a man leaped into the roadway at sight of him joe came to a halt the fellow was bill butts the man who had tried to swindle josiah bean stop him came from the cabin he has my gold stop cried joe and ran up to butts the next moment man and boy tripped and fell but luckily our hero was on top let me go growled the man so we meet again butts cried joe the man stared in amazement and then began to struggle seeing this joe doubled up his fists and gave him a blow in the nose and in the right eye which caused him to roar with pain thats right came from the doorway of the cabin give it to him make him give me my gold give up the gold ordered joe there it is growled bill butts and threw a buckskin bag towards the cabin the man from within caught it up and stowed it away in his pocket shall i call a policeman asked joe i dont know said the man from the cabin he wore a troubled face and had white hair and a white beard it may be wha where did you come from he gasped where did i come from asked joe yes yes answer me quickly you are you must be a ghost i saw you in my dreams last week i dont understand you said joe and arose slowly to his feet at which bill butts did likewise and began to retreat i never met you before no its queer the man brushed his hand over his forehead yes i must be dreaming but i am glad i got my gold back so am i but the rascal has run away never mind let him go what makes you think youve seen me before questioned joe and his breath came thick and fast i er i dont know you mustnt mind me i have queer spells at times you see i had a whole lot of trouble once and when i get to thinking about it the man did not finish may i ask your name asked joe and his voice trembled in spite of his efforts at selfcontrol sure you can its bill bodley william a bodley yes but how do you happen to know my full name did you once own a farm in millville iowa i had a farm in iowa yes it was millville center in those days joe drew closer and looked at the man with care and emotion did you ever have a brother named hiram bodley i did but he has been dead for years no hiram bodley died only a short time ago answered joe i used to live with him my name is joe bodley he told me i was his nephew you his nephew hiram bodleys nephew we didnt have any brothers or sisters and he was a bachelor i know he was a bachelor but i dont know joe paused he told me joe died at least i got a letter from somebody to that effect but i was near crazy just then and i cant remember exactly how it was i lost my wife and two children and then i guess i about lost my mind for a spell i sold out and the next thing i knew i was roving around the mountains and in rags then i took to mining and now ive got a mine of my own up yonder in the mountains come in and talk this over joe entered the cabin and sat down and william bodley plied him with questions all of which he answered to the best of his ability there was a blue tin box i had said he presently that contained some documents that were mine a blue tin box ejaculated joe hiram bodley had it and it got lost i found it a long time afterwards and some parts of the documents were destroyed i have the rest in my suit case at the hotel can i see those papers certainly perhaps you are my son joe perhaps i am sir they went to the hotel and the documents were produced then william bodley brought out some letters he possessed man and boy went over everything with care you must be my son cried william bodley thank heaven you are found and they shook hands warmly he told joe to move over to the cabin and our hero did so it was a neat and clean place and soon joe felt at home then he heard his fathers tale in detail an odd and wonderful story of great trials and hardship there will always be something of a mystery about this said william bodley but no matter so long as i have you with me uncle hiram was a queer stick answered joe i suppose if he was alive he could explain many things and in this joe was correct let us add a few words more and then draw our tale to a close when joe told maurice vane how he had found a father the gentlemen was much astonished so were the badgers but all were glad matters had ended so well it was found that william bodleys mine was a valuable one the ore in it was about equal to the ore in the mine owned by maurice vane and this was likewise equal to that in the mine run by mr badger after some conversation on the subject it was agreed by all the interested parties to form a new company embracing all the mines of the shares of this new concern onethird went to maurice vane onethird to the badgers and onethird to william bodley and joe the necessary machinery was duly installed and today the new company is making money fast on the day after his trouble with mr bodley bill butts disappeared from town but a week later he was arrested in denver and sent to jail for two years for swindling a ranchman during the following summer joe received a visit from his old friend ned and the two boys had a delightful time together in the meantime joe spent half of his time at the mine and half over his books for he was determined to get a good education for a long time william bodley had been in feeble health but with the coming of joe on the scene he began to mend rapidly and was soon as hale and hearty as anybody he was an expert miner and was made general superintendent for the new company today joe has a good education and is rich but come what may it is not likely that he will forget those days when he was known as joe the hotel boy
