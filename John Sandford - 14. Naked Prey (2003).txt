the buick disappeared into the garage and the door started down the big man rolling down the highway in a battered cherokee killed his lights pulled into the driveway and took the shotgun off the car seat the snow crunched underfoot as he stepped out the snow was coming down in pellets rather than flakes and they stung as they slapped his warm face he loped up the driveway fully exposed for a moment and stopped just at the corner of the garage in a shadow beneath the security light jane warr opened the side door and stepped through her back turned to him as she pulled the door closed behind her he said jane she jumped her hand at her throat choking down a scream as she pivoted and shrank against the door taking in the muzzle of the shot gun and the large man with the beard and the stocking cap she screeched what whore you get away a jumble of panic words he stayed with her tracking her with the shotgun and he said slowly as if speaking to a child jane this is a shotgun if you scream i will blow your heart out she looked and it was a shotgun all right a twelvegauge pump and it was pointing at her heart she made herself be still thought of deon in the house if deon looked out and saw them deon would take care of himself what do you want joe kelly they stood for two or three seconds the snow pellets peppering the garage the big mans beard going white with it then joes not here a hint of assertion in her voice this didnt involve her this shotgun bullshit the big man said he twitched the muzzle to the left toward the house were going inside to talk to him and hes gonna pay me some money i dont want to hurt you or anybody else but im gonna talk to joe if i have to hurt the whole bunch of you i will he sounded familiar she thought maybe one of the guys from missouri from kansas city are you one of the kansas city people because were not shut up the big man said get your ass up the steps and into the house keep your mouth shut she did what he told her this was not the first time shed been present when an unfriendly man flashed a gun not even the second or third time but she was worried on the other hand he said he was looking for joe when he found out joe wasnt here hed go maybe joes not here she said as she went up the steps quiet the mans voice dropped one thing i learned down in kansas city ill share this with you is that when trouble starts you pull the trigger dont figure anything out just pull the trigger if joe or deon try anything on me you can kiss your butt goodbye all right she said her voice had dropped with his now she was on the strangers side shed be okay she told herself as long as deon didnt do anything but there was something too weird about this guy ill share this with you shed never heard a serious asshole say anything like that they went up the stairs onto a back porch then through the porch into a mudroom then through another door into the kitchen none of the doors was locked broderick was a small town and it doesnt take long to pick up smalltown habits as they clunked into the kitchen which smelled like microwave popcorn and weekold carrot peels deon cash called from the living room hey and they heard his feet hit the floor a second later he stepped into the kitchen scowling about something a thin fivefootteninch black man in an indianprint fleece pullover and jeans with a can of budweiser in one hand he saw warr the big man behind her and then an instant later registered the shotgun by that time the big man had shifted the barrel of the shotgun and it was pointing at cashs head dont even think about moving easy cash said he put the can of budweiser on a kitchen counter freeing his hands call joe cash looked puzzled for a second then said joe aint here call him the big man said hed thought about this about all the calling cash shrugged hey joe he shouted nothing after a long moment the man with the shotgun said goddamnit where is he he went away last month he aint been back we dont know where he is warr said told you he wasnt here go stand next to deon warr stepped over next to cash and the big man dipped his left hand into his parka pocket and pulled out a clump of chain handcuffs he tossed them on the floor and looked at warr put them on deon deon turn around aw man its up to you the big man said i dont want to hurt you two but i will were gonna wait for him if it takes all night he aint here warr said in exasperation he aint coming back cuffs the big man said i know what it sounds like when cuffs lock up aw man cmon the shotgun moved to cashs head and warr bent over and picked up one set of cuffs and the big man said turn around so i can see it and warr clicked the cuffs in place pinning cashs hands behind him the big man dipped his hand into his pocket again and came up with a roll of strapping tape tape his feet together man you startin to piss me off cash said even with his hands cuffed he managed to look stupidly fierce bettern being dead sit down and stick your feet out so she can tape you up still grumbling cash sat down and warr crouched beside him and said im pretty scared and cash said we gonna be all right the masked man can go look at joes stuff see he aint here the big man made her take eight tight winds of tape around cashs ankles then he ordered warr to take off her parka and cuff her own hands she got one cuff but fumbled with the other and the man with the shotgun told her to turn and back toward him and when she did clicked the second cuff in place he then ordered both of them to lie on their stomachs and with the shotgun pointed at them he checked cashs cuffs and then warrs just to make sure when he was satisfied he pulled on a pair of cotton gloves knelt beside warr and taped her ankles then moved over to cash and put the rest of the roll of tape around his when he was done cash said so go look joe aint here i believe you the big man said standing up they looked so helpless that he almost backed out he steadied himself i know where joe is after a moments silence cash asked where is he in a hole in the ground a couple miles south of terrebonne dont think i could find it myself anymore the big man said i just asked you about him so youd think that he shrugged that you had a chance another moments silence and then warr said aw god deon listen to his voice cash put the pieces together then said loud croaking but not yet screaming we didnt do nothin man we didnt do nothin i know what you did the big man said dont hurt us warr said she flopped against the vinyl tried to get over on her back please dont hurt us ill tell the cops whatever you want we get a trial cash said he twisted around the better to see the mans face and to test the tape on his legs we innocent until we proved guilty innocent the big man spat it out we didnt do nothin cash screamed at him i know what you did the crust on his wounds had broken and the big man began kicking cash in the back in the kidneys in the butt and the back of his head and cash rolled around the narrow kitchen floor trying to escape screaming the big man wailing like a man dying of a knife wound like a man watching the blood running out of his neck and he kicked and booted cash in the back and when cash flopped over in the face cashs nose broke with the sound of a saltine cracker being stepped on and he sputtered blood out over the floor across the kitchen warr struggled against the tape and the handcuffs and halfrolled under the kitchen table and got tangled up in the chairs and their wooden legs clunked and pounded and clattered on the floor as she tried to inchworm through them cash screaming all the while sputtering blood cash finally stopped rolling exhausted blood pouring out of his nose smearing in arcs across the vinyl floor the big man backed away from him wiped his mouth on his sleeve then took a utility knife out of his pocket and stalked across the room to warr grabbed the tape around her ankles and pulled her out from under the table warr cried jesus dont cut me he didnt he began slicing though her clothing pulling it away in rags she began to cry as he cut the clothing away the big man closed his mind to it finished leaving her nude on the floor except for the rags under the tape on her ankles and began cutting the clothing off cash whatre you doing man whatre you doing cash began flopping again rolling finally frustrated with cashs struggles the big man backed away and again kicked him in the face cash moaned and the big man rolled him onto his stomach and knelt between his shoulder blades and patiently sliced at cashs shirt and jeans until he was as naked as warr whatre you doing warr asked now there was a note of curiosity in her voice showing through the fear public relations fuckin kill ya cash groaned still bubbling blood from his broken nose fuckin cut ya fuckin head off the big man ignored him he closed the knife caught cash by the ankles and dragged him toward the door cash nearly exhausted from flopping on the floor began flopping again but it did no good he was dragged flopping through the mudroom leaving a trail of blood onto the porch and then down the steps to the lawn his head banging on the steps as they went down mother mother cash said god mother there wasnt much snow on the ground hadnt been much snow all winter but cashs head cut a groove in the inch or so that there was spotted with more blood when they got to the jeep the big man popped open the back lifted cash by the neck and hips and threw him inside back in the house he picked up warr and carried her out to the truck like a sack of flour and tossed her on top of cash and slammed the lid before leaving he carefully scanned the house for anything that he might have touched that would carry a fingerprint finding nothing he picked up the shotgun and went back outside wherere we going warr shouted at him im freezing the big man paid no attention a quartermile north of town he began looking for the west ditch road a dirt track that led off to the east he almost missed it in the snow stopped backed up on the dark roadway and turned down the track he passed an old farmhouse that hed thought abandoned but now as he went by he saw a single light glowing in a firstfloor window but no other sign of life too late to change plans now he thought besides with this night the wind had picked up ripping the snow off the ground hed be far enough from the farmhouse that he couldnt be seen he kept moving the light in the farmhouse window fading away behind him in the dark in the snow there were no distinctive landmarks at all he concentrated on the track and the odometer fourtenths of a mile after he turned off highway he slowed looking out the leftside window at first he saw nothing but snow after a hundred feet or so the tree loomed and he pulled over then carefully backed pulled forward and backed again until he was parked across the road what cash groaned from the back what the big man went around to the back of the truck opened it grabbed the thick wad of tape around cashs legs and pulled him off the truck as if he were unloading lumber cashs shoulders hit the frozen earth with a meaty impact the big man got him by the tape and dragged him past the first tree into what had been from the car in the dark an invisible grove of trees one of the trees a pin oak loomed at the very edge of the illumination thrown by the cars headlights ropes were slung over a heavy branch fifteen feet above the ground the big man staggering under cashs weight dropped him by one of the ropes then went back for warr when he got her to the hanging tree struggling and kicking against him he dropped her beside cash cant do this man cash screamed this is murder the storm around them quieted for a moment but the snow pellets still whipped through the trees stinging like so many bbs please help me warr called to cash please please murder the big man shouted back at cash raising his voice above the wind he broke away from them toward a tree branch that was sticking up out of the snow ripped it off the frozen ground and staggered back to cash murder he began beating cash with the long stick ripping strips of skin off cashs back and legs as the black man thrashed on the ground gophering through the snow trying to get away murder you fuckin animal murder he stopped after a while too tired to continue threw the stick back into the trees murder he said to cash ill show you murder the big man led one of the ropes over to cash tied a single loop around his neck tight with strong knots he did the same with the second rope around warrs neck she was now shivering violently in the cold when he was done the big man stood back looked at the two of them said god damn your immortal souls and began hauling on the rope tied to cash cash stopped screaming as the rope bit into his neck he was heavy and the big man had to struggle against his weight and against the raw friction of the rope over the tree limb finally unable to get him in the air the big man lifted him and pulled the rope at the same time and cashs feet cleared the ground by a meager six inches he didnt struggle he simply hung the big man tied the lower end of the rope around the tree trunk and tested it for weight it held warr pleaded but the big man couldnt hear her later couldnt remember anything she said except that there were a lot of whispered pleases didnt do her any good didnt do her any good when she fought him either though it might have given her a brief thirty seconds of satisfaction he couldnt get her high enough to get her feet off the ground and as he struggled to do it a space opened between the bottom of his coat sleeve and the glove on his right hand the space the warm flesh bumped against her face and quick as a cat she sank her teeth into his arm biting ferociously twisting her head against his arm he let go of the rope and she fell holding on with her teeth pulling him down and he hammered at the side of her head until she let go she was groaning when he boosted her back up and she ground out were not the only ones that stopped him for a moment what theyll be coming for you you cocksucker she spat at him from three inches away and hit him in the face he flinched grabbed her around the waist and boosted her higher his gloves slippery with blood and then he had her high enough and he stepped away holding tight to the rope and she swung free and her groaning stopped he managed to pull her up another four inches then tied the rope off on the trunk he watched them for a few minutes swinging in the snow in the dim light their heads bent their bodies violently elongated like martyrs in an el greco painting then he turned and left them they may have been dead then or it might have taken a few minutes he didnt care and it didnt matter he rolled slowly carefully out of the side road down through broderick and on south he was miles away before he became aware of the pain in his wrist and the blood flowing down his sleeve toward his elbow when he turned his arm over in the dim light of the car he found that shed bitten a chunk of flesh out of his wrist a lemonwedge that was still bleeding profusely if a cop stopped him and saw it he pulled over in the dark wrapped his wrist with a pad of paper towels and a length of duct tape stepped out of the truck washed his hand and arm in snow tossed the bloody jacket in the back of the truck and dug out a lighter coat from the bag in back get home he thought burn the coat dump the truck get home weather davenport crawled sleepily out of bed the kid was squalling hungry in his bedroom down the hall and she started that lucas woke up as the housekeeper called i got him weather im up ah great weather said she came back to the bed sat down looked at the clock getting up lucas asked alarms going off in fifteen minutes anyway she said she yawned inhaled exhaled pushed herself off the bed and headed for the bathroom pulling off her cotton nightgown as she went lucas lying half awake under the crazy quilt could see nothing but darkness on the other side of the wood slats that covered the window january in minnesota the sun came up at and went down at noon he thought he shifted his head around on the pillow tried to get comfortable tried to get back to sleep sleep was unlikely hed been feeling down for a month or more and depression was the enemy of decent sleep i i the marriage was fine the new kid was great nothing to do with that his sense of the blue was a chemical thing but the chemicals made sleep impossible if he went down further hed check with the doc on the other hand it might just be the winter which this year had started in october he heard the shower start and then ellen the housekeeper banging down the stairs with the kid the kid was named samuel kalle davenport the kalle a finnish name for weathers late father the housekeeper was a fiftyfiveyearold exnurse who loved kids the four of them together had a deal they all liked after a few minutes the shower stopped and lucas sat up he was awake now no point in struggling against it he climbed out of bed remembered the clock picked it up and turned off the alarm as he did weather came out of the bathroom rubbing her hair with a towel you getting up she asked cheerfully she was a small woman and an early bird she liked nothing better than getting up before the sun to begin the hunt for worms uh lucas said he started for the bathroom but she smelled so warm and good as he passed her that he slipped an arm around her waist and picked her up and gave her a warm sucking kiss on the tummy below her navel she squirmed around laughed once and then said severely put me down you oaf mad rapist attacks naked housewife in bedroom lucas carried her back to the bed and threw her on it and landed on the bed next to her hands running around where they shouldnt be get away from me she said rolling away come on lucas goddamnit she whacked him on the ear and it hurt and he collapsed on the bed she got out and started scrubbing at her hair again and said you men get hardons in the morning and youre so proud of them just swishing around in the air you cant help showing off try not to use the word swish lucas said sex in the morning is for teenagers and we arent she said lucas rolled over on his stomach now youve offended me offend this she said shed spun her towel into a whip and snapped him on the ass with it that hurt too more than the whack on the ear and he rolled off the bed and said arrgh naked housewife attacks sleeping man weather laughing backed away from him rewinding the towel said sleeping man snapped in the balls with wet towel then ellen the housekeeper called from the stairs you guys up they both stopped in their tracks and weather whispered well you are what do you want me to tell her weather was a surgeon and she was cutting on somebody almost every morning this morning she had three separate jobs all at regions all involving burns two separate skin grafts and a scalp expansion on the head of a former electric lineman trying to stretch what hair he had left over the burn scars hed taken from a hot line she was bustling around the kitchen in full imperial surgeon mode when lucas finally made it down the stairs ellen had the kid in a high chair and was pushing orange vegetable mush into his face ill be home by three oclock ellen but ill be out of touch from seventhirty to at least ten weather was saying if theres a problem you know what to do the man from harpers is coming over this morning to look at the front steps the phone rang and they all looked at it maybe a canceled operation lucas picked it up hello

weather still there just getting ready to leave let me talk to her lucas handed the phone to weather and at the same time said rose marie something happened i gotta run weather took the phone said hello listened for a moment and then said yes lucas gave it to me i think well start tonight uhhuh uhhuh i dont think well skip any of it i was listening to the japanese flute last night while they were talking lucas went to the front closet and got his overcoat and briefcase he took his out of the briefcase and clipped it on his belt and pulled the coat on listening to weather talk to his boss rose marie subscribed to a theory that children became smarter if they were exposed to classical music as fetuses continuing until they were say fortyfive shed found a set of records made specifically for infants weather had swallowed the whole thing and was about to start the program im going lucas called to her when he had his coat on weather said wait wait and then to the phone ive got to say goodbye to lucas talk to you tonight she hung up and came over to lucas and stood on tiptoe to kiss him on the lips she said youd be going out of town so oh boy lucas said he kissed her again and then went over and kissed sam on the top of his head see you all running a few minutes later than the fifteen hed promised lucas davenport walked a long block down st pauls wabasha street toward the former store that housed the state department of public safety lucass own office was a mile or so away at the main bureau of criminal apprehension office on university avenue so hed had to find a space in one of the commercial parking garages around him featherlike flakes of snow settled on the sidewalks on the shoulders of passersby and drifted into the traffic slowing and softening the usual hustle of the morning rush lucas was a tall athletic man hatless in a blue suit and gray cashmere overcoat swinging a black coach briefcase with no thought of the north of dead people hanging in a frozen stand of oaks both coat and case were christmas gifts from weather and though hed taken some grief about them they were a little too fey for a cop hed been told he liked them the coat was soft and warm and dramatic and the briefcase had that aristocratic thump that impressed people who were impressed by aristocratic thumps that included almost all bureaucrats he was surrounded by bureaucrats as the result of a political clusterfuck that had stretched across three or four different sets of politicians when the dust had settled the former minneapolis chief of police was the minnesota public safety commissioner and lucas had a new job fixing crime for the governor lucass job was officially designated director office of regional studies the ors had been planted within the state bureau of criminal apprehension and drew its budget and support from the bca but lucas reported directly to rose marie roux and through her to the governor the governor had already been burned by a couple of out state murder cases that had gone unsolved and hed had enough of that in both cases the local sheriffs departments had investigated the murders before calling in the bca when the cases proved too complicated or politically touchy they started screaming for help and blamed the bca and the state when the cases went unsolved that the cases had been mucked up by the locals hadnt cut any ice with the hometown newspapers where was all the scientific investigation stuff they kept seeing on the discovery channel why were they sending all that taxpayer money to st paul what was the governor doing sitting on his ass questions that a percent governor didnt appreciate so the governor created the office of regional studies in consultation with roux the office was intended as the insiders all knew to fix shit the bca director john mccord hated the idea nobody above him really cared they just wanted shit fixed lucas smiled at the thought he hadnt fixed anything big yet but this call sounded like others hed gotten from roux over the years lucas smiled often enough he liked his job and his life but the years had given him a hard face and frenchcanadian genes had left him with crystalblue eyes his hair was dark with flecks of gray and a white scar ran across his forehead and one eyebrow onto the cheek below another scar dimpled his throat a nasty round white spot with a slashing tail hed been shot by a little girl and had been choking on his tongue and on the blood from the wound passing out and a surgeon the same one hed later married had opened his throat and airway with a jackknife that had all been years ago now he thought he spent too much time in a chair in an effort to fight what he saw as sloth hed been playing winter basketball with a group of aging jocks from minneapolis he was broadshouldered quickmoving and not quite gaunt he brushed by a redheaded woman who was leading a muffinsized red dog in a muffinsized red christmas sweater down the sidewalk the woman smiled and said hi lucas as they passed he halfturned and blurted hey how ya doin and smiled and kept going whered he know her from somewhere he was up the steps inside the shopping mall that led to the dps in an elevator a bartender he thought she used to be a bartender where obriens maybe rose marie rouxs office was a twentyfoot square that shed furnished with her own money a good cherrywood desk two comfortable visitors chairs in green leather a couch a few prints and photographs of politicians a bookcase full of reference books and state procedure manuals rose marie was sprawled in a chair behind her desk an overweight woman with improbably blondtinted flyaway hair wearing a rumpled blue dress with an unlit cigarette hanging from the corner of her mouth word around town was that when she took the job shed moved the commissioners office across the building so she could get a window that opened at any time of day you were likely to see her head sticking out the window it was said with a plume of smoke hanging over it what lucas asked sit down she said she pointed at a green leather chair the governors a couple of minutes out but i can give you an outline she took a breath well what weve had a lynching the statement hung in the air like an oral goodyear blimp tell me lucas said after a moment up north a few miles outside of armstrong you know where that is by thief river somewhere very good a black man and a white woman were found hanging from a tree out in the countryside they were naked handcuffed legs taped with strapping tape theyd been living together in some flyspeck town north of armstrong lynched lucas said he thought about it for a few seconds then said slowly lynched means that somebody is suspected of a crime the townspeople take justice into their own hands and the law doesnt do anything about it is that no what actually happened is that they were murdered rose marie said twisting in her chair sometime last night but its a black man and a blond woman and theyre hanging from trees naked when the word gets out the shits gonna hit the fan and we can say murder all we want and the movie people are going to be screaming lynching we need to get some shit up there does bemidji know lucas asked the bcas bemidji office handled investigations in the northern part of the state i dont know they dont know from me what weve got is an informal contact with ray zahn the state patrolman out of armstrong rose marie said he called in about fortyfive minutes ago and had the call switched to me at home he seems to be a smart guy he was first on the scene a couple of minutes ahead of the first sheriffs deputies maybe the sheriffll handle it lucas suggested zahn says no he says the sheriff is a new guy whos scared of his own shadow zahn says the sheriffll call us as soon as he looks at the scene and im going absolutely thats the first thing the governor said when i called him weve got a national guard chopper getting ready you can fly right into the scene thats all we know lucas asked thats everything roux said then ill get going lucas said pushing up from the green chair he felt a hum a little spear of pleasure breaking through the blue an evil bastard to hunt nothing like it to cheer a guy up you can call me in the air if anything changes waitfor the governor hes only a minute or two away while they waited lucas got on his cell phone and called del where are you in bed del capslock had come over from minneapolis with lucas get up ill pick you up in fifteen or twenty minutes bring some clothes for a couple of days bring some boots too were going up north were gonna be outside uhoh yeah exactly right ill tell you when i see you rose maries telephone rang and she picked it up listened for one second then dropped it back on the hook governor just came through the front door governor elmer henderson was six feet tall and willowy with lightly gelled blond hair fading to gray long expressive hands and watery blue eyes he wore narrow goldrimmed glasses that gave him a scholarly look and conservative gray blue or black suits handmade in london over handmade english shoes hendersons clan had money and a history in minnesota politics but elmer hadnt been expected to carry the family banner he had in fact always been the family weenie with a whiff of sexual difference hanging around him from his college and lawschool days hed been expected to spend his life as a secondstringer in the boardrooms of large minnesota corporations while his two brothers grew up to be governors and senators and maybe presidents but one of the brothers turned to cocaine and multiple divorce and the other got drunk and powered his antique wooden chris craft under a dock and made a quadriplegic of himself elmer by default was chosen to soldier on as it happened hed found in his soul a taste for power and a talent for intrigue hed created a cabal of conservative democratic state legislators that had decapitated the democratic party machine and then had taken it over hed maneuvered that victory into a nomination for governor a little more than a year into his first term he looked good for a second henderson was also a northern catholic conservative democrat in his midforties nicelooking with an attractive wife and two handsome if slightly robotic children one of each gender who never smoked dope or rode skateboards or got tattooed or visibly pierced although a local talk show host had publicly alleged that hendersons eighteenyearold daughter had two clitorises that even if true could hardly be held against henderson if the party should choose a southern protestant liberal for president and needed some balance on the ticket well who knew what might happen henderson came in in a rush banging into rouxs office without knocking trailed by the odor of bay rum and his executive assistant who smelled like badly metabolized garlic they were an odd couple almost always together the slender aristocrat and his igor neil mitford mitford was short burly darkhaired badly dressed and constantly worried he looked like a bartender and in his college days had been a good one he had a nearphotographic memory for faces and names has custer county called yet henderson asked roux without preamble not yet were not officially in it roux said the governor turned to lucas this is what you were hired for fix this get up there let the regular bca guys do their thing let the sheriff do his thing but im going to lean on you all right lucas nodded yes just so that everybody is on the same page mitford said hed picked up a crystal paperweight from one of rose maries trophy shelves and was tossing it in the air like a baseball this is a murder not a lynching well challenge the word lynching as soon as anybody says it theyre going to say it roux said from behind her desk we know that henderson said but we need to kill it the use of the word not a lynching mitford repeated to lucas the sooner we can find anything that supports that view the better off well be any little shred get it through to me and ill spin it out to the tv folks gotta knock it down quick henderson said cant let it grow lucas nodded again i better take off he said the quicker we get up there go said henderson knock it down the word then the crime roux added ill call you in the air as soon as custer county calls in ill get the bca down here to coordinate you with the guys out of bemidji all right lucas said see ya and as lucas was going out the door henderson called after him great briefcase on his way to dhls house lucas called weather at the hospital was told that shed just gone down to the locker room he left a message with her secretary hed call with a motel number when he was on the ground del lived a mile east and north of lucas in a neighborhood of postwar ramblers and cottages all modified and remodified so many times that the area had taken on some of the charm of an english village del was waiting under the eaves of his garage wearing a parka and blue corduroy pants pulled down over nylonandplastic running shoes he had a duffel bag slung over his shoulder running shoes lucas asked as del climbed into the car got boots in the bag del grunted he hadnt bothered to shave but his breath was mintyfresh he was nuttough smaller than lucas streetweathered shifty a guy who could pass as a junkie or as homeless or almost anything else that didnt involve a white collar does weather know about this left a message how about cheryl lucas asked dels wife was a nurse yeah called her shes working the first shift i told her probably two or three days what happened interesting problem lucas said he outlined what he knew about the hangings as they headed to lucass house to pack a fuckin lynching and we gotta fix it for our own sakes along with everything else del said when lucas had finished not a lynching walks likes a lynching quacks like a lynching they sat silently for a moment watching the snow come down around a red light then could be a good time you know lucas changed clothes and packed in ten minutes stuffing underwear jeans a laptop and a cellphone charger into a black nylon bag he said goodbye to the housekeeper kissed the kid who was taking a nap and who with a beige blanket folded around him looked a little like a submarine sandwich and collected del whod called a cab the cab driver got lost for a while trying to find the entrance to the national guard site at minneapolisst paul international when they finally arrived the pilot and copilot who had become impatient briskly packedthem into the back of the chopper the flight was uncomfortable the old military chopper had been built for utility rather than comfort conversation was difficult so they gave it up even thinking was hard and eventually they huddled nylonandfleececlad lumps on the bad canvas seats closed up in the stink of hot oil and military creosote heads down fighting off incipient nausea after an eternity the chopper beat got deeper and they felt the beginning of a turn del unbuckled halfstood looked forward and then patted lucas on the shoulder and shouted there it is lucas pressed his forehead to the icy plastic window of the national guard helicopter and tried to look forward a thousand feet below the red river plains of northern minnesota stretched north and west toward canada and the dakotas though it was january and the temperature outside the chopper registered at six degrees below zero the ground below them was only dappled with snow the few roads resembled lines on a drafting pad dead straight across the paperflat farm scape to the southeast along the route theyd just flown the country had been rougher and the snow deeper dozens of frozenover lakes and ponds had been strung like rosary beads on the snowmobile trails jigsawpuzzle farm fields red barns and vertical streams of chimney smoke had given the land a homier personality straight east out of the helicopters right window was a wilderness of peat bog punctuated by the hairy texture of trash willow to the west they could just see a shadowy hint of the line of the red river rolling north toward winnipeg theyd overflown the hamlet of broderick in custer county and were now closing on a line of cop cars parked on what lucas had been told was west ditch road the roof racks were flashing on two of the cars to the north of them in one of the bigger patches of enow they could see a stand of leafless trees the copilot leaned into the passenger compartment and shouted over the beat of the blades were gonna put you down on the highway they dont want the rotor blast blowing dirt over the crime scene a state patrol car will come out to get you lucas gave him a thumbsup and the copilot pulled his head back into the cockpit del pulled off the nikes stuffed them in his duffel bag and began lacing up hightopped hiking boots lucas looked at his watch the flight to broderick had taken better than two hours minnesota was a tall state and custer county was about as far from st paul as it was possible to get without crossing into north dakota or canada now the pilot dropped the chopper in a circle to look at the highway where theyd land at the same time a state patrol car followed by a sheriffs car rolled down the side road and at the intersection blocked the main highway north and south better button up tight the copilot called back to them its gonna be chilly the chopper put down on the tarmac between the two cop cars and the copilot came back to slide the door lucas and del climbed out into the downdraft of the rotors the air was bitterly cold dirt and ice crystals scoured them like a sandblaster and unconsciously ducking away from the rotors they ran with their bags back to the state patrol car their pants plastered to their legs the icy air lashing their exposed skin the patrolman popped the back and passenger doors and as they climbed in the chopper took off in another cloud of ice crystals that really sucked the patrolman said as they settled in he was in his late forties with white eyebrows and graying hair his face as weathered as a barn board didnt even think about the goddamned prop wash or whatever it is he buckled up and looked back at del nodded then held out a hand to lucas and said ray zahn sorry to get you up so early lucas davenport thats del capslock in the back lucas said as they shook hands they havent taken the bodies out yet no theyve been waiting for the me couldnt find him for a while but hes on his way now zahn did a uturn and they bumped off the highway onto the gravel road and the sheriffs car fell in behind them you know the people the ones that got hanged del asked zahn got the car straight and caught up with lucass question yeah its a couple from down in broderick weve ided them as a jane warr and a deon cash they were living in an old farmhouse down there cash is black yup zahn grinned only black dude in the entire county and somebody went and hung him that could piss you off del ventured got that straight zahn said with a straight face our cultural diversity just went back to zero west ditch road was frozen solid but sometime during the winter thered been a thaw and a tractor had cut ruts in the thinly graveled surface as they bumped through the ruts now frozen as hard as basalt zahn pointed to a house across the ditch and said thats where the girls from what girl lucas asked he and del looked out the windows a thirtyfootwide drainage ditch ran parallel to the road and showed a steely streak of ice at the bottom a narrow twostory farmhouse its white paint gone gray and peeling sat on the other side of the ditch the house faced the highway but was a hundred feet back from it a rusting jeep cherokee squatted in the yard in front of the sagging porch zahn glanced over at him how much you know about this anything nothing lucas said they threw us on the chopper and thats about it okay zahn said to give it to you quick a girl named letty west lives in that house with her mother shes this little twerp he thought that over for a second then rubbed an eyebrow with the back of his left hand naw thats not right shes like a little annie oakley she wanders around with an old and a machete and a bunch of traps caught her driving her mothers jeep a couple of times got a mouth on her anyway last night she looked at her clock when she woke up and she says it was right after midnight she saw some car lights down the road here and wondered what was going on theres nothing down here and it was blowin like hell this morning about dawn she was walking her trap line along the ditch and went up on top to look at that grove of trees thats how she found them if she hadnt they might ve hung there until spring they were all looking out the windows at the girls house the place might have been abandoned but for a light glowing from a window at the front door and foot tracks that led on and off the porch to the jeep the yard hadnt been cut in recent years and clumps of dead yellow prairie grass stuck up through the thin snow a rusting swingset sat at the side of the house not square to anything as though itd been dumped there a single swing hung from the left side of the twoswing bar on the far back end of the property a fortiesera outhouse crumbled into the dirt lucas noticed a line of greenpaper christmas trees taped in an upstairs window how olds the girl del asked eleven or twelve i guess whats the machete for lucas asked something to do with the trapping zahn said she down at the scene or they took her into town with her mother to make a statement lucas asked whod know about this road have to be local you think zahn shrugged maybe but i think its probably the first road the killer came to that led off the highway outside of broderick first place he could do his business with a little peace and quiet must have scouted it though lucas said the road was only slightly wider than the patrol car with no shoulder on the left and on the right six feet of frozen dirt and then an abrupt slope into the ditch that ditch would be dangerous as hell howd he turn around there are some tracks youll see them up ahead whats left of them anyway he just jockeyed her around and got straight but youre right he mustve scouted it if this kid could see him whyd he think he was out of sight del asked we had a good wind through here last night a nice little ground blizzard zahn said from the grove of trees on the ground he might not be able to see the farmhouse but from up on the second floor of the farmhouse you could see his lights down in the grove anyway letty said she could and theres no reason to think she was lying she never turned her room light on mmm lucas nodded hed once been in a ground blizzard where he couldnt see more than three feet in any direction but if he looked straight up he could see a fine blue sky with puffy white fairweather clouds so the victims lived back in broderick yeah down there in another old farmhouse thats how we identified them so quick took one look and knew who the guy was him being black how long did he live here year and a half he was in jail down in kansas city showed up here in july a year ago and moved in with warr warr was working at the casino in armstrong dealing blackjack we just found out about the jail thing this morning the warr woman she was from here del asked nope she was from kansas city herself zahn said got into broderick about a month before cash so we think she mustve been his girlfriend and came up here when he was about to get out of jail to nail down the job but to tell you the truth we dont really know the details yet okay what about broderick del asked anything there what do they do farmers well it was mostly a ghost town until gene calb got his truck rehab business going there was always a gas station and a store and a bar off and on servicing the local farm folks just a crossroads then some people moved up here to be close to work at calbs houses are really cheap and now there must be twenty or thirty people around the place so what the hell was an interracial couple from kansas city doing there lucas asked that seems to be a question zahn agreed theyd come up on the line of cop cars which were parked on both sides of the narrow lane a halfdozen cops were standing around backs to the wind ducking their heads briefly to see who zahn was bringing in zahn threaded between them slowed pointed to a tall whitehaired man in sunglasses a camo hunting jacket and nylon wind pants who stood with his hands in his pockets talking to two other men zahn said thats the sheriff dick anderson ill let you out here im gonna find someplace to get turned around i get claustrophobic when im pointed the wrong way lucas and del climbed out and the sheriff and the two men he was talking to looked down at them and the sheriff said something to the other two and they both smiled del who was coming up behind lucas muttered were city slickers for a while anyway lucas agreed he smiled as he came up to the sheriff lucass blue eyes were happy enough but his smile sometimes made people nervous sheriff anderson lucas davenport and del capslock with the bca we understand youve got a situation if thats what youd call it the sheriff said the sheriff was about forty lucas thought with a pale pinkish complexion he ran to fat like a clerk but wasnt fat yet his hands stayed in his pockets a statement of some kind lucas thought anderson nodded to the two men with him these are deputies braun and schnurr we understood that hank dickerson was coming up from bemidji with a crime scene crew lucas nodded still smiling yes they should be here anytime del and i were sent by the governor to make sure everything was handled right the governor knows about this anderson asked doubtfully yes i talked to him this morning before i left he said to say hello and that he hoped we could get this cleared away in a hurry maybe i should give him a call anderson suggested im sure hed be happy to hear from you lucas said he looked around where are the victims anderson turned toward the stand of trees north of the road took a hand out of his jacket pocket and pointed back in there where the guys in the orange hats are lucas said to del lets go take a look are you running this or hank anderson asked both of us in a way lucas said i report directly to the commissioner of public safety and to the governor hank reports up through the bca chain of command so what exactly do you do deputy schnurr asked handle the politics or what i kick peoples asses lucas said his eyes flicked over schnurr and the other deputy then went back to the sheriff when they n ed to be kicked he and del both stepped away at the same time toward the men in the orange caps the sheriff and his two deputies hesitated and del and lucas got a few steps away and del said that was cool hey the guy didnt even shake hands yeah they pushed through a tangle of brush and caught a glimpse of the bodies hanging from the ropes passed a few more trees and then saw them fully in the clear lucas focused on them got careless pushed back a springy branch and got snapped in the face by a twig his cheek stinging he said careful to del and went back to staring at the bodies they looked like paintings he thought or maybe an old fading color photo from the s two gray stretchedout bodies dangling from a tree half facing each other ropes cutting into their necks with four white men not looking at them desperately not looking at them as they came up del asked quietly you ever noticed how hanged people sort of all look alike like they lose their race or something they all look like theyre made out of clay lucas nodded he had noticed that except redheads he added they always look like they came from a different planet del said youre right except for redheads they just get paler the four orangehatted men were spaced around the bodies at the cardinal points as though they might be rushed from any direction a short stepladder was set up beside the bodies and the snow had been thoroughly trampled down for fifty feet around two of the men were doing the coldweather tap dance a slow shuffle that said they were freezing when lucas and del came up one of the orangehats turned and asked whore you bca lucas said whore you dave payton the man turned back to the bodies and shivered ddeputy sheriff whatre you doing del asked kkeeping everybody out of a circle around the bodies you guys are supposed to have a crime crew coming you dont look like them theyll be a bit lucas said his voice had turned friendly you get here early i was the first car in after the state patrol ass is freezin solid wheres the line they were brought in on tracks or anything payton jerked his arm toward the road back that way i guess pretty trampled down now lucas looked and could see the kind of snaky break in the brush that often meant a game trail if the bodies had been brought in along it then the hangman had known exactly where he was going del had taken a couple steps closer to the dangling bodies womans got blood on her face he said gguys pretty messed up too payton said looks like somebody beat the heck out of him before he did this i dont think its her blood del said some of its off to the side and on her upper lip and nose well get the lab to check lucas said thatd be a break if its the killers payton said ddddna we did a dna in a rape last year catch the guy nnno payton said lucas said look why dont you go sit in a car for a while and get warmed up for christs sakes youre shaking like a leaf cause andersond have a cow payton said were taking over the crime scene lucas said the bca is im ordering you to leave okay he looked at the other guys who were watching him some hope in their eyes all of you get some place warm get some coffee payton bobbed his head said aye aye capn the four men hurried in a wide circle around the hanging bodies another of them muttered thanks and then they all scuttled off through the naked trees toward the cars anderson could be a problem del said conversationally when the deputies were out of earshot he and lucas were still looking at the dead people the ghastly fact was that cash and warr hung only a few inches off the ground and neither one had been tall lucas and del were looking almost straight into their dead halfopen eyes at their purplish faces and the two bodies swayed together as though dancing on the same floor where the two cops were standing he doesnt know what hes doing del continued half the goddamn crime scene is stuck to the bottoms of the deputies boots then he left them out here to freeze yeah lucas decided that they were gawking at the bodies were gawking he said i know del said looking at warr how many dead people we seen in our lives you think a thousand maybe not a thousand lucas said still looking i dont dream about any of them except maybe one burned guy i saw all black and crispy but still alive died while we were waiting for the ambulance and a little kid who drowned in a creek she was my first one right after i went on patrol i remember my first kid everybody does del said he did the coldweather tap dance and blew some steam im gonna remember this one for a while theyre on display lucas said after a while you think it could be a biker thing bikers do this kind of shit sometimes ive never seen it del said doubtfully a gust of wind came through and both of the bodies slowly rotated toward them neither have i but ive read about it lucas said read about it or seen it in the movies maybe the movies lucas admitted the thing is the guy who did this wanted everybody to freak out this isnt just a murder this is something else the guy was making a point no clothes around del said mustve pulled the clothes off somewhere else or took them with him somewhere else this was all planned lucas said the killer wasnt struggling around in the dark pulling their clothes off he didnt have to look for this place off the top of his head he knew what he was going to do he worked it all out ahead of time they were talking about the line the killer took through the trees and the angle down to the kids house and the distance from the town and more about the display of the bodies when they heard people coming in anderson was pushing through the brush with braun and schnurr followed by three more men in bulky uniform parkas and insulated pants must be the guys from bemidji del said they were dickerson a tall man in a tan parka with strawcolored hair and goldrimmed glasses introduced himself and the other two agents barin and woods all of them gawked at the bodies as they talked the crime scene and special operations guys are about five minutes behind us dickerson said the mes out on the road right now the special ops guysll get it on film and well process the scene then well get those folks out of the trees we need a careful sweep lucas said i mean like crazy careful pretty screwed up already dickerson said then he secondthought himself with the sheriff right there and diplomatically added were getting set up now were bringing in a propane heater and after we get finished crawling the place well melt out the snow and make sure nothing was trampled down into it excellent you and i ought to go off somewhere and decide whos going to do what again a bureaucratic wariness del and i dont have anything to do with crime scene stuff lucas said thats all yours but make sure the me takes a close look at the womans mouth that blood on her face looks likes it might not be hers well want a dna on it and well want her mouth cleaned out sure otherwise we can chat if you want but basically del and i just go around and talk to people lucas said your guys should do the same thing interview whoever you want duplicate us no problem so were not one investigation dickerson looked skeptical nope lucas shook his head del and i have done this a lot in minneapolis we find its handy with the hard ones to have two investigations running side by side if you can do it without a lot of infighting you get different ideas going dickerson shrugged its all right with me these two guys he turned a thumb to barin and woods will be doing all the work im going to get us set up hang around today and maybe tomorrow and then ill be on call down in bemidji i understand the governors taken an interest lucas said he has hes worried about the image two people hanged naked the mans black got a pretty good dick on him too said schnurr the sheriffs deputy lucas turned on him his teeth showing shut the fuck up honest to christ if i hear anybody talking like that ill personally slap the shit out of him didnt mean nothin schnurr said he shuffled his feet like a child whod been bad in class but he had mean eyes if a reporter heard that or even heard youd said it sheriffs deputies making cracks like that wed have twice as much trouble as we do now so keep your fuckin mouth shut lucas finished to anderson i dont know how much you like your job but your whole goddamn county is about to get smeared in the national media do you understand that i dont know anderson said uncertainly believe me its gonna happen and one asshole making comments like this guy it could mean that you dont only lose your job but you gotta move to arizona and change your name anderson glanced nervously at schnurr and said well keep a lid on it dickerson was peering up at the bodies embarrassed lucas thought to be from the same agency as lucas you better lucas snarled he looked again at schnurr nailing him in place then asked anderson the little girl who found the bodies is she in town giving a statement anderson said wed appreciate it if youd have somebody call in tell them to keep her there until del and i have a chance to talk to her anderson nodded lucas said to dickerson good luck you guys got it we got it dickerson said need to get to that little girl lucas said as they walked back out to the line of cars if the sheriffs crew is as bad as it looks we need to talk to her before somebody fucks her up gotta get some wheels del said get them at a car dealer probably if we get there fast lucas said tomorrow morning you wont be able to rent a car anywhere north of fargo zahn oughta know zahn did know holmes motors in armstrong he said fix you right up how many do you want two as they bounced slowly down the dirt road past the girls house to the highway zahn fumbled out a cell phone pushed a speeddial button and said this is ray zahn let me talk to carl and a moment later hey i gotta couple of cops in town from st paul they need two cars good shape uhhuh he turned to lucas what kind of credit card american express or visa whatever they take lucas said american express or visa yeah yeah ten minutes yeah see you then he hung up all fixed he said one of you gets a loaded threeyearold oldsmobile the other one gets a sixyearold fiveliter mustang ill take the one with the best heater del said we need to get over to the sheriffs department quick as we can lucas said is that the courthouse law enforcement center zahn said three years old stateoftheart behind the courthouse and right across the street from holmes car lot the leg is the reason dick andersons the sheriff he built it lucas asked no the last sheriff did bobby carter zahn said he grinned at lucas and pumped his eyebrows dont tell anybody i said so bobbys a friend of mine but he got a little too close to the construction process nobody went to jail but people around here figure that a good chunk of money stuck to his fingers hes back to farming what was anderson not a deputy he was a lawyer private practice real estate mostly he worked with the county attorney sometimes when bobby got into trouble and figured he better get out he put up one of his good old boys to run that pissed people off anderson jumped in at the last minute and got elected a political wizard huh del said zahn smiled into his steering wheel as they bumped over the last set of ruts onto the highway and turned south toward broderick and armstrong never heard anybody use the word wizard around him he said hes pretty much wholly owned by barry wilson whos the head of the county commission thats okay most of the time doesnt work too well when theres an actual crime or something the town of broderick was a few hundred yards down the highway and zahn took them through it at a crawl the town was built along two streets that intersected the highway at right angles a big foursquare farmhouse sat on the north edge of town on the west side of the highway a sheriffs car sat in the driveway in front of the garage and zahn said thats the victims place okay it looked like a rural murder scene on a cnn report a lonely white farmhouse surrounded by snow with a cop car in the yard farther south still on the west side of the highway they passed wolfs cafe which looked like a shinglesided rambler the night owl club and a building with a wooden cross fixed above the door and a bare spot where a sign had been pulled down that used to be the holy spirit pentecostal church holy rollers zahn said they eventually rolled out of town now a bunch of women work there like religious women dogooders i guess some catholics and some lutheran women from lutheran social services and i heard one of thems a quaker one of the catholics is a looker the other ones are the bluetights kind scattered among the buildings were a halfdozen small houses a couple of trailer homes a corrugatedsteel corn silo with a coneshaped roof and a red barn the east side of the highway was sparser a handy mart gas station and convenience store calbs body shop tow in a long yellow metal sided pole barn genes an overtheroad truck rehab place and two more houses thats it thats it thats the town zahn said as they rolled out into the countryside del asked whats all the truck places the body shops isnt that pretty heavy industry for a place like this naw i dont know would you drive your car nine miles to get it fixed were nine miles from armstrong i guess i would del admitted actually i know i would cause i have and it was an inheritance deal gene inherited the body shop from his old man and then he added the truck rehab business truck rehab you can do anywhere he does pretty good hes why the town started coming back most everybody who lives here works for him not a bad guy a long way out del said some people like it lonely zahn said some people dont then they were out of town out in the countryside a crow or a raven was flying south parallel to the highway a fluttering black speck against the overcast sky the only thing besides themselves that was moving del said jesus christ its flat they rode in silence for a couple of minutes then zahn started a low unconscious whistling lucas recognized the tune probably from an elevator somewhere whats that song youre whistling didnt realize i was whistling zahn said he thought a minute its that thing from phantom of the opera thats right after a second you dont seem to be too upset you know by the bodies well youre with the patrol you learn not to be a pussy like a homicide cop or something zahn said all right pussy del drawled from the back seat zahn glanced over the seat and said every time i go out to an accident and there are a couple of high school kids bleeding to death right in front of my face and screaming for their dad or their mom i know them theyre kids from down the street you do that for a few years and a couple strangers up in a tree wont bother you much unlike some homicide pussies katina lewis got out of bed at one minute to ten oclock in the morning the goose bumps like oranges in the chilly morning air she padded barefoot across the cold wooden floor into the bathroom she was a round woman who no longer fought the roundness thirtysix years old five years divorced with her dark brown hair she was a rarity in this corner of the country where it seemed everybody was blond or towheaded she had good english skin from her father a short nose and a bow lip from her german mother and she had her hopes and her religion she desperately hoped for children though she felt the time running out she prayed to the lord to help her and had faith more than faith she had fine discriminating morals she could run drugs for god knowing that she was on a mission of love knowing that god was love katina lewis wasnt silly about love didnt walk around with a moony glow on her face and she could get as cranky as the next woman she simply thought of love as something real and tangible and everyday like crackers or soap that she simply hadnt been able to acquire but if you looked for love long enough she believed if you kept the idea in your heart if you had faith you would surely find it god would not keep it from you now shed found it in this unlikely place this bleak gray flat prairie as she headed for the bathroom she glanced back at the bed and the top of loren singletons towhead she loved him she thought hed make a good father if he let himself go if he loosened up but she wouldnt want him to loosen up too much she loved that cowboy thing that sandpaper jaw in the morning those bittenoff words the stoicism that rode on his face she loved the look of him lounging with a shoulder against a wall feet crossed showing his boots a marlboro hanging from the corner of his mouth shed begun to talk to him about it shed talk more maybe today or someday soon time passed that was one thing shed learned in her twenties and in her first marriage time passed and was gone and you couldnt get it back lewis had set her alarm clock for ten in her urgency to make it to the bathroom shed forgotten about it at ten oclock exactly the hourly livestock report trickled out of the twoinch speaker five feet from loren singletons ear quietly as though a strange man had stolen into his house to whisper in his ear slaughter steers choice two to three to pounds sixtyone dollars to sixtytwo seventyfive select and choice two to three to pounds sixtyone to sixtyone ten the voice took a minute to penetrate and then singleton stirred squeezed his pillow around and cocked an eye at the clock and the man y said thats the south st paul stockyard report ed wein will have updates through the day right here on your feedercattle central now from our news bureau we have a report here from broderick minnesota where two people have been found hanged in a grove of trees just north of broderick the first reports said that two people a black man and a white woman were found hanging the words were so flat and so unbelievable that they took a few seconds to connect when they did singletons head popped up what lewis called from the bathroom did you say something shut up he shouted back the man on the radio said anderson confirmed that two people were dead but deferred further comment until the medical examiner could reach the scene we will follow this story during the day so keep your dial set here to north dakotas allnews central the voice was both tinny and tiny singleton rolled across the bed grabbed the clock tried to find the volume control heard the weatherman come up and say you never know what lifes gonna bring dick and then his voice was lost in the noise of the flushing toilet lewis came out of the bathroom pulling her cotton nightgown down over her hips her heavy legs jiggling at him she was annoyed she didnt like being shouted at being told to shut up she opened her mouth to say so when singleton still staring at the radio said did you hear that i heard you shouting at me she said letting a little of the annoyance seep into her voice somebody killed deon and jane singleton blurted the irritability vanished what gotta call he said over his shoulder he added they were found hanged in a tree he trotted naked out of the bedroom and down the hall nothing bounced or hobbled when he moved he was solid lewis looked at the radio which was now firmly into the weather more glooiruthat was the essence of it cold and gray and maybe if we were unlucky a lot of snow followed by more cold and gray jane and deon she called after him what did the radio say what did they mean hanged then she heard him talking on the phone and turned around like a dog in its bed looking for her jeans couldnt find them and heard the phone clatter back on the hook a moment later singleton came back deon and jane were found hanging in a tree across the nine mile ditch that letty kid found them this morning about two minutes after i went off duty they were naked and dead somebody beat the shit out of them before they were hanged no she was astonished but not distraught yup people are coming in from all over state police are flying in from st paul they might already be here ray zahns going up to meet them take them around he had a few more details but not much ive got to go lewis said she turned her back stepped toward the bathroom and he said you smell like vanilla and she said absently that perfume i wonder if your mom knows anything dont know katina hadnt known cash or warr very well and hadnt liked either one but their deaths could create problems ive got to get down to the church we had some sisters getting ready to make a run i better call ruth right now she disappeared halfdressed down the hallway and singleton stood there puzzling over it staring at the very expensive cowboy boots that sat at the end of his bed deon and jane lewis came thundering back she already heard five minutes ago i gotta get down there whatre you doing cowboy i dont know still gotta get some sleep then maybe see whats going on singleton sat down on the edge of the bed and ran his hands through his hair worried what the hell had happened hanged he couldnt get past that part maybe he should go look but too much curiosity who exactly knew that hed spent time with jane and deon katina knew some of it of course calb knew some of it knew that hed been at their house a few times maybe some of the other body shop people the shop was just down the highway and they may have seen him turning in deons driveway but hed taken a little care not to be seen when he was there hed always parked on the slab beside the garage where you really couldnt see the car that hadnt been a matter of foreboding but just common sense now the commonsense care might pay off w h at r e you doing cowboy lewis had asked loren singleton was a cowboy though without a horse or a ranch he wanted to like horses but horses always tried to bite him sooner or later and hed quit trying to ride besides cadillacs were even better old overthetop seventies and eighties cadillacs which for a cowboy was close enough in his own mind singleton was a cowboy and an artist with automotive lacquer and only in a secondary unimportant way a sheriffs deputy and a lookout for a band of car thieves he knew though that something was missing in his life he felt that all the details were there but not the color he felt like a blackandwhite photograph only when he met katina did a little color begin to bleed into his life in other peoples minds loren singleton was when they thought of him at all a loner a familiar outsider a man always standing on the edges a few women had tried to talk with him he wasnt bad looking and the cowboy clothes seemed to give him some kind of personality but theyd found him unresponsive emotionally stunted as a deputy he had a reputation for casual brutality that seemed to go with his essential coldness even his cars his caddys tended to cold brilliant colors that could set your teeth on edge everybody nodded to him on the street almost nobody spoke to him then katina lewis had arrived to work with the nuns singleton wasnt sure that hed ever loved anyone before he met lewis he thought about it sometimes he probably loved lewis he thought there was no other explanation for the way he felt when he was around her but did he love his mother had he ever she was the only other possibility for love in his life and everyone was supposed to love his mother people got mom tattooed on their arms people ate at places called moms because mom would never hurt you would always have that extra piece of pie for her little boy but singletons mom had whacked the shit out of him for years had beat him up so badly when he was six months old that an uncle had taken him to the hospital told the doctor that hed crawled out of his playpen and had fallen down the stairs his father edgar singleton had died in a livesteam accident at the chip board plant when loren was two years old singleton had heard his mother telling stories with some relish about poached eg how his father had been poached from the neck down when a steam line broke in a processing tank and how he lay in the hospital burned over percent of his body waiting to die without pain but also without a mind hed rambled on for seven days about haying on the old farm then hed died when eg was gone mom began dressing singleton in girls clothes shed wanted a girl girls were more manageable she did her damnedest to make singleton into one would have done better if the nosy old school principal hadnt gotten a restraining order against her requiring her to dress her kindergartener in genderappropriate clothing singleton vaguely remembered all of that after the court order she still made him put on a dress occasionally and serve tea at one of her ladies poker parties that ended when he was eleven big for his age shed ordered him into a dress and hed refused shed begun to hit him with a broomstick that shed used to beat him in the past and hed fled into the winter darkness when he came back she was in the bathtub hed gone into the bathroom and shed screamed at him and tried to cover her nakedness but he didnt care about that he a big tough abused elevenyearold had grabbed her hair and shoved her head under water shed thrashed and fought and clawed at him but hed held her under until she quit struggling then he held her under for another fifteen seconds when he finally let her up she lay back against the end of the tub apparently without breath then she breathed in a small breath and then another one in five minutes still weak she tried to climb out of the tub singleton heard her came back in shoved her head under water again until she passed out a second time the second time she revived she was quiet about it crept over the edge of the tub and crawled to the bathroom door and managed to get it locked she lay there naked until the next morning when she heard him whistling out the door on his way to school when he came home that night he found shed locked him out he kicked the back door until the lock broke found her crouched inside with a baseball bat he pointed a finger at her the elevenyearold did and said dont fuck with me anymore they spent their next seven years together with the bedroom doors locked at night after he graduated from high school singleton had enlisted in the air force had been trained for the air police and had been sent to eielson air force base outside of fairbanks alaska all he could remember of the place were the clouds and the cold better than two hundred days of cloudy skies every year bonechilling for seven months cold for another three mosquitoes for the final two just like home out of the air force he worked in east grand forks for a while moving lumber around a home improvement warehouse then heard about a deputy sheriffs job in custer county his ap background got him in but he didnt try very hard at anything and after two years was assigned to permanent sundaythroughthursday night shift if hed take it he could stay the sheriff said otherwise it was the highway he took it there was almost nothing to do at night in custer in twelve years thered been three house fires that started on his shift and maybe once a month hed get a medical emergency which only required that he show up hed stop a few speeders on country roads jail a few drunks break up the occasional barroom fight with his casual brutality given his work hours he didnt have a social life he followed no sports teams didnt hunt or fish or ride atvs or snowmobiles didnt garden or read or pay attention to music or go to movies didnt even watch much tv his only real interest were the old cadillacs hed get one in his garage do the mechanical work that would bring it back to life and then lovingly and carefully strip it down to bare metal after months of preparation hed move it to gene calbs autobody shop where he rented the equipment to do the paint he changed cars every year or so driving one while he rehabbed a second one his current ride was an eldorado biarritz with a custom rolls royce grille the finish was a handpolished flameorange flake over a deep mocha base that was it other than the caddys it was all about taking numbers passing the years then four years earlier gene calb had offered to expand their relationship an expansion that would give singleton free working space for his cars and a thousand dollars a week with an upfront payment of ten thousand dollars ten thousand down and a thousand dollars cash money no taxes every friday all he had to do was keep an eye out the money had changed everything for one thing his mother had begun to take an interest in him then one night up at the casino hed introduced her to deon cash and jane warr and then katina had shown up singleton heard katina coming out of the shower heard her clumping around getting into her pants and shoes she came out of the bathroom like a rocket kissed him quick once on the mouth once on the penis gave him a quick suck and then said wallys gonna have to wait cmon thirty seconds he said fifteen seconds she sucked on wally for fifteen seconds and then hurried away laughing and was gone singleton and katina lewis had fallen in bed a couple of months after they met which was at calbs katina came in with her sister ruth who was showing her around before katina made her first run across the border ruth didnt care for singleton but katina was immediately attracted their daddy liked to work on old cars she told singleton later ruth didnt care about that she was closer to her mother and to jesus t katina saw a relationship with singleton shed already mentioned love that she might be falling into it with him shed told him over dinner at the bird and then peered over the little red votive candle on the table singleton had felt something blossoming within him as he looked across the table at the woman after all this time a woman really cared for him somebody who would hang out with him and cook and make babies how did that happen hed reached across the table and had taken her hand tears rolled down his face and she said something like its okay later feeling a little unmanly about the whole thing about the tears hed started to apologize for himself and shed laughed and squeezed him and said loren you did just perfect just perfect somehow he thought he had singleton had worked until seven that morning and had come home to find katina in his bed hed crawled in with her though he hadnt been too tired now at ten oclock he was sleepy he closed his eyes and tried to go back to sleep deon and jane he thought hanged fear tickled through his chest he tried to shut it out flopped this way and that wrestling with his pillow maybe somebody was coming for him he thought a hangman katina didnt know anything about that ruth and katina lewis stepped inside the body shops overheated office took off their mittens and ruth pulled the door shut behind her gene calb was working behind his desk he was a balding heavyset man in his midforties with a weathered face and thick scarred mechanics hands a pair of reading glasses perched on his thick nose he looked over the glasses and said guys you musta heard a little while ago in town ruth said jane and deon but people said they were hanged ruth stuffed her mittens in her coat pocket and unzipped the parka ruth lewis felt like her sister but didnt look like her she was a slender woman where katina was round and she had flinty green eyes behind steelcolored wirerimmed glasses while katinas eyes were softer paler ruths hair was closecropped an ascetics do katina wore her hair full ruths cheeks were rosy from the cold like her sisters but unlike katina she wore no lipstick or jewelry a pretty woman determined to do nothing with her looks ruth was the older sister and the boss katina the subordinate calb said hung in a grove off the ditch road that letty kid found them this morning he looked at the clock it was just it seemed like the morning had stretched on forever since hed heard the news at ten so what are we doing katina asked she always reminded calb of a clucking hen a busy mildly overweight woman but with a sensuous underlip she was supposedly a member of some catholic religious group but apparently one that didnt have anything against sex katina had been sleeping with loren singleton and singleton was looking as happy as he ever did if a little peaked do we do anything im closing down calb said for the time being until we find out whats going on thats not acceptable ruth said i a car went by on the highway and ruth and katina and calb all turned their heads that way you always looked at a car on the highway in broderick a highway patrol car with extra passengers ray zahn ruth said loren told me that a couple of big shots flew in from st paul and zahns driving them around katina said calb shook his head ill tell you what guys theyre gonna hook deon up with me and i dont know what im going to tell them tell them as much of the truth as you can ruth suggested that you hired deon to drive for you on the recommendation of an old army buddy in kansas city that you rehab trucks from all over the midwest and that he picks them up thats not exactly he does that ruth interrupted you could give references yeah hes done that calb said what about you guys we cant stop ruth said her chin was set tough square we need to keep working im sorry but we gotta stop until we find out whats going on calb objected this may be coming out of kansas city if thats what it is maybe we can give some stuff to the cops and they can settle it but before then ray we cant ruth said urgently we havent made enough runs lately the ontario net just came backup since jeanette died i cant help that calb said i talked to sister mary ann yesterday when she came in she seemed pretty happy she did fine but the mix wasnt that good we cant stop ruth said hey im shipping a load of junkers out right now george is on his way in with his truck and were getting them the fuck outa excuse the language im sorry he was genuinely worried that they might be offended ruth had once been a nun i dont care about the language ruth said she switched a smile on and then off all i care about is that we keep working and we wont stop if we have to pile up the junkers on your doorstep thats what well do ah jesus christ on a crutch calb said forgetting himself again the deal was complicated but profitable for everyone a man named shawn davis from kansas city missouri working with old drugdealing friends in st louis des moines and omaha would spot and steal latemodel toyota land cruisers runners and tacoma pickups no nissans no fords no chevys nothing but toyotas that kept parts and paint supply simple the stolen vehicles would be driven individually from daviss place in kansas city to calbs body shop in broderick calb had been in the army with davis and theyd done some chickenshit black market stuff in turkey selling us government meat they trusted each other to a point the stolen cars were driven north by deon cash who was daviss cousin or joe kelly a friend of cashs as cash or kelly was driving north one of a group of religious women as a group they were called the nuns by the custer county people and some of them were would pick up a latemodel but highmileage lastlegs toyota in canada usually from a dealer auction the nun would nurse the wreck across the border into minnesota and deliver it to the body shop in the shop the stolen car would be repainted to match the beater some of the parts and trim the dashboard graphics indicating kilometers per hour instead of miles the id numbers and papers of the highmileage toyota would be transferred to the lowmileage machine a nun would then drive the truck back across the border where it would be resold the remnants of the beater would be shipped to a junkyard where it would be crushed into a cube and sent to a smelter the money was great a battered bustedup two or threeyearold toyota land cruiser often owned by the kind of longdistance salesman whod put fifty thousand rough miles a year on his car would be purchased at a usedcar auction for a few thousand dollars canadian three weeks later it would turn up on a working ranch in saskatchewan or alberta in nearnew condition with all the right papers the buyer would pay the equivalent of american for a machine after all the work was done and the employees paid and the investment in the vanishing truck was accounted for calb and shawn davis would split on each toyota sale give or take two trucks a week added up to a quartermillion taxfree dollars a year each hiding the cash was almost as much trouble as making it but they found ways there were a few flies in the ointment the nuns made everybody nervous they werent paid anything which meant that davis and calb didnt have a good hold on them the women were using the trucks and the body shops expertise to smuggle drugs south across the border although they had no economic hold on the women calb believed that they were safe the women were he thought the next thing to fanatics nice fanatics like ruth lewis but they would go to prison before they talked about the deal another fly was deon cash and his old lady jane warr cash wasnt quite right shawn davis had given him a job reluctantly paid him per delivery because he was a cousin and because he had shown in jail that he could keep his mouth shut but cash was a bad man and worse he was stupid a third fly and lately a big juicy one was cashs friend joe kelly kelly stayed with cash and warr between runs then a month earlier hed disappeared nobody knew where everybody wanted to know calb had begun to suspect that kelly had made a move on jane warr and that cash had buried him out in the woods now this calb wasnt listening to ruth lewiss appeal he was staring past her out into the shop thinking about the whole mess and calculating he had to have something going out there when the cops arrived maybe he could haul one of his own trucks in tear it down start repainting it the place couldnt be empty with a bunch of guys sitting around staring at the walls gene gene calb looked back at ruth sorry i was thinking about getting something going out in the shop before the cops get here it looks weird being empty give us the cash to buy a truck ruth said one truck listen guys weve got to figure out whats going on here you have to figure it out too i mean youre doing the driving i thought maybe joe kelly just took off but there was no sign he was going and deon said all his clothes are still hanging in his closet you think joes dead too katina asked well where is he calb asked nobody in kansas city has heard from him theres an auction saturday morning in edmundston thats got the perfect truck ruth said three years old two hundred and fifty thousand kilometers runs good enough to get across i gotta talk to my kansas city guy gene weve got to do this ruth said urgently weve got a load waiting were desperate let me talk to my guy he looked around the office you know if this doesnt get settled quick we might have to start worrying about where we talk what we say you could always come over to the church to talk katina said i dont think theyd have the guts to bug the church maybe calb looked out the window i wonder what happened i heard they were just hanging there like icicles all messed up jane warr she was not a nice woman deon was worse katina said she turned to ruth the witch used to hang around with jane i hope shes not involved with this somehow ask loren ruth suggested i will but jane and deon may god have mercy on their souls said ruth and she crossed herself armstrong the county seat came over the horizon as a hundredfoottall yellow concrete chimney with a plume of steam hanging over the prairie then as a couple of radio towers with red blinking lights then as a row of corrugated steelsided grain elevators along a double set of railroad tracks they followed the tracks past the elevators past a few brokendown shacks on what had once been the bad side of town into a quiet neighborhood of aging cape cod houses all painted either white or a dirty pastel pink or blue over a bridge labeled cross river and into the business district whats that smell del asked as they came into town zahn looked at him what smell paper plant or chip board plant lucas said chipboard zahn said i dont smell it anymore jesus it smells like somebodys roasting a wet chicken with the feathers on del said aint that bad said zahn yes it is del said the downtown was a flat grid mostly brick yellow and red with meter less curbs along blacktopped streets three or four stoplights lucas could see both a motel and a best western conoco and bp stations on opposite corners with competing convenience stores a frans diner followed by a frans bakery followed by a frans rapid oil change a mcdonalds on one corner and a pizza hut halfway down the block a sports bar called the dugout at the heart of the town was a scratchy piece of brown grass patched with gray snow with a twostory fiftiesish redbrick courthouse in the middle of it a newer redbrick law enforcement center hung on to the back of the courthouse with a fire station even farther back three cops and a couple of firefighters were outside in the cold leaning against the walls of their buildings smoking holmes motors was across the street from the leg in a metal building with a single plateglass window looking out at a dozen used american cars red white and blue plastic pennants hung down from a wire stretched above the lot there was just enough wind to keep them nervously twitching zahn pulled into the lot and through the window they could see a man poking numbers into a desk calculator thats carl zahn said carl holme was broad and baldheaded with a cheerful smile heard about the negro getting hung he said to zahn when they pushed through the door thats gonna dust things up huh id raise your prices before the tv people get here zahn said really you think five minutes after they walked in they walked back out into the cold lucas took the olds and del cranked up the mustang and they trundled behind zahn a threecar caravan sixty feet across the street to the law enforcement center the smoking cops said hello to zahn looked with flat curiosity at lucas and del zahn took them inside was buzzed through a bulletproofglass door to a reception area where he introduced them to zelda holme the car dealers wife a pretty roundfaced woman who was also secretary to the sheriff sheriff anderson called and said you wanted to talk to letty weve got her back in the lounge holme said smiling and friendly come right along im gonna take off zahn said to lucas lifting a hand youve got my number call if you need anything see you later lucas said thanks he and del fell in behind holme and as they followed her along a creampainted concreteblock hallway lucas mentioned that theyd just rented cars from her husband i hope you counted your fingers after you shook hands with him she said cheerfully carl can be a sharp one the lounge was the last door on the right a pale yellow concrete cubicle with office max waitingroom chairs vending machines and a slender girl in jeans who had her face in an outdoor life magazine letty dear holme said youve got visitors letty west turned her head and took them in she was blond her hair pulled back tight in a short ponytail she had warm blue eyes that lucas thought for an instant he recognized from somewhere else some other time and an almost oval face but with a squared jaw and freckles she wore jeans and a blue sweatshirt and dirtcolored gym shoes that had once been white nylon a coke can sat on an end table at her right hand she might have been a female huckleberry finn except for a cast of sadness about her eyes a pietalike sadness strange for a girl so young lucas had seen it before usually in a woman whod lost a child a goodlooking kid lucas thought except for the weathering her face and hands were rough and if you hadnt been able to see her preteen figure you might have thought she was a twentyyearold farmers daughter with too much time hoeing beans these gentlemen are here to see you from st paul holme said she was stooping over like older women did when they approached younger children her voice too kindly cops letty asked state policemen from st paul holme said cops letty said lucas looked at the kid and said hi and then to holme we can take it from here okay she said holme looked once at del as though he might be carrying a flea and went back out the door lucas had the impression that she might have stopped just outside so he said to del did i see a water fountain in the hallway let me check del said smiling he stuck his head out looked both ways and then said nope nothing there more quietly shes going the lounge had two candy machines and two soda machines one coke one pepsi and smelled like floor wax and spilled coffee with a hint of flatulence lucas asked the girl you want another coke this one wasnt mine she said indicating the coke with her elbow well you want a first one then if youre buying she said he had to smile something about her deadseriousness made him smile and he got a diet coke for himself tossed a can of sugared coke to del and she said ill take a pepsi if thats okay thats fine he slipped a dollar into the machine and pushed the pepsi button wheres your mother del asked as he popped the top on his coke probably down at the duck inn letty said we figured i could handle this on my own yeah dels eyebrows went up she gets a little out of control sometimes letty said lucas asked shes still your mother we could call her not much point letty said shes probably pretty drunk by now shes been at it since ten oclock she drinks a little huh del asked del had dropped onto a couch next to the door letty took a delicate sip of her pepsi and then said no she drinks a lot almost all the time wheres your father she shrugged who knows last anybody heard he was in phoenix that was when i was a little kid ah lucas said thats tough listen did you talk to some sheriffs deputies this morning make a statement yeah so whatd you tell them her face went dark and her blue eyes skittered away from his about the bodies lets start right from the beginning last night you were in your house the night before letty said she had been in bed on the second floor of the house just across the drainage ditch from west ditch road although the windows on the north and west sides of the house had been boarded up and the rooms closed to cut heating bills she had her own room on the east side of the house and still had a window she was in bed asleep when a vehicle went past the house on west ditch road that never happened in the winter the road was used by a local farmer as back access to a couple of fields but was used mostly for ditch maintenance and the strangeness of a passing vehicle was enough to wake her up when i heard the car i was afraid it was mom she said she was out last night and it was windy and there was a little snow and if she missed the driveway sometimes i dont know if she was drinking and she tried to turn around on that ditch road she could roll the car into the ditch or something so i got up and looked out the window and was watching the car and it stopped up the road a way and i thought it was starting to turn around and i was really worried but then i heard my mom coughing downstairs and i went and called her she came to the bottom of the stairs and i told her somebody just went by on the ditch road and they might be lost she came up and looked out the window and we watched it and it stayed there for a while and then it drove out this was about midnight two minutes after when i woke up i looked at my clock and it said twelvezerotwo you didnt see the people lucas asked i didnt even see the truck except for the lights the wind was blowing and all i could see was snow and the lights how long did you watch the lights del asked quite a while i dont know exactly i didnt look at the clock before i went to bed you didnt see it again after it drove out nope never saw it again in the morning she told them shed gotten up to run her trap line she ran thirty traps up the ditch and in the surrounding marshes for muskrat shed get up at five in the morning collect the days catch of rats reset the traps dump the rats into a garbage bag and haul them back to the house by seven since it didnt get light until seventhirty or so shed do it all by the light of a rechargeable flash this morning after shed run the traps shed climbed the bank onto the ditch road to walk back to her house she hadnt been all that curious about the car from the night before until she saw the tracks in the snow and the lines in the snow where somebody had dragged something back into the trees whatd you think they were lucas asked what i thought of was bodies letty said holding his eyes thats the first thing i thought of it scared me in the dark but when people throw their garbage away out here they dont haul it down the ditch road they just stop on the side of the highway and heave it into the ditch they dont hide it so i couldnt think of anything else but bodies so then well i went back there and i didnt see them at first because it was still dark her eyes were wide now fixed on lucas as she remembered and relived it i came to this place where there was a big square of messedup snow with nothing in it i just i dont know i guess i saw a dark thing hanging and i lifted up the light and there they were the black guys eyes were open scared me really bad i ran back out to the road and got my rats and ran all the way back to the house and woke up my mom she didnt believe me at first but then she did and we called the cops that was it yup she nodded and took a hit of the pepsi did your mom go down to the trees to look no she was afraid to she doesnt like dead things she doesnt even like to drop off my rats for me and theyre inside a bag and everything what do you uh do with the rats del asked sell them to joan wickery shes the furbuyer in these parts letty said how much do you get lucas asked hed never met a trapper depends on what it is letty said she gives me for average rats and six dollars for coon problem with coon is theyre smart and they catch on when youre trapping them i have to drive over to the dump to get them so i only go over about two days a week get maybe two or three at the most i can get twenty rats out of the ditch and the marsh across the road and be done before school you dont have to skin them out or whatever lucas asked nope joans boys do all of that i just bring in the carcasses del was fascinated what do they do with all the muskrat bodies grind them up turn them into feed i dont get paid for that though i only get paid for the fur joan says the carcasses pay her to keep the doors open and the furs her profit del asked feed for what mink joans got a mink farm they sat and looked at her for a minute then lucas asked anything else you can tell us i hope i dont die by getting hung she said they all thought about that for a moment then she added they twisted hanging there they twisted she made a twisting motion with her fingers they thought about that some more lucas groping for something to say that might comfort her but he couldnt think of anything after a moment he asked listen whyd you think it was your moms car going down the road lucas asked anything about it she thought for a second then nodded yeah it was a jeep i think it was a jeep cherokees got this big square red taillight she drew a big square taillight in the air and then a big square yellow light under that thats your turn signal then theres a little white light which is the backup light inside the yellow light thats what i saw on the road those red taillights like my moms and then when he was backing around down there when i was afraid shed go in the ditch it had those white lights inside the big square yellow light the yellow lights didnt come on but you could see them because of the white light inside them jeep cherokee lucas said yup i didnt think of it this morning when i was talking to the other cops they talked for a few more minutes and lucas finally smiled at her and said okay im out of questions i got one del said im a city guy how do you trap muskrats she told them quickly about the difference between feeding platforms and houses the houses look like little tepees made out of sticks and cattails and stuff you see them all over on marshes little piles i went down to the cities once with my mom and i saw a place by the airport that had more houses and feeders than i ever saw in my life really del was charmed by the airport yup anyway after freezeup you can open the houses and some of the big feeders with a machete or a hay knife and slip a trap right inside theres a whole bunch of rooms in a big house so you put the trap inside and theres a chain off the trap and you pin that down outside the house then you patch the hole in the house so its dark in there and theyll walk right into the trap then theres a hole in the bottom of the house that leads under the ice thats how they get around after freezeup and when the trap snaps they jump through the ri ole to try to get away and they drown i use mostly number jump traps so what do you do pull on the trap to see if theres a body she shook her head groped in her pocket found a pencil stub and got a napkin the chain comes out of the house like this she drew a chain with a bigger circular link at the end then you put your pin through this circle so that the rat cant pull it free but you keep the pin in the middle of the circle when you set it so if something hits the trap inside itll pull the circle against the pin that way you can walk up to a house and see right away if anything has hit the trap huh you can usually get four or five of them out of a house you always got to leave some breeders how much do you make during a winter lucas asked she grinned at him and shook her head thats not polite youre a kid he said tell that to the feds when they want their taxes think you could give me a ride home letty asked she crushed the empty pepsi can in her hands and tossed it into a waste basket what about your mom lucas asked she can always get a ride from one of her friends letty said i dont want to hang around all day lucas nodded okay but lets go check with mrs holme see if they had anything else set up id rather ride with you letty said i dont like the deputies they give me a hard time you get in trouble mostly about driving my moms car but i got no other way to get around and its too far to walk to town how old are you del asked twelve she said thats a little young to be driving dont you think might be for some people she said then if you give me a ride i could show you around broderick i know every house in the place sounds like a deal lucas said holme was happy enough to let lucas take letty home outside in the parking lot they decided that del would hit the local motels and ask about strangers driving jeeps lucas would take a look at the victims house in broderick later on theyd hook up for an afternoon snack and then go out to the casino and talk with warrs coworkers letty listened to them talk then told del theres four motels you want to know where theyre at del said yes and letty started to explain the layout of the town drawing with a piece of gravel on the blacktop her hands rough red but apparently impervious to the cold halfway through the explanation lucas cut her off and they walked over to the courthouse found the county clerk and bought maps of both the town and the county letty read the maps well enough and with the clerk pinpointed the motels outside again del took off in the mustang and lucas and letty headed back toward broderick as they crossed the river lucas noticed a dense spread of icefishing shacks at a bend to the north a few were simply flattopped boxes with doors while others were more elaborate with pitched roofs and american flags on door poles then the river was behind them and they followed the railroad tracks past the pastel cape cods and the dwindling businesses and quickly were back on the prairie you ever been out here before letty asked after a while not exactly here lucas said been over to oxford you got a gun with you yes you ever shoot anybody maybe lucas said whats that supposed to mean it means you should mind your own business lucas said he tried not to be mean about it but letty stayed on top of him dont want to talk about it letty asked he looked at her why dont we change the subject she shrugged okay if you dont want to talk about it after a while you got any kids two lucas said a daughter and my wife just had a baby boy whats your wife do shes a doctor id like to be a doctor letty said looking out at the countryside the countryside reminded lucas of a modern painting hed once seen at the walker art center as a young cop out on a sexual assault call the painting had been done in two colors a narrow band of black on the bottom a wider band of gray above it he still remembered the name whistler in the dark composition in white and gray if the artist had known about it he could have called it winter landscape broderick minnesota or maybe run a beauty salon letty was saying weve got three beauty salons in armstrong two good ones and one bad one mmm lucas said if i was a cop id put secret agents in every beauty shop in town teach them to be hairdressers but yknow theyd all have tape recorders and cameras hidden away like spies take a lot of cops lucas said yeah but youd know everything i go to harriets mane line with my mom and the salon ladies know everything thats going on everything thatd be pretty good for a cop lucas looked at her again more carefully youre right thats absolutely right maybe youll grow up to be a cop i could do that she said comfortably wouldnt mind carrying a gun if id had a real gun this morning i wouldnt have been scared at all all i had was that crappy the thing that made traveling across the land so strange lucas realized was that you did nothing you simply sat in the car and time passed driving almost anywhere else the road moved you went up and down hills and around curves and past houses speed zones came and went cars and trucks went by and something new was always popping up out here the road was dead straight with hardly anything on it or at the sides rather than whipping around a curve over the crest of a hill and finding a town tucked away surprising you here the towns came up as a slowly growing lump on the horizon you could see them it seemed for hours before you arrived though broderick arrived quickly enough lucas slowed as they came into town so whats where okay so theres the church she said pointing across the highway it used to be run by don sanders hes kinda crazy and i stay away from him for the last i dont know maybe two or three years there are a bunch of women living there people call them the nuns are they nuns a couple of them are they wear oldfashioned dresses okay you know them i talk to them in the diner when i see them but my mom says i should stay away from them because they might be lesbians they claim that theyre church people and say that they take food and clothes to poor people do they she nodded i guess i got some jeans from them once chics i know a couple of them the nuns and one of them ruth lewis i really like her she doesnt take any shit from anyone she says im as good as anybody and i should remember that how about the sanders guy why do you say hes crazy i just dont like the way he looks at me i get a bad feeling like what like he might hurt you like he might try to make me do something with him she said okay he didnt comment he simply filed it until he knew her better young girls in his experience were sometimes psychic in their ability to pick out predators at other times they were capable of straightfaced accusations against the absolutely innocent hes been replaced by lesbians thats just my mom letty said i know that ruths sister is going out with a guy in town the word is shes no lesbian lucas said huh and took another look at her and thought she might have blushed she hurried on pointing over the dashboard those two big yellow buildings belong to gene calb he fixes up cars and trucks hes a real good guy if im out with my traps hell let me come in and warm up i cant go into the bar or the cafe because sometimes im a little stinky but he doesnt care i think mom had a crush on him once but hes married i heard that sometimes the lesbians drive for him like when he needs a car delivered somewhere i could do that if i had a license and you probably ought to wait for the license lucas said yeahyeah she pointed thats the bar the guy who runs it is named pete mom used to go there when randy pearce ran it but she says she doesnt feel welcome anymore she says its a dive now a bunch of paint sniffers from the body shop she says theyre all jailbirds are they she shrugged some of them been in jail i guess but they seem like pretty good guys on the other side of the highway the diner is run by sandra wolf shes pretty nice and john mcguire has the gas station hes okay and down there right across from the barn she pointed down a side street where a low rambling house sat across a graveled street from a small white barn i dont know what those guys do but if i was a cop id take a close look at them yeah why i was walking through there taking a shortcut back from the lake and the guy came out of the house and yelled at me to get off his property i was only about ten feet on it and hes got dogs big blackandbrown ones he had these little paper flags around his property for a while they said dog training invisible fence but i think if he sicced one of those dogs on you that invisible fence wouldnt do any good theyd go through it like it was you know invisible but all he did was yell at you i thought it was pretty suspicious i mean hes got ten acres there and i was about three steps on it whats the guy do for a living works at calbs sometimes hes got a woman in there ive seen a couple of them different ones he sure does keep you off his property they were coming to the north end of town and the house where jane warr and deon cash had lived two sheriffs cars were parked outside now along with one of the bca cars from bemidji if you want to stop i can wait letty said you might want to ask me some more questions after you look inside he was being steered lucas thought shed shown signs of the female steering gene during the interview at the leg and even more on the way to broderick on the other hand she was right he pulled in and parked a sheriffs deputy stepped off the porch and walked toward them lucas got out said im davenport with the bca the deputy nodded okay one of your guys is inside lucas stuck his head back inside the car and said wait shut the door and followed the deputy up to the porch whered you get the kid the deputy asked bending down a bit to get a look at letty she lifted a hand to him she was downtown making a statement you know her sure i know everybody around here shes a pretty interesting kid dont let no grass grow under her feet thats for sure gonna wind up rich got a nice line of bullshit lucas said first thing you notice the deputy said he pushed the door open and lucas stepped into the house into an entry with a coat closet to one side he continued into a living room where one of the bca guys hed been introduced to that morning was standing at the bottom of a doublewide staircase talking on a cell phone he saw lucas and held up a finger lucas nodded and looked around the place smelled of macaroni cheese marijuana and blood not a new smell in the few hundred houses hed been through on homicide cases to his right in the corner was a widescreen panasonic television and on a table next to it a big sony a game console was plugged into the sony while the panasonic had boxes for a dvd and satellite dish a love seat and a leather chair faced the tvs straight ahead behind the bca guy on the other side of the staircase landing a hallway led to the kitchen lucas could see a bread maker sitting on a counter next to a microwave to the right an archway led into another room with a dining table in the center of it the table was stacked with boxes most of them from small electric appliances fifty or sixty magazines mostly on sex european cars or travel were in heaps along one wall a bose wave radio sat upside down under the table as though it had fallen off it was still plugged into a wall socket a set of earphones one earmuff broken off lay on the other side of the table along with a genericbrand bottle of ibuprofen a box of wheat thins sat on top of the litter of boxes on the table the generally upset state didnt have the look of deliberation of a search it simply looked like bad housekeeping hey the bca guy came up behind him look at this he led the way to the kitchen on the way he said im joe barin by the way we were introduced this morning lucas said here barin said be careful where you put your feet weve got some blood spatter he was pointing into a wastebasket on the floor by the kitchen door when lucas looked inside he saw two tiny ziploctype bags the kind used by hardware stores to hold small collections of screws washers cotter pins and the like and by dope dealers to parcel out measured amounts of cocaine heroin and crystal methadrine there were no cotter pins in sight you pull one out not yet you can see theres some residue i wouldnt stake my childs life on it but its coke they were dealing we looked around cant find any more baggies so maybe just using or maybe well find more stuff later and then weve got these clothes he pointed to another corner at a heap of clothing its all cut to shreds this is where the killer cut the clothes off them so he comes in with a gun cuffs them up tapes them up then cuts the clothes off them beats the shit out of the guy of cash beats the shit out of cash and then drags them both out the door and throws them into his truck and takes them down the road and hangs them yeah tough guy fruitcake lucas looked around the kitchen for a few more seconds nothing for him here that he could see the crew might get something whats upstairs three bedrooms and two bathrooms barin said one of the bedrooms doesnt look too used one of the other ones has a double bed and theres some clothes hanging in a closet a mans clothes and some stuff in the bathroom but it doesnt look like its been used lately the clothes are not cashs theyre for a bigger guy the third bedroom the big one was their regular bedroom clothes for both warr and cash lots of clothes lots of cashmere lets get the crime scene crew over quick as we can lucas said tear this place apart if they were dealing that would explain a lot could be punishment killings okay barin hesitated i dont exactly understand the chainofcommand here wheres dickerson still out at the scene i guess hes in charge on your side im running my own thing what i just suggested was a suggestion lucas grinned at him of course i do talk to the commissioner five or six times a day barin shrugged im not big on bureaucracy tearing the place up is the right thing to do the guy with me del knows every drug hideout invented by modern man ill bring him by later on good enough the deputy came to the door this young lady lucas and barin turned letty was standing behind the deputy looking around with interest says she has to use the bathroom uh not here ill run you home lucas said to barin so you know what youre doing ill get del up here okay barin was looking curiously at letty is this the young lady who found he tipped his head to the north yeah lucas said barin said for a second i thought she might be your daughter shes got exactly your eyes i can walk back to the cafe letty said to lucas its only two blocks ill take you lucas said cmon on the way out letty pointed at the widescreen panasonic television in the corner that used to be in the window at lutes you know how much that cost thousand fifteenhundred letty snorted it was on sale for ninethousand nineninetynine ten thousand bucks highdefinition tv sat there for six weeks and then one day it was outa there didnt know it came here though lucas looked at barin raised his eyebrows barin nodded hed check a tenthousanddollar television would give weight to the drugdealing proposition so lets go lucas said to letty but outside letty said i dont really have to pee i just wanted to get a look around well jesus christ lucas said irritated im trying to help you need all you can get she said then why couldnt i pee here they have to process the whole place crime scene process like the shows on television bathrooms are good places to process because they have good surfaces for fingerprints and so on you can sometimes get dna out of them okay she nodded good reason lets get you home lucas said lettys house was visible from cashs a gray spot on the bowlrim of the horizon what the heck are they doing letty asked peering out the passenger window as they drove out of town what lucas ducked his head to look through her window out over one of the farm fields directly south of the line of cop cars at the crime scene two helicopters were hovering thirty feet above the ground kicking up a small storm of ice crystals and dirt as they moved slowly sideways in line toward the ditch and the police cars television lucas said he looked at his watch not yet two oclock the newsies had been quick taking pictures he glanced over at her you really dont have to use the bathroom not really okay you better stick with me for a while a sheriffs car was parked across the side road and lucas held his id out the window as he turned in the deputy stopped to look through the windshield it was one of the guys who lucas had released from the hanging site and waved them through they continued down the track toward the cop cars there were fewer cars now but as they pulled up they saw three men carrying a black body bag through the trees are those the dead people letty asked peering out over the dashboard one of them lucas said he popped the door and was about to get out of the car when his cell phone rang he swiveled back into the car and punched the phone yeah lucas neil mitford the governors aide there was electronic noise in his voice again lucas remembered they were on the edge of nowhere anything yet one of the victims the black guy was in jail down in missouri until he moved up here that was probably a year and a half ago the guys from bemidji are running that down and at the house where they lived therere a couple of baggies in the wastebasket small ones like the kind used for street drugs that show some white residue probably cocaine excellent mitford said is it too early to start spinning out a dope story dont let the governor do it you want to be able to deny it if you have to lucas said but i think itll hold up theyre just bringing the bodies out of the woods now any film lucas told him about the helicopters i dont know what they could see from out there theyll be able to get pictures of the bodies coming out in the body bags but nothing of the trees i dont know ill ask and get back to you were pretty anxious mitford said ill get back lucas said he rang off and turned to letty this time you stay in the car its a free country she said you step out on the crime scene which this is and ill put you in a sheriffs car and send you back to armstrong to sit in the sheriffs office and think about it for a few more hours he said not fair she said so take a couple aspirins and lie down lucas said as he started climbing out again letty said excon with bags of cocaine huh thats a pretty picture stay lucas said as he got out of the car lucas spotted ray zahn leaning on the fender of his patrol car at the far end of the line zahn was watching the body bag being loaded into a suburban lucas walked toward him zahn turned his head nodded and called bringing them out me still in there yeah he helped take them down he had them cut the rope so they could keep it around their necks to make sure that this rope was what killed them you think any of the tv helicopters got pictures lucas asked as he turned into the trees zahn trailed behind zahn said yeah i dont know how much they could see but if you go over there diagonally look out over toward the field there was an open line into the hanging tree you dont see it right away because of the brush but if youre up fifteen or twenty feet looking down at an angle thats exactly where the choppers were they kept moving in and out of that hole shit maybe couldnt see too much anything was too much they could see the hanging tree and a group of men around it the mes the guy in the black coat yeah henry ford really henry ford yeah hes out of thief river good guy doesnt know shit about cars anderson the sheriff dickerson the bca supervisor and a few other men were huddled to the left of the second black bag cigarette smoke streaming away from them cold zahn mumbled from behind him radio says its two below i heard lucas said but its gonna warm up tonight then maybe snow we could use it zahn said anderson had spotted them coming through the trees and turned to the me who had what looked like an unfiltered cigarette hanging from one lip and said something and ford looked toward them he was a whitehaired man hardly old enough to be so white thirtyfive lucas thought with round gold grandpa glasses lucas came up with zahn a step behind nodded and said dr ford lucas davenport they shook gloved hands and lucas said anything useful they almost certainly died here if thats useful ford said talking around the cigarette cashs neck was cut by the rope and he bled down the length of his body and there were a few drips on the ground in the snow under his right foot so he was alive when they hung him up i assume the same was true with warr but well know for sure later the blood on warrs face i dont believe its hers i was worried about jarring anything loose taking her down so i took some swabs on the spot weve got three short blond hairs not hers not cashs good excellent any signs of drug use ford took the cigarette out of his mouth both of them were raw around the nostrils like they might be if they used cocaine cash had some scars on both of his forearms and warr on her right forearm and both feet that could be from needles i couldnt swear to the cocaine because we havent seen much of that here lately well need a few hours to verify all of this well do the full range of toxicology of course okay quicker is better though he looked out toward the choppers still hanging south of the crime scene he could see them clearly just above the brush they would have had a straight shot of the bodies hanging from the tree to dickerson theres no chance that you had the bodies down before the choppers arrived no the bca man shook his head if theyve got the right cameras they got the shot if wed had another twenty minutes they tried to come right in and we waved them off anderson said not much more we could do spilled milk lucas said the bca crime scene crew was already working the site and lucas drifted over and spoke for a moment to the supervisor nothing no good footprints everything is frozen and the snow didnt hold anything the man said the length of stride and the size of the foot would make the killer a male but hell we didnt think a woman dragged them back there anyway looks like just one guy if that means anything yeah it does lucas said so its one guy not much else were gonna clean the whole place out though right down to the dirt lucas turned to go back to dickerson but the phone rang again and he pulled it out and punched it up youre not going to believe it del said there was a guy staying at the motel the night before last driving a jeep cherokee paid with cash ive got his registration card he shows minnesota plates including the tag number im gonna run it see what happens the night clerk says he saw the guy again last night that he pulled into the parking lot as if he were going to check in again but he didnt he just sat in the lot for a few seconds then pulled away the clerk says he was a white guy with a short beard big guy wellspoken he was wearing a dark blue parka and a watch cap if lettys right on the time he would have been in the motel parking lot about an hour earlier maybe a little less huh anybody else stay in the room since him one guy last night who already checked out and the rooms been cleaned weve got a credit card on the guy who checked out so we should be able to get him for some prints i locked up the room and put some duct tape on the doors what else if i dont get something to eat in the next twelve minutes my ass is gonna fall off got a place theres a cafe called the red red robin it comes reluctantly recommended see you there in fifteen lucas said he went back to dickerson and they stepped away from the crowd to talk lucas told him about the dope baggies at the cash farmhouse i was just heading back down there dickerson said anything else we interviewed the kid and she thinks the killers car was a jeep cherokee lucas explained and outlined the conversation with del so the guy at the motel saw the jeep not long before letty saw the lights out here on the road it makes me nervous to say it but it fits gotta process the room dickerson said he was interested now priority one its sealed with official duct tape lucas said feel free do any good for us to talk with the kid i dont think so she mostly just found them lucas said you can take a crack at her if you want we got other stuff to do if you think you got it all im taking her back downtown to see if i can keep her away from the reporters for a while lucas said well talk to her some more letty was sitting on the hood of the oldsmobile apparently impervious to the cold when lucas got back to the road couldnt breathe inside the car she said but i stayed right here she hopped off the passenger side popped the door and climbed in the bodies in the bags looked stiff like bags full of boards she said as lucas got in and fumbled out the key uh you know a place called the red red robin the bird downtown nice place my mom and i went there once for thanksgiving im going in to get a bite to eat with del i hate to leave you without your mother he didnt mention that he hated even more to leave her with a pack of reporters outside her door want to come sounds good to me letty said if youre buying im buying on the way letty asked they were stiff in the bags is that like rigor mortis lucas shook his head no they were frozen like popsicles the red red robin was a storefront cafe with a robin painted on a swinging wooden sign outside the door like the sign on an english pub inside a dozen redtopped stools ran straight down a coffee bar and behind those and behind a sign that read please seat yourself were sixteen booths covered with the same red leatherette as the stools the place smelled of fried eggs fried onions fried potatoes and fried beef eight other customers sat in three groups down the booths they seemed to be arranged to keep an eye on del who sat halfway down the righthand wall anything lucas asked del as he and letty slid into the booth ran the numbers no such tag del said shit he glanced at letty shoot but it occurs to me that a guy whos gonna come up here and do something like hang two people would have to be pretty weird to do it in a small town in his own car hes gotta know hes gonna be somewhat noticed youd think so maybe he wouldnt lie about the minnesota part of the plates in case the clerk might notice maybe he just jumbled the numbers i got the guys in st paul to look for recent title transfers on older jeep cherokees turns out the new ones dont have those taillights the motel clerk thought that it might be an older model too maybe get lucky lucas said letty asked can you guys talk while you eat or is that too complicated del lifted an eyebrow at her my daughter is only three years younger than this kid lucas told him do you think i could lock her in a freezer i mean what if she grew a mouth like this one ha ha letty said she handed a slightly greasy menu to lucas youre buying letty stuffed herself del and lucas went out of their way to prove that they could talk while they ate the food struggled toward mediocrity but lucas realized as he sampled the potatoes i wasnt going to make it half of the meatloaf was refrigerator cold the other half microwave hot as they were finishing a tall man in tan r carhartt coveralls came in stamping his feet and snuffing with the cold letty called hey bud the man looked around until he spotted letty then stepped over i he was about fifty lucas thought and as thin and hardlooking as an oak rail with a bulbous red nose and flinty white eyes hey letty he said his eyes bouncing off lucas and del been working hard or hardly working doin okay she said i heard you been shootin beaver again yeah over to spike whats this about you finding those people i heard about it at jerrys yep letty puffed up a little they were nude all right lucas said dryly lets finish the meatloaf buds a trapper like me letty told them to bud these guys are state agents theyre taking me around bud nodded i thought jane might come to a bad end he said why was that lucas asked not good people he said she thought we were a bunch of hicks she was always laughing at people behind their backs and she used to talk about las vegas all the time like that was the navel of the universe every time she opened her mouth shed start off by saying in las vegas we used to whatever sounds like you knew her pretty well del said just to play blackjack the trapper dude said she was the main dealer up at moose bay he hesitated then said dropping his voice you know what you ought to do when you get up to the casino is talk to a guy named terry anderson he knew warr real well he leaned on real just enough lucas nodded and said ill do that thanks terry anderson any relation to the sheriff del asked the trapper was puzzled looked at letty and then back to del terry why would he be both andersons del suggested the trapper cackled shit buddy half the people up here are andersons they talked for another fifteen seconds then bud retreated to the counter and got a menu heck of a trapper and hes supposed to be an unbelievable hunter too he knows more about animals than they know themselves letty said hes been number one around here for years taught you everything you know she shook her head he doesnt teach anything to anybody hes got his secrets and he keeps them lucas dropped his voice to match hers think he might have had anything going with jane no now she was almost whispering dont look at him hell know were talking about him but uh everybody says buds a little gay when theyd finished the meal lucas sent del to brodcrick to look for dope hideouts were gonna pick up lettys mother lucas said then ill see you up there as he and letty were about to get in the car he remembered mitford damnit why dont you go look in a store window for a minute he suggested to letty and pulled out his phone mitford picked up on the first ring and lucas gave him the bad news theyve got pictures i dont know how good because they were a couple hundred yards away but theyve got something aw man thats terrible anything on the dope not yet my partners on the way up to the house if theres anything hell find it what about cash and the jail business were getting that now through rose marie mitford said we got a summary hes had a whole list of minor stuff some drugrelated disorderly conduct like that then this last one he was originally charged with ag assault he beat on some other guy with a steel coat tree in a hotel they pled it down and he took a year in the county lockup on some lowerlevel assault served nine months doesnt sound like something you get hanged for i got missouri trying to figure that out they said theyd get back to us this afternoon with whatever they can find mitford said oh and i got two more words for you what words washington fowler youre joking washington fowler was a civil rights attorney from chicago whod mostly given up the law in favor of incitation to riot im not mitford said hes having a press conference here at the airport in an hour and hes flying out to fargo in a private plane in an hour and a half the governor invited him over to the mansion for a conference but he told us to go fuck ourselves you should see him up there tonight aw jeez yeah lucas we need to hit cash hard the woman too before the news before that film gets down here before fowler gets up there were looking when lucas got off the phone letty suggested that they might find her mother at the duck inn two blocks over they ambled over lucas looking in the storefronts small towns hed realized a long time ago were a little like spaceships or ordinary ships for that matter they generally had to have one of everything one mcdonalds or burger king a department store a quick oil change a hardware store a feed store a satellitetv outlet a bar or two everything needed for survival armstrong was like that a lifeboat one of everything necessary for life all packaged in yellowbrick and redbrick twostory buildings about one in four of the storefronts was empty and the owners hadnt bothered to put for rent signs in the windows the duck inn was a cliche a plastic fauxhunters haven smelling of beer with a fake oldfashioned jukebox that played cds next to the twin coinop pool tables a cliche and lettys mother wasnt there cop came and got her i think they went over to the courthouse the bartender said the courthouse was just down the block and they found martha west leaving the law enforcement center she was a natural blond like letty but her hair had been tinted an improbable rust color she wasnt weathered like letty but there were explosions of tiny red veins on her cheeks so that she would always look rosycheeked she wore a parka and khaki slacks with pointed boots and was carrying a beatenup guitar case she saw letty and lucas and called to letty where you been i been looking all over for you cops have been taking me around letty said jerking a thumb at lucas this is agent davenport lucas davenport lucas said martha west wests eyes were moving slowly and then jerking back like a drunk drifting out of his lane then jerking the car back straight she was loaded but controlling it i was about to drop letty at your place but i didnt want to leave her alone lucas said we ate at the bird letty said with a slight sophisticated deprecation in her voice really the mother looked at lucas like he might have done something incorrect she had an openfaced meatloaf sandwich mashed potatoes green beans and apple pie lucas said and about six cokes two letty said they were free refills they loaded martha and her guitar into the back seat of lucass car and on the way north he caught her eyes in his rearview mirror and said therell be some reporters who want to talk with you if i were you id get in the house get your heads straight clean up a little bit i can get a guy from the bureau of criminal apprehension to talk with you about your statement about what you should or shouldnt say or about whether you should talk at all you could always tell them to go away tv asked martha she straightened touched her hair for sure lucas said but they can be aaa he changed directions jerks be a good idea if you talked with a bca guy who knows how to deal with the media all right ill talk to him martha said but ive been on tv many times okay then you know how to handle it i used to work with the chamber of commerce and the tv would come to me for comment her eyes rolled toward the westside ditch and ive always been a singer so ive been around okay but ill talk to your person that wouldnt hurt as they went through broderick they saw a collection of media trucks at the cafe and just down the highway lucas saw dels mustang at the victims house next to dickersons car he slowed did a uturn and said the guy im going to introduce you to is hank dickerson who is the head of the whole bureau for the northern part of the state hell help you out he left them in the car and as he crossed the yard the cop outside said you wont believe what they found yeah joe barin the bca agent was standing at the bottom of the stairs and when he saw lucas pointed up take a look he said lucas went up the creaky stairs and found del with dickerson and one of dickersons crime scene crew in the main bedroom the bedroom smelled of makeup and aftershave a framed michael jordan poster hung on one wall opposite a fake antique beer sign the cops turned to lucas when he walked in and dickerson said del found their hideyhole the hideyhole was in the bedroom closet and was custommade what appeared to be a crossbrace for the closet pole was in fact a cover for a fourfootlong sixinchhigh wall cache inside the cache lucas could see what appeared to be a onekilo bag of cocaine separated into dozens of smaller baggies a colt magnum carry revolver like one he had in his gun safe at home and cash the cash was wrapped in paper bands and took up three running feet of the cache between the bag of cocaine and the back wall holy cats how much we dont want to take it out until we get pictures but i figure something upward of three hundred thousand if its all hundreds del said all the top bundles are hundreds and all used not a single new bill as far as you can tell from looking at the sides lucas said to dickerson you need to have three guys here with the money all the time until its counted make sure one or two of them are sheriffs deputies you want both agencies involved people are gonna ask how much of the money went into cops pockets dickerson nodded right well do that another thing i walked across the highway and talked to gene calb at the truck place he was cashs boss he said he had no idea what was going on but he said there was another guy living here part time named joe kelly he said kelly disappeared a month ago and nobodys heard from him since the clothes in the other bedroom are kellys we got a couple chargecard receipts with his name on them check the companies for new activity under way dickerson said we got another thing del said maybe what i want you to look at it del said then you tell me lucas followed him dickerson trailing down through the house to the basement on the way down he told dickerson about washington fowler dickerson was unmoved youre pretty calm about it lucas said the guy goes around starting fires dickerson smiled thats your problem general not mine youre the guy whos supposed to fix shit the basement was unfinished concrete block and exposed joists but with a newlooking furnace a new hotwater heater and new wiring and fluorescent lights in one corner a new bathroom had been built in a beigepainted cubicle with a standard toilet and a sink and a fiberglass shower booth with sliding glass doors del said well well they just remodeled it lucas said he looked around saw nothing of obvious interest del had to be thinking about the bathroom and lucas went that way the bathroom was bare and smelled of disinfectant large lots of room to move around lucas swung the entrance door then knocked on it looked like wood sounded like a metal fire door knocked on the walls not drywall as hed expected but painted plywood and heavy probably threequarter inch yale keyhole lock with a bolt lock able from the outside no keyhole on the inside k he stepped back and said to del and dickerson its a goddamn cell del turned to dickerson you heard it here first twenty minutes later lucas del and dickerson walked through the gathering collection of cop cars in the yard letty was sitting on the hood of the car again while her mother waited inside when she saw them coming she climbed out and lucas introduced dickerson hank will help you with the tv commentary and hell get you home cops say you found a bundle of money in there letty said to del that right just a rumor del said dickerson looking from lucas to del asked whatre you guys doing next gonna talk to st paul and maybe wander around some more lucas said he looked back at the house this thing is getting interesting free of letty and her mother lucas and del caucused at the cars moose bay del asked thats a big topic lucas said why dont we talk to this calb guy they both looked across the highway at the yellow metal buildings with the trucks parked out front and del nodded calb had two buildings an autobody and tow building and a truckrehab building connected by an unheated shedlike walkway they went into the autobody building which consisted of a small office and a series of repair bays at the back a woman in the office directed them through the walkway to the truckrehab wing the truck area was bigger and more open forty feet long and thirty wide with a thirtyfoot ceiling it smelled of diesel and welding fumes a row of red toolboxes sat at the back and an electric heater was mounted high on one wall and glowed down over a burgundy peterbilt three men were clustered around the open door of the truck peering inside and one of them asked what the fuck were they carrying in there you think there was some acid dripping in there i dont know then one of the men saw lucas and del and nudged the heavyset man who was deepest into the truck he backed up saw them stood upright and asked can we help you fellas were with the state bureau of criminal apprehension lucas said del held up an id case we need to talk to gene calb thats me ill be with you in just a second he turned to one of the other men i dont know larry id go after it with a grinder and if you dont get good metal well cut another piece off a wreck and welder in theres a hulk down in worthington out of a fire oughta work looks like its rotten all the way to the bottom i could push a nail through it said an emaciated man in oilstained mr goodwrench coveralls well cut through it and find out calb shook his head as he turned to lucas and del the whole floor of the passenger side is eaten away not the drivers side just the passenger side its not rust exactly but its rotten like they spilled acid on it or something and then let it soak for a few years one of the other men said cat pee cat peell rot holes in hardwood floors well jesus how could he stand the smell calb shook his head once more if i were you larry id keep my hands out of it you sure as shit can count on that said the man called larry to lucas and del calb said cmon this way fellas well go back to my office you want to know about deon i already talked to some of you guys with the bca right were doing a little backchecking lucas said how well did you know mr cash they pushed through a door into another small office and calb gestured at a couple of guest chairs then settled behind his desk as he answered a caution flag signed by richard petty and a snapon tools calendar from the s hung on a wall everything else was parts books he worked for me calb said earnestly leaning across the desk to lucas he had a big head and a blunt nose and square mildly green teeth the size of chiclets the face of a plumber or a carpenter or a character actor playing a hardworking joe we werent friends an old army buddy down in kg asked me if i could get him a drivers job i knew he was just out of jail and tell you the truth im not sure he was that much reformed with whats happened it looks like he wasnt what do you think happened del asked calb said well you know somebody took him out and hung him i know it wasnt none of my boys because none of my boys could do that jane too killing both of them i think its gotta come out of kg he was in jail thats what its gotta be somebody back there how about jane warr lucas asked how well did you know her not real well she didnt hang around or anything she came up with deon from kg she wasnt much she was a card dealer up at moose bay im sure you know so were they renting that house own it what was the situation there they bought it cheap thirtysix thousand i think then they fixed it up joe kelly did some of the work hed once worked as a handyman and they had a couple guys in from town they did some of it there are rumors around town that she might have had a relationship with a guy up at the casino del said i wouldnt know about that calb said shaking his head like i said she wasnt that bright but i dont think shed be dumb enough to play around on deon deon had a mean streak thats why he was in jail if hed found out something like that he would have beat on her like a big bass drum mmm calb picked up a piece of paper from his desk something with a printed irs seal looked at it flicked it off to the side then theres the whole thing about joe joes gone and nobody knows where he went never said a word to anyone one day he was here and the next day he wasnt he was from kg too you think it might be possible that joe did this that there was some kind of an argument and for some reason calb shook his head nah to tell you the truth joe just didnt have the grit to do this not hanging them where he had to look them in the face so maybe he just took off del said or maybe something else i thought of after the other bca boys was here calb continued if this whole thing didnt come out of the kansas city j all and thats gotta be it in my opinion but if it didnt then you oughta get up to moose bay that would be the place to look along with kg why del asked the word around town is that letty west saw them out there at the stroke of midnight calb said is that right lucas nodded close to that jane worked the threetoeleven shift she couldnt have got home much before halfpast eleven and last night with that ground blizzard it was probably later if he took them up there to hang them at midnight he must have grabbed her the minute she got home so he was waiting for her or followed her home lucas and del both nodded they talked for another five minutes and lucas got the impression that calb was genuinely confused by the killings cash had had some words from time to time with coworkers but never anything serious nothing that had even led to a confrontation just that you know mechanics and guys like deon dont mix he thought he was a basketball star one of those bad gangsta dudes whatever they call them thats what he thought outside walking back across the highway lucas said i thought about her getting off at eleven and being hanged at twelve i did too del said i was saving it up pigs ass lucas said anyway somebody thought of it maybe warr was the target del said weve been doing nothing but talking about cash got to get on her get some background going id talk to dickerson gotta get up to moose bay del said hows the heater in the olds fine then lets take your car mustang heater wouldnt soften up butter moose bay was run by the black river band of the chippewa on the banks of a river whose water was stained so absolutely black by decomposing vegetation that when it froze over even the ice looked black from cashs house to the res was twentyfour minutes nine minutes down to armstrong then another fifteen minutes through armstrong and out the county road to the casino tell me your theories del said on the way out you give good theory im thinking drug deal lucas said calb was probably right both ways its connected with kansas city and cashs jail contacts and its probably connected with the casino the casino indians dftnt have much truck with drugs but the people who come in to gamble have a good time theyd do a little coke so the moneys drug money del said all in cash all bundled up but not fresh bricks cash makes the wholesale contacts driving for calb back and forth warr has the contacts up here delivers it out to the individual dealers or deals it herself then they fuck with somebody or somebody knows theyve got that money and they come looking for it but then theyd just shoot them they wouldnt hang them del said trying to get them to talk more likely they fucked with somebody and got made an example of del said a bigger network thats still up and running where they need an occasional example maybe lucas said where does calb come in he doesnt not necessarily look at the farmhouse there was a lot of work done in there new work and it cost a bundle believe me i know the big new house back in st paul had cost if calb knows cash is only getting paid for driving and if warr is just dealing cards whered he think they got the money to fix that place up theres a hundred grand in work in there minimum and a tenthousanddollar television set tell you what if the totals a hundred and thirtyfive thousand dollars thats not much for a house with two incomes and a guy upstairs who might be paying rent del said cmon lucas scoffed how many drug dealers do you know who have a mortgage how many have bought a house jimmy szuza bought a house for his mother jimmy szuza was working for his mother the treacherous old bitch he was fronting for her still after a couple of minutes and what about the cell beats the shit outa me calb was right about the travel time lucas said glancing at his watch as they rolled into the casinos parking lot the casino looked like a larger version of calbs truck shop but a truck shop on steroids a huge rambling twostory yellowandgreen metal building with a prismshaped glass entry built to resemble a crystal tepee liquor in the front poker in the rear del said bumper sticker lucas said but i dont think they sell booze the moose bay security chief was a cheerful chippewa man named clark hofrrnan who hurried down to meet them after a call from the reception desk figured youd get here sooner or later he said shaking their hands he looked closely at del did you hang out at meats in the cities yeah id go in there before it closed del said it closed shit couple years back hofrrnan thought about that for a moment then said i used to kick your ass at shuffleboard i thought you were a wino del grinned and shrugged i remember you told me you were at wounded knee thats me hofrrnan said sneaking through the weeds with a hundred pounds of frozen brats in a backpack fuckin fbi no offense cmon this way they followed him upstairs to his office del filling him in about meats trouble with the health inspectors del told him you name it they had it mice rats roaches disease the only thing that kept you from dyin was the alcohol i o i everything did have a particular flavor hoflrnan said ever notice that yeah i always sorta liked it what happened to meat he moved to san clemente and opened a porno store not much money in retail porno anymore hoffman said shaking his head not since they started piping it into every motel room in the country jane wares employment file sat in the center of hoffmans desk he pushed it across at lucas and said not much there she learned to deal at a school in vegas held a couple of jobs there worked at a walmart for a while outside of kansas city then came up here we heard a rumor that she might have had a relationship here with a guy named terry anderson hoffman frowned whered you hear that downtown cant tell you exactly who mentioned it lucas said ill check and ill find out i hadnt heard anything but then i might not have about anyone else but not about terry why not terry del asked hes my brotherinlaw hoffman said he grinned at lucas but it wasnt a happy face hes married to my sister aw shit lucas said listen all we heard was one guy who didnt like warr but maybe got turned down by her and knew wed be up here talking to you maybe just a wise guy one way or the other ill know in the next half hour hoffman said he interlinked his fingers stretched his arms out in front of him and cracked his knuckles ill let you know take it easy del said ill take it easy hoffman said my sister on the other hand might kill his ass if its true tell her to take it easy too del said i mean jesus you have any cocaine going through here lucas asked after an awkward pause hoffman spread his hands sure on the res and some of the customers bring it in we try to keep it out we make so much money that we try to keep everything spotless we dont need to give some asshole state senator an excuse to build staterun casinos when we see it we call the cops anybody caught with it is banned no matter what the cops do any chance warr was dealing del asked not in here hoffman said we watch the dealers and they know it we tape them every minute theyre working really do you still have last nights tapes lucas asked sure do weve got tapes for the last month and tapes of anything that might ever come up in the future catch people stealing theyll be on tape until the next glacier comes through del said we dont have a line on who did this but wed sort of like to see a guy big guy new beard dark watch cap or ski cap dark parka and jeans drives a jeep cherokee i dont know about the cherokee but i know who youre talking about weve got him on tape hoffman said you know him lucas asked who he is not who he is but i looked at him pretty good hed be on the tapes though most of what youd see is the top of his head the camera coverage on the slots isnt as good as it is on the tables because the slots arent as much of a problem when can we see them lucas asked and how do you know it was him right now and i know who youre talking about because some people dont act right and you tend to notice them this guy wasnt interested in gambling i couldnt tell what he was interested in i noticed him the night before last and then he came in again last night hoffman said he was plugging dollar tokens into the slots but slow and he hardly paid attention when he won like he didnt care people dont act like that in casinos theyre always walking around counting their coins and looking at machines or they get perched up on a chair and they start pounding away one thing they dont do is they dont not give a shit del looked at lucas hell of a long thread from the motel guy to here gotta pull it lucas said to hoffman lets go see the tapes hoffman took them to a surveillance room on the way he asked you really think your info on terry might be good and lucas said jeez i hope not where a halfdozen women roamed along twenty monitors watching the activity on the floor below there were good overhead shots of all the blackjack tables but most of the cameras over the slots looked straight down only a few looked at the slots from shallow angles and those were farther back the main problem with the machines is theft guys dipping coins out of other peoples coin buckets hoffman explained he pointed at a monitor showing a woman who was sitting in front of a machine feeding in quarters all they could see was the top of her head her shoulders and her arms see like this lady shes pushed her coin bucket halfway around the machine if youre on the next aisle over you can reach across and dip her we get one of those a week guys who never think about cameras dumb guys but you cant see them dipping from the side you can only see them reach from the overheads he led them to a cubicle at the back of the room where an indian man with two careful redribbontied braids was poking at a computer les are we still on last nights tapes on number twelve yeah thats good for another couple of days the man looked curiously at lucas and del state police hoffman said looking into the jane warr thing hanged les said he toyed with the end of one of his braids that sort of freaked me out when i heard it she wont be on twelve though were looking for another fella go to ten oclock start there the computer guy typed in a group of codes and they waited fifteen seconds then twenty and finally a wideangled color film came up the people in the film moved in a her kyjerky motion indicating that the camera was shooting at a superslow rate there he is hoffman said tapping the camera the camera was looking down a long row of slots from slightly above twothirds of the way down the row a tall man in a dark coat watch cap and glasses was playing one of the machines can we get a closer shot of him lucas asked not from that camera we could have zoomed in if we thought he was up to something but he never did anything hoffman said i just noticed him when i was down there because he didnt seem right i forgot about his glasses though how about another camera the overhead wont help but weve got a camera coming across from the side but its gonna be partly blocked by the machines number twentyeight les said i can get it if you want it get it lucas said number twentyeight showed slices of the mans face only marginally more clearly than the first camera is that the best there is probably got him walking in or out on number thirtysix but i dont know when he arrived leaving wed only get the back of his head itd take some time i dont know how much better the shot would be hoffman said we could take the flashes we got of him on twentyeight freeze the shots and then stitch them together and wed have his whole face les said i could do it in photoshop how long would that take i dont know ive never done it but i think i could i could print the best partial shots too lets try it all lucas said to hofrrnan we can get a subpoena to make it all legal thatd be good hoffman said itd help publicitywise if somebody asks but we could get started right away look look where he keeps looking what hoffman tapped the monitor see he keeps looking over the top of the machine sideways thats where jane is shes out of the picture but he keeps looking over there here comes small bear a woman pushing a change cart moved into the picture when she got to the man she stopped and spoke to him he nodded took out his wallet and gave her a bill she gave him a stack of coins said a couple more words then pushed on down the aisle whos that joanne small bear been working here since we opened we need to talk to her lucas said were gonna need all the tape youve got of this guy even the overheads he might be wearing a ring or a watch and that could be a good thing to know hoffman nodded sure ill have les pull out everything weve got youre a hundred percent sure its him no only about ninety percent lucas said ninety and climbing how about this small bear del asked where can we get her hoffman looked at his watch shes gotta be checked in by now she works the threetoeleven lets go find her joanne small bear looked nothing at all like a bear she looked more like a raspberry barely five feet tall she was jolly and fat with black eyes and brilliant white teeth she wore bootcut jeans with a western shirt and a turquoise necklace she remembered the man in the watch cap he looked lonely and sad she said pretty goodlooking though polite any particular characteristics that might tell us about him del asked maybe she said you think he killed jane warr we need to talk to him lucas said jane was a big pain in the ass small bear said you dont hang people for being a pain in the ass del said you wouldnt have wanted to see her this morning when they cut her down small bear exhaled and said i know one thing that might be important when he opened his billfold to give me some bills i saw that he had a black card one of those american express black cards del looked at lucas and lucas shrugged small bear looked from lucas to del to lucas and said you dont know about the black cards i dont know what youre talking about lucas said we get every card in the world in here hoffman said the black card is called the centurion card to get one you gotta spend a hundred and fifty thousand bucks a year with american express i bet there arent a hundred of them in minnesota youre kidding me lucas said a hundred and fifty thousand a year thats what i hear del said to lucas that ought to narrow the list lucas stepped away took out his cell phone found a slip of paper with neil mitfords personal cellphone number and punched it in mitford answered on the second ring this is daven port things are moving here we could have a photo and maybe a name pretty quick but we need some help what we need somebody to get to american express maybe theres a local office or a local official we can give a subpoena to but we need all the names of all the centurion card members from minnesota and the kansas city area maybe somebody could feed them a list of zip codes we need it quick as we can wait a minute let me jot this down after a second of silence mitford said what the fuck is a centurion card some kind of exclusive card lucas said the casino people say theyre pretty rare ill find out the fastest way to do it and get it to you see if you can get a printable list from them and fax it to the sheriffs office here and tell them you know it involves a multiple murder put a little heat on them i can do heat mitford said ill call you hop f man had walked away while lucas was talking when he got off the phone del said hoffmans gone to get anderson his brotherinlaw damnit i would have liked to have been there see how the guy takes it he went over there he said hed be right back maybe we could catch him they found hoffman and anderson just outside an employees canteen off the main floor anderson was a thin darkhaired white man with big crooked teeth and a small narrow mustache he was waving his arms around his face harsh and urgent as he talked to hoffman who leaned against a wall with his arms crossed lucas heard goddamnit clark you know me better than that i just ate lunch lucas came up with del trailing and said there you are hoffman turned and pushed away from the wall to anderson he said these are the cops anderson pushed a finger at lucas what the hell are you doing telling clark that ive been cheating on suzie didnt exactly say that lucas said we heard from a guy in town that you were pretty friendly with jane warr what guy cant tell you unless we bust you then youd have a right to know lucas said hardening up your lawyer could get the name anderson shriveled back my lawyer what the hell is going on del edged in the beatup good guy listen just tell us how well did you know her i wasnt screwing her if thats what you mean how well del pressed anderson took a step back and the stress in his voice dropped a notch a little bit she used to deal in vegas and i worked out there for a while years ago i didnt know her then we werent even there at the same time but you know working in vegas was sort of a big deal for both of us when we were both off at the same time wed eat lunch together here in the canteen sometimes but most of the time just in a group only once or twice when there was just the two of us he looked at hoffman clark i wouldnt bullshit you all right hoffman said del said did you ever meet any of her friends deon cash or joe kelly i didnt really meet them but i knew who they were because they were black anderson said to hoffman thats another reason i wouldnt do it clark even if id wanted to you ever see her boyfriend the guy was like some kind of ghetto killer or something all right hoffman said again she ever say anything about them lucas asked or was she worried about anything did she seem apprehensive or scared a few weeks back i dont know three or four weeks the joe guy took off or disappeared she didnt know where he went she said he just vanished she was pretty worried about him but thats all i know she never did say if he ever showed up she seemed scared about it anderson dipped his chin thinking scratched his head straightened his hair a little relieved grooming lucas thought and said maybe scared sort of more freaked out like when you find out something weird about someone like if somebody told you your best friend was a child molester or something did you see a guy watching her last night a big guy wasnt here last night i was out with my wife anderson said leaning on the wife okay lucas said tell me this how much coke was she pushing out on the floor here what cocaine del said anderson looked at them like they were crazy she wasnt dealing cocaine no way i woulda known about that you get a bunch of dealers and one of them is pushing everybody knows there was nothing like that about jane she use it lucas asked andersens eyes flicked away maybe i never saw her use it he unconsciously rubbed his nose with the back of his hand but she used to get a little cranked and once or twice i thought she might ve gone back to the ladies can and done something you didnt tell us hoffman said i didnt know anderson said hell you even hint at something like that around here and the next thing you know somebodys looking for a job and i kinda liked her but not too much hoffman said no jesus clark then his eyes narrowed and he turned to lucas did that asshole bud larson put you on me lucas kept his face straight and shook his head havent heard any larsons mentioned he said why nothin anderson said to hoffman he was the guy who complained that we colddecked him last week meanlooking guy del looked at lucas and shook his head when they were finished with anderson still a worried man despite hoffmans assurances that he believed him they went looking for other employees who remembered the big man les the computer operator brought down the first printout of the mans face it was fuzzy but would be recognizable in context nobody else remembered talking to him by the time they finished talking with other employees les had saved a dozen shots of the man and two stitchedtogether composites to a cd that could be opened on any pc with the imaging program which he said was most of them we still need the actual tapes lucas told him were pulling them well hang on to them he said theyd been in the casino for an hour and a half when mitford called back were running with amex they accepted a faxed subpoena and theyre putting the list together now they say theyll have it in half an hour im having copies faxed to the sheriffs office up i i i there and another one down here they say there might be a couple hundred names well head downtown lucas said ive got a cd with some photos on it wed like to see some down here ill email them to you you gonna be there until you guys go to bed mitford said washington just had a press conference in grand forks and he says the law enforcement agencies must be comp licit in this crime im reading this either actually or morally then ah blah blah blah i think hes on his way up there to have a rally yeah in armstrong whos gonna rally i dont know im just telling you what he says ill get back to you lucas said on the way out they thanked hosman agreed that anderson probably hadnt been playing around on his sister and made arrangements to have the videotapes picked up by a bca crime scene man so we got a face and a few hundred names del said he looked at his watch you think well get him by midnight were rolling lucas said and ill tell you what he left enough stuff on the bodies that when we identify him weve got him id bet that hair was his i bet that blood on warrs face was his could be cashs not dripping down like that it was fresh when she was hanging god bless dna del said on the way back to town lucas called dickerson and filled him in then did you get anything out of that motel room fingerprints hair anything weve got an ocean of fingerprints but weve also got some places that appear to have been wiped dickerson said i wouldnt get your hopes up did you hear anything from st paul about tracking down the cherokee if you go back a month you can find maybe thirty cherokee transactions in minnesota weve got the names on those and were working with north and south dakota missouri and iowa i think iowas in havent gotten word from the others yet im not sure south dakota is computerized enough to get what we need that quick lets get what we can a bunch of cops were leaning on the wall outside the law enforcement center smoking when lucas and del pulled into the parking lot lucas had just gotten out of the car when his cell phone rang yeah lucas its neil i got the list on those cards down here and itll be up there in the next couple of minutes i dont think you have to waste a lot of time checking it out why not cause i think i know who it is what theres a guy on the list named hale sorrell you remember him sorrell hes oh shit del said what lucas ignored him and asked mitford do you know him yeah i once tried to get him to give some money to our guy on the basis that our guy was a rational conservative democrat sorrell wasnt buying hes a dyedinthewool republican seemed like an okay guy shitload of money from medlux big guy but not fat big shoulders dark hair middle forties glasses this guy had a recent beard k i dont know if he wears glasses but hes at an age where he might hes fortysix he could grow the beard everything else is right on im gonna email you a photo maybe a couple of them lucas said gimme an address what del asked when lucas rang off we got him maybe lucas said hale sorrell you remember del thought for a moment then a light flared behind his eyes oh shit thats what i said lets get this list maybe they got a tl or a dsl line out of here we can send the photos from here they crossed the parking lot at a halftrot one of the deputies pushed away from the wall and said chief davenport you remember me lucas slowed down he did remember the deputy more or less hed beaten up the guys partner a few years before in a different county but not too far away yeah i do lucas said what happened you take a transfer moved over here when sheriff mason retired my folks live over here anyway have you seen the tv the news no bad pretty bad that little girl letty she was terrific but man they took some pictures of those people hanging in the trees and theyre everywhere they were on the cbs and abc and nec evening news and theyre on cnn almost fulltime they got video of the bodies sort of swinging in the wind aw christ then that washington guy gave a talk down in grand forks and they had this video picture behind him with the bodies hanging and it looked like he was standing in there with them and he was screaming about lynching maybe we better figure this out in a hurry im pretty sure you can do it the deputy said i been telling the guys about you not too much i hope lucas said yeah i told them that part the deputy said thats the best part uh whatever happened to the girl the girl that come up with you marcy sherrill shes a lieutenant in minneapolis now she runs the intelligence unit really jeez the deputy was impressed gotta go lucas said nice talking to you again as he and del went inside he heard the deputys voice got a pair of knockers on her like muskmelons and you got groupies del said groupie with a good eye for knockers lucas said amused muskmelons those are cantaloupes right the sheriffs department had a fast line out anderson and a dozen other cops were in the building when lucas and del arrived and came out to meet them something happen we might have a name lucas said we need to send some pictures to st paul right now andersons jaw dropped he stood like that for a moment looked at a deputy whod trailed him in and then said well jimmy who is it you mean a name for the killer possibly know in a minute if i can get an internet connection on a computer with a cd drive i got one in my office lucas followed him back to a big woodpaneled office with a blue highpile carpet sevenfoot mahogany desk and a wall full of photographs the sheriff with local politicians his wife his children other sheriffs cops a computer sat on a sidetable with an aeron chair in front of it lucas dropped into the chair brought up the computer slipped the cd into the cd tray and called up a qwest connection ten seconds later the best of the stitched photos was on its way to st paul a minute later another was on its way six deputies were crowded into the office now and lucas thought about the other bca crew he punched in dickersons number dickerson this is davenport where are you just outside of armstrong thinking about heading home we got a name were down at the sheriffs office if the name is good it ties together a lot of stuff the money the cell in the basement whats the name hale sorrell long pause oh shit hale sorrell anderson demanded when lucas rang off you mean the rochester guy lucas nodded leaned back in the chair crossed his legs daughter was kidnapped last month and never came back he said were not sure yet but its a possibility you got pictures of him one of the deputies asked weve got these pictures lucas said tapping a photograph on the monitor screen theyre not good but they might be good enough once we get a solid maybe and some dna returns back from the medical examiner then well know that means his kid is out at might have been at her she might still be out there somewhere at the house lucas said did you know sorrell was from up here originally one of the deputies asked i mean not right here but down to red lake falls his father still lives down there somewhere hes in a nursing home or something lucas said thats interesting maybe somebody around here set him up could be i guess another deputy said maybe he was fooling around with somebody red lake falls is pretty much known for its beautiful women thats always a useful piece of information lucass cell phone rang and the governor was there lucas neil brought me up to date on this hale sorrell thing i know him pretty well i looked at the pictures what do you think neil and i agree it sure looks like him not positive but boy it sure looks like him we have a lot of dna sir if we can get somebody to officially point the finger we could get a warrant for some dna samples and settle it the devils gonna be in the details we dont want to be wrong if we had to is there any way you could hang this on the sheriff up there the sheriffs a pretty sharp guy sir lucas said looking up at anderson who appeared confused and mouthed at lucas who is it lucas went back to the phone i think we could probably work something out if we had to but before we do anything official id like to get some good photos of sorrell put them in a photo spread and show them to a woman up here who actually talked to him if she ids him wed be on solid ground asking for the dna that sounds good ill get mccord on it right now thereve got to be some publicity shots around hes served on committees and so forth can we transmit them up to you i think so youll have to talk to the local people i dont know exactly what the printing facilities are here hang on he took the phone down and asked do we have a photo printer of some kind one of the deputies said sure weve got two or three different kinds standard stuff back to the phone were good sir when your guys find a photo send it up here to the sheriffs department we can do that henderson said man you moved fast this is exactly what i wanted that asshole washington hasnt even gotten out of grand forks yet hes supposedly going up to the hanging tree to make a speech sir we cant let that happen its really a bleak place it looks like it was invented for a hanging the imagell be so strong that nothing else will make any difference nothing we say maybe we could keep him out of there on the grounds that its a crime scene can we blame that on the sheriff too i think it could be worked out sir is he right there listening yes sir let me talk to him say something that would lead to me talking to him lucas nodded i think you should talk to sheriff anderson about that sir good give him the phone lucas passed the phone to anderson saying the governor he needs to speak with you anderson took the phone uh governor henderson as anderson talked lucas said to the group of deputies is there somebody here who usually handles photo spreads well need a halfdozen pictures of white men with dark hair probably in business suits looking charming like a political picture he looked around at the pictures on the walls like these like that one he pointed a finger at a smiling head one of the deputies said we got that the rest of it took an hour and a half lucas was in a semifrenzy driven by the momentum of the day and dickerson arrived running hot with lights and siren wanting to be there if it all cracked open forty minutes after lucas talked to the governor the sheriffs id division took the transmission of two recent photos of hale sorrell one a formal portrait the other taken at a press conference after the disappearance of his daughter a deputy put together two different photo spreads one of darkhaired white men in informal situations another of darkhaired white men in formal poses then he retransmitted all the dummy photos to himself so theyd be printed on the same paper and have the same general look hoffman was still on the job at the casino small bear was on the floor he said pushing her change cart keep her there lucas said were on the way lucas del and dickerson went with anderson in a sheriffs truck a comfortable cmc yukon xl with a big heater at the casino hoffman met them at the door small bears upstairs he said howre we doing gonna find out lucas said small bear was sitting at a table in a conference room her hands folded in front of her looking a little frightened lucas explained quickly we have two sets of photos were gonna show you one set then ask if you see the man who was here last night and then well show you the other set okay she nodded lucas spread the informal photos in front of her she looked at them slowly slowly pushing one after another away from her until finally she was left only with sorrelts i think this might be him not a very good picture okay lucas scooped up the deck of photos put them back in the brown envelope they came in opened a second envelope and took out the formal shots this time small bear didnt hesitate im pretty sure this is him she said tapping the photograph of sorrell they all stood in silence nobody moving nothing audible but some breathing and then anderson groaned jimmy and lucas turned and looked at del del nodded got him margery singleton looked like a green heron a sharpbilled stalking bird with a mouth like a rip in a piece of rawhide an arrowhead nose rattlesnake eyes her eyebrows plucked naked and redrawn with a green pencil she worked the first shift at elysian manor pushing patients to and fro cleaning up after them rolling pills when a registered nurse wasnt available her best friend flo anderson was a registered nurse having put in her two years at fargo and theyd worked out a system where if somebody needed a shot or to get blood taken margery could do it and flo could sign the patients most of whom had alzheimers didnt know one way or the other margery heard about the hanging of warr and cash from a breathless young nurses aide who came back from lunch bright eyed with a tale shed heard from a sheriffs deputy at the minimart theyre hanging down there naked as jaybirds all purple and frozen the womans tongue was sticking out like this she tilted her head hung her tongue out of the side of her mouth and crossed her eyes straightening she added in a lower voice they said that the black guy had a penis that was about ten inches long thats bullshit margery said her rattlesnake eyes fixing the young woman i seen two thousand dicks since i been in this place and there aint been one of them more than seven how many black men have been in here the nurse asked an eyebrow going up had the old bat there hanged in a tree thats what they say do you think loren might know more about it ill find out margery said she looked at her watch she had another two hours before she could get oft a supervisor named burt stuck his head into the station where they were talking old man barrows got shit all over the couch clean it up okay burt continued down the hall and margery muttered clean it up yourself asshole but she went to get her spray bottle and sponge and the nurses aide said as she left if you hear anything from loren let me know i mean jeez loren singleton finally rolled out of bed at two oclock hed been unable to sleep much dozing off only to see in his dreams deon and jane hanging from a tree he stretched scratched went into the bathroom as he shaved looking in the mirror he started thinking about his latest cadillac restoration the car was at calbs and that could be inconvenient the more he shaved the more inconvenient it seemed he finished shaving showered brushed his teeth got dressed and called gene calb calb came on the phone and said katina said youd heard woke me up on the clock radio this morning singleton said i thought it might be a good idea to move the caddy outa there you know until things quiet down calb nodded yes right away where do you want it my garage you got somebody who could drive it down for me ill drive them back ill get shem he isnt doing anything so what do you think singleton shook his head i dont know i wonder if it has anything to do with joe you think they were fighting i mean deon never said anything im completely confused calb said if you told me shit was shinola id just nod my head and agree same with me when can you move the car right now were closing everything down moving everything out shemll be there in fifteen minutes ill be outside waiting listen loren were really counting on you you gotta keep an eye out this is why you got the job i understand you can count on me the car shuffle took forty minutes when it was done singleton went downtown probed for information got small pieces and one essential fact nobody knew anything he called calb told him that at threethirty he was back home as he always did when he first got home he checked his money he kept it in the basement inside the holes in a row of concrete blocks maybe he thought he ought to move it get a bank box far away maybe in minot or somewhere if anybody looked at him seriously the bca people theyd find the money and then the cat would be out of the bag the money he didnt know what to do with it hed bought some expensive boots another old caddy some good breather gear for painting his cars when he got his first lumpsum payment from calb hed made the mistake of showing it to his mom shed claimed it most of it and had come back every week since demanding more then hed introduced her to jane and theyd gotten their heads together and when the big money came in shed taken most of that singleton had stood up to her a little bit anyway and claimed fifty thousand fifty thousand would almost get him a small shop somewhere a morton building maybe with space to work on a couple of caddys at once and maybe even space to rig up a paint booth big dreams wham the back door banged open only one person entered like that without warning singleton had a few hundred dollars in his hand and he hastily shoved it into his pocket pulled the string on the overhead light and headed up the stairs margery was waiting in the kitchen she was a small thin wrinkled woman a woman who was to other women what a raisin was to a grape her eyes were pale blue and her hair once blond looked gray at first glance but was actually almost colorless translucent like ice on a window her lips were thin her chin was pointed katina called her the witch what the hell have you been doing she demanded whyn the hell didnt you call me about deon and jane she turned her nose up sniffed stepped close to him youve had that whore in here havent you i can smell her juice not a whore mom she slapped him hard a fullhanded slap shes a whore if i say shes a whore she shouted shes a whore singleton stepped away from her a hand to his face furiously angry his mom had a thin neck and sometimes he thought about snapping it take that goddamn little cornstalk neck and snap it off he bared his teeth at her ground them felt his heart pumping margery hadnt forgotten about the bathtub she stepped farther away took the tone down whoever did this they might be coming for us she said that fuckin nigger would sell us for a quarter and you know it mom what can i do he heard the plaintive whine in his voice he didnt hate the whine only because it had always been there when he was dealing with mom and he didnt recognize it you coulda called me she shouted but you were up here with your whore when you coulda been callin me i gotta think about this she looked around eyes narrowing whatre you doing here anyway you oughta be downtown seeing what you can see i was already down there for a while and i didnt hear hardly anything the cops found deons money it was stuffed away in his house somewhere they got it all goddamnit margery said they got it all goddamnit thats what i heard therere state cops in town and theyre supposed to be really good i think we better lie low nothing they can connect to us not unless i mean what if theyve got joe joes dead margery said we all agree but what if hes not then we are she said she pointed a trembling finger at him you get back down there you find out whats going on and you call me dumb shit they both turned to the sound of a car in the driveway singleton looked katina he said im getting out of here margery said im not talking to that whore margery and katina met at the door and margery went on by with a sideways glance and not a single word katina on the other hand smiled and said hi mom when she was inside with the door closed she asked whatd the witch want borrow money singleton said that was always good for an excuse because his mother genuinely did love money katina bustled around getting some coffee together whats the word on deon and jane she asked nobody knows what happened but the bca guys found a big pile of money and a bunch of dope up in deons bedroom singleton said theyre gonna be all over the dope angle sheriff andersons out completely out singleton dipped his head hes out hes smart enough to know that he was over his head and if he wasnt smart enough half the county commission went over to his office to tell him harvey benschneider stood right over him while he made the call to st paul ah boy katina said she pulled off her gloves parka and ski hat shook her hair out i cant believe theyre dead genes going crazy you talk to him yeah he thinks maybe jane was dealing cocaine at the casino singleton said could they be that stupid deon was a stupid man and jane wasnt much smarter katina said she took cups out of a dish rack in the sink my question is what do we tell the police you dont tell them anything singleton said let gene do the talking no reason for any of us to get involved deon worked for gene not for us if genes smart hell point the state cops at the casino theres so much shit going on up there they could investigate the place for the rest of their lives and not get to the bottom of it only one problem with that idea katina said what joe wheres joe jane told me that all of his stuff was still in the house if joes dead then it wasnt the casino could be could be if its coke they were dealing cant tell with dopers the other thing is what if joe came back and did this what if he was looking for that money hmm they sat silently for a moment as katina struggled with all the conflicting possibilities finally she looked up at him and said whatever happened to all three weve really got to worry about our own positions thats right we all ought to stay away if the state guys find one string and pull it hard enough the whole sweaters gonna unravel they talked for a while over their coffee a middleaged couple who got along singleton wasnt like the men shed met in the cities katina thought he had some steel in him some flint some ugly she liked it a man whod stand up she just didnt know the party at the west house started when two newspaper reporters accompanied by two photographers showed up at the front door and asked for interviews letty was pleased to do it though martha was a bit embarrassed by the mess the house was in that didnt seem to bother the photographers who got a couple of shots of letty sitting in her mothers old rocker then the first tv truck showed up the newspaper people were okay but compared to the tv people they were mongrels at a dog show the tv people were stars lettyd even seen some of them on her own tv the tv people agreed on one set of lights and set them up around the living room while martha scurried around moving all of her best furniture into place moving the worst of it into the kitchen a guy came in with a couple of sacks of blackcorn chips cheese dip and coke and then somebody else brought in a twelvepack of bud light they asked letty to get some traps and she did and they put them on the floor by her feet and some of the cameramen crawled tn close to get a shot of the traps using the lights on top of their cameras somebody else challenged the cameramen to snap their fingers in the traps and being cameramen they did although none of the onair talent would do it then somebody else asked martha about her singing career and she got out her guitar and sang an old pete seeger song called where have all the flowers gone and then the main lights came up and were adjusted and the first interviewer a blonde with a foxy face and feathery crimson scarf said letty tell me about yesterday i was up in my bedroom she began letty told them about the traps and the rats and the and the bodies hanging in the dark then she told a darkhaired italianlooking guy from fox and did it again for cnn and as many times as they wanted she stayed on top of it fresh the tv liked her the kid had this face a face that looked like it ought to have a smear of dirt on it though it had been scrubbed clean a wild face with just a hint of feral preteen sexuality they made her demonstrate the traps her gun explain the machete she cradled the rifle in the notch of her left arm as she talked and the reporters fluttered around her like sparrows over a spilled patch of quaker oats they could smell the connection between the kid and the tube youre gonna be a star honey the foxy blonde said she was a beautiful smart woman whose socks cost more than lettys wardrobe and letty believed her the bca guy dickerson finally chased the tv reporters away several asked if they could come back the next morning martha said of course and martha as animated as letty had ever seen her began to plan for the next day i look like a troll she said looking in the kitchen mirror the house suddenly silent seemed cold and lonely and isolated from the world ive got to get a different coat and my hair ah baby i wonder if i can get into harriets what time is it while her mother called harriets mane line letty went up the stairs and threw herself on her bed and closed her eyes closing her eyes was almost as good as television when shed been on tv shed felt normal she was surprised by that she could feel what the tv people wanted and reflected it back at them chin up a little grim a little tight the in the crook of her arm but a smile now and then too she felt she could move them shed grown up with tv and knew how it worked letty got up and closed the door on the back of the door shed mounted a mirror that shed found at the goodwill store she looked pretty tough she thought trying to turn so she could catch her own profile she was weathersmudged from the wind and the ice but she couldnt help that but maybe she lay down again and closed her eyes maybe some lipstick just a little teeny hint of lipstick she should definitely clean up her shoes shed seen a girl in a john wayne movie a spunky kid just a little older than herself maybe and that was the look she wanted that was the attitude martha west ran up the stairs dicks here hes gonna take me she said dick was her onandoff boyfriend hed heard about the press conference are you okay harriets gonna give me a quick wash and set and then dick and me might go out after you know just for a while ill be okay i gotta get some traps out for when the reporters come back tomorrow and maybe clean up my room one lady said they might want to look out my window if they decide to do a reenactment okay maybe catch the kitchen too okay and just run the vacuum around the living room spray some of the lemon pledge around okay okay dont be too late we gotta get up early tomorrow letty said were just gonna go out for a few minutes see what people are saying martha ran back down the stairs and letty sat on the bed and pulled on her kneehigh gum boots and got her coat and gloves going to set some traps her mom yelled back up dont miss the six oclock news they said maybe five oclock and for sure at six okay this was like paradise ten minutes later visions of mtv still dancing in her head she was out the door with her trap sack she carried the though she didnt need it and the machete in the green jungle sheath which she did need but who knew maybe the tv would come back and the tv people liked the gun she looked over her shoulder and she trudged across the road and then into the frozen marsh on the north side wishing them back she spent an hour with the traps the sun dropping out of sight as she worked back at the house in the light of the single bulb in her room she looked at herself in the mirror again and thought about the men whod come in from st paul davenport and del and how they carried an air of the city with them shed told davenport she might like to be a surgeon or a hairdresser or even a cop maybe she could do those jobs but she no longer thought that was what she wanted she liked the lights she was going to be a reporter a star she went downstairs got one of the two remaining cokes and saw the keys to the jeep on the kitchen table she had a hundred and twentyseven dollars hidden in an old metal thermos jug under her bed maybe just a piece of pie down at wolfs after a day like this she deserved it the holy roller church in broderick had been converted into a roughandready dormitory wooden screens divided the former prayer space into nine rooms to provide privacy each cubicle contained a folding bed a bureau a night table a fire extinguisher and a curtain across the doorway in the long tradition of the flophouse a christian electrician from bemidji had laid some cable between the rooms so each room had one electric outlet to power a lamp personal radios and televisions were forbidden not for religious reasons but because the noise might annoy others most of the women had walkman radios or cd players for personal use and most had small bookcases jammed with mystery novels and spiritual howtos the women who lived at the church usually ate communally cooking out of the church kitchen although there was no rule about that a side room had a pile of beanbag chairs a television connected to a satellite dish a dvd player and sixty or seventy slowly accumulated chick flicks a balcony in the back once an organ loft had been set aside as a quiet place for someone who needed a moments peace and separation two of the women at the church were nuns none or maybe just one nobody was certain was a lesbian absolutely none of them cared what the people in town said ruth lewis was the leader she worked out schedules and tactics with calb for the dope operation and coordinated through catholic charities and lutheran social services for the food and clothing distribution work the food and clothing distribution might have helped a few people but minnesota was a socialist state and much of that was done more efficiently by the local state agencies the women didnt care about that either a decent cover was worth maintaining after briefing the other women on the murders of jane warr and deon cash ruth listened to worries and arguments for an hour but most of them were selfreliant not given to panic after an hour of talk they agreed there was nothing to do but wait to work the drug transport as well as they could to work the rural food program and to keep their heads down afterward katina lewis took her sister aside and said loren will keep us posted about the police theres a good chance that if something happens if they find out about the drug runs well have some warning before they do anything if they know about you guys about your relationship we might pull loren down with us ruth said she smiled her cool smile she didnt like loren singleton and katina knew it hes willing to take the chance katina said the only problem might be hes always been under his mothers thumb if she knew what was happening out here shed sell us to the highest bidder the old witch warn him i am sorta what im really doing is she smiled her older sister was always so solemn that she made katina giggle what ruth asked solemnly were sorta changing thumbs katina said the old witchs for mine later ruth walked up the highway in the afternoon darkness to get a salty friedeggandonion sandwich at wolfs cafe ruth always felt guilty about the egg sandwiches they were greasy probably put an extra millimeter of cholesterol in her veins every time she ate one the salt probably pushed her blood pressure and the raw onion gave her bad breath that lasted for hours on the other hand she had no heart problems her blood pressure was perfect and the sandwiches tasted wonderful a break from the gloom of winter and the glum healthy food of the communal kitchen the cafe had a double door and always smelled of grease and was fifteen degrees too warm and sandy wolf called out hey baby ruth hi ruth nodded shyly she wasnt a hailfellow like wolf but she enjoyed the other womans heartiness another woman sat halfway down the counter not a woman though ruth thought but a girl eating a piece of pie letty west letty ruth stepped down the bar smiling shed liked the girl the first time they met and had talked to her a dozen times since how are you letty returned the smile waved her fork im fine had a press conference this afternoon oh i heard ruth went solemn looked for the right words heard that you found the people we was just talking about it wolf said letty says they was frozen like popsicles they put them in the black bags to carry them out and they were in there like a sackful of boards letty said do the police have any ideas who did it ruth asked letty shook her head nah they know a heck of a lot less than i do they dont know anything about broderick i been filling them in theres these guys lucas and del im helping them out we ate up at the bird this afternoon what did you actually see at the murder scene sandy wolf leaned on the counter and ruth plopped on the stool next to the girl and letty went through the whole story as shed told it to the television cameras that afternoon when she finished the story about finding the bodies she added that the cameras were coming back the next day for a feature story theyre gonna come along and run my traps with me i had to go out this afternoon and put some traps in just so ill have some rats for the feature story tomorrow are they paying you wolf asked maybe letty said she wasnt sure she hadnt thought of that angle they oughta wolf said i mean you got a product to sell you could go on oprah you think letty liked oprah you cant tell where this kind of thing will lead you could be in hollywood stranger things have happened wolf said i dont know about hollywood ruth said she felt a tickle of concern letty do you have anybody staying with you out there with you and your mom i mean a policeman no you think we should well she nibbled at a lip okay now im scared letty said shed seen all the cop dramas the killers always came back all i got is that pieceofshit the guy isnt coming back wolf said disdainfully shed been cleaning up the grill and she flapped her cleaning rag at letty the guy who did this is a million miles from here hes probably on miami beach by now i hope ruth said to wolf egg sandwich with raw onions fried hard coming up wolf said she asked letty another piece of pie short piece if youre buying letty said she grinned at ruth got a free piece of pie for the story youll get a free ride to jail if the state patrol sees that truck parked out back wolf grunted to ruth shes driving her moms truck again little goddamn juvenile delinquent little goddamn juvenile delinquent whos gonna be on oprah letty said she looked at the wall clock fourthirty i gotta be out of here in ten minutes theyre telling me that well be on at five movie star wolf cackled sliding a halfslice of cherry pie down the countertop when ruth got back to the church she told katina about letty smiling as she recounted the girls enthusiasm katina wasnt so amused that kids all over the place if shes talking to the police i hope she doesnt talk about us or about genes place not really much for her to know ruth said bunch of cars getting fixed i suppose just the way that shes always hanging around i mean ruth were criminals we should act like criminals at least part of the time shes having a good time i dont think shes a danger to us ruth said shes a kid if you say so katina said letting her skepticism show besides weve talked about this sooner or later one of us is going to get caught crossing the border or somebody will tell some ambitious little creep prosecutor what were doing and theyll come get all of us we could go to jail katina its a fact of life katina shook her head i never believed that if were careful if were really really psychopathic ally careful i dont think we will the discussion had not quite been an argument and nothing was resolved later on katina crossed the highway when she saw singleton pull into calbs parking lot singleton had a remote that worked the overhead door and the door went up and he pulled inside to get the car out of sight katina supposed there were still two cop cars and a state van at cashs house though it was so cold all the cops had gone inside the house singleton saw katina coming across the highway and held the door up for her dropping it when she was inside genes in the back singleton said calb was in his cubbyhole staring at an aging dell computer he looked up and said loren when singleton came in leaned back to look around him and said hey katina talk to the state guys yet singleton asked two sets of them this afternoon one set was okay and they were here for an hour taking notes the other set was just two guys who stood around with their hands in their pockets like the fuckin gestapo davenport and capslock singleton said supposed to be heavy hitters whatd you tell them the truth calb said i talked to shawn down in kansas city before they came in told him what i was going to do which was tell the truth that i knew shawn in the army and knew he had this troubled cousin and when the cousin got out of jail i hired him as a favor then i told them i was about to fire him because he was a screwup and i suspected he used the drugs but not that he sold them i told them i thought the trouble might be coming from janes casino job good singleton said i was going to suggest that weve gotta reinforce it now that you got them thinking about it katina pulled at her lip im worried about letty west shes spending a lot of time with the police and she hangs around here calb shook his head nothing to worry about she comes in to get warm and i dont let her go in the shop because i dont want her getting hurt all the shit laying around here i dont believe she ever talked to deon they chatted for a few more minutes then as they left singleton deflected a hint from katina she could have used some comforting in these troubled times and headed back to armstrong he stopped at peskes market to pick up a sixpack of caffeinated coke and ran into roger elroy who was also looking into the cooler at the back of the store anything happening they got him elroy said quietly they got him elroy was young and eager and full of news they know who it is those two bca guys figured it out up at the casino elroy said singleton thought the casino and a wave of relief washed through him and he leaned into the cooler for a sixpack it was that guy whose kid was kidnapped hale sorrell that guy from rochester remember last month singleton almost gave it away then might have if elroy had seen his face but his face was in the cooler as he reached deep inside he stopped got a grip both on himself and the sixpack backed out and said whered they come up with that elroy told him briefly then shook his head anderson talked to the governor they think the sorrell girls body might be out there at deon cashs place you knew those guys right knew who they were singleton said talked to cash a couple of times jeez so have they grabbed sorrell yet not until tomorrow theyre trying to run some stuff down theyve got a line on the car he used theyre running some pictures by a witness they dont want to tip him off jesus these bca guys theyre heavy duty elroy said i met davenport a couple of years ago when he was on another job im telling you hes the smartest cop in the state hes the guy who set up that ambush on that assassin woman down in minneapolis if he thinks its sorrell then it is maybe not so smart maybe just lucky you havent met him elroy said he is something else when i met him he was up here with this policewoman fuckin her she had a set of knockers singleton had a lot to think about and he prowled down the streets of armstrong doing just that thought about letty west thought about her for five minutes tried to remember exactly where hed seen her around the farmhouse he knew hed seen her out around the dump but not when he sat on a street corner for a while tapping a marlboro into his hand lit it with an icecold zippo thought about hale sorrell finally disturbed and a bit angry at the unfairness of it he drove over to logans fancy meats used the phone on the outside wall dialing a number from memory a man answered hello he hung up walked back to his car unraveling sweaters he lit another marlboro thought about it singleton didnt think of himself as a killer because hed never actually killed anyone not that the law cared the law would say he was a killer because he was there when the girls were killed it was all really gentle mom had gone into the room with them and told them that they were being taken back home but that they werent allowed to see it so shed give them a shot and when they woke up theyd be back with their mom and dad they never woke up of course singleton had carried them out in a black plastic garbage bag still warm out through the night the burial spade rattling in the back of the truck theyd gone quickly quietly mercifully they never felt a thing hed like to go like that in a way theyd been lucky now they had the sorrell problem it wasnt joe it was sorrell and there was only one way as far as he could see that sorrell could possibly have found out about deon and jane and that was through joe sorrell had gotten him had joe given up his name as well or moms had deon or jane given them up damn like a sweater unraveling he thought about it for a few more minutes and then called mom del had gotten them rooms in a motel but after small bear identified sorrell with the photos they decided to head back to the cities the helicopter had already gone so theyd be driving we have to put together an approach lucas told dickerson as they rode back to armstrong in andersons truck you gotta stay right on top of the dna samples the labll want to take three or four days but you can get them in two days if you push also we need that formal statement from small bear get her while shes hot you gonna bust him ill talk to the governor lucas said id rather have the dna done first so we know that what weve got is good but theres some politics in this so i dunno if the dnas good well have him cold and what id like to do is talk to him without any lawyers around find out what the hell happened how did he pin them down what was the sequence were there more people involved dickerson nodded all right he was in the army so hell have prints on file ill get them and run them against everything were taking out of his hotel room so well have that too ill get all trie tapes from moose bay see if we can get him following her out of the casino need statements from everybody i wish youd stay around for when washington gets up here anderson said to lucas anderson was behind the wheel i dont know exactly what to do with him dont talk to the guy lucas said be too busy solving the crime this guy makes a living with confrontation and you cannot win have somebody designated to handle your information and to deal with him a woman would be best somebody a little older and motherly so if he really ripped on her hed seem like an asshole but you oughta stay away i gotta say something anderson protested its my town man im telling you if you go out there and meet him hes gonna fuck you lucas said if you want to be on tv thats okay have somebody keep an eye on washington and talk to the tv people while hes taking a nap or eating be really polite about him welcome him to the community but do not talk to him anderson looked at dickerson what do you think lucas is right if you talk to him with a tv camera around hell hand you your ass if you gotta talk to him do it privately in your office dont let the cameras in if you can hold him off until the day after tomorrow then the whole thing may be moot lucas said well jump on sorrell and leak the story like crazy washington probably wont want to be identified as defending people who kidnapped and murdered a little girl all right all right anderson said he muttered something under his breath then said you guys are treating me like the village idiot after a moment of silence lucas asked think you could do pretty good surgery what anderson said surgery you think you could do a heart bypass tomorrow if you had to now anderson was pissed is this leading to something yeah this washington is to confrontation and publicity what a heart surgeon is to bypass surgery you shouldnt be embarrassed if youre not as good at it as he is none of us are its his specialty hes not interested in getting to know you or understanding the problem or solving the crime hes here to fuck somebody and raise some money for himself if you give him a target hell fuck you nothing personal its just his job they rode in silence for a while then dickerson said im seeing stars i think supposed to clear off just long enough to get really cold then tomorrow we got more clouds coming anderson said del called the motel from the law enforcement center and canceled their rooms and lucas talked to the car dealer holme about taking the oldsmobile south to the cities its a good runner holme said no problem about that but how you getting it back ill find somebody to bring it back or bring it back myself lucas said give me a week he thought about the possibility of a body out at the cash house hed be back and he called mitford who was still in his office we got a solid id lucas said im coming back tonight we ought to arrive sometime after two in the morning so i can be in early tomorrow if you talk to the governor tonight our next question is when do we take him he explained about the dna processing time the thing is if we really nail him down right at the start before he has a chance to get into some long strategy sessions with his lawyers maybe we can find out what happened at least what happened with the kidnapping a twofer mitford said clean up the kidnappings and the lynchings the hanging ill talk with the governor tonight youll be on your cell phone yeah but there are some big holes in the cell phone net you might not be able to get me for a couple hours unless im going through a town once i get on going south we could probably hook up if i dont get you we meet tomorrow for sure how about seven oclock you got a life neil what on the way out of the law enforcement center lucas said goodbye to anderson and dickerson the sheriff shaking hands with him this time lucas had the feeling that he wouldnt stay away from washington but that was andersons problem guys we kicked some ass today lucas said they consolidated their bags in the olds and lucas took the wheel as they passed the front of the courthouse they saw the glow of tv lights on the front steps getting set up for washington del said like a flame for a moth lucas said ill bet you ten bucks that anderson winds up out there no bet the twin cities were southeast from armstrong but the fastest way home was on a state highway that went directly west for almost forty miles where they would hook up with the northsouth in north dakota theyd take to fargo where theyd catch east into the cities it was a long way around but both anderson and dickerson said it was the quickest way by at least an hour on the way out of town they called home to tell their wives that they were on the way the housekeeper told lucas that weather was at the supermarket on ford parkway but shed pass the message on lucas put the speedometer on ninety and they headed through the moonless dark toward the north dakota border ought to bring the porsche up here let her out lucas said dead straight not another car in sight and we know where all the cops are course we could hit a cow del said they rode along for a few minutes then lucas said you know i didnt see any cows come to think of it neither did i another minute and lucas said they mustve named moose bay after something maybe well hit a moose del didnt answer lucas glanced over at him found him staring out the window what my god look at the lights northern lights lucas couldnt see them from the south side of the car so he stopped and they both got out and stood next to the idling olds the stars were so close that they looked like headlights on a city highway but the real show was to the north where a rippling curtain of pale yellow and even paler violet hung from the vault of the sky the curtain moved swayed brightened and then faded and then exploded in another sector they stood on the highway watching until the cold began to seep into their shoulders and then they got back in the olds and took off del still watched from his window and finally he sighed and said too much light to see them in the cities i mean you can see them but not like this i can see them pretty good from my cabin lucas said so goddamn bright that you dont need your headlights del said yeah lucas reached out and turned off the headlights they were immediately hurtling through a darkness so intense that is should have had elvis paintings on it turn the fuckin lights back on del said after a few seconds there might be a curve somewhere no curves lucas said i could tie the wheel down crawl in the back seat and go to sleep but he turned the lights on and they crossed the red river into north dakota thirtythree minutes after blowing out of armstrong lucas drove the first two hours then del took two and lucas took them into the cities six hours after leaving the law enforcement center he dropped del at his house then drove through the quiet streets to mississippi river boulevard and the big new house he left the olds in the driveway got his bag from the trunk fumbled his house keys out of his pocket and trudged inside weather woke when he tiptoed into the bedroom by the light from the hallway that you no its a crazed rapist howd it go we cracked it he started to undress what she pushed herself up you can turn on a light here her bed stand light came on are you working tomorrow morning lucas asked weather operated almost daily no i might do a palate in the afternoon but theyve got to finish some tests on the kid so its not a sure thing what happened with the lynching not a lynching lucas said it was a revenge killing you remember that hale sorrell who was in the paper a month ago his kid got kidnapped yeah it was him she was amazed and a little entertained lucas youre joking no we havent made an arrest but the bodies were really clogged up with somebody elses dna and ill tell you what its gonna be sorrells he found out who killed his kid he tracked them down and he hanged them i dont know the details but were gonna find out oh god that poor family that poor family you dont really go around hanging people lucas said what would you do if somebody kidnapped sam and killed him lucas got in bed but didnt answer she pressed him what would you do i dont know oh bullshit lucas i know what youd do and so do you she said youd wait until the police werent looking then youd find them and kill them all right lucas said then after a while make a spoon she rolled away from him and lucas snuggled up behind her arm around her waist see anything about it on tv yeah that washington man and the sheriff had a press conference and washington lost it and started screaming at the sheriff about being a redneck bigot and the sheriff kept apologizing it was like he admitted it or something aw man we told him it was pretty funny if you like assassinations weather said and this little girl was on she had this amazing face like in those pictures from the dust bowl letty west ill tell you about her in the morning lucas said they snuggled for a while and then lucas rolled away and said i gotta sleep im supposed to be downtown at seven oclock or some fuckin thing set your clock weather said are you going to arrest him sorrell no no its just that the goddamn governors aide is a maniac he wants an early meeting nothings gonna happen with sorrell for a day or two loren singleton and his mother unaffected by the crystal clarity of the night and the rippling northern lights were passing through fargo as lucas snuggled up against weathers butt and as lucas stirred under the drone of the alarm clock and weather kicked him and he groaned and thrashed toward the snooze button they were rolling up the long landscaped driveway at hale sorrells house in the countryside east of rochester sorrell himself wearing blue silk pajamas let them in the house singleton in his deputy sheriffs uniform asked is your wife up yet oh god oh my god you found her sorrell asked his eyes wide they clicked over to margery but didnt ask the question maybe she was some kind of social worker he turned and shouted mary mary from up the stairs who is it you better come down you have any relatives in the house singleton asked any help any friends no no mary could call her mother mary sorrell came down the stairs and said is it tammy no its not tammy singleton said he thought about the warm bundle hed carried outside then what sorrell asked was there fear in his eyes did he think singleton was here because of the hangings better get it done with its just singleton said digging in his coat pocket he glanced at his mother theyd worked this out its just the sorrells were looking at his pocket as though he were about to produce a paper or a photograph instead singleton produced a snub by caliber revolver pushed it toward sorrells eyes and pulled the trigger at the last moment sorrell flinched even at the short distance singleton might have missed but singleton flinched the same way and the bullet struck sorrell between the eyes and he fell backward after a second of stunning gunsmoked silence in the aftermath of the blast mary sorrell backed a step away and began to scream looking at her husbands body and then realizing up at singleton the gun was pointing at her head and singleton pulled the trigger and flinched again just as mary sorrell flinched the opposite way and though he was four feet from her the bullet clipped only the corner of her ear and she staggered away and turned and tried to run goddamn you margery shrilled and to singleton shoot her shoot her she was now six feet away and singleton shaking badly shot her in the back and she went down hurt but still able to scramble weakly to her hands and knees she made a coughing noise like a lion coughing from the blood in her lungs and crawled away from him trailing brilliant red lungshot blood now still shaking he stepped carefully around it and shot her in the back of the head and she went down for good then singleton and mom both stood there until singleton groaned oh god shut up dumb shit his mother said just listen they listened together for running feet for a call for a question all they heard was the crinkling silence of the big house they knew from tammy that the sorrells had no livein servants although there was a housekeeper who would be arriving after eight oclock we ought to check around margery said looking up and down the entry hall theres money in this place i can smell it mom we gotta get out of here sorrell said we cant touch any thing i told you they got microscopes they got all kinds of shit dont touch anything so they left in the wan light of the predawn locking the door behind them they had at least a couple of hours before the housekeeper showed up not enough time to get back to armstrong but certainly enough time to arrive early in the day to be astonished if singleton was called upon to be astonished left some money back there margery said as they rolled out of the driveway left some goddamned money on the table lucas slept for four hours then the alarm buzzer went and he groaned and weather kicked him and said the clock the clock and he groaned again and swatted the clock hard enough to trigger the snooze feature for the next thirty years weather said get up youll go back to sleep get up no just give me a minute get up cmon youre keeping me awake jeez he rolled out of bed stunned by the early hour staggered to the window looked at the indooroutdoor thermometer it was stuck at f then parted the wooden slats of the shade and peered out at a surly pitchdark morning the sun wasnt due up for a while but a streetlight provided enough illumination that he could see the bare branches moving on a lilac bush not only bitterly cold but windy good he turned back to the bed but weather said go in the bathroom miserable bitch he muttered and heard her cruel laugh as he tottered off lucas didnt care for mornings unless he came on them from behind he liked the dawn hours if he could go home and go to bed after the sun came up but getting up before the sun wasnt natural science had proven that early birds werent as intelligent sexually vigorous or goodlooking as night owls although he couldnt tell weather she cheerfully got up every workday morning at fivethirty and was often cutting somebody open by seven oclock the governor was an early bird he was dressed in a crisp white shirt sleeves rolled two careful turns a concession to the fact that it was saturday dark gray slacks and black loafers a pale gray jacket hung from an antique coat tree in a corner of his office he looked fine but lucas could take some thin comfort from neil mitford who looked like a bad cartrain accident he was wearing jeans and a tattered tweed jacket over a blackandgold iowa hawkeyes sweatshirt and had lost his shoes somewhere he wore grayandred woolen hunting socks john mccord the bca superintendent huddled in a corner in khakis and a sweater with a rednosed reindeer on the chest rose marie roux was still among the missing coffee henderson asked cheerfully wonder where rose marie is probably killed by the cold lucas grumped or run over by a car in the dark gimme about six sugars good to get up at this time get going henderson said you get a fourhour jump on everybody youre on them before they know what hit them unless you have a heart attack and die lucas said mccord had a sixteenounce diet pepsi in his coat pocket his own i s o source of caffeine mitford drained one cup of coffee in fifteen seconds and poured another the governor settled behind his desk and sipped whats going on and what do we do about it lucas outlined the theory upon which everyone agreed that sorrell had somehow learned who had killed his child and had killed them in return thatd take some brass balls mccord said he might be like that mitford said i did some research rose marie slipped into the room said sorry it was just so damn cold and dark and found a chair henderson gave her a oneminute update and then turned back to mitford you were saying i pulled everything i could find on the guy after he graduated from cal tech he turned down a bunch of heavyduty jobs and enlisted in the army he spent six years as an infantry and then a special forces officer there are some hints that he had combat decorations but there wasnt a war going on so so he did snoopandpoops and maybe cut a few throats henderson said he seemed pleased with the snoopandpoops and the throat cutting thats what i think mitford said so henderson picked up a ballpoint pen and toyed with it leaned way back and asked the ceiling when do we take him we have enough i think we should get the dna back tomorrow morning lucas said we could go tomorrow but if anything else comes up it wouldnt hurt to wait until monday mitford seemed startled monday he looked at henderson we cant wait until monday henderson was shaking his head and said lucas when i said when i meant before breakfast or after we cant wait until tonight or tomorrow washington is killing us fifty states you know cbs yeah yeah i know it they want me to go over to channel three and do a segment at eleven oclock henderson said then theyre switching qut to fargo for a segment with washington i want to be able to say that weve made an arrest and i want to say something about what we think happened if i do that well fuck the guy washington id love to fuck him love it he turned in his chair once all the way around and then again his pink tongue stuck on his bottom lip as if tasting the word fuck his glasses glittering from the overhead lights love to fuck him itd be good mitford said and itd be national lucas began if were trying to build a case it doesnt matter look weve got x amount of information to arrest him with and to get a dna sample from him then weve got to wait a day or two to process his sample so why not grab him now just lucas looked at rose marie doesnt seem orderly can i get some of that coffee rose marie asked i talk better when i can see of course henderson said let me lucas everybody else is right and youre wrong rose marie said as henderson poured her a cup weve got two things going a big crime and a big publicity problem we can strangle the publicity problem before it gets out of control and not do much harm to the criminal case if we do hurt the criminal case mitford said what weve done is weve fucked up a case against a bright hardworking guy who employs hundreds of minnesotans and who killed a couple of thugs who kidnapped and presumably coldbloodedly murdered his daughter so fuckin what lucas said to mitford dont get your shorts in a knot and then to the governor you say take him well take him its seventhirty now i can kick del out of bed well go down and get him we can have him by say ten at the latest and you can make your announcement ive got neils cellphone number if hell be with you i will mitfbrd said he jumped up and rubbed his hands together like a cold man in front of a fire hot damn we came we saw we kicked ass and hes a republican poor bastard said rose marie you making the call lucas asked looking at henderson get him henderson said del was as much a night owl as lucas and was not happy when lucas shook him out of bed dels wife cheryl was already awake and writing bills in the kitchen when lucas arrived and she sent lucas back to the bedroom to do the dirty work lucas stuck his head in the door and cooed get up sleepyhead time to work nothing sleepyhead get up i hope you die of leprosy del moaned he pushed himself up on his elbows what do you want its not what i want lucas said its what the governor and rose marie and mccord want they want sorrell busted at ten oclock this morning and you and i are going down with a couple of bca guys in another car and were gonna drag him kicking and screaming out of his mansion cant you do it by yourself i could but then id feel bad knowing that you were up here in a nice warm bed sleeping late while i was dragging my ass all the way down to rochester all right he dropped back on the pillow just give me one more minute lucas wasnt buying that routine jenkins and shrake were the bcas official flatfeet most of the other agents had degrees in psychology or social work or accounting or computer science and worked out for two hours a day in the gym jenkins and shrake had graduated from hennepin community college with law enforcement certificates and as far as anyone knew that was the last time either had cracked a book that didnt have tom clancys name on the cover both of them smoked and drank too much both had been divorced a couple of times and lucas knew for sure that they both carried saps they were the pair most often sent to arrest people because they admitted they liked the work lucas and del were eating scrambled eggs at a bakers square restaurant on ford parkway six blocks from lucass house when the other two arrived jenkins was a heavyset man unshaven with gray hair and suspicious eyes shrake was tall and lean closely shaven with a pencilthin white mustache also grayhaired with suspicious eyes they both wore hats and buttonedup woolen overcoats and shrake had an unlit cigarette pasted to his lower lip they didnt sit they stood outside the booth looking down their hands in their coat pockets like a couple of wandering east german stasi thugs they finished each others sentences jenkins if we can bust this asshole at ten shrake we can get back up here in time to watch the playoff game jenkins if you guys dont fuck something up shrake in which case well miss the game jenkins then well tell everybody in the bca that you guys are queer shrake and that davenport is the girlie lucas continued to chew and del put a piece of bacon in his mouth and stared out the window at the ford plant across the street i think we can get it done by ten lucas said after swallowing but you guys oughta know del actually is gay and youve probably violated about six diversity guidelines del turned and stared steadily at the pair unsmiling until jenkins said not that it really matters and they all tried to laugh but it was too early in the morning and too cold and shrakes hoarse laughter trailed away into a spasm of tobacco coughs the sun was just up and the car exhausts were melting the frost on the streets leaving behind nasty little streaks of black ice too fuckin early the trip through the frozen countryside took an hour and a half with an orange sun finally groaning up over the horizon there was more snow around the cities than in the northwest and for twenty minutes they ran down the highway alongside a snowmobile rally in the adjoining ditches a couple of dozen sleds making a fast run south canadians call them snow machines del said shaking himself out of a slumber and looking out the window at the riders they were in lucass new acura suv which lucas had begun to suspect was a disguised minivan what they call them snow machines instead of snowmobiles or sleds fuckin canadians they are the spawn of the devil del agreed yawning want me to drive for a while if we stop those goddamn flatfeet are gonna pull that dodge off the road and then theyre gonna get stuck and then itll take another half hour to get down there and well all be freezing and our socks will be wet good i didnt want to drive wake me up when we get there sorrells home was eight miles outside of rochester on a rolling piece of country that might have made a decent golf course though the driveway was open lucas had the feeling that theyd triggered security sensors when they crossed between the two stone pillars that marked its entrance the driveway leading to the hilltop house was blacktopped carefully plowed and though it seemed to pass through a wood lot the trees were too aesthetically pleasing to be natural the house itself seemed modest enough from the bottom of the drive a kind of pasadena bungalow of redwood and brick with a wing only when they got closer did lucas realize how big the place was and that what looked like a wing was a garage i could put the big new house in the garage lucas said as they neared the crest of the hill you paid what a millionfive for that del said del had been trying to worm the price out of him nothing near that lucas said but this place this place would go for a millionfive or maybe six millionfive the driveway disappeared around the corner of the wing apparently to hide the utilitarian commonness of garage doors they stopped in front of the house got out waited until jenkins and shrake joined them jenkins parked his car beside lucass suv effectively blocking the driveway they walked as a group blowing steam in the cold air up the steps of the low front porch the porch had a swing as did lucass big new house and a stone walkway along the front under an overhanging eave lucas looked at jenkins and shrake said ready and jenkins said unless you want me around back lucas shook his head lets everybody be polite he said probably at work anyway shrake said the place feels empty lucas pushed the doorbell and heard the empty echo shrake was right there was something weird about houses they felt either occupied or empty and even without looking inside most street cops could feel whether there were people inside one of lucass old friends with the minneapolis police force harrison sloan theorized that people who were tiptoeing or even breathing gave off vibrations that the house amplified and that you could subconsciously feel the vibrations lucas told him he was full of shit but secretly thought he might be onto something he pushed the doorbell again and then a third time jenkins moved down the walkway to a line of windows and tried to see inside trying one window after another halfway down he stopped and moved his head up and down his hand against the glass of the storm window blocking reflections then he shook his head and said ill be right back he went out to the dodge popped the trunk and fished out a twentypound yellowhandled maul as he climbed back up the porch lucas said what are you doing gonna knock the door down jenkins said what are you talking about del asked jenkins sighed as if instructing a slow student if you look through that window youll see a hand and an arm just a hand and an arm sticking out of a hallway into the kitchen it looks to me like a dead hand but i cant be sure it might still be a live hand that dies while we stand here bullshitting so if youll stand back lucas turned to del who said oh boy and to shrake who said gloomily there goes the fuckin playoff game jenkins had a nice smooth woodchopping swing and the edge of the maul hit just above the doorknob blowing the door open jenkins stepped back and lucas slipped his out of its holster and pushed the door open with his knuckles del to one side with his clock pointed overhead said im going and then he was inside with lucas two steps behind and jenkins behind him shrake had jogged around to the back just in case guy down here del said and lucas moved forward and then del said another one and lucas saw the first body sprawled in the hallway one arm sticking like a chicken claw into the kitchen sorrell lucas recognized him from the photographs except that the photographs didnt have a bullet hole in the face del was moving and lucas moved with him and lucas saw the woman facedown in a puddle of blood like sorrell she was wearing a bathrobe and one leg stuck out toward lucas as hed done with the door he stooped and touched her leg with his knuckles not cold still some warmth not long ago lucas said lets clear the first floor del said lucas spoke over his shoulder to jenkins put a gun on the stairs were gonna clear the floor gotcha jenkins said he moved to the base of a curling stairway with a blondwood railing his pistol pointed generally up the stairs lucas and del took two minutes clearing the first floor slowing to pop the back door and let shrake in when the floor was clear shrake and jenkins took the basement and lucas and del took the second floor although all four believed the house was empty except for themselves and the bodies and it was lucas came back down the stairs tucking the gun away and said lets move it out on the porch make some calls the first call went to the olmsted county sheriffs office lucas identified himself gave the dispatcher a quick summary of the situation for the recording tape and got the sheriffs cell phone the sheriff took the call on the second ring listened for a moment then said oh my god im on my way bring the me and tell him were gonna need some fast body temps then he called the governor through mitford neil get me a number for the governor like right now mitford said hes next door hang on ill walk the phone over did you get him not exactly lucas said henderson took the line get him we busted down the door of his house and found sorrell and a woman who i expect is his wife dead in the front hallway shot to death looks like executions looks like theyd just come down in their bathrobes and were shot like somebody got them out of bed bodies arent quite cold good lord did you touch them yeah the sheriffs on the way with the me lucas said he was standing on the porch and down at the bottom of the hill he could see a patrol car flying down the approach road slowing for the driveway weve got one coming in right now what do you think i dont know im a little stunned but id say that either joes not dead and he came back or that theres another player what do i do with the cbs interview you got what an hour ill talk to the sheriff about notifying the next of kin tell them that its critical to move fast if we can get that done you could make the announcement i wouldnt make the announcement though before the nextofkin notification not unless we get some media out here or something as cover if you do itll come back to bite you on the ass some relative talking to tv about how he heard it first from you and how awful it was let me think about that henderson said in the meantime get the sheriff to find the next of kin okay lucas said take down a number henderson said he read off a phone number and lucas jotted it in the palm of his hand thats the red cell phone about ten people have the number so dont call it too often but call me on this okay you know if you look at this one way our problem was solved pretty quickly i wouldnt look at it that way lucas said not in public anyway call me back henderson said and he was gone the sheriffs car reached the top of the hill and pulled around jenkinss dodge slid to a stop in the snow an applecheeked deputy jumped out of the drivers side and staying behind his car hand on his holstered sixgun the other hand pointed at the cops on the porch shouted all right all right jesus christ calm down shrake said from where he was leaning on the porch rail he blew a stream of cigarette smoke at the kid were really important state cops and youre just a kid whos not important at all that confused the deputy and slowed him down where are the casualties he asked no longer shouting there are two dead bodies inside hale sorrell and we think his wife lucas said oh god the kid jumped back inside the car and they could see him calling in lucass cell phone rang and rose marie was on the line you gotta be kidding me he moved down the walkway under the eaves were not we dont know anything except that theres probably nobody inside the house except the dead people i havent had a chance to think about anything sorrell for sure yeah you ever meet his wife a time or two sorrells age midforties probably dark hair a little heavy short thats her ninetynine percent lucas said do i need to be there no the locals are arriving and ive got hendersons direct line if i were you id get next to the governor and guide his footsteps so as to avoid the dogshit ill do that call if you need anything she said and was gone the sheriffs name was brad wilson and he arrived ten minutes after the first car came in by that time there were four sheriifs deputies on the scene two of them on the porch two more sent around to cover the back just in case but mostly to get them out of lucass hair the sheriff was an older barrelchested man wearing a pearlhandled on a gunbelt he and lucas had met once when lucas was working with minneapolis lucas thought him competent and maybe better than that you attract more goddamned trouble davenport the sheriff said as he came up males dead and mary come on and take a look weve been keeping everybody out so the crime scene guysll have a chance the sheriff nodded and followed lucas inside stepping carefully they stood back but the sheriff leaning over sorrell said thats hale and thats mary god bless me howd you come to find them we came up here to arrest him on murder charges lucas said sorrells the guy who hanged those two people up north the sheriffs mouth dropped open then snapped close after a moment he said you wouldnt be pulling my leg would you no the two people he hanged were probably the people who kidnapped his daughter you better tell me the sheriff said he looked a last time at the two figures on the floor holy mackerel and i got to call the feds they are going to wet their pants after the sheriff called the fbi lucas got him to dispatch pairs of deputies to local homeowners we want to know if anybody saw a car or any other kind of vehicle here this morning or late last night or anything else for that matter ask them if they ever saw sorrell in a red jeep cherokee the first media trucks from rochester began arriving fifteen minutes later twenty minutes after that a twin cities media helicopter flew over hale sorrelts parents and mary sorrelts mother were notified of the deaths by the sheriffs chaplain and said that they would notify other family members lucas called henderson youre good to go next of kin are notified excellent how are things down there were just mostly standing around waiting for the medical examiner he was off somewhere but hes on his way now at eleven oclock still waiting for the medical examiner they filed into a home theater turned on the fiftyinch flatpanel television and watched henderson do the interview with cbs somebody mitford probably had roughed him up his hair wasnt quite as smooth as it usually was and a fat brown file envelope sat on the table in front of him he looked like the harried executive with bad news and he delivered it straight ahead no punches pulled jesus he looks almost tough del said washington came on a moonfaced black man with a dark suit and white shirt a man who knew hed been seriously oneupped the dead people were dope dealers and kidnappers the hangman and his wife had been executed in their hallway i feel there were some serious investigative shortcomings in custer county and im calling on the federal government to blahblahblahblah bullshit bullshit bullshit del said it aint workin fifteen minutes after they were off the air henderson called anything new no you looked pretty good thanks we heard washington is on his way home to chicago god bless him jenkins and shrake were in the media room watching the playoff from premium leatherpaneled theater seats del was prowling the house checking desks and bureaus and calendars and computer files twenty minutes after he began he handed lucas a piece of paper an iowa title transfer application from a curtis frank of des moines to a larry smith of oelwein iowa on the purchase of a jeep cherokee dated three weeks earlier check the oelwein address lucas asked no but i will bet you a buck its fake the me had arrived and after fussing around checked the blood puddles and body temps sorrell and his wife had certainly been killed sometime after midnight he said and after he got some weights and checked the accuracy of the house thermostat and the floorlevel temperatures he said he could probably do better than that off the top of my head id say they were killed this morning he said theyre a little too warm to have lain on the floor all night and the blood is a little too liquid but well have to do the numbers before we know for sure sheriff wilson was standing by the door and said here come the feds just what we needed who lanny cole and jim green pretty good guys actually mmm i know cole i dont know green del came back and said theres no such address in oelwein its fake there is a curtis frank and he says he sold the truck for cash i talked to des moines homicide cops and theyll take a picture of sorrell down to his house for an id he saw the men in suits coming up to the door and said feebs cole the fbi agent shook hands with the sheriff and said how ya doing brad and nodded at lucas and asked they got any more jobs over there at the bca i got a slot for a female investigator lucas said i can investigate females cole said so what happened here wilson and lucas took him through it lucas connecting sorrell with the hangings in custer county i gotta call in on that cole said squatting next to sorrell we got civil rights guys on the way to take a look at it you say hale did it most likely cole nodded and looked at his partner who said we knew something was seriously screwed up didnt know it was that screwed up cole said he looked down at the body again and said goddamnit hale whatd you do you guys want in on this act lucas asked cole shook his head were gonna want to know all about it if you could forward your findings but were not going to get directly involved we just dont have the manpower what with discovering arab terror plots at the washington county courthouse sheriff wilson looked at lucas and said doesnt make any sense for us to do it it doesnt sound like the killers from around here so you got it ill call john mccord right now and ask you in good enough lucas said if your guys come up with anything they can pass it up to me and ill coordinate with lanny and jim to the feds any problem getting your files on the kidnapping ill talk to the sac from here we should be able to give you the file this afternoon back to wilson can you handle the press down here i can do that so were set the fbi agents visited nothing more and at noon they left a bca crime scene crew arrived from the twin cities and lucas eventually joined del in turning over the house looking at pieces of paper they found nothing of interest but couldnt get into three of the sorrells four computers the two desktop machines one in a library and another in a home office and a laptop in sorrells briefcase were passwordprotected and would have to be cracked by computer people a fourth laptop apparently belonging to mary sorrell was not protected but contained nothing but letters a personal calendar and a few documents relating to a heart disease research foundation lucas was returning sorrells machine to the briefcase when he found an envelope with a bank letterhead inside were twenty separate receipts for bank drafts each for with each check made to a different major las vegas hotel a million dollars del said high roller maybe that had something to do with the kidnapping gambling debts or something these cant be all for him lucas said looking at the receipts every one of the hotels is different maybe its a business thing a convention its weird we oughta look at it at one oclock with del getting restless lucas was ready to leave he turned control of the house over to carl driscoll the head of the bca crime scene crew who said hed get the computers to st paul if anything conics up call me lucas told him all the routine stuff get it in your own computer i think del and i are probably headed back to custer county and you can email it to me the sheriff had just come back up the hill after talking with reporters shook his head and said this is gonna get goofy the governors statement its gonna get goofy never was gonna be any other way lucas said not after those two people went up in that tree lucas got his coat collected del and as they headed for the door saw a fortyish man in a gray overcoat walking around the line of cop cars in the driveway closely trailed by a deputy he was carrying a walletsized box and when he saw the sheriff step out on the porch with lucas he called hey brad george you heard about hale i guess wilson said to lucas hales lawyer my god i was at a wedding ken hendricks kid the lawyer said as he came up to them he looked back down the hill i got here as fast as i could but i had a heck of a time getting through your boys down there not much for you to do here george yes there is a week ago hale gave me a box he handed the box to the sheriff it was about four inches by five an inch thick a toughlooking lock was set flush to the polished steel surface at one edge he said i swear to god that if he should die i should give this to the authorities i asked him if it was anything illegal and he said no its just some information that he felt should come to official attention i thought maybe it was business but now whats in it i dont know the lawyer said he gave it to me told me to file it and forget it he said it couldnt be opened without destroying the contents unless you used a key he said the key was on his key ring with his car keys wilson looked at the box then handed it to lucas ever see anything like that yeah it looks like a magneticmedia safe for carrying around computer smart cards and so on its bigger than most of them and ive never seen a lock before his key ring is on the bedside table del said i checked to see if there was a jeep key on it lets go look lucas said maybe we ought to do it in a lab wilson said doubtfully its not a bomb its something he wanted us to get lucas said del retrieved the key ring which contained one key with a circular blade lucas popped the top on the safe and inside was an oldfashioned inch computer floppy disk laptop del said they took mary sorrells ibm laptop out of her briefcase put it on the floor of the home office the base unit had no floppy drive but they found the drive in a separate pouch and plugged it in lucas brought the laptop up slipped the floppy into the drive and found one file he clicked on the file microsoft word began opening on the screen and then the file itself a note a brief note tammy sorrell was kidnapped by joe kelly deon cash and jane warr cash is a driver for the gene calb truck rehabilitation service in the town of broderick near armstrong minnesota jane warr is a card dealer at the moose bay casino near armstrong warr and cash live together in a farmhouse in broderick they killed tammy on dec and buried her somewhere nearby the exact location is unknown this information has been confirmed jeez there it is wilson said looking up at lucas where did he get the information the fbi says that the kidnappers never called the feds even started looking at males background to see if he might have had something to do with tammy you know lucas touched the computer screen he says kelly cash and warr did the kidnapping and that cash is a driver for the truck place he doesnt say anything more about joe i think he mustve got the information from joe where else would he get it wilson pursed his lips so joe i think joes outa here lucas said if sorrell was special forces maybe he had some training with pliers and fingernails you dont think joe did this wilson gestured out toward the kitchen where the two bodies still lay on the floor its possible but how the hell would sorrell know about cash and warr i think he probably grabbed joe when joe came for the money lucas said he looked at the note again frowned i thought all the stories were about the rich girl being kidnapped on christmas eve and all the gifts around the tree she was wilson shook his head maybe its a typo maybe he meant the twentyfourth and typed the twentysecond pretty unlikely del grunted thats one thing youd get right in that kind of note those bank draft receipts the ones that went to vegas lucas had returned them to the briefcase where he found them to have them checked later now he retrieved them and looked at the dates theyre dated december twentieth he took a million dollars in cashiers checks to las vegas on the twentieth what do you think wilson asked could you get one of the bank managers to check on when the drafts were cashed lucas asked wilson looked at his watch its saturday maybe let me call somebody maybe lucas scratched his chin and looked at del maybe he was collecting money in vegas he got drafts from his bank then spent three days withdrawing the money from his vegas accounts he was collecting cash to pay the kidnappers del nodded couldnt just walk into a bank and ask for a million in cash how else would you get it but a bunch of bank drafts for vegas hotels he couldve even passed it off as a business thing with the banks so tammy wasnt kidnapped on the twentyfourth lucas said they got her sooner than that huh theyd been squatting next to mary sorrells computer and now they all stood up but there was something that sorrell didnt get from joe or cash or warr there must be a fourth man or woman or maybe a fourth fifth and sixth somebody who knew what it meant when cash and warr got hanged and didnt want sorrell talking about it del said couldnt risk it why couldnt he risk it wilson asked del said because he didnt know if sorrell was finished didnt know whether or not sorrell had his name didnt know what jane and deon might have told him wilson scratched his head and said shoot and a moment later goldarnit lucas said to del we better get back up north del nodded but we wouldnt get up there before dark if we left now we should catch a nap this afternoon leave really early tomorrow three in the morning get there when the sun comes up take that little town apart saturday afternoon just after dark loren singleton rolled along highway listening to the radio he was tired despite a long nap from the overnight round trip to the sorrells and back a snow squall bothered his windshield little pecks and flecks of ice whirling down from the north hed been horrified by the shooting as he hadnt been by the killing of the little girls the little girls just seemed to go to sleep and he hadnt really done that hed just been there at the same time there was something about the sorrell killings that left him feeling larger tougher he tried to find the exact word studlier that embarrassed him but it might be close the lights of broderick came up through the blowing snow the cafe and the gas station two dimly lit windows at the church a beer sign in the bar and then he noticed the light in the back of calbs the office was lit up as though there were a meeting going on he pulled the caddy into the parking lot watched for shadows on the window somebody looking to see whod pulled in mid when he got none climbed out of the car and walked over to the shop and tried the door the door was locked as it should be after dark on saturday still the lights he walked around the side of the building and peeked through a window and found a meeting gene calb ruth and katina lewis and a black man that singleton had never seen before both women had taken their coats off as if theyd been there a while the black man was leaning back in an office chair idly swiveling a few inches from left to right singleton watched for a while but couldnt hear anything why had they left him out were they suspicious he eventually crunched back around to the caddy climbed inside rolled back to get square with the overhead door and punched the garagedoor opener as the door went up he eased the caddy inside punched the remote again and as the door started back down got out of the car calb and katina were standing by the corner of the bay calb with a cup of coffee in his hand hey come on back were having an argument whos we singleton asked me and shawn davis and ruth and katina calb said shawn came up from kg you heard about the sorrell thing on the radio a while ago singleton said what do you think thats what were arguing about katina said i tried calling you but didnt get an answer been running around singleton said he looked at the bridge of her nose rather than in her eyes so she wouldnt see the lie in his eyes and he thought okay they tried to call him so they werent cutting him out he started past her but she caught his arm and stood on tiptoe and kissed him on the cheek and asked you busy tonight i sure got some time if you do he said she stepped ahead of him and he touched her on the butt inside the office calb introduced him to davis davis was a toughlooking fortyfive not impressed by much he lifted a hand and nodded and singleton gave him his best grim cowboy look you got any special insight into this mess davis asked him in a twangy missouri drawl gene said you knew deon and jane and joe as well as anyone up here singleton hurried to deflect that idea i have no idea whats going on i used to stop by and talk to deon but that was just part of my deal you know keep an eye out i keep thinking its joe that maybe they had a fight or something joes dead davis said bluntly he never went more than five miles from his mama in his life until he come up here called her every day then he talked to her one night and the next day he was gone she hasnt heard a word since hes dead goddamn calb said he stood up and wandered in a tight circle his hands jammed in the back pockets of his jeans this kidnapping if they think its outa here they could be all over me you too shawn if they really started pounding my books looking at how many people i employ and how much commercial rehab we do they could give me some trouble might be time for a fire singleton said they all looked at him for a moment and then calb said youre not serious take care of the book problem singleton said calbs eyes rolled heavenward as in prayer and he said it wouldnt take care of shit loren youve never been a businessman therere records all over the goddamn place payroll tax receipts workmans comp insurance income tax the only thing that would happen if i burned down the shop is that id have a burneddown shop then theyd really get interested if they get really interested theyre gonna get to all of us including you loren and the women too which gets us away from the question i want answered and i want to know that im being told the truth ruth said squaring off against calb and davis she had her wintery fighting smile fixed on her face this kidnapping thing this sorrell girl you didnt know about it you didnt have any part of it either of you this wasnt some kind of moneymaking deal that went wrong my god ruth no never im not nuts calb said the way he said it made her believe him davis was quieter but just as convincing the thing is ruth if these news stories are right the kidnappers wanted a million bucks for this kid they were gonna cut it three ways that we know of and probably had to be four since it seems like theres a fourth one on the loose thatd be a quartermillion apiece for risking the death sentence gene and i make that much every year just running our quiet little car business there wouldnt be no sense in it some sense for somebody like deon singleton said he was getting nothing but chump change just like you loren and both of you happy to get it calb snapped hey shut up ruth said she looked at the two men poked a finger at them we dont need a quarrel so what does gene say to the police he plays dumb davis said thatll work if you let it work if you dont get smart you go ahead and sweat and wiggle around and apologize the man always likes to see that but just be dumb yeah you hired him because i asked you to to get him out of the neighborhood they come to me and i say hell yes it was a big favor getting deon off my back and his old lady too we tell them that his pay probably wasnt enough for some city boy who wants to put cocaine up his nose and so he went off on his own davis continued i mean this thing they did with this little girl deons crazy enough but no cop down in kg who knows me would say that id do it nobody up here would think that gene would either he paused and in the absence of words a fullcolor motion picture popped up behind singletons eyes a picture of mom getting the little bottle of drugs out of her bag and the syringe and sucking the fluid out and holding the needle up and squirting a little bit of it then putting the smile on her face before she went in with the girl the older girl might have known what was going on shed taken the shot with a darkeyed passivity her eyes locked on singletons shed had a blue ribbon in her hair with a knot in the middle the younger one had a stuffed toy that jane had gotten her a handsized whitemouse puppet with a pink tail shed said okay and had lain back on the folding bed and rolled her arm around to take the shot brave little kid went to sleep with the mouse on her chest hed dug her down through the clay cap and placed her in a pile of old yellow pages phone books and that was that wasnt hard didnt seem crazy just was davis started talking again and popped singleton out of the mental movie so we play it dumb what you see is what you got three dumb assholes decide to kidnap a girl because they want more money and they get killed for their trouble four dumb assholes calb said distractedly maybe the other guy was like down on the other end of the thing set up the girl or something he looked at singleton they never mentioned a friend or anything no they kept talking about all their friends down in kg whatever ruth said the thing is i need something to tell the women who work with me some of them are afraid that somehow everything is linked the cars the drugs and the kidnapping if somebody put pressure on them came at them the right way theyd probably give up the whole story feel morally obligated to shit davis said well i agree with them ruth said showing the cold smile again the only difference is i know gene she lifted a hand toward calb if i thought we had anything to do with all of this id go to the police myself but i think it was deon cash and jane warr and joe trying to make some money and the fact is even though we dont know anything about it it could drag us all down so tell them the truth calb said tell them that were just as scared and confused as they are we dont know what the hells happening and were desperate to find out dumb is best davis said again believe me on that you dont know no thin about no thin if you dont know nothin nobody can trip you up not your friends not the cops they talked for another halfhour and then broke up davis said he was heading back to kg that night after eating dinner at the calbs katina walked out with singleton and ruth ruth kept going across the highway and down toward the church katina held back and said id like to come over youre the goddamned horniest little thing singleton said he touched her face and said dont worry you worry too much i just want everything to be right she said you never talked to deon about anything did you by anything she meant the kidnappings singleton realized jeez katina he was insulted im sorry im just so upset itll be okay honey not just that i sorta need to get close to somebody after all this she stood close to him and fumbled for his hand so come over well just you know hang out ill see you there lewis said ill take my car so i can get back maybe we could go down to the bird for dinner love you singleton said talking down to her first time hed said that no place romantic just standing in a snowswept parking lot in the middle of nowhere love you he said sunday lucas and del went north in a twocar convoy lucas leading in the acura del trailing in the rented olds they left the big new house at threethirty in the morning out past the airport around the sleeping suburbs then northwest on rose marie had called ahead and cleared them with the overnight highway patrolmen and lucas put the cruise control on eightyfive with del drafting behind him they made the turn north at fargo in three hours picking up a few snowflakes as they crossed the narrow cut of the red river the snow got heavier as they drove north up but was never bad enough to slow them after a quick coffeeandgas stop at grand forks they continued north then cut back across the border to armstrong and pulled into the law enforcement center a few minutes before nine oclock bitter cold now but the snow had quit for the moment more was due during the day and lucas wanted to get started in broderiok before conditions got too bad the sheriff wasnt around probably at church the comm center man said so they left a message that theyd be somewhere around armstrong or broderick then stopped at the motel with the discovery of the bodies of hale and mary sorrell most of the reporters had gone and they got rooms immediately like a land office in here the night before last the clerk said now were back to sleepy hollow all the reporters gone all but one the clerk leaned across the desk and dropped his voice a black guy from chicago he says hes a reporter but i wouldnt be too sure hmm lucas said wisely and took the room key on the way out of broderick rolling through the bleak landscape del punched up the cd player and found bob segers turn the page in the cover version by metallica they listened for a while and then del said i like segers better close call theyre both good lucas said i go for the metallica great goddamn album anyway dusty fuckers versus metal heads and you always leaned toward the metal del said back when you were running around town on that bike i remember when you went to that first ac dc concert you talked about it for weeks they kept your motor clean lucas said they were coming up on broderick tell you what lets go on through town and find that kid letty west a ford taurus was parked in the yard next to the wests cherokee lucas and del trooped across the porch and martha west met them at the door before they had a chance to knock the state policemen she said to the room behind her she pushed the door open and said cmon in the front room was too warm and smelled of wool and lucas thought old wine and maybe windex or lemon pledge letty was sitting on a piano bench in front of a brokenlooking hammond organ a short muscular black man with a notebook was perched in an easy chair fortyfive degrees to her right a nikon dlx by his feet a pillow sat on the floor at the third point of the triangle where martha west had apparently been sitting hey lucas and del letty said she got up smiling did you see me on tv all over the place del said you were like mickey mouse martha west said weve been having an interview with mr johnson from the chicago she looked for the name but couldnt find it tribune the black man said standing up he wore round goldrimmed glasses and looked like he might once have been a lineman for northwestern mark johnson he reached out to shake hands with lucas and then with del youre agents davenport and capslock lucas nodded im davenport and this is capslock im surprised youre here your friends got out of town fast enough he said mostly tv johnson said as if that explained everything we need to talk to martha and letty but we dont want to disturb your interview lucas said we can come back if youd like johnson shook his head i got most of what i was looking for im trying to figure out how in the hell cash ever wound up here learn anything no the guy down in the car shop wont talk because hes afraid hell get busted or even worse get sued the guy with the dogs wont talk to me because of his american principles and the women at the church think im probably a rapist because im black but theyre too nice to say so we cant help you with cash lucas said wed like to know ourselves he just doesnt fit he was purebred city johnson agreed i called some people down in kg and they tell me theres no truckdriving job in the world thatd keep him up here hed rather have some cheapass job like robbing elevens interesting lucas said it is johnson said gesturing with his notebook now you tell me something do you really think cash and this joe guy and jane warr kidnapped the sorrell girl if they did why in the heck would they be out in the country where everybody could see them coming and going and know every move they made i dont know lucas said but i think they were involved in the kidnapping i think they did it for the money and well eventually nail it down weve got a state crime scene crew taking their cars apart looking for dna that might tie them to the girl can you tell me precisely why you think they were involved the notebook was poised again lucas thought it over then asked do you know deke harrison yeah sure hes my guy at the trib johnson said he runs our desk he used to come through the cities lucas said for years wed go out and get a drink yeah thats my job now he moved up johnson said tell him to give me a call lucas said ive got a cell phone lucas gave johnson the cell phone number johnson said goodbye to lucas and del went out through the door and then a moment later stuck his head back inside find a good place to eat letty said the red red robin thats the best god help us johnson said and he was gone letty put her hands on her hips and looked at lucas hey whats that supposed to mean lucas told letty and martha west what they needed any hint of an irregularity around the cashwarr property there is no body in the house we took the place apart after we found the money and the dope so they mustve buried her letty said crossing her lips with both of her forefingers thinking martha shivered at the thought and looked at her daughter letty seemed more interested than scared i imagine they did lucas said but out here theres ten thousand square miles of unbroken dirt and bog yeah but even out here theres always people going by you couldnt just drive out somewhere and spend an hour digging a grave and be sure nobody saw you letty said people see you out here because wherever you are youre unusual they notice you ill be walking across the lake down by the old dump and two days later somebodyll say saw you down by the dump with your gun and i never saw them gives me the creeps martha west said you got no privacy letty looked out the window the white winter light picking out her blue eyes still not much snow why dont we go look around she asked ill come with you see if i can see anything i walk up and down there all the time on my way to the crick if we wait until tomorrow there might be too much snow mustve been snow since the girl was taken del said she was taken before christmas theres been some but not much letty said if you guys are gonna take letty could i get you to buy her some lunch or something martha west asked ive got to run into town for a while sure del said down to the bird martha west was suddenly in a hurry and del looked past letty at lucas catching his eye with an uhoh twist of his head martha west needed a drink right now lucas nodded and said to letty get your coat want me to bring the that wont be necessary piece of crap anyway she said and headed up the stairs to her bedroom martha west was gone before letty came back down letty came down wearing a slightly too big parka pac boots and carrying a pair of mittens sgo she said clumping through the living room to the door your moms already gone del said straight to the duck inn letty said she added without irony in a voice that sounded older than her twelve years its a tragedy they drove back down to the cash warr house in the acura letty fascinated by the crt screen in the dashboard can you play movies on it nope you get the information screen and the map screen and thats it unless you have to eject lucas kept his voice flat he was a firm believer in lying to children if you need to eject you go to the information screen and push history and one second later youre history throws you right out of the car through the moon roof letty in the back seat thought about it for a second then said its not nice to fuck with kids del twisted and said jesus christ watch your mouth little girl two vehicles were sitting in the driveway at the cash warr house a bca crime scene van and a sheriffs department car lucas pulled in behind them they all climbed out and a deputy sheriff came out on the stoop and said your guys are out in the garage if youre looking for them thanks lucas called back they trudged up the driveway to the garage and went in through the side door a bca tech was standing at the open trunk of jane warrs car and said hey guys when he spoke another man shorter and stockier backed out of the trunk he was holding a plastic bag and a pair of forceps a magnifying hood was pulled down over his glasses and his eyes appeared to be the size of ashtrays doing any good lucas asked the trunk is full of stuff weve got hair for sure we might have some blood but it could be something else too the shorter man said typical trunk how about cashs car same thing all kinds of stuff how long before we know if anythings good the taller tech shrugged depends on how much stuff there is a week or two anything we can do for you were gonna look around the grounds lucas said see what there is to see uh dickerson called this morning said something about a guy with groundpenetrating radar could happen lucas said but he cant do the whole place thatd take weeks were gonna see if we can find a place to start good luck lucas del and letty went back outside and lucas turned around once looking at the house the garage an old dying tree line that once marked the southern boundary of the farmyard a fence that might have marked the western end if you had to bury somebody letty said i wouldnt do it here del said turning like lucas id take her someplace everybody in the state was looking for her probably not yet when they killed her if they killed her before sorrell brought in the fbi but they couldnt be absolutely sure that he hadnt done that right away lucas said if they had her here in that cell they wouldnt want to take her too far especially if like letty says everybody sees things here everybody would remember a black guy with a little blond girl up here even if they thought it was innocent keep her in the trunk too many things to go wrong lucas said they drove her all the way up here from rochester what can i tell you they did that maybe but when it came to getting rid of her do you think theyd drive her all the way back down and take another big risk dunno del said i just dont know where we could start looking letty pointed out there in the trees thats the crick fiveminute walk you could carry a bag if you walked out there right at dark nobody would see you and you could walk back in the dark how old was she eleven skinny not fat lucas said sort of fleshy minnesota skinny thats it so she weighs seventy or eighty pounds fiveminute walk youd leave footprints del said not in december i remember how cold it was but it wasnt snowing we had hardly any snow at christmas lets go look lucas said the creek began asa swale in a farm field narrowed into a line not really a depression toward the back of the cash warr land and finally deepened into a kneedeep notch in the black earth surrounded by willows and box elders they started with the first tree at the north end of the property and followed the deepening notch into the thicker line of trees and brush walking on the ice of the little creek itself the band of trees was no more than thirty yards wide they followed the creek for two hundred yards until it ended in a bog they saw nothing unusual no disturbed earth and the only tracks they found had probably been left by letty they finally walked back up the creek halfway back three dogs began barking from the back of a house that lay down the highway from cashs place they were black and brown squarefaced crazy pit bulls thats the dogs ive been telling you about letty said scare the heck out of me del admitted to letty they ever let them out on you you shoot first and ask questions later lucas was annoyed you just stay away from there he said you dont need to do any shooting maybe they fed the kid to the dogs letty suggested goddamnit lucas said and as they came to the top of the creek goddamnit we could be standing ten feet from the sorrell kid and not know it how would you do it letty asked she looked up at del if you killed a little kid and brought her out here where would you put her del said i dont think you should be here cmon del look around whatd you do she asked lucas looked around then down at his feet is there always water in the creek no but most of the time there is under the creek del asked skeptically its a possibility lucas said but if he was going to dig around here i bet hed be down here in the creek bed maybe digging in the bottom or in the creek bank couldnt be seen but he could see people coming unless it was at night letty said they walked up and down the creek ice looking at the banks but couldnt find anything unusual lucas probed a low cutbank with a stick then shook his head and threw the stick back into the trees we need the crime scene guys down here and the radar guy and maybe some dogs or something discouraged they walked across the thin crunchy snow back up to the house and lucas looked at his watch and said little early for lunch but we could get some breakfast can i see the cell letty asked the room in the basement fuckin tv del said the cell had been mentioned prominently watch your mouth around a kid letty said payback for the little girl comment to lucas id really like to go down there im a kid maybe i could think like a kid or something lucas sighed looked at del then said all right two minutes they trooped through the house nodded to the deputy and took letty into the basement inside the bathroom the cell she turned round and round then sat down on the floor then lay down and looked at the ceiling her arms outstretched as though she were making a snow angel she closed her eyes and a minute later she said if they left me here alone if they left me here alone i would try to write my name somewhere she opened her eyes found lucass eyes and asked what do you think sit up lucas said she sat up and lucas and del sat down and they began scrutinizing the walls nothing apparent lucas stood up pulled the top off the toilet tank and looked inside nothing visible lucas flushed watched the water go down pulled the float to stop water and groped around the bottom of the tank with his hand the shower stall was bare not even a bar of soap he pulled open the medicine cabinet found it empty del looked inside the cabinet under the sink and found four rolls of toilet paper he looked through all the toilet paper tubes empty lucas checked the rim on the top of the medicine cabinet and got his fingers dusty i would write something letty said a little defensively i would scratch it with something she crawled around on her hands and knees peering at the baseboard then del whod crawled over to the toilet said got something here what lucas got down on his stomach and letty crawled over del was lying face up something twisted around the water line its a chain let me he fumbled under the tank said uhhh then got it he slid out from under the toilet a silver locket a small oval dangled from his fingers on a short silver chain aw jesus lucas said dont fuckin move dont even twitch lucas ran up the stairs dashed through the house to the mudroom door outside to the garage and said you guys get some shit get some baggies and those tweezers cmon back down in the basement the stocky crime scene guy grabbed the locket with his forceps held it sideways to one of the overhead lights and said theres a partial print on the back if its not yours he looked down at del who shook his head not mine i never touched the locket part only the chain looks like a good print the tech said he turned it in the light its got an inscription the locket does what the techs lips moved as he worked through the script then he frowned and asked who the heck are jean and wally lucas scratched his head maybe somebody the sorrell kid knew her grandparents or somebody whoever she put it down there del said the locket didnt just fall in there whered you find it the tech asked del explained and the tech looked around and finally said did you check the mirror and the shower booth walls if she used hot water in here theyd get steamed up and shed write in the steam if she had soap or shampoo or oil on her fingers you might get the image back i do that every time im in the bathtub letty said i write on the mirror when i get out lucas said worth a try i guess the tech said let me put this away and get my camera huh wally and jean while the tech went to put the locket away lucas trailed by letty went out to the car got his address book out of his briefcase and looked up the numbers for the fbi agents on the sorrell case he got lanny coles wife on the second ring and she said cole was out shoveling the walk just had a quick two inches she said of snow lucas heard her calling her husband then some stomping around and then cole was on the line he didnt know the names on the locket we were told that she probably wasnt wearing any jewelry when she was taken she was just a kid and she had a pretty limited set of stuff nothing like a locket far as i know sorry thought we had something lucas said its weird ill ask around cole said i wouldnt hold my breath maybe the print will turn out to be something lucas hung up and letty said no luck not yet its gotta be something letty said it didnt belong to the plumber both techs were in the basement with del the hot water pouring out of the shower when lucas and letty got back down the stairs they halfclosed the door of the bathroom waited fifteen seconds the mirror steamed and showed several fingerdrawn lines but nothing they could make sense of the tech took a picture anyway the walls of the shower showed what looked liked sponge marks somebody cleaned up the tech said good try guys lucas said feeling a little morose they all wandered back up the stahs and the burly tech said that hed recheck the walls with his magnifying hood as soon as the humidity cleared maybe somebody wrote really small itd be about the only thing you could do it was a good idea looking for a name it turned up the locket thatll be something lucas looked at letty maybe you oughta be a cop letty shook her head nope im going to be a reporter its decided lucas said to del we could be responsible for that ill never feel clean again del said want to head down to the bird my gut says its lunchtime they rode down to the red red robin in near silence all thinking about the house and where the sorrell kids body might be del finally said if they thought they ever might be suspected of anything they wouldnt want a body anywhere around they mustve driven it out into the countryside all right if theyre seen theyre seen but they could fix it so they werent scout out a spot ahead of time dig a hole drop the body during the night fill the hole itd only take a couple of minutes and get out of there yeah i know lucas said shes probably gone for good the bird was as belowaverage as it was the first couple of times belowaverage coffee belowaverage food belowaverage letty ate everything in sight with the shiftyeyed compulsion of a kid whod gone to bed hungry a few times who was afraid the food might disappear you okay with your mom del asked halfway through the meal gettin this far with her was the hard part letty said working around the edges of the mashed potatoes so the gravy wouldnt spill out of the center cup now that im in middle school things are smoother i ride the bus back and forth she can do what she needs to just checkin del said ive had a little trouble with alcohol myself its a bitch to get off your back but it can be done you drink letty asked lucas holding his eyes lucas shook his head a bottle of beer few times a week i never got the hang of it thats good letty said the phone in lucass pocket rang and he pulled it out davenport hey lucas this is lanny cole the fbi man sounded like he was having a hard time catching his breath you said wally and jean on that locket it was a white gold oval locket with a white gold chain and the names in script in the front oval picture of an elderly couple inside we didnt look inside because of the print but you got the rest of it except that i thought it was silver lucas said was it tammy sorrells no no it belonged to a girl named annie burke fifteen daughter of the owner of a chain of nursing homes from lincoln nebraska one of our guys downtown remembered the locket thing she was kidnapped last april a milliondollar ransom was paid but she was never returned never heard from again the deal was the kidnappers told burkes father that they had an in with the fbi and they left him a pack of papers that looked like fbi printouts they told him that if he contacted the fbi or any police agency they would know he bought it made the payoff and get this he got the money in vegas same way hale did oh boy letty said what were coming up there cole said we need that locket we need that fingerprint ill talk to your boss what do you need up there you got people who can look for soft spots in the ground under the snow we got that we have a team in california who do exactly that they can be here in fortyeight hours bring them in lucas said after lunch they took a protesting letty back to her house i can still help you if we need you well stop by lucas said we really do appreciate what youve done her face anxious she asked if i get my traps real fast could you drop me at the dump its only five minutes in the car i can walk back lucas said were pretty busy i helped you she said i need to get some clothes tv might come back lucas sighed get the traps she took ten minutes getting into an old pair of jeans her boots and her parka she got a can of genericbrand tuna cat food from under the kitchen sink bait the gunny sack with her traps and her the was an old harrington richardson bolt action singleshot probably made in the s she tossed it all in the back of the acura six miles north of broderick on a back road the landfill was marked by a clan of crows flapping overhead like little specks of india ink thrown against the gray sky lucas pulled into the entrance road next to a sign that said quadcounty landfill and stopped by a locked gate inside the landfill a small caterpillar sat at the base of a wall of garbage lucas got out of the truck at the same time letty did and looked over the locked gate the dump was bigger than hed expected covering a half of a square mile much of the garbage appeared to be pizza boxes though it smelled more like old diapers letty walked around to the back of the truck to get her gear six miles lucas said as he walked back around the truck and popped the lid for her howre you gonna get back home walk or hitch a ride she said she dragged the sack of traps out stuck the rifle under her arm i wont have my traps do it all the time aw jesus lucas looked around at the weird cold landscape the spitting snow the circling crows and the piles of trash im not asking for a ride back letty said he could feel the manipulation how long will it take to set out the traps minimum lucas asked hour hour and a half do it right she said you got a watch no goddamnit you need a watch lucas took his watch off and handed it to her if you lose the watch ill poison you my wife gave it to me well be back in an hour and a half thanks be careful a car pulled into the entryway stopped and they both looked at it the man inside put up a hand a hello then turned and backed away he got straight on the road and headed back toward the highway an old cadillac letty said see you and walked away lucas slammed the lid got back in the truck shes more goddamn trouble than women ten years older than she is he said whatre we doing del asked lets start tearing broderick down starting with gene calb go back and hit him again nail him down and maybe those church women if we can find them letty said they worked for calb sometimes delivering cars theyre church women so maybe theyll tell us the truth fat fuckin chance del said and a while later as they headed back toward broderick that was a nice caddy you know ive thought about buying an old one myself you see them in the sunday paper you can get a good one for six or seven thousand ten years old some old guy drove it until he died put thirty thousand miles on it or something you can drive it for another ten years of course youd have spent ten years driving a pig lucas said go ahead tarnish my dream calbs shop was locked and del said it is sunday not everybody works yeah therere a couple of cars over at the church though lucas said they both looked across the highway where two s toyota corollas both red sat in the driveway next to the church electric cords ran out to both of them firing the block heaters lets check them out nuns make me nervous del said except for elle lucas said elle makes me nervous del said im always afraid shes gonna start shaking and moaning and screaming about jesus wrong religion lucas said dryly as they trudged across the empty highway toward the church she screams about the archbishop jesus she doesnt scream about it could happen though del said shes one of those skinny women with big eyes they can start shaking anytime th ts my experience elle kruger was lucass oldest friend a nun and professor of psychology at a st paul womens college hed known her before kindergarten they had walked together with their two mothers carrying their tin lunch boxes on the first day theyd ever gone to school later when he was with minneapolis homicide shed consulted on a number of his cases and when lucas began writing roleplaying games as a way to make extra money shed created a group at her college to testplay the games which made the coincidence seem even stranger that they should be talking about elle kruger as they crossed the highway and then they climbed the stoop and knocked on the door of the old church lucass ears were burning from the cold and del said fucking minnesota and shuffled his feet in the keepingwarm dance lucas reached out to knock again when the door opened and a woman looked out she was an older woman in her sixties whitehaired roundfaced with little pink dots at her cheeks wearing bifocals and holding what looked like a dust cloth the pink dots made her look like ronald reagan when they explained what they wanted she said youd have to talk to ruth come in when the two men hesitated her bottom lip twitched and she said this isnt a nunnery or a dormitory youre allowed to come in thanks lucas said feeling a little lame they followed her through the back of the church which had been cut into sleeping cubicles reminding lucas of an old washington avenue flophouse in minneapolis except that it didnt smell like wine vomit past a side room where two women were sitting on a couch watching the movie fight club and into the kitchen a small woman sat at a kitchen table peering through goldrimmed glasses into a notebook a pile of what looked like insurance forms sat to one side she looked up and the woman whod met them at the door said ruth these gentlemen are from the police they wanted to speak to somebody lucas davenport the woman said closing the notebook she showed him a thin cool smile lucas surprised said im sorry she stood up and put out a hand as they shook her hand small and cool she said im ruth lewis im sure you dont remember but im a friend of elle kruger i once played a game with your gaming group maybe ten years ago when elle was running it i got to be george pickett at gettysburg i remember that he said and he did clearly and with pleasure shed learned fast and had been determined to win you kept taking out buford lucas said no matter how many times we played it youd kick buford out of the way and then youd get on top of the hills and that was that she said dusting her hands together the south wins the battle and maybe the war bad design lucas said you never came back for stalingrad nobody invited me she said i thought maybe it was because i kept messing up the first one no no no lucas said you were invited back you just didnt come have you seen elle just the other day they chatted for a few minutes shed known lucas as a minneapolis cop and he told her about his move to the state and lucas had known her as a nun and she told him about her migration away from the sisterhood i made the mistake of going to the holy land she said i saw that the sea of galilee was a big dirty lake and that the mount of olives was a neighborhood then jesus didnt seem divine he seemed more real but he seemed like another one of the guys that the old testament is full of down in my heart i didnt believe anymore in jesus i mean so you quit yup moved over to catholic charities got a boyfriend though that didnt last long i think he just liked the idea of sleeping with an exnun lucas was embarrassed some people he said she smiled letting him off the male hook and said youre here investigating the lynchings murders lucas said hastily not really we know who did those the man from rochester i heard about that the man and his wife its hard to believe yeah now were trying to figure out who killed them we were told that you guys sometimes make money driving cars for gene calb since deon cash worked over there as a driver we thought you might have known him she was nodding i did know him and he was a bad man a bad man gene was going to fire him because he thought deon was taking dope and gene was worried about some insurance issues like if deon was driving for him and got in an accident driving under the influence gene was afraid hed get sued for everything so everybody knew about the drugs some of us anyway ruth said there was a woman here jeanette raskin she used to work for lutheran social services down in minneapolis and she knows a lot about drugs she said he once had a crack pipe in his car i wouldnt know what one looked like but thats what she said i have her phone number if you need it shes back in the cities t i know jeanette del said and to lucas you do too she used to run the love bug place the free clinic oh yeah lucas said she would know about drugs how come you guys drive for calb del asked ruth ruth shrugged extra money pizza money easy money we follow the delivery car in my corolla fifty cents a mile so we get fifty dollars for a hundredmile round trip and we can do that on three gallons of gas we dont have a lot of money here you did it a lot a couple of times a week she said is calb straight lucas asked yes hes a very nice man in a carmechanic way ruth said meeting his eyes she had pale eyes like the moons you could see in daylight his wife sometimes helps us out when were checking on older people shutins you dont think if cash and warr were involved in a kidnapping you dont think that calb would have been involved good gosh no i mean the girl is dead i guess lucas and del both nodded ruth continued gene always wanted children but he and his wife couldnt have any theyve been foster parents even for like a half a dozen kids theres no way hed ever hurt a child lucas said all right but deon cash could deon deon was crazy i didnt know him very well but you didnt have to i once saw him kick a door for two minutes because it didnt open right he was really crazyangry with it with the door she looked away from them for a minute thinking about it then back and nodded positively he could kill children how about his pal joe i hardly knew him but he always seemed to be walking behind deon i think deon impressed him deon impressed jane too she liked him being crazy like it gave her status again she looked away thinking and then turned back we see that quite a bit actually women taking status from the violence of their men a sense of protection if you live in a slum lucas said but she shook her head not just in the slums all kinds of women even nuns she showed a little smile and del grinned at lucas and said ouch lucas said tell me one good fact one thing that will point me somewhere something you know way down in your head about deon ive thought about this ever since they found jane and deon she said i keep thinking deon was from the big city kansas city so was jane they hated it here i dont think they even knew anybody besides a couple of people at calbs but they stayed so there had to be a reason something they couldnt do in kansas city maybe they were selling the dope maybe it was the kidnapping whatever it was came from up here good said lucas outside del said sister ruth does a little dope herself yeah i could smell it on her faintly raw not smoke brownies maybe del looked around at the whiteonwhite landscape at their lonely car sitting in the empty snowswept parking lot outside the empty yellow building across the highway i cant blame her its like its dope or network tv there aint nothin else ill ask elle about her lucas said im not sure the sister was entirely straight with us whatd i miss lucas shook his head maybe nothing i counted eight cots in there and most of the rooms seemed to be lived in thats a sizable operation what would a hundred dollars a week mean to them i mean if they each worked one night in a holiday store theyd make three or four times as much if they need the money that bad maybe its just easy casual pin money take it if they have somebody around skip it if they dont wouldnt be tied to a schedule could be lucas agreed she seemed pretty rehearsed but then she might have expected us he looked at his watch and found a patch of white skin where the watch face should have been not having a watch was going to drive him crazy he realized the bars closed lets go try the cafe and then the grocery it feels hopeless del said knocking on doors in nowhere on the way to the cafe lucass cell phone rang and when he answered it a voice said this is deke harrison is this davenport yeah it is how are you deke interrupted i was halfway through an anchovy peppercheese onion sandwich and you know what its like to be interrupted halfway through one of those so are halfway through when somebody called for somebody else who got a call from mark johnson that said you wanted him vouched for you vouching for him yeah hes a good guy knows what hes doing takes care of his sources i might chat with him then excellent if you ever run for governor of whatever hick state youre in minnesota youll know that the tribune stands behind you far behind you stepped on my line harrison said yeah i know lucas said it was such an original go back to the sandwich sandy wolf who ran the cafe told them that deon cash liked coconut cream pie and that jane warr was allergic to sulfites used as a preservative she said that shed never seen them argue every time they left the cafe together she said warr would go through the door first and that cash would reach out and squeeze her ass wolf also knew that cash liked basketball and was a los angeles lakers fan and that he didnt care for football and especially hated the green bay packers and the minnesota vikings she once had a vikings game on the television and cash asked her to turn it off he had a mean look in him so i turned it off she said the convenience store gas station was run by john mcguire and mcguires sister shelly mcguire was a lean man who might have been taken for a farmer his sister equally lean reminded lucas of a pool shark hed known in minneapolis who eventually became a successful rugcleaning franchisee both of them knew cash who in addition to whatever dope habits he might have had also was attracted to the orange halloween hostess cupcakes and had bought four dozen of them last halloween all that the store had in stock they had also known joe kelly and said that he seemed like a shy man every night when they saw his car parked at cashs place kelly came in and bought a twelvepack of budweiser we think he had alcohol issues shelly mcguire said i should have offered to take him to my aa meeting mcguire said but i wasnt sure he was drinking it by himself and i couldnt get him talking and i thought you know him being colored maybe colored people can drink more than white people the bar was closed the dog house on the side street was a manufactured home built in a factory and trucked to the homesite where it was hammered together on a pre poured slab the siding felt like tin del knocked and a man in a sleeveless undershirt came to the door while the dogs went crazy in a back room lucas without looking could feel del loosening up his smith the man said yep he propped himself in the door and lucas could smell tomato sauce and dog shit in the overheated air streaming out the man had an american flag tattooed on one shoulder and on the other a skull with a dagger through its eye and the legend death from above were with the bureau of criminal apprehension were investigating a series of crimes got an id a woman in the house yelled who is it dick lucas held out his id and dick glanced at it and yelled cops asking about cash and stepped out on the porch what can i do for you dont want you to freeze lucas said he would have liked a look inside im fine the man said his arms were turning red dont feel the cold we understand you work at calbs and were looking for any information the mans name was richard block and the woman inside was his girlfriend eurice he was a prep specialist who set the trucks up for painting i didnt have nothin to do with the drivers he said i was always back in the sanding booth i aint management i dont think i talked to cash more than once in my life never did meet his old lady except to s nod at her in the store she never came to the bar talked to joe once or twice he was interested in the prep business he wanted ho paint his own car dont know anything about him though they bounced a few more questions off him looking for an edge and found nothing but genuine ignorance you ever meet any of the nuns er whatever over at the church del asked never saw them except at the cafe and maybe at the store call them the rugmunchers over to the shop he said i thought they drove for calb lucas said not that i know of block said his eyes shifting away momentarily he was lying you have to talk to gene about his employees i mean i aint in management and i dont want to piss anybody off id like to keep the job he had nothing more to say except that he hoped to build a kennel and breed pit bulls nice tats del said as they backed away from the door the man glanced at his dagger tattoo and for the first time showed a hint of a smile sometimes i wished id gotten mom but i was in the army and only navy guys get mom the man stepped back inside and closed the door behind himself why would he lie about the nuns del asked as they walked away he was doing good up to then i dont know lucas said lets try some more there were a halfdozen trailer homes scattered around town one had unbroken snow around it and was apparently not being lived in of the others three were being lived in but nobody was home at the other two they talked to men who worked for calb but seemed genuinely confused about the killings one of the men who smelled strongly of beer said were sittin here with a gun tell you the truth he reached sideways onto a table picked up a heavyframe revolver waggled it at his ceiling and said i dare the motherfucker to come in here hell be walking home without a couple of pounds of meat make sure who youre shooting it at lucas said i dont know i think people get more scared when they think that youre crazy and maybe drunk tend not to fuck with you said the man smiling in a distinctly crazy way you could be right about that lucas said as they walked away he looked at the patch of white skin on his arm lets go get letty letty was out on the dump when they got there a small figure in dark clothes kicking through the trash pile letty was concentrating on something and didnt see them pull in lucas got out and yelled hey letty she turned waved and skidded down the side of the pile of trash and clumped across the dirt pan between the edge of the trash pile and the gate when she got to the gate she passed him the and the empty gunny sack then climbed the gate when she dropped down beside him he got a whiff of aged garbage you oughta stay out of the trash he said you dont know what might be in there letty said nobody knows what might be in there phil gets all kinds of good stuff out of there whos phil drives the cat she said nodding at the bulldozer he gets about one good computer a week wont do you any good if you die of some weird disease lucas said you better take a shower when you get home water kills cancer youre also a little stinky lucas said yeah itd be worth it stinky if i could get a good computer out of it she said my computer is worse than this old pieceofcrap they were loading into the acura as she said it del asked if the guns a piece of crap why dont you get another one cause they cost money and this one works she said i mean its a piece of crap but thats all i need my computer thats just a piece of crap as they were backing out she added you know what id do if i was a cop id tell the guy at the dump to turn in all the computers he found most of them work theyre just old when people throw them away they leave all their letters and stuff on them he finds out the neatest stuff about people messing with the old computers its his hobby one time he found uh she suddenly colored and snapped her mouth shut what lucas asked never mind they both looked at her and then del said to lucas i need to get my old computer back singleton could not remember feeling exactly like this unable to breathe unable to think hed driven out of the dump down the gravel road and straight through the stop sign onto the highway he was heading south before he realized hed missed the stop he might have died right there he thought if thered been a molson truck coming through from canada goddamn letty west she was out there all the time trapping the goddamn coons he was sure that she hadnt been out there when hed buried the girls except that he hadnt checked he had the same sense of uneasiness that came when he was sure hed unplugged the iron before leaving town or when he was sure that hed locked the doors before going to bed he was sure but he wasnt sure he knew she was often out there even late because hed seen her walking along the highway in the evening carrying her rifle and her bag if she had seen him hauling the garbage bags that held the girls bodies she would have assumed that he was getting rid of his own household trash though it wasnt legal people did it did it all the time after hunting and fishing trips to get rid of fish guts or deer remains but the girl had been dragging around town with the two state cops had apparently helped them reach the unbelievably quick conclusion that the sorrells had been involved in the hanging of deon cash and jane warr now she had taken them out to the dump did she know something were the state cops looking at him maybe he shouldnt have left so quickly maybe he should have stopped and chatted he could say that the dump was part of his checkroute but if they started to ask him questions what would he have said he wasnt ready for that then if the state cops were looking at him why hadnt he felt anything at work there hadnt been any curious looks or veiled questions could the state cops be holding it that close not even letting the sheriff in on it or how about this theyd found out that hed been hanging around calbs and in the process of checking on him theyd talked to letty and shed mentioned seeing him at the dump dragging the bags of course putting him with calb wouldnt get them to deon and jane because hed kept that connection very quiet think all right heres another possibility it was all a coincidence she was out there trapping and the cops had taken her out but why would the cops do that it wasnt like they were a taxi service think better talk to mom the day had started simply enough hed slept late after a strenuous evening with katina lewis had then gotten up gotten dressed and had gone into the office to see if anything had happened with the murders of the sorrells micky james was working the comm center the state boys are back james said theyve been asked in to cover the sorrell murders too theyre going to be up around broderick what the hell you think is happening dope dealing up at the res if you ask me singleton said its all gotta be tied together back home hed decided that snooping was probably more dangerous than doing nothing and his thoughts turned to the caddy out in his garage he needed to do some fine sanding on the last clear coat and doing that kind of work always smoothed him out along with the car gave him a chance to think in the garage he realized that his breathing gear was still out at calbs and the paint he was using always specified breathing gear that meant a trip to broderick hed gone to broderick without a thought in his mind as he came into town he saw a silver suv pulling out of the body shop heading out on the highway north he pulled into the spot that the suv had just left and found the shop deserted not unusual for a sunday he ran the door up with his remote control went inside and got the breather gear didnt feel the slightest vibration from the silver truck loren a womans voice called to him he looked back to his right and saw an older woman walking across the highway from the church hey she called did you talk to katina not since last night she said she was heading back here and for a moment singleton thought the woman was going to tell him that katina was missing if shed gone missing for any reason he might be cooked she was here until ten minutes ago the woman said she was an older woman who looked like a saturday evening post caricature of grandma she tried to call you shes probably down at your place now she said if you came by looking for her to tell you that shed wait all right did you talk to the state policemen no they were just here theyve been going around town silver truck the woman nodded yes you just missed them they were headed north to letty wests he thanked the woman and as soon as she was back in the church headed north out of town after the silver suv he was no more than fifteen minutes behind it he thought he took it slow going out looking for their car at wests house it wasnt there in fact there was no car at wests of course they might have come back past calbs when he was getting the breathing gear but he hadnt seen or heard any traffic and the shop was quiet they were headed north then it hit him shit the dump he denied it to himself couldnt be the dump he wheeled the caddy out of the parking lot and put his foot down the cadillac would make a hundred and ten he had to fight the undulating highway and the soft suspension but he stuck with it pushing the car as hard as he could the dump road came up in four minutes with no sign of the silver truck he turned the corner eased down the road saw nothing until he came to the entry turned in there they were caught like deer in the headlights the whole goddamned bunch of them standing around the suv he lifted a hand mind gone blank backed out and raced away the scene went round and round in singletons brain and he couldnt stop it there were too many permutations but it all came back to one problem he didnt believe in coincidence the state cops had been out there with letty west for a reason hed put the two girls four feet down in the center of the landfill under the clay cap hed dug through to the garbage layers shoved the bodies in refilled the holes and carefully tamped down the clay even if he went out to look for the bodies now hed be lucky to get within twenty feet of them letty west if shed been back in the woods and had seen him cutting the holes would never be able to put the cops on the exact spot still if they knew hed been involved theyd find a way to get him christ they might hit the house in fact thats the first thing theyd do if they found the money hed be gone and what else did letty know had she seen his caddy at deons hed parked it in the back but hed seen her walking down the creek behind the place had she seen it there hed been there often enough did she know hed gone to vegas with james ramone and later with deon and jane he better get a story he needed a story and a good one and he needed to think about letty west goddamnit he looked at himself caught his own eyes in the rearview mirror hed never been like this could this be fear katina was at his house sitting on the back stoop in the cold a brown grocery sack next to her leg he pulled into his driveway and she stood up hugging herself across the chest jiggling up and down trying to keep warm whereve you been had to go in for a couple of hours he said got guys running all over the place with this deon thing he got his keys out unlocked the house and she picked up the sack and followed him inside he walked on through to the front hall took off his coat hung it leaned back against the wall and pulled off his boots something wrong she asked he didnt exactly jump but felt himself twitch huh you look a little stressed just uh wish i didnt have to work tonight he said anything new with the deon thing from gene not that ive heard the state police have been going around town talking to people talked to ruth for quite a while she didnt have much to tell them good be dumb the lord looks over the innocent she said i brought a couple of ribeyes and some veggies i thought we could eat here thatd be good he said they had a quiet afternoon katina cooking singleton looking through car trader magazines calb had a computer on his desk and hed shown singleton how to get online and browse carrehab sites singleton did it from time to time but preferred paper he trusted the magazines he liked the color and he liked to lie on his couch and look at a photo for a long time thinking what he might have done with the same car he had a hard time doing it this afternoon he kept thinking about the scene at the dump with the two cops and letty west he finally got up and went into the hall to call mom he got no answer probably at the casino he thought she usually was on sunday nights she liked her slots since shed come into the money shed moved up to the dollar machines he went back to the couch and dozed fitfully the odors from the kitchen getting better and better almost driving the letty west demon out of his head then katina called him into the kitchen and he found a tablecloth on the kitchen table and a couple of white candles in fancy glass candle holders he said whoa i thought youd like it katina said she blushed a little as though she were shy about it or maybe it was the heat from the stove shed made a salad with white seeds that looked like sunflower seeds but werent and mashed potatoes to go with the steak singleton sat down and said pretty okay then popped up and said you forgot the ketchup she said grace as she always did and then was quiet until they were halfway through dinner when she asked have you ever thought about having a child he said what singleton didnt know exactly what had happened there during dinner and afterward theyd watched television and then wound up in bed again which was fine with him but hed gotten up to watch the ten oclock news and to get into his uniform and shed left lightfooted and apparently lighthearted singing to herself he watched the news they were still talking about sorrell and they had a quick piece of tape with letty west but it was old tape that hed been seeing for a couple of days he dozed for a while sitting in front of the tube in the lazboy when he woke up he groped around for his cigarettes found them found the matchbox and ripped the match down the igniter strip in the flare of the match it occurred to him that the sorrell killings had been no problem at all hed just gone and done it nothing pointed at him and a threat had been eliminated truth be told he realized as he stared into the flame hed enjoyed knocking down the sorrells nothing to do with his mother hed enjoyed it for himself here was that kingshit sorrell guy all the money in the world all big and smart and walking around in his house in silk pajamas and here was singleton with his little ole mother but who had the gun king shit who acted fast he knocked them down in his mind knocked them down again then swore as the flame bit down to his fingers goddamnit he said aloud he lit another match lit the cigarette letty west he thought waving the match out up there in the night with nobody but her mama after lucas and del dropped her at her house letty changed clothes and then went out to the highway and hitched a ride into armstrong she wasnt stupid about it she always waited until she recognized the truck before she put her thumb out in that part of the county she recognized one in twenty and they always stopped for her at the library she got a computer and went online called up the google search engine entered how to with tv reporter and got some strange websites three boys from her class came in two of them wearing vikings sweatshirts and the third wearing a sweatshirt that said scouts which was the high school nickname one of the vikings boys was named don and letty considered him somewhat desirable she felt a pressure from them almost like a pressure on her face they got on computers two of them facing her and they all clicked along through the net two hours later disturbed by what shed read on the websites and carrying fifty pages of printout she hitched back home with an eighty threeyearold drunk whod spent the evening with a lady friend and couldnt keep his truck straight on the street she flagged him down and he let her drive she dropped him at his house halfway up to brodcrick and told him shed come over in the morning with the truck when he was sober as she went through broderick she stopped at the store and bought a bottle of milk and a box of cereal the house was dark when she got back she lit it up turned down the heat ate a quick bowl of cereal and then went back into her mothers bedroom to look at herself in the mirror she wasnt badlooking she decided actually she was quite attractive but she would need to soften up her face she looked good now but if she kept making grim lines she could wind up looking like a crocodile she had no makeup skills at all but the women at the hair salon could fix that they had a whole library of books and magazines and an ocean of experience letty had never spent a dime on makeup shed start now the web sites had stressed that journalism wasnt very important but skilb were that was her next assignment print out everything she could find on tv schools then she thought school homework social studies she climbed the stairs found her textbook and looked up the questions she was supposed to answer then she thought they cant hold it against me if im helping lucas and del she dumped the book went back downstairs turned on the tv watched for a while reading the printouts and every half hour or so went to look at herself in the mirror some more she hardly ever did that this was not a matter of vanity but a matter of technique of skills she found that if she used her mothers compact she could hold it next to her eye and get a good rightangle profile in the dresser mirror one of the web sites had said that you had to look like tv the site said that every female host of the today show had been chosen because she looked like shed be good at fellatio shed carefully written fellatio on a piece of paper and carried it over to the librarys new shorter oxford english dictionary and looked the word up sucking or licking of a sexual partners penis she thought huh and a second later every one of them then shed ripped the piece of paper into a hundred bits in case one of the boys from her class might see it thrown the tiny bits of paper into the wastebasket and changed pages in the dictionary she was watching letterman and critiquing technique when headlights swept through the yard after a moment they died and she walked out to the front door boots clunked across the porch the door rattled and her mother stepped inside martha west was moderately loaded bars werent open on sunday so like the old man shed also done her drinking privately hi honey whose truck is that reese culver he was drinking and asked me to drive him im gonna take it back in the morning okay you got traps out yeah down at the dump you better get upstairs then get to bed its after eleven oclock martha said letty would have to get up at five oclock to make it out to the dump you had something to eat had some honey bunches of oats letty said she stood up and stretched theres some left and i got a bottle of milk martha yawned okay get to bed letty took the social studies book up the stairs with her closed her bedroom door dug a notebook out of her school pack sprawled on the bed and started working through the questions if lucas and del didnt come through shed need the answers besides with reeses truck outside she could sleep an extra fortyfive minutes in the morning and take the truck up to the dump before she returned it the problem with broderick singleton thought was that there werent any back roads to the place if you wanted to go there you went on highway or you didnt go he took the hed have to get rid of it he thought and the thought pained him hed paid for it at a gun show in fargo and he hated to lose it itd worked just fine with the sorrells couldnt ask for more not for not in this world at eleven oclock with the sky black with the daily overcast he went on the air to tell the sleepy dispatcher that hed take a quick run down south to show the flag the sheriff emphasized that when nothing was going on he wanted his deputies out to be seen the dispatcher said okay and went away he turned north broderick showed scattered speckles of light when he crept into the south side of town he pulled in behind calbs shop and got out let the wind bite at him for a moment listening then satisfied that he was alone he pulled his parka up around his head hunched his shoulders and started off hed brought a penlight and used it in quick flicks to guide himself along the back of the building then past the old power transfer station through an empty lot behind the darkened convenience store and finally out on the open highway the west house was maybe six hundred yards down the road a quartermile to a halfmile not far once or twice around the track at custer high he might have been walking into a coal pit for as much as he could see not a single vehicle passed in either direction the only sound was the wind the scuffle of his feet on the road and his own breathing when he reached the west house he found that it was not entirely dark light glowed through a shade on a northfacing window on the second floor and a variety of small lights a tv power light a bathroom night light a green light that might have been on a telephone a small row of red lights that looked like a power supply actually gave his dilated eyes enough light to navigate moving slowly he felt with his feet for the track that crossed the culvert into the driveway when he got close he sensed a bulk to his right marthas jeep too big pickup goddammit who was here he moved around behind it looked for any movement in the house then squirted the penlight at the back of the truck he recognized it all right the dented corner panels where old reese culver tended to back into solid objects like phone poles what was the old man doing here with virtually all the lights out thered been rumors offandon that martha west might fuck for money but nobody paid them much attention it was generally taken as wishful thinking in a town that needed somebody who fucked for money but reese culver if he was staying the night the old fart he had to be paying he thought about it for a minute two minutes shit he put his hand in the pocket gripped the revolver took it out once to make sure he wouldnt snag the pocket put it back in and walked up to the porch martha west had just crawled into bed when she heard the knock at the door she thought the knock was letty upstairs until it came a second time she looked at a clock almost midnight who was it at this time of night and a sudden chill went through her shoulders and she thought deon cash and jane warr just at midnight the knock came a third time and she picked up a ratty old terrycloth robe and threw it on and walked through the darkened front room to the front door the porch light was burned out so she turned on the interior light and looked out through the glass cutout on the front door the first thing she saw was the embroidered star on the parka and then loren singletons face no ghosts anyway had something happened puzzled she opened the door hi martha sorry to bother you singleton said i know its late but loretta grupe called in and said she was worried about reese hed been drinking some and she was worried about whether he got home i happened to see his truck out here he uh was drinking and uh well letty drove him home and he told her to go ahead and bring the truck up here so shed have a ride you know how she is singleton kept looking past her looking for something else she didnt care for him and pushed the door closed an inch or so ready to go back to bed anything else okay so hes home and lettys home everythings all right yeah shes asleep everythings okay she smiled not her best smile okay no point in messing around singleton put his left arm out and straightarmed the door and it flew open bouncing martha west straight back she was startled just beginning to get scared and he pulled the revolver out of his pocket and pointed it at her eyes and said tell letty to come down here shes under arrest martha hesitated just a second looking down the barrel of the gun and knew in her heart that letty wasnt under arrest that something terrible was happening here and she thought she knew what she mimed a turn as if to shout up the stairs and then instead she threw herself at singleton avoiding the gun barrel grabbing his arm going right straight into his body screaming and spitting at him clawing at him the sleeve of his coat jerked up and she got some skin saw some blood he fought back and she realized that she was going to lose him and she screamed letty run letty run letty run and singleton hit her and she went over a love seat and crashed through a glasstopped coffee table still screaming and saw singleton coming reaching out to her and then she realized just in a tiny fragment of time that she had left that he was pointing not reaching and she screamed run letty the boom of the gun was deafening in the small room but the noise stopped instantly singleton had never liked that kind of noise that highemotion squealing that women did and when he shot martha west in the forehead and the squealing stopped his first feeling was that of sudden relief and he thought letty and looked at the open door to the second floor martha west had been screaming at the stairway he went that way taking the stairs two at a time letty had finished the last of the social studies problems and was packing her bag when she heard the knock on the front door she couldnt see the front yard from her room so she paused listening was it her mother then she heard the knock again and stepped toward the door heard her mothers footsteps leaving the downstairs bedroom she listened heard her mothers voice and a male rumbling maybe it was lucas and del with something important and then the voices went up and her mother began screaming run letty and letty turned and stepped across the room and picked up her rifle which was unloaded because her mother made her swear to keep it unloaded except when she was using it and she fumbled in the pocket of her trapping parka for a box of shells and then heard a crash of breaking glass and a run letty and she broke the gun open and there was a sudden tremendous boom and the sounds of fighting stopped too late she looked wildly around the room flipped the old turnlock on the door grabbed the steellegged kitchen chair at the foot of her bed and without thinking about it hurled it through the east window there were two layers of glass the regular window and the storm but the chair was heavy and went through running footsteps on the stairs like some kind of halloween movie and letty threw her parka over the windowsill to protect herself from the broken glass and still hanging onto the rifle went out the window she hung on to the coat with her left hand and she dropped pulling it after her the coat snagged on glass and maybe a nail held her up for just a second then everything fell she landed awkwardly in a clump of prairie grass felt her ankle twist and hobbled two steps sideways her ankle on fire clutching the parka in the cold and saw a silhouette at the window and she ran and there was a crack of light and noise like a closein lightning strike and something plucked at her hair and she kept hobbling away and there was another boom and her side was on fire and then she was around the corner of the house and into the dark hurt she thought she touched her side and realized that she was bleeding under the arm and her ankle screamed in pain and something was wrong with her left hand she kept going halfhopping halfhobbling cold she thought she pinned the rifle between her legs and pulled the parka on she had no hat or mittens but she pulled the hood up and began to run as best she could and her left hand wasnt working right she was only a hundred feet from the house when she realized that she wasnt alone in the yard there was a squirt of light and then she heard movement a crunching on the snow he was coming after her whoever he was shells as she hobbled along she dug in her coat pocket and found a shell but her hand wasnt working and she dropped it lost in the dark dug out another one with the other hand broke the rifle got the shell in snapped it shut a squirt of light then the man called letty you might as well stop i can see you bulbhit she thought she could barely tell where he was and he had the partly lit house behind him and she was moving as fast as he was because he was having trouble following her footprints through the grass that stuck through the shallow snow and there was nothing behind her but darkness if he kept coming though she had to do some thing she didnt know how badly she was hurt had to find someplace to go his silhouette lurched in and out of focus in front of the house and she remembered something that bud her trapper friend had told her about bowhunting for deer if a deer was moving a little too quickly for a good shot you could whistle or grunt and the deer would stop to listen thats when you let the arrow go she turned got a sense of where the mans silhouette was leveled the rifle and called who are you he stopped like a deer and she shot him singleton ran up the stairs and at the top looked around heard the crash of breaking glass looked back thinking somehow that it might be martha west who was sprawled in the wreckage of the glass table and realized in the next instant that it had to be letty because martha was definitely dead he spotted the door with light leaking beneath it stepped over to it and said letty and tried the knob locked he kicked it once and it bent without breaking he kicked it a second time a copkick and it flew open letty was gone window broken with movement the jacket going out he stepped on a notebook and almost fell got right hurried to the window and saw a dark figure on the ground hobbling down the side of the house he fired once missed and blinded by his own muzzle flash let go another shot and then he couldnt see her anymore think she was out there alone maybe hurt there was nobody else out there the countryside was empty he could shoot a machinegun at her and nobody would hear he ran down the stairs realized his arm was burning he looked at it quickly as he hurried through the living room and out on the porch blood then he was around the house and he got out the flash and got under the window and flicked the penlight on and started tracking her at the back of the house he found blood so hed hit her maybe unless shed cut herself going out of the house he tracked her for a minute then called out letty you might as well stop i can see you she called who are you and he stopped trying to focus on the direction it was dark as a coal sack then a star burst in front of him a muzzle flash and he felt a sharp slap on his chest and he involuntarily sat down he could hear her running again but he paid no attention he thought im shot im shot he couldnt believe it he was shot shit at and missed shot at and hit he almost giggled had to do something about this he crawled back toward the house then got on his feet staggering got inside and looked at his chest nothing but it hurt bad after a second he spotted a tiny dimple in the parka fabric a hole he thought wonderingly he unzipped the parka found a small circle of blood on his uniform shirt pulled his shirt open found a bigger circle on his undershirt pulled that up and found a hole in his chest just right of his left nipple the skin was already beginning to bruise and when he touched it pain rippled across his chest shit he was shot didnt hurt as bad as his arm though he took a few experimental breaths he was breathing okay and he thought she yelled who are you did she really not know when would she have seen his face he began to see some possibilities maybe he could pull this off yet and then he thought dna goddamn dna martha west had cut him up they might find his blood anywhere letty fired the shot then stumbled away from her muzzle flash aware that it would have given her away the man was crunching through the snow again and she found another shell with her good hand what was wrong with her left it just didnt work and tried to get it in the gun she fumbled it found another got this one in stopped to listen nothing where was he she began to get the creepy feeling that he was right next to her breathing quietly and she slowly dropped to her knees huddling into the dried russian thistles along the west ditch waited where was he two minutes passed though it took an eternity another minute where was he what happened to mom she almost gagged because she thought she knew what happened to mom though mom had fought the guy long enough for her to go out the window more light what was that more light lots more light the house was burning she was drawn to it was there something she could do or was the gunman simply pulling her in frightened she shrank farther back into the dark and farther back as the flames grew when the first of the volunteer trucks arrived twenty minutes later the fire was five stories high and climbing into the night like a volcano lucas had stolen an old copy of fortune magazine from the motel lobby and lay in bed reading an article about how he could still retire rich when the phone rang del he picked it up and got the comm center clerk from the law enforcement center mr davenport this is susan conrad down at the sheriffs office weve just dispatched our fire department to the west house the call coming in said the whole house was burning like crazy thought you might want to know jesus thanks lucas slammed the phone back on the hook and ran barefoot in his underwear to the door and out down two and began pounding on dels door get up del get up without waiting for an answer he ran back to his room left the door open and began pulling on his jeans hed been outside for no more than ten seconds and he was cold god only knew what the temperature was he was pulling on his shirt when del stumbled into the room pulling on jeans still wearing his pajama top west house is burning down fire trucks on the way lucas blurted del disappeared lucas pulled on his socks and shoes and in the distance through the open door could hear the siren that called in the volunteer fire department and the roar of the truck heading out shoes on lucas got his wallet and keys and coat and gloves and headed out to the truck climbed inside saw del running toward him popped the passengerside door lock and del was inside and lucas took off del was carrying his shirt and coat and boots and dressed as they headed toward the highway not a coincidence he grunted we been out with that kid all over the place its like we were dragging bait i didnt even think about it lucas said they were probably two or three miles behind the fire truck when they got to highway but once past the last house going out of town lucas dropped the pedal to the floor and left it there two minutes out he pushed the button that lit his information screen which said that it was fourteen degrees below zero another minute out they could see a glow to the north burning faintly above the closer red lights of the fire truck jesus christ that cant be it del said were too far away gotta be it lucas said unless the report was wrong they were closing quickly on the firstresponder fire truck but didnt catch it until they were just outside of broderick by then they knew the reports had been right the fire was north of broderick and huge and there was nothing else out there lucas worried that some of the town residents might be in the highway in the dark looking at the fire let the truck lead them through town when the truck pulled into the house lucas swung past it and turned in at west ditch road even from there on the opposite side of the ditch the heat was ferocious if theres anybody in there theyre gone del said one of the firemen had jumped off the truck slid down the bank of the ditch and began hacking at the ice on the bottom with an oversized ax as he did that another man was uncoiling a hose and when he had enough of it he rolled it down the bank and the axman dragged it to the hole hed cut and shoved it under the ice a minute later a thin stream of water was splashing onto the house but it was obvious that it was doing no good at all it was like pissing into a welding torch the fire was eating everything more lights now police cars and two more fire trucks then lucas the voice was high and shrill but somehow weak and might almost have been the scream of a falling joist in the fire but lucas knew it wasnt and he ran down the gravel track in the direction of the sound and shouted letty letty over here here he could see the pale halfoval of her face across the ditch half of her face lit by the fire im hurt bad hang on lucas shouted del yelled not that way as lucas went straight down the wall of the ditch sliding crawled halfway up the other side slid back tried again slid back and finally ran thirty feet down the ditch to where some tumbleweeds were still rooted in the side and clambered out of it del had run around the end of it and was coming toward him letty hed lost track of her im hurt bad and i think moms moms in there somebody came and shot her she began sobbing and lucas came up and he bent to pick her up and she shrank away and said my hand is hurt bad and my side hurts i think im shot and my ankle might be broke aw jesus del was there and lucas pulled off his coat and said were making a sling just aw fuck it del lucas pulled his coat back on and said im gonna pick her up which side hurts honey which side he picked her up cradling her and del asked wherere your keys and lucas told him and del dug them out of lucass coat pocket and ran back to get the truck one of the firemen ran up and asked she burned and letty said no im hurt del was there in a few seconds and lucas lifted her into the back seat and then crawled in with her and del put the truck on the highway and they were headed back to armstrong running at top speed you okay im hurt bad she began sobbing again lucas got on the cell phone found a signal called into the sheriffs comm center how do we get to the hospital weve got a hurt kid you on your way back to town running fast where are you just went through broderick therell be a car sitting on the edge of town with its light bar flashing blink your headlights a bunch of times when you come up and hell take you right through to the medical center were coming lucas relayed the information to del then turned back to letty i know youre hurt but tell me what happened if you can i was up in my bedroom and mom was down in hers and i heard this knock she told the story and when it was done del muttered jesus christ letty and lucas said you think he was shot he was shot he fell down maybe he was you know going down so you couldnt see him he was shot she said stubbornly id never miss anyone that close hes shot in the chest all right twentytwo short yes her body was shaking with grief and pain he shot mom she was yelling for me to run and she was fighting him and then the was a shot and she stopped yelling and he started coming up steps you didnt see her outside in the yard or anything lucas said i didnt look i was just trying to stay out of the way of the fire guys you never saw the guy only his outline it was way dark but he talked to me he knew who i was he called me letty and he sounded like he was from around here he sounded like one of us did you see his car after a moment of silence she said he didnt have a car he didnt have a car i shot him and he fell down and then he got up and walked back to the house while i was trying to reload and then i just sat there and the house caught on fire and i couldnt get up and then the house burned and then you came no car ever drove away youre sure no car he didnt have a car okay listen he was about to say something but she pushed a hand out of her coat sleeve and tried to look at it and lucas saw a huge gash that started at her wrist and ran across the palm and disappeared between her middle and ring fingers better keep your hand down he said its bleeding a little coming up on the patrol car del said lucas looked down the highway and saw the light bar del clicked the high beams off and on and the patrol car pulled out on the highway rolled slow until theyd gotten close and then sped up and led them through town to the medical centers emergency room three people were standing on the ramp and then a fourth joined them pushing a gurney and del pulled up next to them the four moved lucas and del out of the way and loaded letty onto the gurney and pushed her inside and lucas went over to a plastic trash barrel and punted it out into the driveway where it rolled around spewing its garbage her fuckin hand he said to del her fuckin hand looks like its almost cut in half what about the chest was she shot in the chest she was pretty alert for anything deep he said then i gotta get inside ill park the car lucas stopped at the door and looked back you getting pissed yet yeah im pissed a young resident had been hustled out of bed when lucas called in and he was looking at letty when lucas pushed his way into the examination room how is she letty tried to push up and the doc turned looked at lucas over his mask whore you im a cop how is she the resident turned back to letty and as an aside to a nurse in exactly the wrong tone said get that guy out of here lucas snarled listen asshole im not going into all the background but if you want to keep your license in minnesota dont fuck with me now how is she is she shot the doc looked at a nurse who shrugged and showed no inclination to throw lucas out the doc said she has what might be a gunshot wound but its not lifethreatening her hand is badly cut we havent fully evaluated it yet we need to xray her foot its badly swollen and she complains of pain it might be broken its at least badly sprained is that good enough what about the hand that looked bad i cut it on the broken window letty said did you find mom the hand will take mmm take some special attention the resident said theres a surgeon in fargo fuck fargo lucas said he banged back out of the examining room and went outside met del told him what he was doing pulled out his cell phone and called home a sleepy weather answered on the third ring hello its me ive got a problem he told her about it quickly and when he was done weather said get her down here as fast as you can we need her while the wound is fresh i dont do hands but i can get harry larson to do her how fast can you get her here ill have to check go back to sleep ill call you are you cutting tomorrow morning not until ten what are you going to do see if i can find a plane if i cant ill drive her down or something get an ambulance listen let me call over to regions see what theyve got maybe itd be quicker to get a fast helicopter out of here rather than messing around good call me back whos paying we are i am wont be cheap call em del asked whatre we doing were gonna take her out of here in a helicopter weathers taking care of it shes gonna call back i dont think her mom made it del said when i came running around the ditch going back to where you were somebody inside the house was burning he wrinkled his nose then made a spitting gesture off to the side burning people smelled like pork barbeque and left a stink in your nose and mouth she knows it lucas said she hasnt admitted it yet sounds like mama took on the asshole whoever he is wonder why he burned the house down if he hadnt done that letty might have died out there id figure he was after letty why i mean why was he after her del thought i dunno what if he was after mom del shook his head that doesnt feel right okay but the whole thing is pretty interesting why was he after her what was he burning where is he now especially if he was shot i have my doubts about him being shot i mean we both know cops whove emptied a whole goddamn clock at somebody down the hall and didnt hit shit mmm i kind of suggested that and she said she hit him said there was no way she missed i kind of think she might have hit him better get the word out to the local hospitals we can do that they were still talking about it when weather called back turns out theres an air evac service out of brainerd which is almost halfway up there and they can have a helicopter on its way in a halfhour theyll call you when theyre coming and give you a time estimate he says theres a landing pad right there at the hospital he said it wouldnt be much more than an hour before theyre coming in up there i can meet her when she gets down here excellent back in the hospital he told the doc were medevacing her sending her down to hennepin general and a hand guy a chopperll be here in an hour or so we need to get her stable the hand is the only big problem the doc said shes got a groove in her side where she was shot but thats minor sos the leg the hand the hand is a problem so how soon can she go ill start some pain medication and she can be ready in a halfhour if the choppers coming in here were good lucas said to letty i told you my wife is a doctor shes setting up everything down in the cities and shes gonna meet you youll be okay but they want to fix your hand as soon as they can okay she said did you check on mom were gonna do that now lucas said im gonna head right back up there youll be okay just ride along and do what everybody tells you theyll take care of you moms dead she said well go see what happened lucas said he touched her good leg you take care of yourself back at the west house the fire was virtually out there was almost nothing left to burn and what had been a foursquare farmhouse was now a hole in the ground a deputy who said that hed met lucas at the hanging scene shook his head when they asked about martha west nobodys seen her cars here there was this he gestured at the house there was this smell i know letty said her mother was downstairs she heard a knock on the door then her mother started screaming there was a shot the screaming stopped and letty went out the window never saw her mother or heard her again were sure shes telling the truth i dont want to suggest anything but they were out here alone letty was shot herself and its not selfinflicted believe me lucas said somebody shot her from behind and above and nobody would do to themselves what happened to her just to cover up her hand theres a possibility that shes gonna be crippled the deputy winced okay you know out here on the prairie strange things happen when people are alone too much in the city strange things happen when theyre together too much del said strange things happen the deputy said lucas suspected they were about to lurch off into some philosophical black hole and hastily interjected we need to alert all the local hospitals and doctors that the killer may have been shot thats something since she didnt hit him in the head i hope she hit him in the nuts the deputy said ill call it in once singleton got the fire going hed slipped out the front of the west home and begun jogging down the highway hed thought about one more look around one more quick search for letty but she had that gun and shed see him coming he gave up on that and jogged his chest hurt hurt a lot but he wasnt spitting blood wasnt having any trouble breathing if he could just keep going running hurt he ran halfway back to broderick then he stopped stooped over braced his hands on his knees and tried to ease the pain the pain was coming in waves now and if he hadnt been shot he might have thought he was having a heart attack behind him the fire was growing he ran on hurting made it to the car running through the dark behind the convenience store and the shop this was the dangerous part this was where somebody might see him he eased the patrol car out from behind the shop pointed it south and took off no lights in any windows that he could see but in the rearview mirror the fire was going like crazy a mile out of town two miles four then his handset burped and he heard the comm center calling over to the fire station he dropped the hammer on it he was still two miles from the nearest road that would take him away from highway he made it by ten seconds hed made the turn when he saw the light bar on the first responder truck he continued east and out the side window could see the huge balloon of fire at the west house then the comm center was squawking at him and he said he was on the way back but he was pretty far south and he heard the siren come up and he hurt goddamn letty west he was sweating from the pain he could smell himself he made another mile crossed a gravel road heading south into the backside of armstrong four minutes later he was at his garage running the door up inside the house he peeled off his parka took off his shirt and undershirt and examined the hole in his chest it was a hole a purplish sized dot on his chest already surrounded by a nasty bruise he pushed on the skin around it and winced wont do that again blood trickled steadily from the hole not much but it wouldnt stop he went into the bathroom got a roll of gauze made a thick pad went into the kitchen found some duct tape and taped the pad to his chest he couldnt help fooling with the area around the hole squeezing gently to see if he could feel the slug he couldnt but he hurt himself again fuckin dummy he said the phone rang he let it ring probably katina with news about the fire he got enough tape on his chest that he was sure he wouldnt bleed through his shirt then checked his arm martha west had scratched him not too badly but there would have been skin under her fingernails good idea about the fire he washed the scratches with soap and warm water smeared on some disinfectant ointment and ducttaped it all right no blood showing he could still walk around he got a fresh shirt eased into it touched his chest and the pain ran through him the phone started ringing again he ignored it touched his chest again gasped with the pain and headed out to the car the fire station was lit up and empty every man was out at the fire singleton pulled into the station pushed through the main door and called out hey anybody home nobody answered though a hank williams jr song was drawling through the open truck slots hey anybody no excellent he headed up the stairs to the sleeping loft went straight through it to a storeroom where the medical gear was kept the fire department was also the backup paramedic service he pulled down a paramedics pack ripped off the sealer tab and zipped it open shit no pills he needed some painkillers and there wasnt a goddamn thing hed been sure thered be some firefighters always seemed to have a few pills around supposedly because of the small burns they took on the job if so they didnt get the pills from the paramedic packs he zipped the pack up replaced it where else the hospital the drugstore the hospital would probably be on alert with the fire and he didnt know how hed get the drugs anyway the drugstore had a safe he touched his chest goddamnit that hurt he was on his way out when he got lucky all the lockers were open and he saw a tube of pills in one of them he looked at it advil not good enough then he checked all the lockers quickly found a dozen more bottles of pills mostly vitamins and nonprescription painkillers finally in the locker of one of the two fulltime firemen he found two tubes of dilaudid twenty orange tabs in total both tubes carried the notation one tablet every four to six hours excellent he took the tubes dug further through the locker and found another tube penicillin good took that too have to think about katina though he was gonna be out of action for a while and he needed a reason had to think made it out to the car touched his chest goddamn that hurt then he thought wonder where letty west got to hed gone out to her house to solve a problem and hadnt she was still out there letty was singleton got into his car and headed for the fire halfway there a new thought occurred to him mom was gonna be pissed the fire was out and a couple of the firemen were gingerly working through the blackened jumble of burnt wood and plaster in the nowopen basement it looked like a bomb crater lucas and del took turns watching the work and getting warm in the car ray zahn showed up in his highway patrol cruiser and they chatted for a while the comm center called the sheriff he told them to handle it and to coordinate with you guys and then he went back to bed i guess this isnt important enough were not being fair to him del observed no were not zahn said im sure we dont know all the problems and contingencies he has to deal with the miserable twat zahn left on a dragracing call and lucas and del lingered watching more sheriffs deputies came in apparently working on their own time zahn came back and wanted to talk about how rose marie roux might change the highway patrol theyd been back at the fire site for an hour when a gray toyota land cruiser pulled off to the side of the highway and two women got out lucas recognized one of them as the woman hed talked to at the church he dug around in the back of his mind for a moment then came up with her name ruth lewis ruth walked down to a cluster of the firemen as the other woman popped open the back of the land cruiser lewis talked to the firemen for a moment then two of them broke away and followed her back to the truck the second woman was doing something in the back then produced a carton of white paper cups and the firemen who came back with lewis took the cups and stepped out of sight behind the truck coffee del said like to talk to that woman lucas said want some coffee take a cup del said they got out of the acura and walked over to the toyota more firemen and cops were clustering around the back of it taking cups and lucas and del edged into the line when they got their coffee lucas took a sip and stepped over next to lewis you heard what happened you heard about letty some of it i heard she was at the hospital that you took her in lewis said shes hurt lucas said she was shot not too bad but when she was getting away she had to jump out her window she slashed her hand open really bad were flying her down to the cities so a hand guy can look at her her ankle is either busted or twisted so bad that she cant walk thats terrible i heard her mom lewiss eyes went to the house might still be in there were waiting but letty thinks she was shot to death right at the beginning of it she apparently fought the guy long enough for letty to get away this doesnt happen in custer county lewis said somebody told me that the last murder here was fifteen years ago our operating theory is that deon cash jane warr and probably joe kelly kidnapped the sorrell girl and killed her and probably another girl named burke two of them yes we think that hale sorrell somehow grabbed joe kelly and tortured him and got the names of cash and warr we think he found out that his daughter was already dead we think he then waited until their guard might be down a little then he came up here took them and hanged them for the murder of his daughter but we think there was at least one more person involved and that person is afraid that somebody will give him away its a him by the way not a her he spoke to letty she smiled quickly a flitting smile that was gone as quickly as it came thanks for the briefing im not just chatting lucas said something complicated is going on around broderick and i dont know what it is but its the cause of all these deaths and people in broderick are evading us theyre not telling us what they know i dont know why theyre doing that but they are i more or less know everybody in broderick some of the men from the body shop keep to themselves but nobody i know well would have done this kidnapped those girls or she gestured at the burnedout hole in the ground three firemen were standing in the ruins of the basement and as lewis gestured and they looked that way one of them called up to another man who was standing outside the hole and he turned and trotted toward one of the fire trucks two more firemen dropped into the basement aw shit lucas said i think they found her they had lucas and del hung around for another hour watching as the medical examiner crawled down into the basement ten minutes later he climbed back out martha west lucas asked i assume so from what ive been told no way to tell by leaking at the body well have to do dna on the body and on her daughter and make some comparisons but its her all right they lingered a few more minutes then headed back to armstrong there was actually traffic on the highway cop cars and fire department vehicles and maybe rubber neckers running up to see what had happened on the way back del asked whatd you tell ruth lewis i gave her something to be guilty about those kind of women they guilttrip pretty easily just gonna let it percolate yeah overnight then im gonna go up there tomorrow and ask lewis if shell go down to the cities and tell letty that her mother is dead mmm del said then after a minute hitting her with a hammer maybe shell break lucas said they stopped at the hospital found it quiet the duty nurse told them that the resident had gone back to bed and that letty was in the air they got here really quickly she said she glanced at a wall clock she should be at hennepin in a halfhour after leaving the hospital they drove over to the law enforcement center where two people were sitting in the comm center eating microwave pizza lucas borrowed a computer and wrote a memo to the sheriff outlining what had happened and what had been done about it he made two copies put one in the sheriffs mailbox and kept one himself at the motel they went to their separate rooms and though he was tired lucas turned on the television found a movie channel and watched james woods bruce dern and lou gossett get wry with each other in diggstown fortyfive minutes later weather called weve got her on the ground she said the hand is not good but its fixable gonna take a while to heal do you know if she has insurance she doesnt seem to think so she doesnt lucas said im buying is this a roman catholic guilt thing that ive got to be psychologically careful about yeah okay call me tomorrow i want all the details she seems like an interesting child shes scared she jumped out a window got shot got stalked in the dark shot a guy saw her house burned down and her mothers dead she doesnt know about her mother for sure yet im going to try to get somebody up here to fly down and tell her somebody she knows aw jeez all right ill stay with her call me sleep would be tough coming up to five oclock in the morning but he was still too cranked he clicked around the tv channels found nothing that he wanted to watch eventually he put on his shoes and walked down to the motel office that black guy from chicago still here he asked the clerk yup said hes checking out tomorrow morning whats the room twooheight is he gonna be a problem naw i called chicago and they say hes gonna win the nobel prize for reporting i just wanted to shake his hand way too early for this he thought but what the hell reporters fucked with him often enough he knocked on waited knocked again and then a man croaked what time is it five in the morning lucas said checkout time what a crack of light appeared between the curtains in the room window and a moment later mark johnson peered out the door over the safety chain davenport so whatre you doing lucas asked trying to sleep youre so young too lucas said johnson took the chain off and opened the door and yawned and asked whats going on somebody just burned down the west house murdered martha west and shot and wounded letty shes been taken to the twin cities for surgery johnson stared then looked back at his bed then back to lucas youre shitting me i shit you not come on in let me get my pants on jesus what happened i talked to deke and he said youd be marginally okay to talk to yeah margin my ass so the deal is i tell you what you want to know and you got it from an informed source and ive got a lot of stuff that nobody else has picked up like what lucas told him and when he was done johnson stared down at his laptop and said i can see this as a story itll take some work christ the best story of his life is handed to him on a platter and he says itll take some work lucas said the noattribution is the hard part johnson said thats the deal but ill tell you what you come around tomorrow wearing your sport jacket and ill talk or attribution but ill also refuse to comment on some of the other stuff like the locket you can ask the fbi about that theyll be up here tomorrow looking for the kids bodies thats great theyre like the worlds worst media connections they wont tell me anything they might their media trainings improved a lot the last two or three years and ill put in a word for you appreciate it look on my side of the deal i sorta got a name for you he slapped a group of keys on the laptop saving his notes and changing programs then reached into his briefcase for a pen and paper scribbled on it and handed it to lucas a name tom block and a phone number in an unfamiliar area code this is another guy deke put me onto maybe a year ago down in kansas city hes sort of kansas citys lucas davenport although hes younger and betterlooking could be younger lucas admitted whats he do wanders around town but he knows a lot about the cash family and what that whole group does down there you might want to chat he told me a couple of things that i cant use because of libel problems but it wouldnt be a problem for you like tell me one thing like the whole cash family its really more like a clan with aunts and uncles and nephews and all that they started out in drugs and then when crack came in and all the killing started they got out went into other stuff tom says some of the brothers down there went to business school at the university of missouri then came back to kg and diversified yeah yeah one of their things now is that they steal a lot of cars thats the rumor low risk high profit and since calbs body shop up there is involved in this thing you think calbs is a chop shop i dont know doesnt make sense really they could chop cars down there no problem i dont know what calb could do out here that they couldnt do hmmp lucas stood up and stretched he thought he might be able to sleep all right ill probably see you around tomorrow one place or another you still checking out shit no the desk clerk thinks youre up to something being black and all i encourage him to think that johnson said sometimes i cant help myself lucas slept like a baby for almost five hours until del called lucas rolled over and picked up the phone and del said i cant lay down anymore try harder lucas said then ill get up ill come over in fifteen minutes well go down to the bird and get breakfast lucas brushed his teeth and skipped shaving so he could stand in the shower for a few extra minutes he was just pulling on a shirt when del knocked he let del in then sat on the bed and put on his shoes and socks got his coat tossed the car keys to del you drive ive got some calls to make he started by calling the sheriffs comm center where he got the phone number for the church in broderick he called the church and asked for ruth lewis im calling to ask you to do something for me he said when she came on wary what i would like you to go down to the cities and tell letty that her mothers dead she knows it but nobodys come right out and said it yet you know her and she likes you it would be good if you could tell her oh god lewis said then after a moment i could go this afternoon thanks shes at hennepin general and ill call down to make sure they let you through if you go pretty soon you could talk to her this evening the next call went to weathers cell phone she answered after a moment im in the locker room cleaning up i sat in on the operation pretty neat stuff the guy knows how to tie a square knot yeah yeah how is she shes gonna be pretty dopey the rest of the day and theyre gonna put a cage around her hand the hand gonna work shell probably need more surgery you know to release the scar tissue as it builds up but yes she should be okay she wont be playing the piano for a while how about her leg how about the bullet wound the bullet wound isnt a problem the guys up there cleaned it up and should be okay just took some skin off her rib cage and the inside of her arm her ankle is sprained but its not too bad since its on the other side from the cast she should be able to use a crutch for a couple of days if she needs it nothing broken nothing broken hows sam he is just such a cutey hes so cheerful and its pretty apparent that hes really bright no im serious hes really bright i dont think she got lucas laughing all the more because she was sincere talk to you later he told del about lettys progress as he dialed a third number a woman answered st agnes department of psychology my name is lucas davenport im a police officer and i need to talk with sister mary joseph just a minute please elle kruger came on a second later hows the baby she asked probably the most intelligent kid in the twin cities if not the entire midwest lucas said ive got a question for you sort of a semiofficial question go ahead she said cheerfully shed given lucas advice on other cases you know a woman named ruth lewis right used to be a nun sat in on a couple of games with us he sensed a hesitation then i know ruth whats going on with her whats going on with you lucas was dumbfounded elle was his oldest closest friend and he was feeling resistance that hadnt happened before im trying to figure out the sorrell kidnapping a little girl was shot last night almost had her hand cut off and her mother was murdered and then she had her house burned down around her lewis lives just a few blocks down the highway and she knows something shes not telling me i can feel it this guy the guy whos doing the killing hes not gonna stop if he thinks hes in danger another moment of hesitation then lucas are you on your cell phone yes let me call you back elle what the hells going on ill probably tell you but i want to talk to ruth first i want to make sure theres no possibility that shes involved with your case she wont be involved directly but i want to make sure that there are no ramifications from her job that might create some mmm involvement lucas was getting angry elle youre bullshitting me no im not youve just got me stuck if i tell you why youll understand but ive got to talk to ruth first cmon ill call you back lucas i promise i will tell you something about ruth though she wasnt a very good nun because she was too much she demanded perfection and she was the one whod define what that was the people she most admired were all martyrs so shes nuts no shes not crazy but she will do what she will do and you wont stop her nobody will stop her if she winds up martyred because of it that wouldnt faze her wouldnt slow her down in some ways shes a throwback to what the fifties i was thinking of the crusades elle said anyway ill call you back they were coming up to the bird when lucas got off the phone now as puzzled as he was angry del asked what was that all about im getting stonewalled by elle she knows lewis and she knows whats going on but she wont tell me i dont know man del said thats weird i even told her about letty lucas said now we know one thing somethings going on and it probably aint legal what are the chances of two big illegal things going cfn in a town the size of broderick that arent connected somehow slim and none lucas said shes gonna call me back she called back as lucas was in the middle of a lowvoiced rant about the scrambled eggs how in the fuck can you screw up eggs you just scramble them in a bowl with a little milk and then pour them in a pan these things are like burned yellow rubber they even smell like burned yellow rubber whered they get the fucking eggs from a firestone factory dont even get me started on the goddamned danish this feels like a piece of skin is that a prune that looks like dont say it im gonna eat it del said the phone rang and lucas dug it out of his shirt pocket davenport lucas its elle ruth is up at that church or whatever it is she wants to talk to you now elle what the hell is going on i dont know the details i only am aware of the outline of what shes doing but i promised her that you were going in as a citizen and not exactly as a cop that your conversation would be off the record i dont know if youll be able to go along with it but thats what i told her oh boy theyre smuggling grass right theyre using the money to regild the dome on the cathedral another odd hesitation and then elle said talk to her i dont know what shell say they gave up on the breakfast and headed for broderick del still driving on the way out of town they got hung up in a fourcar traffic jam behind a lift truck taking down christmas lights for the first time since theyd come to town there were cracks in the clouds and hints of sunshine the car thermometer said it was six below zero and the air was almost still wherever a house was burning wood the smoke from the chimney went straight up for fifty feet before fading away on the way lucas dialed the kansas city number that mark johnson had given him early that morning the answer was fumbled and lucas recognized it as a cell phone being answered by somebody who was standing on a street corner block yeah my name is lucas davenport im with the bureau of criminal apprehension up in minnesota mark johnson said you might call he said you were the tom block of minnesota but better looking thats true lucas said block laughed and asked so he told me whats going on with the lynching and the kidnapping not a lynching if it was down here it wouldnt be a lynching either in minnesota its a lynching anyway you think the cashes are chopping cars up there no i dont lucas said the place were looking at its called calbs doesnt look like a chop shop it looks like what they say it is car body and truck rehab see any toyota trucks up there i mean connected to this place lucas thought and hed seen one one he said land cruiser now were talking the thing is we know the cashes are moving hot cars weve even caught their boys in a couple but those were going to chop shops down here theres a rumor that they steal new toyota trucks only new toyotas and then the toyotas disappear and theyre never found again ever theyre gone never get in wrecks never sold to wrecking services ive got some numbers of insurance companies that are interested if you want to talk to them but id say were talking anywhere from seventyfive to a hundred trucks a year from all over the midwest and the plains far east as cleveland and far west as denver thats a lot of trucks we figure about five million worth we had one guy across the river in kansas city kansas who bought a new land cruiser sixty thousand dollars got it stolen got his insurance check bought another one and they stole that the second night he had it hmm listen i gotta get a bus if you want to talk come down or call me this afternoon ill have some open time i can tell you all about the cashes i grew up with them anything good del asked that was a toyota land cruiser those women were hauling coffee in right last night yeah i think theyre driving for calb for a week and they drive a sixtythousanddollar land cruiser thatll cause you to think oh boy tell me about it lucas told him and as they came up to broderick he said go on through lets see if theres anything going at lettys as they went past deon cashs place they noticed a halfdozen cars in the driveway and yard fbi has landed del said talk to them later there wasnt much at lettys house one deputy sheriffs car and one state fire marshals car sat next to the hole that used to be the house the deputy was in his car writing on a clipboard and waved at lucas another man was digging carefully through the basement when lucas identified himself the man climbed out on a stepladder he was wearing rubberized coveralls and his face was smudged with charcoal george puckett he said figure anything out not a thing he admitted i dont see any signs of accelerant the sheriffs deputies say the fire was deliberate but i couldnt prove it thats not nothing lucas said that means that the guy probably didnt come here to burn it down probably did it on the spur of the moment might not be nothing but it isnt much puckett said wish i could help more lucas and del walked around the scene a few minutes longer found a patch of blood where letty had huddled in the snow no blood between that spot and the window as far as they could tell although the remaining snow was covered with soot and debris from the fire church del asked i guess what else is there the motherly woman met them at the door looked hard at both of them and without a word took them back to the kitchen where lewis was again working at the table when they came in she stood up looked at del and said id like to talk privately with lucas del shrugged looked at lucas and said ill be out in the tv room when he was gone lewis said sit down lucas pulled out the kitchen chair opposite her she asked want a cup of coffee no im fine so whats the story i wasnt surprised to hear from sister mary joseph id been more or less expecting it she paused but lucas kept his mouth shut anyway she continued we all talked about it and several of our sisters have left in the past two days people not yet too involved so if you decide to bust us they can pick it up later he kept his mouth shut she said so we talked about it and not one of us could figure out how we could be involved in anything that had to do with the girls we couldnt see any possible connection good lucas said the parents of the other girl are coming up here today you could meet them if you like her hand went to her throat thats cruel keep going with the story lucas said whatre you doing ill figure out for myself if theres a connection were smuggling drugs she said abruptly we bring them down from canada we put on nuns habits so that the border people dont check too closely and bring them across marijuana some but thats more complicated usually its tamoxifen and ondansetron theyre cancer drugs and we get people in canada to buy them for us at canadian government prices we bring them across the border and distribute them to people who cant afford them because of the way the drugs are sold in canada they only cost about ten or fifteen percent of what they cost in the us tamoxifen in the states costs a hundred a month or more and you might take it for years the poor tend to skip days or skip whole months and hope they can get away with it ondansetron is a really expensive antinausea drug it costs two hundred dollars to cover the nausea from one chemo treatment so a lot of people go with a cheap drug that doesnt work as well and just put up with the nausea ever been nauseous for a week straight no neither have i but it looks pretty unpleasant we can buy the stuff in canada for thirty bucks cancer drugs lucas said and some marijuana the marijuana is the cheapest way to fight nausea sometimes its the only way and the best marijuana for our purposes comes from british columbia we dont bring it across too often because of the dogs the dogs dont care whether were wearing habits or not and if we have to we can get it in california huh lucas said then just uh for the sake of my own uh technical knowledge how do you get it past the dogs we have a number of religious young men and women from winnipeg who have grown out their hair we provide them with what you might call doper clothing and they drive vans across the border ahead of us if the dogs are working theyll do the van every time and as soon as the people see the dogs they let us know with a walkie talkie if there are no dogs well come across okay cancer drugs yes thats all a little hard to believe sister mary joseph said that if you dont believe you should ask your wife i dont know exactly what that means is she a cancer survivor no shes a doctor then shell know i promise you this lucas and sister mary joseph would tell you the same thing this is only for people who might die if they dont get the drugs people can get the standard chemotherapy one way or another even if they dont have money but the ancillary drugs and the followup drugs lots of times it comes down to a choice between eating and taking the drugs im absolutely serious about that thats what it comes to our drug shipments involve about four thousand patients at the receiving end four thousand and were growing and you werent involved with deon cash or jane warr or joe kelly no except that we drive for gene calb and they did they never tried to cut in on your drug deal there is no money in the drugs we dont get any money we dont buy or sell anything the whole point is that our clients cant afford to buy it you have to understand except for marijuana all these drugs are legal down here were not so much smuggling the drugs as smuggling the prices paid for them they sat looking at each other for a minute then lucas said thats crazy want to know something even crazier there probably isnt any way to make it work better ask your wife lucas took a few seconds to think about it then said my partner claims that a tiny town like this cant have two big crime deals going on at the same time without some relationship between them i tend to agree but if youre telling me the truth i dont see what it could be there isnt one she said so tell me one more thing he said whered you get that land cruiser you were driving last night she blinked up in canada in canada yes at an auction we need a fourwheel drive for some of the roads here when were doing our regular charity work its a terrible truck it has two hundred and fifty thousand kilometers on it were always afraid its going to blow up the transmission feels like youre shifting through a pound of liver it squishes she said then um why did you want to know he was a little embarrassed and shrugged i dont know you told me that story about raising pin money by driving for calb thats true but ive looked at trucks like that and they cost sixty thousand bucks or so so what we have the receipt she was getting a little warm we paid one thousand five hundred dollars for it okay okay lucas stood up to go youre going to go down and talk to letty id be gone already if sister mary joseph hadnt called ill be going in one of our corollas our expensive land cruiser might not make it that far all right all right i had reason to ask so whatre you going to do try to find whoever is doing the killing i dont care about your drugs but if you think of anything anything that might hook it all together youve got to call me this guy wont stop as long as he thinks hes in danger he took a couple of steps toward the tv room then looked back and said when youre taking weed across the border youve got to be careful my partner could smell it on you the other day hes worked with dopers a lot and hes pretty sensitive the guys at the border probably are too we were repacking that day lewis said were very careful before we go across we have no drug abusers here zero thats one of our rules the only people we allow to use drugs are survivors some of them are still on tamoxifen lucas left the room looking for del then turned around and went back to her why isnt there a better way to price the drugs because the drug companies say and they may be right although they lie about everything else that they wont be able to create new drugs that everybody wants or specialized lowprofit drugs if they dont make a substantial profit from the ones theyre selling now so theyre allowed to charge what they want in the united states canadas a small part of their market and its got one central bulk buyer the government and they make the best deal they can so the drug companies sell to canada for a little bit more than cost because the markets small enough that it doesnt have much effect on their overall profit why dont we just make it legal to reimport the drugs because then canada would essentially become a drugwholesaling middleman for the us the drug companies wont allow that theyd start charging canada the american price to get the profit mey say they need the end effect would be that canadians would pay more or go without and americans wouldnt pay less you know that bumper sticker about the arabs nuke their ass and take the gas why doesnt the us just nuke the drug companies ass and take the drugs then whos going to develop the new drugs we need the government the people who brought you the cia and airport security and the bushgore election lucas found del watching night of the living dead with the older woman whod met them at the door you at a good part he asked there are no good parts del said everything okay okay lucas said lets go at least you didnt open fire on anybody the older woman said to del thats a good thing del said out in the car del asked you gonna tell me yeah lucas put the car in gear sighed and said weve gotta talk to the sheriff and the crime scene guys from bemidji start looking through their paper see if theres anything gotta think about it cause it aint these guys so whatre they doing del asked lucas told him when he was done del said i actually heard rumors about them down in the cities never made the connection with these guys i just thought it was some kind of feministwiccaearthgoddessconspiracy urbanlegend bullshit huh whered you hear it my old lady yeah you know where lewis said i should go for more information where my old lady they laughed about that for a very short time and lucas said lets go talk to the feds on the way up the street lucas got back on his cell phone and called the sheriffs office he got the sheriff on the line explained what he needed thats not a bad idea the sheriff said ive got three guys on duty at the schools but thats not critical i could have everybody whos in town down here in fortyfive minutes thatd be great lucas said we need the help were really stuck the fbi squad was led by lanny cole and jim green the agents theyd met at hale sorrells home cole was standing in the yard talking to a man in an air force snorkel parka the furrimmed snout sticking eight inches out from the mans face lucas and del got out and cole came over with the parka and they shook hands this is aron jaffe from hollywood cole said nodding at the parka the parka nodded back hell run the gpr search team can you hear me in there lucas asked talking at the snorkel i can hear you fine jaffe said only my legs are frostbitten is the frozen ground gonna screw you up naw might help he said we might see some seriously unconsolidated stuff they talked for another minute then cole said the second girl burke her parents are driving up here from lincoln they want to look at the locket although i dont think theres any doubt okay lucas said are you all straight with the bca crew yeah were fine you got anything going at all lucas shook his head not much you know about the fire last night went up and looked at the hole this morning the girl who was hurt says the killer sounded like he was from here his voice did the way he spoke the fargo accent said the guy from hollywood yeah we know that three of the kidnappers worked for the calb autobody place and the whole cash family down in kansas city is supposedly heavy into car theft so theres a thing here a nub del suggested a nexus said the guy from hollywood whatever i think its about fiftyfifty that the killers not more than two or three hundred yards away from us somebody from here connected to calbs you wanna jack the guy up i could come along add a little federal heat probably but im going down to the sheriffs office first we need to talk to the deputies to everybody that knows anybody up here theres gotta be some kind of edge we can get our fingernails under before they left they walked jaffe around the place and pointed out spots along the creek behind the house where bodies could have been buried thats a sizable chunk of ground gonna take a while jaffe said they left the fbi men stopped at wolfs cafe found it empty except for wolf ordered pancakes and asked her to name everybody she knew in every building in the town please god dont tell anybody i helped that poor goddamned martha west getting roasted nobodyll hear it from us lucas said she started reciting names and lucas got a piece of paper from his notebook and drew an outline map of the town and slotted the names in cartoon houses they took the map south to the sheriffs office and found twenty or so deputies milling around the sheriff came out and said i got a courtroom upstairs already some people up there ill send the rest of them up now only got two or three who cant make it thirty people half of them in uniform had gathered in the courtroom two or three people who looked like courthouse loafers had squeezed in curious and lucas ordered everybody who wasnt a sworn deputy to leave the loafers squeezed back out and one of the deputies closed the doors i dont want anybody to talk about what goes on here he said if you gotta talk to your wives tell them to keep their mouths shut i know its hard but its only for a couple of days what i have is a list of everybody who lives in broderick he waved dels yellow legal pad i think i have the name of everybody and we need to have a real gossipy talk about who does what up there whos been busted whos been warned what kind of trouble theyve gotten themselves in if they have we need anything youve got im telling you fellas after last night we need to nail this sucker and we dont have a hell of a lot to go on no dna at all one of the deputies asked lucas recognized him as one of the guys whod been at the fire were not too hopeful lucas said mrs west was burned beyond recognition and those of you whove been up at the house know what that looks like its a big pile of charcoal cash and kelly worked for gene calb have you talked to gene yeah but he says he doesnt know nothin about nothin so what i need to know from you is what about gene calb does he really not know nothin about nothin hes always been a pretty good guy one of the deputies said cant see him killing anybody ever been in trouble traffic tickets i guess maybe a dwi when he was a kid the deputy looked around picked out a man in gray coveralls what do you think loren you go up there the man named loren cleared his throat and said i rent a paint booth from him for a couple days every year or so i refinish cars as a hobby the thing is there are some pretty tough hombres up there mike bannister or kiley anderson or dexter barnes everybody knows them gene handles them though so what about these guys bannister and anderson and barnes lucas asked the deputy said theyre mostly just hellraisers but theyve been known to steal a car occasionally theres one guy out there durrell schmidt will steal a calf every once in a while thats what we think anyway had some marijuana around there another man said had some everywhere its mostly just ditch weed a third deputy said they went around for a while told lucas a story or two and laughed at them lucas finally asked so who up there could kill some body who up there if he really got his back to the wall could do that loren said reluctantly you could see three or four of those guys getting drunk and maybe something happens and they get crazy with a gun and shoot somebody almost like an accident but if it came down to sitting around and thinking about it and then doing it i gotta say gene calb maybe dexter barnes i mean if it came right down to having to do something really tough and then doing it one of those two guys i dont think they did but i dont know anybody else up there who who he scratched his chest as he looked for a word who is really organized enough to do this organized isnt the right word maybe there was some nodding of heads but then another deputy said do we know for sure that the guy who killed the sorrells and west had anything to do with the kidnappers or that the guy who killed the sorrells is the same guy who killed west lucas smiled that was a new thought that everything was unconnected we believe theres gotta be some connection if there isnt were really out in the dark another deputy said i talked to the doc this morning the medical examiner and they xrayed martha west and shes got a slug in her head you know about this i havent talked to the me today lucas said good slug most of its there so if its the same guy who did the sorrells you could get a match all right listen guys i want you all to go out and question everybody you know i dont mean interrogations just ask around was there anything weird going on up in broderick anything thats sort of undercover around calbs place if you hear anything from anyone that seems like it might be real give me a call the comm center here has my number so whatre you gonna do somebody asked wait for us to call were gonna go back up and walk the town again the fbi is up there now there are rumors about a second kidnap victim im sure and i can tell you that it seems likely that there were at least two girls not just one so ask around let me know before they left lucas asked a woman in the comm center if there was any place that they might eat a late lunch that didnt involve the bird she suggested they try logans fancy meats which was down two streets and around the corner on the right they tried it and found a slowtalking thin man standing behind a meat counter he was wearing hawkish blackplasticframed glasses the kind that new york authors wear and was reading a copy of the bestloved poems of jacqueline kennedy onassis he sighed when he put the book down and said what can i do for you gentlemen lucas asked those pretty good poems the thin mans eyebrows went up he was skeptical you read poetry i do lucas said ive seen the book but havent had a chance to look through it its very good the thin man said do you know kubla khan of course lucas said maybe the best beginning of a poem ever written its wonderful without prompting the thin man lifted the book and read in xanadu did kubla khan a stately pleasure dome decree where alph the sacred river ran when he finished his eyes gone dreamy behind the black glasses lucas and del shuffled their feet as cops will do when caught listening to poetry and then del cleared his throat and said could i have a cold chuck roast sandwich they left with heavy sandwiches on thick rye bread chuck roast for del and hot sliced chicken for lucas along with bottles of cream soda and ate in the car on the way back to broderick gonna walk the place again del asked no choice things have changed since the fire this time we try to scare them into talking if theres anything worth talking about without thinking much about it lucas headed for the cash house where they could at least be inside when they pulled up cole the lead fbi agent coat less was walking out of the house a black lexus sedan was parked in the yard behind the federal cars a fiftyish couple had apparently just gotten out and were standing passively next to a sheriffs deputy aw man del said as they pulled into the yard must be that burke kids folks worst goddamn thing i can think of having your kid snatched and killed lucas said you want to talk to them maybe to see what they have to say del said good go talk to them i dont want to im gonna start hitting all the houses again find me when youre done with them all right we going after calb looks like there are people over at his shop lucas looked down the highway there was smoke coming out of the shop chimney and a half dozen cars were parked around the lot outside maybe wait one day lucas said do the whole town today and jack him up tomorrow loren singleton hurt the pills helped but they wouldnt last the bleeding at least had stopped but a bruise was growing across his chest from his breastbone to his armpit the bullet hole looked like a black mole clogged with hardening blood he had a fantasy drive to fargo buy some womens makeup at a walmart paint his chest so it looked okay then go barechested for a minute or so in the deputies locker room then he thought why if they wanted to look at his chest theyd look at it whether or not somebody had seen it in the locker room if they looked at it deliberately body paint wouldnt help he thought about calling katina lewis but dismissed that after a moment they were falling in love but there was no way that shed go for the killing of martha west no matter how necessary it may have been he might in fact have to break it off with katina he could fake the flu for a few days but if they stayed together shed have his shirt off soon enough he couldnt bear the idea couldnt stand it he had to do something something to fix it all something that would fix the whole deal that guy davenport at the deputies meeting asked everybody to nose around if everybody did talk to everybody else they might finally figure out that loren singleton had been closer to the kansas city people than anybody had really appreciated if somebody had seen them here and somebody else had seen them there and if they put it with what katina knew and what gene calb knew that was the trouble with a small town too many people knew your business knew your life in the end he called mom margery sat at the kitchen table with her head in her hands you dumb shit you dumb shit what were you thinking about now theyve got to look up here when the sorrells were killed it could have come from anywhere from kansas city now youre sure the kid didnt recognize you im still here singleton said he added after a moment so are you what is that supposed to mean she didnt yell it at him she growled it it means we need a way out she looked at him for a few seconds then said theres only one way out weve got to give them somebody else who did it what if they look at you with that hole in you if they even suspect all they have to say is take off your shirt thats it then youre done i know it he said miserably he touched his chest and tears came to his eyes jeez i hurt i dont know why i help you she said i just oughta go to work and forget about it theyd find out what happened youd go to jail right along with me whos gonna tell them silence then i would you got me into this you witch youre the one who thought jane was so fuckin wonderful youre the one who thought deon was so fuckin smart youre the one who thought of stealin the little girls for christs sake i aint hanging for that i aint hanging for the little girls ill take them out where the bodies are theyll dig them up and you know what theyll find theyll find all that shit from the nursing home that you pumped into them thats what theyll find more silence a full minute of it the locks closing down again just like when they lived together years ago locks on all the doors you gotta do what i tell you if it makes any goddamn sense more tears goddamn i hurt she told him what to do and singleton staggered off to bed pulling at the hair on the sides of his head his head was burning not from the wound but from what his mother had said once facedown he blacked out he woke from time to time to find margery in the living room watching tv watching him mom finally late in the afternoon he pushed himself to his feet brushed his teeth washed his hands went to the bedroom opened the bottom drawer and found the little semiauto he checked it put the gun in his pocket and now a pipe his basement was small dark damp a hole really for the water heater and the furnace and for a few thousand spiders and crickets and ants and mice singleton walked carefully down the wooden steps pulled the string on the bare overhead bulb dug around in an old trash rack and eventually came up with what hed been looking for a lead pipe lead pipes were hard to find theyd been outlawed for decades and when a guy really needed a lead pipe you could hardly find one if you wanted to hit somebody over the head you were usually stuck with a copper or iron pipe which were really too hard to do the job right with copper or iron youd break the skin while with a properly deployed lead pipe you got a nice deadly rap and no blood he was just lucky singleton thought to have one he carried it upstairs walked around the kitchen a few times whacking the palm of his hand with the pipe then stepped down the hall to the living room lets go he said margery pushed herself out of the lazboy you better do this right dumb shit this is it if this aint right were gonna die i know so get some different shit on youre supposed to know how all this works but you gotta get some different shit on singleton pulled out his oldest parka a dark blue nylon job that he hadnt worn in years he got his heaviest gloves and a pair of boots when he bent forward to tie his shoes the pain in his chest suddenly flared and he gasped a highpitched yiiii you goddamn baby margery said katina had said goodbye to ruth and then had gone out as usual to check on a dozen elderly women living in the small towns across the countryside women who needed food or medicine or company katina did it three days a week when she wasnt scheduled to make a run not only did that help build a better cover for the group she enjoyed it and did some good she thought she was south of armstrong by the end of the day coming back into town a halfhour after dark she decided to check lorens house on the chance that he was home and awake she swung by found the house dark went to the garage and looked inside his cars were there and she went and knocked on the door waited knocked again no answer huh when he went somewhere he usually drove loren was not a walker but he wasnt answering the door for a moment that felt sinister what if this killer no there were much better answers than that she stood on her tiptoes and tried to see inside but there was nothing to see after a minute or so she went back to her car shed call him later she thought as she headed back to the church only two women were left at the church in addition to ruth and herself and those two had apparently gone out there were no runs scheduled and the other two had been making country checks like she had she turned on the lights and found a note on the kitchen table gone down to the red red robin for dinner lucys buying if you make it back before six come down she looked at her watch only fivethirty shed missed them by ten minutes she could use some restaurant food she thought she went back out to her car noticed that calbs had gone dark and headed back to armstrong the lights were on at calbs house on in most of the houses up and down the short street singleton and his mother stayed in the dark as much as they could without looking furtive a couple of cars had gone by and theyd leaned behind sidewalk trees as they passed singleton dug at the sole of his boot trying to look as if he were doing something if somebody looked out the window of one of the houses though with the parkas pulled around their faces there was no possibility that theyd be recognized the walk to calbs house had taken ten minutes and by the time they got there the pain was fading again as it had after hed taken the first pill on the other hand his mind still felt a little disconnected a little cloudy that might be okay with gloria calb but hed have to be sharp for gene as they came up to calbs margery said lets go around to the back door wont be in the porch light okay he was like a robot taking directions he couldnt imagine gloria being suspicious of him she knew what he did for gene they walked up the driveway through the fence gate between the house and the detached garage and around to the door knocked on it quietly knocked on it again heard somebody walking around inside knocked on it a third time gloria calb came to the door and looked out the window and he dropped the hood of the parka when she saw his face she pushed the door open loren what are you doing is gene here yet no im just making dinner i was supposed to meet him here weve got a real problem the state police called a meeting today can i come in gene thought hed be home by now she was too polite to do anything but let him in even if shed had a second thought of course im sorry come in gene usually is here by now he pushed the door shut behind him and she turned to lead the way through the kitchen he had the pipe in his hand and her head was right there like a baseball frozen in space and he could see the saltandpepper hair sweeping up past her small pink ear singleton hit her behind the ear with the real actual lead pipe the sound was a sharp whap and singleton could feet the soft pipe deform around calbs skull calb said uhhh and dropped to the floor tried to push up still alive margery whod waited by the side of the house came up inside and squatted next to her shes alive she said give me the goddamn pipe you dumb shit singleton handed her the pipe and margery straddled calb stooping and hit her a halfdozen times on the head hard as though she were breaking rocks with a hammer the second or third blow probably killed her the others were just to make sure there was some blood and singleton pulled one of the plastic sacks out of his pocket and handed it to her and she lifted calbs head by the hair and pulled the bag over it still a little blood on the kitchen floor margery found some allpurpose cleaner under the sink cleaned up the blood with a couple of paper towels the towels went in the garbage bag on top of calbs head and they dragged the body down a hallway and leaned it against the wall in a slumped seated position margery was breathing hard she wiped her hands together as if dusting them off and said all right thats one give me that little gun just in case genes a big one and youre hurt singleton stepped into the living room turned on a light then turned on a hallway light that led upstairs so there would be light coming down from an upstairs window when calb pulled into the driveway he wanted calb to think that gloria might be upstairs he told his mother and she shook her head as if it were all a terrible mistake he went to turn off the lights and she said nah nah leave it get in position then she slapped her forehead oh shit what i gotta make a call you get in your spot if calb pulled straight into the garage as he should hed becoming in the back door through the kitchen singleton moved across the halflit kitchen and looked out a side window toward the garage the garage lights should come on when calb hit his remote control nothing yet he could hear his mother muttering into the phone in the front room what was all that about something at the nursing home singleton leaned back against the wall and for the first time in five minutes noticed the pain in his chest not so bad right now not quite so bad but his chest felt wet he stuck a hand inside his shirt felt the wound felt a dampness and pulled his fingers back out blood goddamnit hed broken the wound open he had to find somebody to work on it and soon god knew what the lead bullet was doing inside of him probably poisoning him thinking about it sent him to the sink where he washed his hands again and wiped them carefully on paper towels he put the towels in his pocket dna his mother came back in the kitchen what ya doing im bleeding again he said wont kill ya she said i seen a lot worse she turned up her head and sniffed something in the oven she stepped over to the stove and looked through the glass front looks like a casserole pork chops singleton said nodding at the sideboard three thick centercut pork chops sat on a sideboard and one of the burners was glowing on the stove turn the stove off he said margery left the burner on but put a kettle on it obscuring the orange glow not bad singleton thought the bubbling pot killed the silence better get back in the hall singleton told her gene doesnt miss dinner calb arrived as the words came out of singletons mouth margery slunk back into the hall as the headlights swept over the side of the house and the driveway the lights in the garage went on and singleton said aloud be alone he pressed himself to the kitchen wall beside the door from the entry the garage door went up then went down and a moment later calb was at the back door stomping his feet on a snow mat gloria he closed the outer door and stepped into the kitchen leaning forward groping for the light gloria singleton hit him on the crown of his head and he went down to his knees singleton grimacing hit him again and calb stayed on his knees and one hand came up his face turned up and he said cars or something like that and singleton hit him across the eyes and this time calb went down margery stepped up took the pipe crouched and began hitting him as she had gloria the hammer swinging once twice three times four five breathing hard she finally stood upright light in her rattlesnake eyes how many times had she hit calb he had no idea but calb was dead all right his head was like a bag of bone chips that got him the old lady said with satisfaction did you kill people at work the old men you didnt like the rattlesnake eyes slid away whatre you talking about lets get to work dumb shit singleton looked at calb and suddenly began bawling again his mother muttered something and went into the living room and singleton wiped his eyes on his sleeves and got a bag out and bagged gene calbs head then he got a paper towel and the cleaned a smear of blood off the floor put the paper towel in the bag and called his mother and together they dragged calb into the hall and left him next to his wife back in the kitchen goddamn something smells good margery said turning toward the stove where the casserole was still cooking smacking her lips margery made him clean the floor again he was doing that and she was back in the living room keeping an eye out she said when the doorbell rang he was on his hands and knees and heard the door open and his mother say come in and then wheres loren and gene and he recognized the voice and his eyes got wide and he lurched to his feet and called katina and at that very second he heard the door close and remembered giving margery the and he stepped to the doorway with the towel in his hand and saw katina looking at him a question on her face and margery standing behind her her arm pointed at katinas head and he shouted no bang katina went down her eyes rolled and she went down on her face and she never twitched and singleton screamed something at his mother and started toward her and she leveled the at him and screamed back get the fuck away from me get away everything locked up then margery said quietly its gonna take two of us to finish this she had to go because there was no way for you to break it off that wouldnt be suspicious now you want to help or you want me to finish you off too the gun never wavered goddamn that smells good margery said it had taken a while but singleton wasnt going to hurt her not now or not yet hed started thinking she went to the stove opened the oven took a couple of hot pad mitts off hooks beside the stove and pulled the casserole out she turned the top burner back on found a pan in the bottom of the stove and dropped in the pork chops she found plates and bowls and silverware dumped some macaroni and cheese from the casserole dish into the bowls fried up the pork chops and slid them onto the dish damn thats good margery said they sat in the semidark kitchen and talked about what to do next chest hurt they finished eating cleaned up the dishes and put them away threw the cooking trash in the garbage and began ransacking the house two suitcases clothes shoes jewelry gloria calbs purse cosmetics some photographs they took two photographs out of their frames and left the frames threw it all into the suitcases and carried the suitcases out to calbs suburban as they went through the house collecting things that the calbs would take with them to hell they searched it looking for money if calb had left money in the house margery said and the cops found it that could queer everything they found nothing except two safe deposit keys for a bank in fargo margery took them put them in her purse then the bodies gene and gloria calb went out to the suburban he humped them out as fast as he could but calb was heavy and he wound up dragging him still the effort nearly killed him and margery was no help at all singletons chest felt as though it were tearing apart and he hadnt yet gotten to the hard part of the evening katina in dying had leaked onto the carpet they left the blood spot and carried her upstairs got a chair from the bedroom pushed open the access hatch to the insulation space under the roof and pushed her body up through the hole she was wearing a sweater and singleton carefully dragged the sweater across a rough spot in the framing around the hatch so that a few strands of wool were pulled out back downstairs forgetting something he thought hurting he needed another pill is what he needed christ this might be too much what was he forgetting he walked through the whole scene and remembered the shell from the found it in the kitchen carried it outside rolled it through gene calbs fingers and made sure he got one good right thumbprint on the cartridge as it would be if gene were pressing a shell into a magazine carried the cartridge back inside and tossed it on the floor his mother had one last idea gene had a home office they went through a rolodex and inside found a kansas city phone number for davis he dialed the number and a woman answered hello my names carl we are asking kansas city people for donations to the missouri state law enforcement association which supports your local state county and municipal law enforcement officers we gave some a womans voice said our records dont show that singleton said we feel our law enforcement officers he strung the conversation out another ten seconds until an increasingly irate woman said go away and the phone slammed down thered be a record that just before the calbs disappeared theyd called shawn davis in kansas city good enough in the garage he got a shovel and they climbed into calbs truck he had three hours before he went on duty needed another pill too as they backed out of the driveway he thought goddamn those pork chops were good then he thought katina margery said watch out for the mailbox you dumb shit the rest of the evening was straight out of a horror film by the time singleton got home he hurt so badly he could barely breathe he peeled off his coat peeled off the fleece under it and found a threeinch bloodstain on his shirt he took off the shirt and his bloody undershirt touched the bullet wound and flinched the scab over the hole had cracked open and when he touched it the pain flared through his rib cage and ran around almost to his spine at this rate his arm would soon be useless he began sobbing as he looked at himself in the bathroom mirror katina what about katina was she in heaven was she looking down at him knowing what hed done he braced himself on the sink with both hands and tipped his head down and tried to cry something more than the gasping sobs nothing came out after a moment he pulled himself back together and began looking at the wound again something had to be done he carefully manipulated the bruised skin with his fingers squeezing it like a pimple fighting the pain the skin and fat wasnt particularly thick at the entry point and he thought could it be his imagination that he felt a lump the lump didnt move though hurt but he couldnt help himself he went to the dresser and dug out a sewing kit took out a needle ran hot water on it for a moment and then using the eye end probed the bullet hole the probe hurt but not as much as squeezing the wound holding his breath he moved the needle around then down a bit maneuvered felt as though he were pushing muscle aside and hit something hard didnt feel like bone he moved the needle carefully now judging the characteristics of the lump found the edges thats it he muttered to himself he found what he believed to be the center of the slug and pushed on it a little pain but the lump didnt move he found trie edge of it explored beside it brighter blood was coming out now apparently from freshly pierced capillaries and it made the exploration more difficult the lump more slippery but he found the side of it and pushed with the end of the needle it didnt move he explored some more he was sweating now from the pain but the pain was still bearable after a minute he pulled the needle out and looked at it the bullet he thought was stuck in a rib hadnt gone through but had gotten into it every time he breathed or flexed the motion was transmitted through his rib cage and that was where the spasms of pain came from he thought about it for a moment then pulled on a sweatshirt and went out to the garage if he hadnt had just the right thing to work with he might not have tried but he did have the right thing or what seemed like the right thing in his tool box a pair of tiny needlenosed pliers used to do automotive electrical work this was going to hurt he thought but if it worked he carried them back into the house took two pills scrubbed the pliers with antibacterial soap and then still not happy with their condition dropped them in a saucepan covered them with water and put them on the stove he let them boil for a while then cool down underwater as he waited for the pills to take hold he glanced at the clock fortyfive minutes before he was due at work he could do this he did it sitting at the kitchen table probed the lump with the needle then slowly pushed the pliers in until he touched it the pain had been dulled by the pills but this hurt as bad as anything yet his right hand the pliers hand began shaking so he pinned the pliers in place with his left hand and leaned against the table bracing himself then with his right hand steady now he slowly spread the pliers pushed them down alongside the lump or what felt like down his hand shaking again and squeezed pain flared through his body might have gotten some meat he thought squeezed and had it slow and steady he held it pulled pulled had some meat but then suddenly felt the lump come free held it held it pulled and had it out it emerged like a small gray larva slick with blood a slug half the size of a pea blood dribbled out of his chest again but now everything felt different the pain was changed thered been an ugly corrosive feel to it and now it just hurt this he could handle he tottered off to the bathroom looked at himself in the mirror his face seemed narrower sharper wolflike and white from the pain his frown lines etched deep but he could touch his chest without flinching he could manipulate the wound area without the arc of pain he took two tabs of penicillin and a pain pill and looked at his watch had to start moving he patched himself with gauze and tape carried his bloody shirt and undershirt and fleece down to the washer and threw them in poured in a halfcup of liquid tide and started it climbed into his uniform almost done now he thought as he buttoned up his shirt there was letty west but if they were searching the landfill he would have known about it and so far they werent maybe she didnt know maybe hed taken that risk for nothing he had the night to think about it and to think about the bullet there was a sense of accomplishment with the bullet damn that was a story maybe he could tell it someday that night was the longest in singletons life and like most of the other nights of his life nothing happened he drove back and forth through town his usual eleven oclock grid then headed out into the countryside passing through a list of small custer county towns showing the flag for the sheriff he tried to think about katirta as he drove but where katina used to be there was a big dark box he tried to focus on her face and nothing came he tried to think about what would happen in the next few days and couldnt think of anything at seven oclock he signed off went home and crashed lay fully clothed on his bed unfeeling until the telephone rang they were stuck theyd spent the day before tramping around broderick talking with housewives and calb employees getting nowhere the pitch lucas had made to the sheriffs deputies hadnt produced anything yet and lucas began to wonder if he might be able to devise a way to pull the killer in the problem was a lack of bait there was letty but he couldnt use her might have been able to use her if she was a fiftyyearold asshole whod brought the trouble on herself but not an innocent teenager he worried a little that hed even bothered to think of reasons not to use her he was sitting on his bed at the motel reading a star tribune story about the attack on the west house and waiting for del to knock the tv was tuned to the weather channel because theyd heard a rumor from the night clerk that snow was coming in coming in somewhere when he looked out the window after he got up there were a few fat flakes drifting around but nothing serious he was rereading the fire story when the room phone rang ruth lewis the sheriff called they want to bury martha west tomorrow and im going to bring letty back up i wanted to let you know the sheriff said theyll provide security at the funeral she can travel letty your wife says so your wife is the admitting physician by the way she said you didnt know she said theyll need letty back here in a week but that she could travel tomorrow has anybody figured out where she could stay yes shell stay with me i have lots of room right now and we get along all right i wish id known about the funeral i might have tried to push it a couple of days i dont know about that lewis said the sheriff said the arrangements had been made and thats what i know come and see me when you get up here lucas said weve got more to talk about maybe she said del came by we doing calb ive got nothing else lucas said they got in the car and loafed up to broderick across the gray landscape heading for wolfs cafe where theyd found that the pancakes were edible the snow had gotten heavier and a north dakota radio station said there could be four to six inches by evening there were a halfdozen cars parked outside cashs house bca crime scene guys the fbi and at least one deputy sheriff lucas guessed wolfs was quiet with only two other customers both on stools at the bar one talking with wolf about going to palm springs the other eating cherry pie and drinking coffee and eavesdropping lucas and del took the furthest booth so they could talk through the window they could see the front of calbs body shop and could see people coming and going hate waiting del said were just waiting for somebody to get killed so weve got something more to work with wed know what we were doing if we could figure out why he went after letty if he went after letty were assuming that but what if he was after martha were thinking it was letty because weve been hanging around with letty no no we think its letty because after he killed martha he went after letty del said he tried to hunt her down out there after he killed martha letty says her mother was yelling at her to get out martha just got in the way lucas nodded okay so what does letty know that makes it necessary to kill her must be something maybe she doesnt know she knows del said well talk to her again tomorrow i keep going back to your theory that there cant be two big separate crimes in one small town without them being related somehow lucas said weve got two big separate crimes the drug running and the kidnappings and they dont seem to be related could be an exception i guess del said but he rubbed his chin sipped at his coffee maybe we ought to get with ruth or one of the other women and do a whole history of how they got here why here how did they get involved with calb cant be just a coincidence that calb has these ties down to kansas city car thieves and these women he trailed off and lucas said what what what where were you going with that cause you gotta be right how did they hook all this together how did they land on calb out there in the middle of the prairie theres gotta be more to it that cheer you up gives us something to think about lucas said something to pull at wolf brought the pancakes over and a couple of minutes later as they were eating a black lexus backed out of the cash house rolled south and pulled into the parking lot next to lucass acura a whitehaired man got out of the drivers side and a moment later jim green the fbi agent got out of the passenger side green pointed at lucass acura and said something to the whitehaired man who went back into the lexus and fished out a briefcase they clumped inside and looked around and lucas lifted a hand the two men came down and squeezed into the booth tom burke lucas davenport minnesota bca green said youve already met del the fbi crew hasnt found anything any gravesites burke said we dont know whether to be relieved or disappointed lucas shook his head burke said i have some paper that jim said you may be interested in when annie was taken the kidnappers told us that if we contacted the fbi or any other police agency they would know because they had a source inside the fbi they sent us these papers he produced a neatly xeroxed stack of papers and handed the stack to lucas i took them to my attorney who had worked with the justice department before he went into private practice and he said they looked authentic so we paid up without calling in the fbi i felt a little foolish even at the time but i didnt think we could take the chance we never heard another word from the kidnappers lucas riffled through the stack of papers and burke added those arent the originals the originals are back home with the fbi it looks like stuff ive seen from the fbi lucas said green said whoever did it had some idea of how the paperwork looks but its not quite right the fonts arent quite right the formats arent quite right its like they made them on a computer cash and warr had a computer nothing on it but games green said not even a word processor what those are are supposed memos inside some kind of kidnapping unit its all bullshit the kidnappings they talk about never occurred its just good enough to convince mr burke not to talk to the authorities before he paid the money because we didnt care about the money burke said one million dollars in unmarked nonsequential fifties and hundreds we thought that if we paid maybe they wouldnt kill her it was worth the chance if you didnt care about the money del said we didnt not too much anyway he showed a quick thin grin dug into his briefcase and pulled out another stack of xeroxes i gave one of these to jim theyre checking the bills they got from deon cashs house i understand one of you gentlemen found them del did lucas said he took the second stack of sheets they were legalsized xeroxes each showing several fifty and hundreddollar bills what we did is we got the money from the casinos new bills in stacks of sequential numbers there were twenty bills in each stack we xeroxed all those stacks the way it broke down there were eight hundred and fifty of them and from those you can figure out all the serial numbers youve got the top serial number and the additional nineteen bills follow in order then we mixed them all up so theyd appear to be nonsequential but you can look at any bill and tell if it came from the vegas money pretty smart lucas said the money in cashs place came from you dont know yet green said the moneys locked up in the bank and we had to wait until it opened this morning time lock on the safe deposit there was no great hurry anyway weve got a guy over there now looking did you ever have anything to do with kansas city or a cash family in kansas city del asked burke we have nursing homes in the kansas city area burke said i own six different chains of nursing homes in minnesota nebraska iowa kansas and missouri but when jim told me about the kansas city connection as part of our publicrelations campaigns we donate money to various hospitals and medical schools for research on agerelated illnesses about a month before annie was taken wed given two million dollars to the university of missouri medical schools our publicrelations people tried to get it in all the papers where we have nursing homes they did very well i suspect those stories were the proximate cause of annies kidnapping oh boy lucas said del asked where do you have nursing homes in minnesota around here yes in armstrong down in red lake falls crookston detroit lakes fergus falls and there was a story in the armstrong paper yes im afraid so burke said i have to say that if id found out who they were i wouldnt have done what mr sorrell did but i understand it and i applaud it i wish to god i could have shaken his hand now weve got to get this last one or the last ones we have to root out all of them doing our best green said well get them him lucas said its one guy how do you know green asked the feel of the killings its one guy lucas looked out the win dow toward calbs shop little bits of icy snow were drifting across the highway cold up here burke said they finished eating and were pulling on their coats when green got a call on his cell phone they were at the door when green said hey and waved them back they stepped back and he said numbers match on the ransom money burke had tears in his eyes but didnt seem to know it lucas put the paper from burke in the car and they rolled across the highway to calbs inside two guys were working on the truck theyd seen before and it occurred to lucas that there were too many people for too little truck he stopped the closest guy is gene calb around the guy shook his head cant find him should be here we need the keys for the office cant find him lucas said no answer at his house hes always here first the guy said dont know where he couldve got to lucas and del went back outside to the acura moving fast please god let him be at logans fancy meats they sped back toward town lucas pushing the acura hard the snow was coming down harder now the flakes a little smaller but driven by a wind from the northwest now it looked serious two miles out of broderick a car a halfmile in front of them and coming their way suddenly showed the flaring red lights of a police roof rack goddamn radar lucas said it was zahn in his patrol car lucas continued past him then pulled to the shoulder jumped out and as zahn swung around in a circle waved at him zahn pulled up and his window rolled down and he said i hate to ask nobody can find gene calb lucas said hes not at work not answering his phone were heading for his house you know where he lives follow on behind me zahn said they tucked in behind him and rolled down to armstrong and lucas could see him talking on his radio calling the sheriff lucas said a deputys car was pulling up outside calbs house when they arrived a neighbor across the street stood by his picture window watching as they all got out the deputy asked what do you think knock on the door lucas said they all trooped up to the stoop pushed the doorbell heard it ringing inside when nothing happened lucas knocked and pushed the doorbell again del went around to the back looked in the window on the back door then returned to the front of the house cant see anything in the kitchen i think theyre just gone zahn walked over to the garage and tried the door it opened and he looked inside then closed the door both cars here out for a walk del asked lucas said lets go ask that guy he nodded across the street at the neighbor in the picture window he and del walked across and the neighbor met them at the door he was wearing a blue fleece sweatshirt and had a pipe clamped between large yellow teeth havent seen them he said whats going on when did you see them last puff puff thought i saw gloria yesterday evening when she turned on the lights in the living room thats about it havent seen anybody coming or going nope whatd they do nothing that we know of lucas said they looked up and down the street they have any friends close by puff puff more thought the carlsons up in that stonefront house theyd probably be their best friends but were all pretty friendly around here thanks as they were walking away the man said that red corolla in front of the house i dont know who that belongs to he pointed with his pipe its been there all night yeah they stopped to look inside the corolla saw a clipboard and what looked like a daily diary on the passenger seat and in the back seat two packing boxes of canned food that looks like the stuff the church women take around del said i saw a corolla there too been here all night lucas tried the car door and the door popped open he reached across the seat and picked up the diary inside the front cover was a handwritten katina lewis lucas showed the diary to del is that ruth lewis or somebody else del shook his head i dont know and where is she they walked back across the street and talked to the deputy and zahn the deputy said katina shes the other ones sister shes going with one of our guys loren singleton shes been sleeping over with him but hes like a mile from here give him a ring lucas said to zahn could you run down to the leg and talk to the sheriff and ask him to get a search warrant up here youll have to swear that we were looking for calb for questioning in connection with a crime which we are on my way lets go talk to the carlsons lucas said to del linda carl son was a goodlooking blond fortyfiveyearold whose husband worked as a state farm agent she had large eyes slightly tilted upward that made her looked sleepy as though shed just been rolling around in bed with someone lucas saw her and thought mmm i called over there last night but didnt get an answer she said putting a hand on lucass sleeve she was a toucher too i was kinda surprised that there was nobody home because i talked to gloria yesterday afternoon and they werent planning to go anywhere she was wearing a fuzzy angora vnecked sweater and her hand crept up the v until it stopped at her throat and she said in a hushed voice you dont think anythings happened were just trying to get in touch lucas said ive got a key carlson said i can go down there anytime lucas spread his hands we cant go in without a search warrant if you could just take a peek if you dont think the calbs would care all we want to know is that theyre okay they wouldnt care let me get my coat she went to get her coat and del muttered youve got drool dripping out the side of your mouth marriageboy just looking lucas said back at the calbs the deputy said i talked to loren he was on duty last night and didnt see lewis he said he thought she was coming over before he went on duty but she never showed up he called the church and she wasnt there okay carlsons key was for the back door she went in as lucas del and the deputy waited on the back porch she called gloria gloria gene she disappeared into the interior of the house then came back and said to lucas maybe you better come in what are they nobodys home she said she was nervous turning pink i dont know about these things but glorias a very neat housekeeper if this she led lucas to a hallway off the kitchen and pointed down there was a dark spot on the carpet about the size of a paper pie plate not coffee not coke heavier than that crustylooking lucas squatted next to it then said please dont touch anything keep your hands by your side and carefully walk back out through the door okay he followed her out to the porch and said to the deputy wait out here okay and to del cmere del followed and when lucas showed him the rug he squatted as lucas had then said yeah he stood up went into the kitchen tore a small sheet of paper towel off a roll by the sink tapped it under the faucet head to get it damp then stepped back to the hallway and touched the dark spot with the damp point of the paper towel he held it up to lucas the towel showed a diluted bloodred thats a problem del said lucas pulled out his cell phone and dialed the leg asked for the sheriff anderson came on and he asked have you seen ray zahn hes here now were working out a warrant listen a friend of the calbs from down the street had a key and permission to go into the house she went in found blood and invited us in i dont know the legal aspects of it but it looks bad we need that warrant down here right now before we start pulling the house apart but we need it now ten minutes anderson said ill walk it around myself lucas called green the fbi agent told him about the blood tsend our crime scene guys down here will you lucas asked we rrfay have another scene for him to process right now green said lucas rang off and del said over here he was squatting in a corner of the kitchen and lucas stepped over a pistol shell lay against a molding a del said yeah goddamnit listen lets do a walkthrough were okay on that the bloods fresh enough quick trip through the house the house was large but they did the first pass in five minutes no bodies but the house had been stirred around closets are halfway cleaned out del said lot of stuff gone and they were in a hurry whose blood is it if the calbs were running how did they run if both of their cars are in the garage taxi to the airport do they have a taxi here do they have airplanes that go anywhere shit i dont know they were snapping at each other feeling the pressure three people on the line the calbs and the church woman katina lewis wheres the goddamn sheriff anderson arrived ten minutes later couldnt find the judge he was in but he was down in the surveyors office bullshitting took forever to find him were okay to dig around go ahead anderson said you need more people i dont know lucas said the bca crime scene people are coming down from broderick the fbi may be with them first thing weve got to figure out if the calbs are really gone wheres that blood lucas showed him and anderson shook his head thats a lot of blood but whose blood is it lucas asked having given the house a quick runthrough they checked the cars the engines were cold so they hadnt been used in the past couple of hours there was nothing in either one of them that helped the lead crime scene guy arrived with one of his subordinates and with del and lucas trailing they began in the basement and slowly worked their way to the top of the house the subordinate noticed the strands of wool on the hatchway that led to the space under the eaves they wouldnt hang there forever he said if they were in a hurry what were they doing up there had something hidden del suggested they got a chair and then an ottoman to stack on top of it and lucas and del helped him balance as the crime scene guy stood on top of the ottoman pushed the hatch up clicked on his flashlight and froze oh jesus he said aw jesus christ who i dont know get me down the tech hopped down and lucas clambered on top of the ottoman when he stuck his head through the opening katina lewiss face was four inches from his her dead eyes looked straight through him and he instantly flashed back to the hanging scene the dead eyes of cash and warr and he saw the face of the other woman ruth lewis in this woman lewis he told del just like the other ones only her lucas couldnt see past her but he could see the rest of the area and there was nothing but pink insulation i dont see anyone else i need to get a little higher he grabbed the edges of the hatch pulled himself up a foot but didnt have the leverage to get any farther he could just see over lewiss body and there was nothing but insulation nope i think its just her ill get something out on the calbs anderson said you think its gene doing this looks like it lucas said he climbed down off the ottoman and chair whoever it is hes breaking up hes going through a psychotic break if its calb id say his wife is in big trouble he could kill anyone now the crime scene crew had suspended work at cashs house and had moved down to calbs lewiss body was still in the crawl space under the eaves and nobody knew exactly when they could move her removing the body would be a job and they wanted as few people as possible going in and out of the house until it was fully processed lucas and del carefully probed through the life the calbs had left behind calb had a small home office and one of the file drawers was open files had been taken lucas thought he found income tax returns for but nothing newer none of the files related directly to the bodyshop business but when theyd talked to calb the first time lucas had noticed a row of filing cabinets in his office so business papers might well be there del came in after a while with a small zippered bag he handed it to lucas who said what and zipped the bag open an insulin kit somebodys a diabetic and didnt take his or her shit del said unless this is a backup still a deputy came through and they asked him about the airport it was small planes only and calb wasnt a flier as far as the deputy knew nor were there any taxis in town one of the bca investigators from bemidji whod been working at the cash house called to say that he and his partner had walked across to calbs place and had frozen it all the employees were there and they were detaining any more who showed up then the crime scene crew at calbs house found a fingerprint on the shell well do the super glue trick but its about the best single print ive ever seen the tech said well have something for you lucas going through mrs calbs bedroom closet found two shoeboxes that contained virtually new shoes with perhaps an evenings worth of wear on the soles in calbs closet on the floor under some shoes he found a steel box and inside the box a thousand dollars in tendollar bills and a loaded caliber smith wesson revolver im getting a bad vibe del said he might leave the gun if hes got another one why would he leave the money a few minutes after noon the sheriff came back trailing a tall cowboylooking cop who the sheriff introduced as loren singleton loren was seeing ms lewis anderson said im sorry lucas said about your friend singleton was distant a little vague lucas had seen it before im a you know we were hell we were sleeping together but i uh a tear ran down his cheek and he wiped it with his shirt sleeve goldarnit whyd this have to happen you think it was gene that did it cant find him do you know any reason hed have a problem with ms lewis no i dont singleton said i know what katina was doing i know what those women were doing and im sure gene knew but how in the heck i mean what would that mean to gene what were the women doing anderson asked taking a halfstep back from his deputy bringing prescription drugs across the border from canada lucas said they had a little distribution thing going giving out drugs to the poor anderson nodded glanced at singleton and said well tell you the truth half the people in town do that sometimes no point in smuggling though you can order on the internet gotta have the internet lucas said most of their clients are poor and a lot of them are older probably not too big on the internet how well did you know gene calb del asked i grew up here so i knew him pretty well singleton said i didnt think i dont know that hed do anything like this i mean i refinish cars as a hobby and once a year or so id rent one of his paint booths to do some painting thats how i met katina at calbs what was she doing there lucas asked singleton shook his head just chatting i guess i mean therere only forty or fifty people in that town you tend to chat when you can you know anything about toyotas lucas asked toyotas singleton looked at anderson who frowned at lucas toyotas anderson asked there are some people down in kansas city associated with deon cash members of his family who apparently steal a lot of toyotas theyre never found again toyotas singleton said he scratched his breastbone you know i never thought about this but there were a lot of toyotas going through genes shop you dont see that many around here but youd see them in genes shop just about every time i went up there when i think about it didnt seem strange then but it seems kinda strange when you mention it what were they doing to them rehabbing them what sometimes it seemed like they had some parts off but they werent chopping them or anything they were like fixing them and painting them man they painted a lot of toyotas aw jesus del said to lucas thats where the hot toyotas went when the girls the women came back across the border they were always in a toyota land cruiser or maybe some old beatup runner theres always one of them around the church up there you didnt think anything was weird about that lucas said singleton wagged his head well sure but i knew what they were doing and i guess i didnt have much problem with it i mean gosh everybody around here does it everybodys drugstore is over there they talked for a few more minutes then singleton went to look at katina lewis he came back down the stairs two minutes later even more shaky sweating a bit jeez jeez almighty go home and lie down for a while lucas said thats gonna help no not much but its better than walking around with everybody staring at you you look kinda messed up aw man lucas said to del they bought old toyotas across the border brought them down here took what they needed off the bodies junked what was left then transferred the papers to the ones theyd just stolen and moved them back across the border probably sold them out in the woods somewhere where nobody would ever give them a second look even if somebody looked the papers would match cause they were legitimate papers youd have to take the car apart to figure out something was wrong the women took them back and forth and the body shop guys probably rigged up some kind of plugin carriers for the drugs a false floor some kind of undercarriage box that you could move from one vehicle to the next with their tools they could build anything you could get a million pills into a oneinch deep false floor in the back of a land cruiser dont get two big crimes in a small town without them being related del said so the women would know about calbs little sideline which was bringing in a few million a year lucas said del nodded and they both thought about it okay i can see calb for doing lewis del said after a moment but why in hell would he do the sorrells or letty because sorrell tortured one of their guys joe kelly who knew what kelly told him about the whole kansas city arrangement thats why they had to act so fast if sorrell found a way to tip the cops i mean all wed need is about three words and wed know all of it if sorrell called and said hey a guy named gene calb is buying cars across the border and switching them with cars stolen in kansas city by the cash gang and if wed called around itd take us fifteen minutes to put the parts together how about letty i dont know about letty but what if it was lettys mother shed lived there for a long time would she know something was going on at the body shop maybe even knew exactly what it was the stolen toyotas so then her kid is hanging around with us and again all shed have had to say was about three words and wed have been on calb likejloly on the pope gonna be interesting talking to ms lewis today del said he looked at his watch funeral in two hours they oughta be getting here ruth lewis called the calb house a halfhour later a deputy answered and she asked for lucas the deputy handed the phone to lucas and said ruth lewis ill take it how did it happen ruth asked when lucas came on she was croaking as though shed spent the morning crying we dont know yet we didnt know about the stolen car ring so we didnt lean hard enough on calb something happened here last night we think your sister was killed here and the calbs are gone if youd told me about this we might have avoided it oh my god is there anything else i need to know right away oh god ruth was weeping then a different womans voice i dont think she can talk any more where are you is letty there were up at the church lettys here tell ruth to stay there well be there in ten or fifteen minutes the snow was steady but not getting any worse there were a few little drifts around the edges of buildings and down in the ditches and the highway was slick maybe an inch and a half maybe two inches lucas thought letty was waiting by the church door with the older woman whod watched night of the living dead with del letty was happy to see them she held up her hand in a fiberglass cast smiled automatically but then her lower lip came out and tears started and she said my moms dead lucas was not good around tears even littlegirl tears and he tried to pat her on the back and she threw her arms around his waist and squeezed they say gene calb lucas pried her off and walked her away from the older woman sat on a chair and asked letty think about it was the guy you shot at was that gene calb i dont think so she said shaking her head i would have known him he was fat and i couldnt see the man but i dont think he was fat i dont think his voice was right was gene shot because i shot the man theres a question about whether you hit him i hit him but if youre shooting shorts it might not even have gotten through his coat a cold night he might have been all bundled up then why did he fall on his butt you dont fall on your butt if the bullet sticks in your coat maybe he was ducking he wasnt ducking he fell on his butt then he crawled for a while and then he ran back to the house and then the fire started when they finished talking lucas sent letty to the tv with the older woman who told letty that she had to change for the service for the funeral letty said correcting her lucas wagged his head at del and they walked through the church to the kitchen where they found ruth at the kitchen table she was redeyed redfaced gene did this with gloria thats thats are you sure she had a brown cardigan wrapped around her shoulders were not sure we just cant find them there was blood on a carpet and we found your sister hidden up under the roof why bother to hide her if she was so easy to find ruth asked maybe they didnt think anyone would come looking or that if somebody did they couldnt look too hard maybe all they expected was a head start hard to believe gene wasnt a bad man i didnt think he was why didnt you tell us you know why she said defensively you could let us go when you knew what we were doing but you could never let gene go how did you get hooked up with him anyway she sighed one of our people up in canada knew a man who bought a car from one of his salesmen we desperately needed different cars to bring the drugs across you cant keep going back and forth two or three times a week without somebody asking why so when we figured out where the cars were coming from i came down here and talked with gene he wasnt too happy but you know if hed done this if he killed katina why didnt he kill me way back then different situation del suggested no pressure then maybe anyway i talked to him i told him that we would all be committing crimes together so nobody could talk about anyone else he really needed people to drive the cars across since he was starting to do some some volume we were perfect older women forties and fifties and sixties who would suspect and gene built some special things for us that fit in the toyotas and let us bring the drugs across it was all very smooth did you bring a toyota through last night lucas asked no the last one was the one we had at the fire at the wests house you saw it gene took it it was a wreck though i dont think it would make another two hundred miles you know what the license plates were i have no idea okay you got some people killed lucas said he said it in a soft voice but a mean one taunting like a bully trying to pull another kid into a fight pushing her but there was no connection between the kidnappings between deon and jane and the car deal she said she said listen to me no connection i knew gene pretty well and he didnt even like deon or jane he didnt trust them deon wasnt a big shot in this thing he was a driver he was a gofer but if wed had a piece of it it wouldnt have made any difference she shouted tears running down her face youre not listening to me the kidnappings and all the rest of it werent connected they werent a little later lucas spoke to neil mitford i dont think the governor necessarily would want to know about this conversation lucas said as an opener thats why i work here mitford said talk to me lucas outlined the situation including the murder of lewis and the coverup of the stolencar ring the women covered up material information we could bust them six different ways the thing is im not sure that if they had told us it would have made any difference to the killer hes operating on some other schedule i cant figure out why calb would kill lewis and then run for it as far as we can tell she didnt know anything that all the other women didnt know if he was going to kill lewis he should have been up here trying to wipe out the church and if we bust the women thats the end of their little drugrunning enterprise mitford said thats right i dont feel too good about that and to tell the truth i think we could smell a little stinky afterward we bust them and four or five thousand women dont get their cancer pills let me rephrase that for you mitford said four or five thousand registered voters wont get their cancer pills and theyll complain to one of the biggest interest groups in the country the breastcancer coalition you think we should let it slide i dont think anything im not a law enforcement officer i dont even recall having this conversation the governor certainly never kaiew about it so im working on my own book welcome to state government mitford said lucas and del left the church so letty and the other women could get ready for the funeral and walked across the highway to calbs the two bca investigators were in the shop working through the office a deputy was sitting in the work bay with a halfdozen employees scattered around the bay on folding chairs lucas briefed the bca guys on the theft ring then went out to talk to the employees you all may be in some sort of trouble so maybe you want to get a lawyer or public defender out here but none of you will be charged with anything right away the guys in the office will want to talk to you individually i would like somebody to tell me one thing which wont have any effect on you at all okay the men glanced around at each other a couple shrugged and a stocky man in a grimy vikings sweatshirt said what do you want to know you know that one of the women from the church one of the nuns was found dead at gene calbs house shot in the head gene didnt do it one of the men interrupted thats not what i need lucas said were not sure what happened but we know that both of gene calbs cars are still in his garage what i want to know is did one of those toyotas come in last night or the night before one of the good ones the men all looked around at each other again there was more shrugging eyes drifted away and finally the spokesman said i dont know is there an old one around here at somebodys house or around back i havent looked around back not around here the spokesman said no more eye contact on the way out del said to lucas so the calbs are running in a wrecked toyota why is that why not take one of their cars because if they can get it as far as the airport at thief river or fargo and if we hadnt found out about it wed never know where they went ill get some calls out del said martha wests funeral service was held in a nondescript chapel at the funeral home so nondescript that it could hardly even be called nondenominational it looked like a gradeschool cafeteria without the charm and was cold as if the funeral home didnt want to waste energy on heating it seventeen people showed up including cops the coffin was sealed letty sat at the front and cried her cast propped on the chair in front of her her single crutch between her legs a lutheran minister called on marthas friends to talk about her and a few did without much to say couldnt say that she drank a lot and spent most of her time at the duck inn most talked about her songs and how hard she worked on them and what a good voice she had for custer county anyway and let it go at that a womens group served ritz crackers with cheese and sliced celery and carrots with pimento spread in a side room for people who werent going to the cemetery that was almost everybody lucas and del drove out to the cemetery behind the hearse with letty crying in the back seat and ruth trying to comfort her when she wasnt crying herself the snow was blowing hard and the grave looked like a big fishing hole in an icecovered lake the coffin went in the ground and they all left with letty peering back for as long as she could see the cemetery and when she couldnt see it anymore she rolled focedown on the back seat and sobbed the sheriff had made tentative arrangements for a foster home but in the end they didnt take her there they left her with ruth at the church with the older woman the arrangement they agreed was temporary until they figured something out dont tell me youre gonna try to find my dad letty said theres no way id live with that sonofabitch as they drove away from the church del said what a wonderful fuckin day if there was a fourstory building in town id jump off it theres the smokestack theres the grain elevators fuck you lucas got to think of something man i have thought of something del said he suddenly seemed comfortable lucas thought which was odd given the circumstances what ill tell you in a while i gotta make sure i can pull it off first what drop me off at the drugstore i got things to buy whatre you doing figured out how were going to end this thing tell me i will in about an hour del knocked on lucass motel door an hour later lucas had been watching tv news and he got up in his bare feet to answer the door del had his duffel bag slung over one shoulder and a package wrapped in brown paper under the opposite arm he handed the package to lucas see ya he said wherere you going lucas was mystified back to the cities got a plane out of fargo in two hours figure to get home by seventhirty cheryls gonna pick me up at the airport and im gonna take her out to lemieuxs for a little french food maybe a little wine tell her on the way home how cute she looks with her hair that way whichever way it is today what the fuck are you talking about gettin laid del said he ticked an index finger at lucas ive got a roundtrip ticket ill be back tomorrow by noon now in that package you will find five differentcolored fineline magic markers and a large spiral art pad so you get a couple beers down here lock yourself in and think draw your pictures on the pad all those arrows and squares and shit ill come back tomorrow and you can tell me who did it jesus del we dont need to be chasing people del said we need to figure out what the fuck happened i think theres enough information you just havent thought about it enough so see you tomorrow he reached forward took the doorknob and pulled the door shut lucas looked at the package hefted it looked at the closed door and thought this is ridiculous he opened the door just in time to see del slip inside the mustang which hed had waiting in the drive del looked over at him lifted a hand and drove away hey del kept going lucas went back inside with the package tossed it on the second bed went back to the television the woman newscaster had the most amazing lips they couldnt be real he thought they must keep a bee in the studio trained to sting them must hurt he fell asleep for a while got up with a bad taste in his mouth del didnt understand about the arrows and boxes he thought as he brushed his teeth his seances with the drawing table and the arrows and boxes only worked when his head was right when something down in the lizard part of his brain said that a solution was available he wasnt getting that message yet he stopped brushing for a moment and looked at himself in the mirror on the other hand there was something not something he missed just something about the killings that he hadnt digested yet maybe he could figure something out draw a box and a couple of arrows couldnt hurt first get a few beers he washed his face bundled up and walked down to the duck inn the bartender had been at the funeral that afternoon and they nodded at each other as lucas came in bad day at black rock the barkeep said what can i do you for sixpack of leinies if you got it yeah that poor kid is the one i think about lucas said bad goddamn thing to happen to a kid she just went by with one of them nuns the barkeep said he lifted the sixpack of leinenkugels onto the bar just now she went by lucas asked pushing a ten across the bar one minute ago heading over to larsons the way they were going shes limping pretty good shes gonna need some clothes i guess lucas took the change from the ten but pushed the sixpack back at the bartender hold on to this will you i want to see if i can catch them larsons right down the block he found them in the womens foundations area buying cotton underpants ruth lewis saw him coming and smiled sadly have you heard anything lucas shook his head not yet he looked at letty whod been looking at an underwear rack how are you were both pretty sad me and ruth trying to figure out whats going to happen letty said her eyes were red with circles below her lip trembled i never even got to see mom whatre you doing here lucas asked ruth ruth tipped her head at letty shes got nothing left nothing no shoes no underwear we went through our stores at the church didnt find much i love to shop lucas said ohhh ruth said a skeptical smile not the first time hed gotten that reaction from a woman but it was true im serious i really like to shop especially for clothes you wanta party letty looked at ruth and ruth said we dont really need that much ill let you in on a small secret which i wouldnt want you to spread around lucas said okay they both nodded and lucas said lowering his voice im the richest cop in minnesota i knew that ruth said sister mary joseph said you have a ridiculous amount of money so i can spend a few bucks on a good time lucas said lets go they bought all kinds of stuff with letty getting seriously involved jockey underpants a couple of brassieres that lucas wasnt entirely sure were necessary but which he wouldnt have remotely thought of questioning three pairs of jeans and two pairs of slacks and four sweatshirts which lucas thought was too many but letty said theyre all i wear they bought four more shirts at lucass insistence a vest a watch some costume jewelry and a pair of pearl earrings a parka mittens two hats and a duffel bag that would carry everything that she didnt wear and though ruth was skeptical they spent half an hour and thirtyfive dollars at the cosmetics counter out on the street letty said happily that was the best time i ever had further down the street across from an ace hardware they put the packages in ruths corolla and letty told lucas i will pay you back every penny i wont take the money lucas said not a cent you gotta learn to take gifts its charity its not charity lucas said itd be charity if i didnt know you and didnt like you these are gifts because i like you would you loan me some money right now if i pay back every cent he hesitated then said probably what do you want it for she nodded at the ace hardware i want to go in there and get a new gun they took that piece of crap and the deputy said i wouldnt get it back its evidence if they ever catch the guy i shot oh letty ruth said lucas letty asked lucas looked at ruth and then said id do it unless ruth absolutely vetoes it the gun would be in her house at least for a while letty turned to ruth who said i really dont think you need a gun letty but you dont really know me very well do you letty said lucas estimated her working age at a quick fortythree i do sort of need the gun ruth said to lucas if you want to loan her the money i wont say no once inside the hardware store ruth wcnt to look at other stuff went to be away from them while lucas and letty got into the details of the gun purchase letty wanted a ruger semiauto lucas suggested a boltaction ruger letty said it cost too much and shed be more comfortable with the lighter semiauto then the store manager a thin man with spiky gray hair and a hunter himself who knew letty jumped in and said they had an even lighter semiauto a browning that split the price difference lucas finally told letty that he wouldnt buy a semiauto because he worried that an autoloader was not safe enough i want you to know when youve got a round in the chamber because you put it there yourself then letty got pouty ive been doing this for years yeah with a singleshot and i know when theres a round in the chamber lucas stood firm and the manager said you know ive got a remington pump in the back its used but its in perfect shape i could let you have it for three hundred bucks lucas and letty looked at each other and letty said bring it out they took the pump but letty got it for two seventyfive with five boxes of longrifle shells thrown in as a dealsweetener she said to lucas ive had enough of that short bullshit next time this jerk comes around he better be wearing a bulletproof vest lucas enjoyed poetry couldnt help himself he was especially fond of haiku the japanese form and in reading haiku from time to time hed encountered talk of zen buddhism and the concept of the koan a koan was a kind of a riddle or paradox without a solution they were used by the zen master to demonstrate the ultimate futility of logic and to provoke with some pupils anyway instant enlightenment lucas heard letty say bulletproof vest and took a step toward enlightenment though later he thought the enlightenment might have been provoked by the way shed orally italicized the better bedel arrived back the next day at one oclock knocked on the door lucas was lying on the bed with the door unlocked and called come in del pushed the door open stuck his head in and said am i too early or have you figured it out i dont have a name yet lucas said he held up the art pad and the top page was covered with red and green squares and arrows ive got some thoughts del tossed his duffel in the corner sat on the second bed give lucas said one we figure out in the evening that the killer was probably sorrell then we drive home and about twelve hours after we leave armstrong we arrive at the sorrell house hes dead and hes been dead for at least a little while that means that the killer had to hear that wed figured out sorrell had to make a plan and had to drive seven hours at least rochester is more than an hour south of the cities and then he has to find sorrells house where the phone number is unlisted do the killing and get away thats pretty amazing when you think about it two thirty hours after he hanged two people in armstrong sorrell lets his own killer into his house with his wife standing right there with him hes unarmed and is shot down in cold blood he takes no precautions he never thinks that the guy at the door might be connected to the murders three why did the guy attack letty we dont know but we do know that lettys mother let him in the house after midnight when both she and letty knew there was a killer running around loose four letty claims she shot the guy but none of the hospitals inside two hundred miles report a guy shot in the chest with a that might possibly be our guy why is that five i talk to burke annies dad and he shows us stuff that looks like it came from the fbi it looks real howd they know how to do that six i talk to letty last night after you head back to the cities hey did you get laid yeah del nodded it was wonderful i have fantasies about cheryl maybe you could tell me never mind cmon wiseass all right anyway i talk to letty and one thing leads to another and we buy her a replacement rifle down at ace hardware and she says io me that if this asshole comes back quote he better be wearing a bulletproof vest unquote lucas looked at del and raised his eyebrows del asked thats it thats it del shook his head maybe i can get a refund on some of them pens looks like you only used red and green think about it for a minute lucas said what are the chances that the guy is a cop del thought about it for a minute if the guy is a cop he would have heard about sorrell really early if he was wearing a uniform people would let him in their house any time of day hed see fbi stuff so hed know the format and if he was wearing a bulletproof vest it would explain all of that shit we know that there are at least two cops who were friendly with gene calb ray zahn and this other guy the boyfriend of katina lewis zahn sometimes hung out there and the boyfriend painted his cars up there how many points did you have six six lucas agreed del nodded then heres number seven if you were running a major cartheft ring thered be nothing more valuable than having a cop inside the only major police agency for miles around in fact youd just about have to have one then lucas said i got another list yeah lucas said one youre a friendly looking guy like gene calb maybe with a spy inside the department or maybe not its a small town and word gets around he bluffs his way into sorrells house kills him and gets back here two he goes after letty we dont know the specific reason but we do know that letty hung around his shop and maybe hes afraid that she saw or heard something and calb is a friendly guy everybody likes him and if he knocks on the door maybe martha west lets him in letty told me one time that marthad had a crush on calb three calb kills katina lewis why we dont know but suppose that letty really did shoot him and hit him in the chest like she said he was hurt but not badly maybe his wife patched him up or something but suppose he bled through his shirt or did something that tipped katina that his chest was hurting heck maybe she patted him on the chest anyway the instant that she suspected hed have to get rid of her because all shed have to do is tell any cop and wed go straight to calb and take his shirt off we find a bullet hole or even a bruise hed be toast so hed have to kill her maybe that was done so spontaneously that he panicked and ran del lay back on the bed and after a minute said i like the first one better the cop why because it all goes back to kidnapping the girls and everybody says that calb wouldnt do that he might have been a criminal but he wasnt a nut because if this car ring worked like we think it did he was up to his ass in money whyd he need to kidnap somebody and most of all he really seemed to think that deon cash and jane warr were stupid assholes would he get involved in a kidnapping with partners he thought were stupid assholes i dont think so lucas thought about that for a while then lets go talk to letty and ruth lewis theyre up at the church i think we ought to stay away from the sheriffs office until weve got something solid i dont think ray zahn del said hes one of our guys yeah well i dont think so either but we gotta keep him on the list and we gotta think about the possibility that its nobody we know yet maybe a cop but nobody we know yet think well have him by midnight del said joking i dont know if i were gonna bet id say a week or less the older woman came to the door of the church and said if youre looking for letty and ruth they went up to the dump to shoot that gun you bought her tight lips suggested that she didnt approve another fan del said as they got back in the car dump ruth lewiss toyota corolla was parked at the dump gate and they could hear the little banging away you dont think theyd shoot back this way do you del asked jesus i hope not he hadnt thought of that where are they sounds like theyre over to the left they walked carefully toward the sound of the shooting a longrifle slug makes a distinctive whip sound as it goes by and they didnt hear anything like that eventually they crossed the high point of the dump and spotted letty and ruth at the far left edge of jthe raw dirt shooting into a mound of clay ruth had the gun may have been a conversion here lucas said lewis wasnt that happy about buying the gun oughta get her an nra membership del said my cold dead hands from what ive seen of her shed probably take the damn thing over lucas said letty and ruth saw them coming and stopped firing lettys crutch was lying on the ground so her ankle must be feeling better when they got close lucas saw that they were shooting at campbells soup cans which made good reactive targets he called how you doing as they came up letty said the guns not as bad as i thought she hit the can every time right from the start even with the cast now shes trying to hit the gold medal thing every time ruth said i havent hit the can once i cant even see the gold medal thing from here del said the cans were twentyfive yards away its sure a lot quicker than that old piece of shit letty said even onehanded letty ruth said i know watch my mouth she took the gun from ruth with her good hand braced it over the cast on the other and sighted down the barrel at one of the cans she pulled the trigger and the can hopped across the ground she turned the gun upside down with her good hand got the pump under the upper part of her bad arm trapped it pumped aimed and fired again hit the can she looked nonchalantly at lucas so whats going on we stopped at the church they said you were out here he looked around whatever happened to those traps you put out before the fire are they still out here letty shook her head naw i had weather call bud from down at the hospital he came and picked them up the next morning we already checked and theyre all gone i gotta get them from him lucas nodded okay listen we need to talk to both of you about mmm whoever might have done all this we were wondering specifically do you know anything about any police officers who might have been connected with gene calb or with deon cash and jane warr letty looked at ruth and then ruth asked do you think this person might be a police officer there are some things lucas said to letty who would your mom let in the door after midnight we know it wasnt her boyfriend because he was still down at the duck inn who else letty thought a guy there might be a couple of guys but i dont know it never happened how about a cop that she knew youd always let a cop in letty said especially since all the trouble ray zahn or how about that boyfriend of katinas lucas looked at ruth loren singleton she said slowly she pinched her bottom lip thinking then to lucas i oh god look were interested in one thing finding the killer del said to her we dont care about all this other happy horse shit the cars and the drugs and all that if you know something about a cop loren kept an eye out for us at the sheriffs office ruth said letty said really was that because of his relationship with your sister lucas asked no they met at calbs loren was being paid by gene before katina got here i dont think hed she stopped they waited and then she said i was going to say that i dont think that loren would hurt katina but when i think about it now im not sure but i can tell you one thing ive talked to loren since the fire at lettys and he certainly wasnt shot lucas said huh then i talked to him too and i didnt see any holes in him he seemed pretty freaked out by what happened to your sister he was i talked to him that night he was really shaky do you see him as a kidnapper del asked i dont you know im not sure hes creative enough if thats the word if hes ambitious enough i didnt know deon very well but deon was this ocean of want he wanted money and he wanted dope and he wanted cars and he wanted clothes and he wanted to go to vegas and la and he wanted season tickets for basketball i dont think i mean loren didnt seem to want anything he didnt seem to care about anything or even do anything other than sleep with katina he had his caddys letty chipped in he was always driving one old caddy while he worked on another one i heard he made some good money selling them a caddy lucas said he looked at del whered we see that caddy you said something about it right here del said jabbing a thumb back at the gate when letty brought her traps up here day of the fire lucas said he looked around at all the raw black dirt of the dump if you were gonna bury somebody in the wintertime with snow around and you didnt want a hole that looked like a grave del asked letty you ever see him out here singleton no not that i remember but you used to come out here all the time couple times a week you said yeah lucas to del jesus what if he was afraid that letty saw him then he sees us out here with her lets go take his shirt off del said lucas shook his head not yet if he was wearing a vest and thats what stopped the slug then wed tip him off and we wouldnt have anything ill tell you what why dont we get the california crew up here they arent finding anything around cashs house they could come up pick a good spot and start sweeping it wed know in a few hours ruth said loren did it lucas shook his head its a possibility maybe one chance in three were really at the end of a long string here but nobody can figure out why letty and her mom were attacked and why he came after letty especially it had to be something that she either knows or that he was afraid she knew and he saw us here together that afternoon and then he hauled ass without a word turned around and took off ruth looked at letty in wonder and letty said loren singleton lettys house six miles south had been on the far fringe of the cellphone net the dump was out of it gonna have to go get the fbi guys lucas said i can run back with the truck if you guys want to scrape around here del suggested thatd be good lucas tossed him the keys the insurance certificate is in the door pocket dont use it what am i gonna hit out here del took off and lucas letry and ruth began walking around the dirt surface of the dump letty using her crutch on about every fifth step she could feel the sprain she said but theyd packed her leg in ice at the hospital and had kept the ice on it for most of the next day and that had helped ill be running in a week she said it probably wouldnt hurt to stay off it though lucas said much as you can anyway drives me crazy yeah well i know always drove me crazy too they chatted about old injuries for a while as they wandered around the dump was large probably covering half a square mile but most of the surface was covered with snow lucas had been to dumps before and knew generally how they worked the garbage and trash was dumped in the working area and was covered with a layer of dirt then another layer of trash went down followed by another layer of dirt when a predetermined level was reached the whole thing was capped with an impervious layer of clay that would tend to sheet water off to the sides the dump would also have a clay bottom beneath all the layers of trash to prevent contamination of the local groundwater it was in a way like a clayandgarbage pie with the clay acting as the crust and the garbage the filling if singleton was the killer and if hed buried his victims at the dump he would have chosen an area already disturbed by the bulldozer they decided over the rest of the area the surface was frozen solid and any graveshaped hole would have shown through to the bulldozer driver do people come out here i mean other than the dump guy and you lucas asked letty oh sure especially during hunting season people want to get rid of deer hides and heads and so on theyll put them in a garbage bag and bring them out and throw them in the pile or maybe theyve got something too big to put out for the trash theyll haul it over in their truck and throw it in theyre not supposed to but they do so it wouldnt be completely unusual to see somebody out here no when im trapping out here i probably see somebody half the time she carried the rifle across the cast on her left arm the muzzle pointing up at the sky lucas had been watching her handle the gun and decided that she was safe enough this all looks pretty raw ruth called they walked over to her she was standing on a patch of dirt thirty feet wide and fifty long rumpled beneath the snow softerfeeling a bulldozer runway that led to the feeding edge of the landfill lucas kicked some of the snow off then stooped and picked up some dirt looked at it tossed it aside and brushed his hands we oughta get the dump guy out here he said maybe he saw something strange after exploring the area of raw dirt they drifted back toward the shooting range and lucas borrowed lettys rifle and bounced one of the cans around then letty asked about his pistol and lucas took out the and showed her how it worked same kind of sight picture as with the rifle he said he stepped away from her aimed at one of the cans which was now about forty feet away and fired once missing right by three inches he frowned fired again and again missed right by only a halfinch this time but also a little high a third shot sent the can skittering away let me try letty said its gonna feel heavy with only one hand on it lucas said he gave her the pistol showed her how the safeties worked she held the pistol out straight from her side her head turned so that she was looking over her right shoulder after a moment she said squeeze and fired a round she missed the can by three feet to the right a foot low holy cow she said whatd i do try once more lucas said he heard truck noises back at the gate letty pointed the pistol but the barrel was shaking and after a few seconds she took it down im not strong enough onehanded she said lucas took the gun from her spent a couple of seconds pulling down on the can let out a halfbreath and smashed the can a second time you got a string tied to the can right del called from the direction of the gate lucas turned around and saw del with four of the california fbi crewmen walking across the dump toward them lucas popped the magazine from the jacked the shell out of the chamber thvftnbed it back in the magazine then took a fresh magazine out of his holster and seated it in the pistol butt the halfused magazine went into the holster good time to quit one of the californians said talking through the snorkel of his snorkel parka if youd kept it up i would have been tempted to take out my piece and kick your sorry ass no offense ladies i dont want to seem insulting or vulgar but none of you fuckin fbi humptydump ties can shoot half as well as del over there and i personally can shoot several times better than del lucas said au contraire del said you can hold your end up on the nice heated lighted range but out here in the real world you cant hold a candle to me though youre right about the fuckin fbi humptydump ties ruth looked at letty and said oh god this is why you should never get married honey these people got a rivulet of testosterone running through them and anything can set it off a cheese sandwich can set it off the lead californian was digging under his parka and produced a smith you are a bunch of rural people who have never seen good shooting so you dont have to apologize for what you just said one of the other californians jerked the back of his coat and he turned and they conferred snorkel to snorkel then the lead californian turned back to lucas and said uh are we doing this for free or is there some money in it they spent twenty minutes banging away at cans without conclusion but they all felt better afterward lucas then showed the crew the area that needed to be surveyed and the lead man suggested that they neednt survey all of it we can do stripes we dont even have to set up guidelines because on that thin snow we can see where weve been we can do it in a couple of hours quick and dirty done before dark anyway the crew had a radar set mounted on a wagon which the californians rolled back and forth over the raw patch the radar was pointed down into the dirt and returned echoes from lumps of differing density the data was fed into a memory module which was dumped into a laptop back in one of the fbi trucks the laptop then produced a density map of the surface covered striping the dirt patch took an hour and a half halfway through ruth and letty bored and a little cold decided to head back to the church and eat stop by when youre going back to armstrong letty said i want to know how it comes out when the striping was done the lead californian dumped the data to the laptop let it churn for a few minutes then tapped a few keys and a map began scrolling up twothirds of the way from the back edge of the dirt strip toward the working edge of the landfill he said whoops got something got a hole we got it on the third and fourth runs it looks like its uh four feet long and three feet wide anything else mostly what look like tread tracks from the bulldozer both current ones and some buried ones but the hole cuts through all of that it looks like therere a few inches of packed stuff then it goes soft he tapped the computer screen you can see the edges of it better get some shovels out here lucas said why dont you guys pin down the edges of the hole and del and ill get the shovels get some sandwiches one of the californians said theres a place in town called logans fancy meats lucas said give me your orders might as well do it right ill get some lights too they went through broderick without slowing down and as soon as they were within cellphone range lucas called ray zahn i need to get the guy who runs the dump bulldozer know where we can find him yeah hes about three blocks from me if hes home zahn said what do you want him for we need him to show us around the dump lucas said its serious ill drag his ass up there zahn said when do you want him at the ace hardware lucas bought four longhandled shovels and four spotlights with cigarettelighter adapters havent sold that many spotlights since deer season the counterman said pick out a deer at two hundred yards lucas thought about that for a moment then went to the back of the store and found four twobyfourfoot pressedboard handy panels with one white side and a roll of duct tape reflectors he said to del outside it was getting dark back at the dump the californians had outlined the hole and using a longbladed screwdriver had determined that there were about six to eight inches of compressed dirt over a looser fill lucas used a tireiron to pop the lock off the dump gate and they drove lucass truck and the two fbi vehicles into a circle around the dig site lucas brought the spotlights out the californians set up the white panels and when the lights were plugged in lucas focused them on the panels and the digsite was bathed in a smooth reflected light cool one of the californians said they started digging three at a time four shovelers was one too many and cleared out the dozercompacted cap in ten minutes looks like a grave del said from the sidelines another set of headlights swept over the dump and a minute later ray zahn had pulled in beside lucass acura zahn and another man got out and zahn said to lucas this is phil bussard he runs the dozer you remember seeing anything that looked like a hole or a dug spot right here this morning nothing like that bussard said did see a bunch of truck tracks somebody unloaded something back here didnt think nothing of it how did they get through the gate lucas asked is it always locked when youre not here yeah but about half the people in town know the combination bussard said all kinds of people are authorized to get in here and the number gets around its tentwentythirty so why lock it at all for the lawyers if somebody works the lock and gets in here and gets hurt i guess its breaking and entering or something they committed a crime and if they get hurt doing it it aint the countys fault where were you working a month ago around christmas right over on the other side there bussard said pointing if you look at the edge you can see some christmas wrap thats where itd be see any holes over there not that i remember see truck tracks all the time zahn came back from the widening hole sure does look like a grave he said the people in the hole were slowing down so the last californian bussard and lucas took the shovels and continued down at three feet the californian said somebody hand me that screwdriver he took the screwdriver squatted and pushed it into the dirt at the bottom of the hole probed for a minute then stood up id say were eight inches off the garbage level thatd be about right bussard said bobbing his head eight inches down lucas cut through a white garbage sack and could smell the garbage inside smells like old pizza he said like from a dumpster out behind a pizza joint on a hot summer night lucky you didnt get one of them diaper bags bussard said they smell like old shit on a hot summer night the californian said i got something here he was probing at a dark green garbage bag they cleared away a little more dirt then bussard took a leatherman tool off his belt flicked open a blade and slashed through the green bag a womans bare leg flexed her toenails were painted red there you go zahn said there you godel said loren singleton here we come im coming with you zahn said i want to see what that sonofabitch has to say for himself all of it was innocent back at the church in brodcrick letty told the older woman about the scene at the dump and the shootout between lucas del and the fbi then letty took a pill for her hand got a book and found an empty bed she could lie on to read ruth went to work on the phone calling members of her network in canada the older woman went down the highway to wolfs cafe got a piece of pie and a cup of coffee and told sandra wolf that the fbi and the state were up at the dump and about the shooting contest a bit later a sheriffs deputy came into the cafe and wolf told him about the shooting contest and that the fbi was searching the dump the deputy was a little put off about it because hed been working well watching the fbi guys at deon cashs house and theyd all taken off without telling him anything he was also fairly sure that the sheriff had been cut out of the deal so he called mrs holrne the sheriffs secretary and asked her to pass on the word to the sheriff the sheriff was out but she passed it on to several other people the word took almost an hour to get to loren singleton who was getting a sprite out of the fire station coke machine when he heard about it up there digging holes said the guy whod heard it from a guy whod heard it from holme better them than me that place smells bad even when its all covered up and froze margery singleton had just gotten home carrying a brown grocery bag with a box of beef brains from logans fancy meats flour and milk from the kwik stop and a sack of potatoes when her son burst in on her the jigs up he groaned at her jesus christ the jig is up the fbi and the state guys are up at the dump digging holes and theyve got all that special equipment up there theyre gonna find them those california guys say they can find a hundredyearold grave and the calbs havent been in the ground long enough to get cold margerys eyes narrowed you think its because of that kid who else when i took the girls up there werent any cars around and i took them off to the back corner and it was almost dark so who else is up there that might have seen me theres nothing out there except those goddamn raccoons that the kid goes after whod you hear this from this isnt just bullshit is it naw i got it from roland askew heres something else they cut the sheriff out of the loop even though they were all buddybuddy up at calbs house whyd they do that because im a deputy and they know its me that put them in the ground god mom im really scared he jammed a knuckle into his mouth and bit it margery looked at the box of beef brains on the kitchen table brains sliced like bread and fried up in beer batter were a rare treat as long as you got the brains when they were fresh frozen brains got mushy when you thawed them she thought about the possibilities for a minute then said if the girl is dead she cant testify youve got to get up there and finish it mom if they think its me i got a hole in my chest and a bruise all they have to do is get me to take my shirt off so you go up and take care of the girl by the time you get back here ill have it figured out youre gonna have an accident an accident a car wreck bruise you all up i gotta think about it hurt you bad enough someplace else like fargo that they put you in the hospital you drive my car we fake the wreck you fake the injury hit something hard enough to pop the airbags by the time they find us the holes healed up we can figure something out i can pretty much see what were gonna do but it aint gonna work if that little kid talks aw jeez theyre gonna get us you better hope not you know what they do to guys like you down at stillwater you wont have any trouble taking a shit i tell you that youll be nice and loose thats if the feds dont get you the fedsll put you in the chair if they get you oh god he stuck his knuckle in his mouth again closed his eyes bit on it the pain helped clear his mind out he opened his eyes and said im going its almost dark now i still got the garagedoor opener for calbs i can put the car in there walk acrbss to the church i heard that the other women left after katina died therell only be ruth lewis and the kid talking himself into it margery nodded and said you might not have much time best get moving ill figure things out here the sheriff heard about the dump dig at the same time that loren singleton heard anderson got it from an assistant county attorney at borgnas drugs the sheriff was mulling over the selection of chap stick products when the prosecutor came by carrying a box of nyquil and said we gotta stop meeting like this anderson said especially with you carrying drugs thats the darn truth i dont know why those crazy fools mess around with meth labs when they can come down to borgnas and buy nyquil so whatd they find at the dump the dump anderson was puzzled yeah its all over town the feds and those state guys are up at the dump digging the place up ray zahns up there they rousted out old phil bussard must have him up there with the dozer must be looking for those girls aw jimmy anderson said he walked out of the drugstore and climbed into his truck did an illegal uturn and headed out of town he got madder and madder thinking about it as he went north he was smearing cherry chap stick on his lips when he realized that hed just shoplifted it under the eyes of an assistant county attorney these people he said aloud meaning the bca but especially lucas davenport he was so arrogant so holierthanthou out here in the sticks with his expensive patagonia parka and his fortythousanddollar truck that no selfrespecting american ought to be driving like to see him get that thing fixed when it blows up on highway he thought like to see him find parts for a goshdarned acura out here theyd have to tow that sucker back to the cities they had their hot jobs up at the capital hanging out with that faggot henderson and they didnt understand that he couldnt be cut out of this investigation not if he wanted to keep this job the best job hed ever had and would ever have these people he had a little fantasy of arranging a breakdown for davenports acura noticed that hed just gone through broderick at eightyfive miles an hour saw lights on at calbs and wondered if the feds might be in there too got even madder and pushed the truck to ninety at the turnoff to the dump he thought easy does it youre cool now he continued down the approach road there were no vehicles parked at the gate but from the high seat in the truck he could see over the rise of the dump to a brilliant cluster of lights off to his right people at work he took the truck that way bouncing over the ruts left by the bulldozer saw zahn walking back to his car then davenport and capslock walking toward the fancy acura the radio went on the command frequency sheriff you there he ignored it pulled up beside davenport and capslock and hopped out whats going on here he asked lucas take a look in the hole lucas said we think its mrs calb aw jeez how come i wasnt in on this lucas said i gotta apologize for that but we got some information that uh the guy were looking for might be with the sheriffs department anderson had started toward the hole but that turned him around my department yeah we think it might be loren singleton katinas boyfriend singleton i just i just aw shoot he walked over to look in the hole theyd exposed most of the bag and he could see a womans thigh and lower leg could be gloria calb about the right size we gotta another bag underneath it bussard said leaning on his shovel looking up at the sheriff he smelled like old campbells tomato soup looks like a mans shoe the boys here think its gotta be gene lucas stepped up next to anderson we were gonna come get you and then go get singleton since hes your guy we figured you might want to be there to make the official arrest aw shoot they all went back to their trucks anderson thinking that theyd never have called him not until they had singleton trussed up like a christmas turkey they were treating him like the village idiot and if he hadnt gotten up here in time everybody in custer county would have known about it anderson got in his truck and the radio bleated again sheriff are you there sheriff he picked up the handset and said yeah this is me what do you want we got a strange call from margery singleton thats loren singletons mother she said shes afraid hes done something awful and that he might hurt some more people i dont know she sounded a little overcooked but i thought id call you zahn was leading the parade out of the dump lucas behind him anderson in the third truck and as they pulled out of the approach road anderson began honking his horn and flashing his lights they all stopped and anderson ran up beside lucass truck loren singletons mom just called in she said she thinks lorens done something awful and hes headed up to broderick and thinks he might hurt some more people she said he mentioned that letty kid aw shit lucas said he shouted tell ray and accelerated away barely giving anderson time to jump back from the truck anderson watched as lucas swerved around zahn and out onto the approach road zahn had stopped with all the horn honking and had gotten out of his car when anderson had gotten out of his zahn yelled what lorens on his way to broderick hes after that letty kid zahn didnt say anything just got in his car and tore out after lucas anderson got back in his truck and followed onto the approach road then he picked up his handset called the dispatcher and said you gotta get the phone number of that church up in broderick tell them that theyre in danger that lorens coming after them tell them to lock their doors the call was he thought later the only good thing hed done all night but it was very good loren singleton had just gotten his truck in calbs garage when another truck went through town at high speed he heard it didnt see it but its urgency carried a message something had happened north of broderick and the only thing north of broderick for a long distance was the dump in his heart he knew theyd found something he sat slumped in his truck the radio muttering at him and then distantly playing an old wayne newton tune danke schoen he turned it up a bit and the song hit him emotionally and he began to weep thinking about katina but also about himself the chances of mom getting anything together were just about zero he thought he was toast he finally wiped his eyes with the heels of his hands pulled on his gloves got the out from under the car seat put on his cop hat took a deep breath and headed out to the church ruth lewis had finished her calls north letty was sleepy from the pain pills and had given up her book and was watching one of the nuns dvd movies thelma and louise her injured leg up on a pile of pillows the older woman was in her cubicle doing her afternoon prayers ruth restless thought about collecting letty and walking over to the diner or getting back in the car and checking at the dump to see if anything had been found thelma and louise was starting to show noise either that ruth thought or the dvd machine was breaking down she leaned against the doorway watching the movie over lettys head when the phone rang in the kitchen she hurried back picked it up the sheriffs dispatcher talking all in a rush loren singletons mom says hes coming up there with a gun he might hurt you and youre all supposed to get out of there quick the sheriffs on his way right now but loren may be ahead of him the doorbell rang ruth dropped the phone and ran toward the front of the church stopped in the doorway of the tv room and said quietly as she could but with urgency loren singletons on his way get up in the loft and hide the doorbell rang again and letty not asking questions limped past ruth and ruth went to the front of the church and peeked out the small window at the front loren singleton hands in his pockets shoulders hunched against the wind was standing on the concrete stoop she backed away silence was best she thought then the older woman interrupted at her prayers called ruth did you get the door the doorbell rang again and then the doorknob rattled and she heard singleton yell sheriffs deputy open up the older woman came out puzzled and asked whats going on ruth grabbed her by the arm saw letty disappearing into the loft at the back and dragged the older women toward the back of the church loren singleton the sheriff says he might be here to hurt letty what they were at a window and ruth looked out but there was nothing out there except a few snowwhipped buildings hundreds of feet apart and the plains if they ran out the back door and if singleton saw them thered be no place to go or to hide i dont she began and at that moment singleton kicked in the door he did it like a cop a quick heavy kick at the doorknob and the door buckled without quite breaking clean then he kicked it again and ruth said to the older woman hide anywhere she turned toward the door to confront singleton singleton loomed in the doorway and ruth shouted at him the sheriffs coming they just called and they know singleton had a gun in his hand but the message got through to him and he stopped breathing hard maybe thinking and then letty from up in the loft yelled you killed my mom you sonofabitch ruths heart sank letty added i shot you once and ill shoot you again if you dont get out of here singleton saw her up in the loft and shouted you little he lifted his gun hand as though he might shoot at her and letty shot him and he fell down letty ruth yelled stop stop get up and ill shoot you again you sonofabitch letty yelled ruth walked carefully toward the front of the church where singleton was trying to roll over on his stomach ruth could see a gun lying on the floor off to the side he couldnt see her coming as he tried to push himself up and she stepped around him and kicked the guff off to the side and waved at letty who shouted get away from him ruth singleton got his feet underneath himself and he looked sideways at ruth and said little bitch shot me right in the stomach god that hurts we can get you to the hospital fuck that singleton said how did you know i was coming your mom called i guess she was afraid youd hurt somebody was it did you are you the one who hurt katina singleton was puzzled mom called the sheriff ruth said did you hurt katina from the back of the church letty shouted get away from him ruth get away from him ruth waved at her did you but mom singleton was puzzled what he looked at her his eyes rolling a little but mom i mean she did it all she had the idea she gave the shots to the girls she got the money she shot katina he managed to focus on ruth and tears started i wouldnt hurt katina i didnt i didnt there was a scuffling sliding gravel sound outside cars pulling into the graveled lot and singleton pushed himself to his feet and said you better get out of here he pushed his parka back and slipped a service revolver out of a holster and said better back away she backed away and he lurched into the doorway and letty yelled watch out watch out and shot him again in the back and he lurched forward and lifted the pistol and ruth heard men yelling outside and letty shot him in the back again and singleton pulled the trigger on his pistol once and then buckled under a volley of pistol shots taking two steps back and falling into the church then she heard somebody shout del del the acura could go a hundred and five but didnt like it didnt like the tar joints on the county highway and lucas felt like a pea being rattled in a tin can del was shouting go go and in the rearview mirror lucas could see zahn slowly closing on them within a minute or two zahn was fifty yards back and he hung there they were only two minutes out of town they were still more than a mile out when they saw somebody walking across the highway far ahead at that distance he was the apparent size of a flea seen from across a room but del said thats him thats gotta be him they were a little more than a mile out when they saw him kick in the door of the church and del pulled out his pistol and said put me right on the door lucas said going too fast i dont know where i can put us thats all gravel in there seconds later they were skidding across the gravel zahn fishtailing into the lot right behind them trying to keep from colliding lucas stopped a little beyond the church door and del was out and then lucas was out and he saw zahn drawing his pistol and aiming over the roof of the cruiser and then singleton was in the door and lucas leveled his gun at him and started shouting didnt know what he was shouting he was shouting a noise and he heard what sounded like gunfire and then singleton whod been moving in a slow jerking motion suddenly and spasmodically lifted one hand and there was a gun in it and he fired and del went down and lucas and zahn opened fire and singleton slumped back into the church lucas ran around the truck del del ruth lewis came to the door cautiously letty was right behind her with her gun lewis stopped to look at singleton but letty came through and saw del on the ground and said oh no is he hurt bad is he hurt lucas was kneeling beside him zahn standing over them both and del asked how bad your leg is fucked up lucas said doesnt seem to be pumping blood you want to wait for an ambulance or you wanna go for a ride zahn above them said i called for an ambulance itll be here in seven minutes ive seen a hell of a lot worse if you wait youll have a comfortable ride ill wait said del lets get some blankets under him ruth lewis said lorens dead we found the calbs out at the dump loren killed your sister and the calbs and lettys mother and the sorrells and probably the two children lucas told her guys done a lot of damage mmm she said distantly lucas thought she might be going into shock then ill get the blankets the grounds so cold she hurried back into the church letty squatted next to del i shot him three more times she said i heard you coming and he went to the door with his gun and i shot him three times but he kept going aw man lucas said this is awful guy committed suicide del said just wish just wish ruth lewis ran inside saw the kicked against the wall blankets she needed blankets for del she went to the closest bed stripped off the blankets then got some more from the next cubicle and she thought mom on the way back out she saw the cluster of people around del and she stepped sideways and picked up the little and put it in her pocket ruth came back with the blankets and they pushed them under dels butt and back and good leg and del asked everybody pain in his eyes i wont lose the leg will i zahn said with our hospital you never know and when del did a kind of eyeball doubletake he said quickly just kidding hang on there that fuckin loren del was stabilized in armstrong and then flown back to the cities where he was met by weather by rose marie and by the governor himself lucas stayed behind for a hard two days after singleton was shot they brought margery singleton in a birdlike woman shocked by what they were saying it cant be my boy it cant be my boy she said hes dead you say hes dead the sheriff eventually patted her on the back thanked her for the phone call and sent her on her way they debriefed ruth lewis who was accompanied by an influential minneapolis attorney who did the heavy lifting for the archdiocese of st paul and minneapolis the drug runs werent mentioned but she told them what she suspected about the car theft ring all of calbs employees were interviewed except for three whod departed for parts unknown all of those interviewed professed to have been mystified by the number of toyotas theyd been painting theyd all heard that it was a deal with some insurance company to fix slightjy flawed new toyotas letty was interviewed and sent down to the cities with the older woman from the church she was scheduled for more work on her hand the fbi crew found first tammy sorrells grave led there by the christmas wrap at the edge of the dump cut and then later the same day annie burkes lucas turned the details over to the crew from bemidji and on the third day left custer county an alberta clipper was coming through and he stayed close to the front all the way down driving through the feathery snow listening to the fm stations come and go he arrived home to find his wife putting her coat on going to subway i thought id be back before you got here weather said after kissing him hello i can go if you want lucas offered no ill go back in fifteen talk to del today yes went over talked to him looked at the films im no orthopod but i think what you heard is right weather said the breaks a bad one some of the bone got blown back into his calf twenty years ago before they got so good with bone grafts hed be stuck with a pretty bad limp now itll be a while before hes out jogging but i dont think hell limp cheryls pissed at me lucas said that happens the wife always gets a little pissed at the partner when somebody gets hit you feel bad about it some lucas said but i dont know what else i could have done we thought he was in there killing them the phone rang weather picked it up listened said yes just a second she covered the mouthpiece with her hand said its sheriff anderson from armstrong and im going to subway the kid was in bed the housekeeper was in her apartment lucas went up and took a quick shower and got back downstairs just as weather arrived with the sandwiches they sat at the kitchen table eating them and splitting a bag of potato chips i thought things would go easier with the new job weather said i think cheryl thought so too dels been in some scrapes but nothing bad since that deal with the pinking shears that was more grotesque than really bad lucas said i mean it wasnt like he couldnt work for months and months so whatd this anderson character have to say the sheriff about what about the autopsy for one thing you said they were going to do them today singleton had eight bullet holes in him two were mine two were zahns and four were lettys from two different guns she said she shot him and she had he had a hole in his chest but somehow he got the slug out jeez yeah the two little girls were killed with injections theyre not sure what the agent was but when i heard that it kind of weirded me out i dont know what to think about that he frowned contemplated his sandwich and added the calbs were killed with the same gun used on the sorrells but it wasnt singletons service revolver he probably ditched it somewhere his mother said he had another smaller gun which sounds right but the injections that kind of worried me doesnt sound like singleton but then the sheriff tore apart singletons place actually it was the guys from bemidji and a couple of deputies and they found a load of cash in the basement more of the kidnapping money a lot of its missing but they probably just spent it if the burke guy wants he could probably bring an action against the calb estate and the cash estate and get some of the money back from the sales of their houses and so on i dont know if itll come to much now the cash house anyway with calb out of business i think brodericks probably gonna sink back into the prairie huh weather took an unladylike bite out of her sandwich did you see letty today lucas asked yes weather said talking with her mouth full they took the cast off to have a look put another one back on they think that they might do some revisions next week shes going to be a hurting little kid for a while huh she was pretty unhappy when i talked to her last night lucas said he halfgrinned anderson took her new gun away from her for one thing i dont think shes gonna get it back shes gotta be traumatized weather said her mother might not have meant to do it but that little girl has been abused thats what it amounts to taking care of a drunk when youre twelve years old and shes done it for years she was the adult in the family and then shes shot and shoots back and her mothers killed its amazing that she hasnt gone catatonic yeah they chewed for a moment then lucas said anderson said that ruth lewis took off hes trying to find her but the older lady up there at the church said ruth crossed into canada something to do with her network said shed be back in a few days sheriff said he checked and the border people have a record of her crossing this morning so i suspect shes rearranging things theyll be bringing the dope across somewhere else hope she pulls it off weather said she seemed like she was trying to do the right thing i dont know lucas said im not smart enough to figure out all the whatifs then lucas sat tapping his fingers on the table for a minute inspecting an olive that had squirted out of his sandwich and finally weather said what he put the sandwich down and made his face sincere like when he wanted to do something that weather might not like you think uh letty might be able to move in with us for a while until things get figured out weather ripped open the nearly empty sack of potato chips and dumped the last four chips on the table she took two of them i wondered if you were going to ask i think we could though i would predict some trouble shes tough shes gonna do what she wants to do and she doesnt mind giving you a hard time which reminds of us who lucas asked weather was puzzled who jesus christ weather you just described yourself perfectly he took one of the remaining chips i did not she was amazed im the most flexible person i know aw man he gave up but you think we can do that i think we could i like her a lot weather said weve got plenty of room even if we have another child the two little ones could sleej together until letty went off to college another hmm im not pregnant dummy she said im just talking theory at this point lucas looked at the table you gonna eat that chip that same night margery singleton was surprised to find her back door open when she got home she always locked it or almost always though it being a small town she sometimes forgot she pushed inside trying to recapture the feeling of the morning hadnt she gotten the key stuck in the door that morning or was it yesterday she pushed the door closed flipped the light took a step into the kitchen and stopped a woman was sitting at the table and margery took a step back who the hell are you then she saw the pile of money on the table thats my money there ruth lewis picked up loren singletons you killed my sister mom and you killed those little girls with needle injections and god only knows who else something has to be done about that she was pointing the pistol at margerys chest the pistol which ruth had picked up at the church had been surprisingly simple to work shed done a little practice before shed sent another one of the sisters across the border with her drivers license ruth would cross herself later that night with that sisters id a simpleenough alibi shed learned to think like a criminal well you cant just shoot me margery said she was thinking ahead two squares like she had with loren loren had been dead and gone before hed left her house that night and shed known it but loren was screwed up in the head and if the cops had gotten a handle on him he wouldve spilled all the beans and when they found the little girls at the dump and found those needle pricks who would have thought they could do that after all this time you cant just shoot me margery was saying if she could get close enough to the table ruth said i dont see why not she flinched with the blast deafeningly loud in the small room but she showed that cold wintery smile when margery singleton went down john sandford is the pseudonym of pulitzer prizewinning journalist john camp he is the author of fifteen prey
