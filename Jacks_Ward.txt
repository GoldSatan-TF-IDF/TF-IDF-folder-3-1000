jacks ward chapter i jack harding gets a job look here boy can you hold my horse a few minutes asked a gentleman as he jumped from his carriage in one of the lower streets in new york the boy addressed was apparently about twelve with a bright face and laughing eyes but dressed in clothes of coarse material this was jack harding who is to be our hero yes sir said jack with alacrity hastening to the horses head ill hold him as long as you like all right im going in at no i wont be long thats what i call good luck said jack to himself no boy wants a job more than i do fathers out of work rents most due and aunt rachels worrying our lives out with predicting that well all be in the poorhouse inside of three months its enough to make a fellow feel blue listenin to her complainin and groanin all the time wonder whether she was always so mother says she was disappointed in love when she was young i guess thats the reason have you set up a carriage jack asked a boy acquaintance coming up and recognizing jack yes said jack but it aint for long i shall set down again pretty soon i thought your grandmother had left you a fortune and you had set up a team no such good news it belongs to a gentleman thats inside inside the carriage no in no how longs he going to stay i dont know if it was half an hour we might take a ride and be back in time jack shook his head that aint my style he said ill stay here till he comes out well i must be going along are you coming to school tomorrow yes if i cant get anything to do are you trying for that id like to get a place fathers out of work and anything i can earn comes in handy my fathers got plenty of money said frank nelson complacently there isnt any need of my working then your fathers lucky and so am i i dont know about that id just as lieve work as not well i wouldnt id rather be my own master and have my time to myself but i must be going home youre lazy frank very likely ive a right to be frank nelson went off and jack was left alone half an hour passed and still the gentleman who had entered no didnt appear the horse showed signs of impatience shook his head and eyed jack in an unfriendly manner he thinks it time to be going thought jack so do i i wonder what the mans up to perhaps hes spending the day fifteen minutes more passed but then relief came the owner of the carriage came out did you get tired of waiting for me he asked no said jack shrewdly i knew the longer the job the bigger the pay i suppose that is a hint said the gentleman not offended perhaps so said jack and he smiled too tell me now what are you going to do with the money i give you buy candy no answered jack i shall carry it home to my mother thats well does your mother need the money yes sir fathers out of work and weve got to live all the same whats your fathers business hes a cooper so hes out of work yes sir and has been for six weeks its on account of the panic i suppose very likely he has plenty of company just now it may be remarked that our story opens in the year memorable for its panic and the business depression which followed nearly every branch of industry suffered and thousands of men were thrown out of work and utterly unable to find employment of any kind among them was timothy harding the father of our hero he was a sober steady man and industrious but his wages had never been large and he had been unable to save up a reserve fund on which to draw in time of need he had an excellent wife and but one child our present hero but there was another and by no means unimportant member of the family this was rachel harding a spinster of melancholy temperament who belonged to that unhappy class who are always prophesying evil and expecting the worst she had been disappointed in early life and this had something to do with her gloomy views but probably she was somewhat inclined by nature to despondency the family lived in a humble tenement which however was neatly kept and would have been a cheerful home but for the gloomy presence of aunt rachel who since her brother had been thrown out of employment was gloomier than ever but all this while we have left jack and the stranger standing in the street you seem to be a good boy said the latter and under the circumstances i will pay you more than i intended he drew from his vest pocket a dollar bill and handed it to jack what is all this for me asked jack joyfully yes on the condition that you carry it home and give it to your mother that i will sir shell be glad enough to get it well goodby my boy i hope your fatherll find work soon hes a trump ejaculated jack wasnt it lucky i was here just as he wanted a boy to hold his horse i wonder what aunt rachel will have to say to that very likely shell say the bill is bad jack made the best of his way home it was already late in the afternoon and he knew he would be expected it was with a lighter heart than usual that he bent his steps homeward for he knew that the dollar would be heartily welcome we will precede him and give a brief description of his home there were only five rooms and these were furnished in the plainest manner in the sitting room were his mother and aunt mrs harding was a motherlylooking woman with a pleasant face the prevailing expression of which was a serene cheerfulness though of late it had been harder than usual to preserve this in the straits to which the family had been reduced she was setting the table for tea aunt rachel sat in a rockingchair at the window she was engaged in knitting her face was long and thin and as jack expressed it she looked as if she hadnt a friend in the world her voice harmonized with her mournful expression and was equally doleful i wonder why jack dont come home said mrs harding looking at the clock hes generally here at this time perhaps somethins happened suggested her sisterinlaw what do you mean rachel i was reading in the sun this morning about a boy being run over out west somewhere you dont think jack has been run over who knows said rachel gloomily you know how careless boys are and jacks very careless i dont see how you can look for such things rachel accidents are always happening you know that yourself martha i dont say jacks run over perhaps hes been down to the wharves and tumbled over into the water and got drowned i wish you wouldnt say such things rachel they make me feel uncomfortable we may as well be prepared for the worst said rachel severely not this time rachel said mrs harding brightly for thats jacks step outside he isnt drowned or run over thank god i hear him said rachel dismally anybody might know by the noise who it is he always comes stamping along as if he was paid for makin a noise anybody ought to have a castiron head that lives anywhere within his hearing here jack entered rather boisterously it must be admitted in his eagerness slamming the door behind him chapter ii the events of an evening i am glad youve come jack said his mother rachel was just predicting that you were run over or drowned i hope youre not very much disappointed to see me safe and well aunt rachel said jack merrily i dont think ive been drowned theres things worse than drowning replied rachel severely such as what a man thats born to be hanged is safe from drowning thank you for the compliment aunt rachel if you mean me but mother i didnt tell you of my good luck see this and he displayed the dollar bill how did you get it asked his mother holding horses here take it mother i warrant youll find a use for it it comes in good time said mrs harding were out of flour and i had no money to buy any before you take off your boots jack i wish youd run over to the grocery store and buy half a dozen pounds you may get a pound of sugar and quarter of a pound of tea also you see the lord hasnt forgotten us she remarked as jack started on his errand whats a dollar said rachel gloomily will it carry us through the winter it will carry us through tonight and perhaps timothy will have work tomorrow hark thats his step at this moment the outer door opened and timothy harding entered not with the quick elastic step of one who brings good tidings but slowly and deliberately with a quiet gravity of demeanor in which his wife could read only too well that he had failed in his efforts to procure work reading all this in his manner she had the delicacy to forbear intruding upon him questions to which she saw it would only give him pain to reply not so aunt rachel i neednt ask she began whether youve got work timothy i knew beforehand you wouldnt there aint no use in tryin the times is awful dull and mark my words theyll be wuss before theyre better we maynt live to see em i dont expect we shall folks cant live without money and if we cant get that we shall have to starve not so bad as that rachel said the cooper trying to look cheerful i dont talk about starving till the time comes anyhow glancing at the table on which was spread a good plain meal we neednt talk about starving till tomorrow with that before us wheres jack gone after some flour replied his wife on credit asked the cooper no hes got money enough to pay for a few pounds said mrs harding smiling with an air of mystery where did it come from asked timothy who was puzzled as his wife anticipated i didnt know you had any money in the house no more we had but he earned it himself holding horses this afternoon come thats good said the cooper cheerfully we aint so bad off as we might be you see rachel very likely the bills bad she said with the air of one who rather hoped it was now rachel whats the use of anticipating evil said mrs harding you see youre wrong for heres jack with the flour the family sat down to supper you havent told us said mrs harding seeing her husbands cheerfulness in a measure restored what mr blodgett said about the chances for employment not much that was encouraging answered timothy he isnt at all sure when it will be safe to commence work perhaps not before spring didnt i tell you so commented rachel with sepulchral sadness even mrs harding couldnt help looking sober i suppose timothy you havent formed any plans she said no i havent had time i must try to get something else to do what for instance anything by which i can earn a little i dont care if its only sawing wood we shall have to get along as economically as we can cut our coat according to our cloth oh youll be able to earn something and we can live very plain said mrs harding affecting a cheerfulness she didnt feel pity you hadnt done it sooner was the comforting suggestion of rachel mustnt cry over spilt milk said the cooper goodhumoredly perhaps we might have lived a leetle more economically but i dont think weve been extravagant besides i can earn something father said jack hopefully you know i did this afternoon so you can said his mother brightly there aint horses to hold every day said rachel apparently fearing that the family might become too cheerful when like herself it was their duty to be profoundly gloomy youre always tryin to discourage people aunt rachel said jack discontentedly rachel took instant umbrage at these words im sure said she mournfully i dont want to make you unhappy if you can find anything to be cheerful about when youre on the verge of starvation i hope youll enjoy yourselves and not mind me im a poor dependent creetur and i feel im a burden now rachel thats all foolishness said timothy you dont feel anything of the kind perhaps others can tell how i feel better than i can myself answered his sister with the air of a martyr if it hadnt been for me i know youd have been able to lay up money and have something to carry you through the winter its hard to be a burden on your relations and bring a brothers family to this poverty dont talk of being a burden rachel said mrs harding youve been a great help to me in many ways that pair of stockings now youre knitting for jack thats a help for i couldnt have got time for them myself i dont expect said aunt rachel in the same sunny manner that i shall be able to do it long from the pains i have in my hands sometimes i expect im goin to lose the use of em soon and be as useless as old mrs sprague who for the last ten years of her life had to sit with her hands folded on her lap but i wouldnt stay to be a burden id go to the poorhouse first but perhaps with the look of a martyr they wouldnt want me there because id be discouragin em too much poor jack who had so unwittingly raised this storm winced under the last words which he knew were directed at him then why asked he half in extenuation why dont you try to look pleasant and cheerful why wont you be jolly as tom pipers aunt is i dare say i aint pleasant said rachel as my own nephew twits me with it there is some folks that can be cheerful when their house is aburnin down before their eyes and ive heard of one young man that laughed at his aunts funeral directing a severe glance at jack but im not one of that kind i think with the scriptures that theres a time to weep doesnt it say theres a time to laugh too asked mrs harding when i see anything to laugh about im ready to laugh said aunt rachel but human nater aint to be forced i cant see anything to laugh at now and perhaps you wont by and by it was evidently quite useless to persuade rachel to cheerfulness and the subject dropped the tea things were cleared away by mrs harding who then sat down to her sewing aunt rachel continued to knit in grim silence while jack seated himself on a threelegged stool near his aunt and began to whittle out a boat after a model lent him by tom piper a young gentleman whose aunt has already been referred to the cooper took out his spectacles wiped them carefully with his handkerchief and as carefully adjusted them to his nose he then took down from the mantelpiece one of the few books belonging to his library dr kanes arctic explorations and began to read for the tenth time it might be the record of these daring explorers the plain little room presented a picture of graceful tranquillity but it proved to be only the calm which preceded the storm the storm in question i regret to say was brought about by the luckless jack as has been said he was engaged in constructing a boat the particular operation he was now intent upon being the excavation or hollowing out now threelegged stools are not the most secure seats in the world this i think no one will deny who has any practical acquaintance with them jack was working quite vigorously the block from which the boat was to be fashioned being held firmly between his knees his knife having got wedged in the wood he made an unusual effort to draw it out in which he lost his balance and disturbed the equilibrium of his stool which with its load tumbled over backward now it very unfortunately happened that aunt rachel sat close behind and the treacherous stool came down with considerable force upon her foot a piercing shriek was heard and aunt rachel lifting her foot clung to it convulsively while an expression of pain disturbed her features at the sound the cooper hastily removed his spectacles and letting dr kane fall to the floor started up in great dismay mrs harding likewise dropped her sewing and jumped to her feet in alarm it did not take long to see how matters stood hurt ye much rachel inquired timothy its about killed me groaned the afflicted maiden oh i shall have to have my foot cut off or be a cripple anyway then turning upon jack fiercely you careless wicked ungrateful boy that ive been wearin myself out knittin for im almost sure you did it a purpose you wont be satisfied till youve got me out of the world and then then perhaps here rachel began to whimper perhaps youll get tom pipers aunt to knit your stockings i didnt mean to aunt rachel said jack penitently eying his aunt who was rocking to and fro in her chair you know i didnt besides i hurt myself like thunder rubbing himself vigorously served you right said his aunt still clasping her foot shant i get something for you to put on it rachel asked mrs harding but this rachel steadily refused and after a few more postures indicating a great amount of anguish limped out of the room and ascended the stairs to her own apartment chapter iii jacks new plan aunt rachel was right in one thing as jack realized he could not find horses to hold every day and even if he had succeeded in that few would have paid him so munificently as the stranger of the day before in fact matters came to a crisis and something must be sold to raise funds for immediate necessities now the only article of luxury if it could be called so in the possession of the family was a sofa in very good preservation indeed nearly new for it had been bought only two years before when business was good a neighbor was willing to pay fifteen dollars for this and mrs harding with her husbands consent agreed to part with it if ever we are able we will buy another said timothy and at any rate we can do without it said his wife rachel will miss it she said the other day that it was not comfortable and ought never to have been bought that it was a shameful waste of money in that case she wont be disturbed by our selling it no i should think not but its hard to tell how rachel will take anything this remark was amply verified the sofa was removed while the spinster was out and without any hint to her of what was going to happen when she returned she looked around for it with surprise wheres the sofy she asked weve sold it to mrs stoddard said mrs harding cheerfully sold it echoed rachel dolefully yes we felt that we didnt need it and we did need money she offered me fifteen dollars for it and i accepted rachel sat down in a rockingchair and began straightway to show signs of great depression of spirits lifes full of disappointments she groaned our paths is continually beset by em theres that sofa its so pleasant to have one in the house when a bodys sick but there its gone and if i happen to get down as most likely i shall for ive got a bad feeling in my stummick this very minute i shall have to go upstairs and most likely catch my death of cold and that will be the end of me not so bad as that i hope said mrs harding cheerfully you know when you was sick last you didnt want to use the sofa you said it didnt lay comfortable besides i hope before you are sick we may be able to buy it back again aunt rachel shook her head despondingly there aint any use in hoping that she said timothys got so much behindhand that he wont be able to get up again i know he wont but if he only manages to find steady work soon he will no he wont said rachel positively im sure he wont there wont be any work before spring and most likely not then you are too desponding aunt rachel enough to make me so if you had only taken my advice we shouldnt have come to this i dont know what advice you refer to rachel said mrs harding patiently no i dont expect you do my words dont make no impression you didnt pay no attention to what i said thats the reason but if youll repeat the advice rachel perhaps we can still profit by it answered mrs harding with imperturbable good humor i told you you ought to be layin up something agin a rainy day but thats always the way folks think when times is good its always agoin to be so but i know better i dont see how we could have been much more economical said mrs harding mildly theres a hundred ways poor folks like us ought not to expect to have meat so often its frightful to think what the butchers bill must have been for the last two months inconsistent rachel only the day before she had made herself very uncomfortable because there was no meat for dinner and said she couldnt live without it mrs harding might have reminded her of this but the good woman was too kind and forbearing to make the retort she really pitied rachel for her unhappy habit of despondency so she contented herself by saying that they must try to do better in future thats always the way muttered rachel shut the stable door after the horse is stolen folks never learn from experience till its too late to be of any use i dont see what the world was made for for my part everything goes topsyturvy and all sorts of ways except the right way i sometimes think taint much use livin oh youll feel better by and by rachel no i shant i feel my healths declinin every day i dont know how i can stand it when i have to go to the poorhouse we havent gone there yet rachel no but its comin soon we cant live on nothin hark theres jack coming said his mother hearing a quick step outside yes hes whistlin just as if nothin was the matter he dont care anything for the awful condition of the family youre wrong there rachel jack is trying every day to get something to do he wants to do his part rachel would have made a reply disparaging to jack but she had no chance for our hero broke in at this instant well jack said his mother inquiringly ive got a plan mother he said whats a boys plan worth sniffed aunt rachel oh dont be always hectorin me aunt rachel said jack impatiently hectorin is that the way my own nephew talks to me well its so you dont give a feller a chance ill tell you what im thinking of mother ive been talkin with tom blake he sells papers and he tells me he makes sometimes a dollar a day isnt that good yes that is very good wages for a boy i want to try it too but ive got to buy the papers first you know and i havent got any money so if youll lend me fifty cents ill try it this afternoon you think you can sell them jack i know i can im as smart as tom blake any day pride goes before a fall remarked rachel by way of a damper disappointment is the common lot thats just the way all the time said jack provoked ive lived longer than you began aunt rachel yes a mighty lot longer interrupted jack i dont deny that now youre sneerin at me on account of my age jack martha how can you allow such things be respectful jack then tell aunt rachel not to aggravate me so will you let me have the fifty cents mother yes jack i think your plan is worth trying she took out half a dollar from her pocketbook and handed it to jack all right mother ill see what i can do with it jack went out and rachel looked more gloomy than ever youll never see that money again you may depend ont martha she said why not rachel because jackll spend it for candy or in some other foolish way you are unjust rachel jack is not that kind of boy id ought to know him ive had chances enough you never knew him to do anything dishonest i suppose hes a model boy no he isnt hes got faults enough i admit but he wouldnt spend for his own pleasure money given him for buying papers if he buys the papers i dont believe he can sell them so the moneys wasted anyway said rachel trying another tack we will wait and see said mrs harding she saw that rachel was in one of her unreasonable moods and that it was of no use to continue the discussion chapter iv mrs harding takes a boarder jack started for the newspaper offices and bought a supply of papers i dont see why i cant sell papers as well as other boys he said to himself im going to try at any rate he thought it prudent however not to buy too large stock at first he might sell them all but then again he might get stuck on a part and this might take away all his profits jack however was destined to find that in the newspaper business as well as in others there was no lack of competition he took his place just below the astor house and began to cry his papers this aroused the ire of a rival newsboy a few feet away get away from here he exclaimed scowling at jack what for said jack this is my stand keep it then this is mine retorted jack composedly i dont allow no other newsboys in this block said the other dont you you aint the city government are you i dont want any of your impudence clear out clear out yourself ill give you a lickin perhaps you will when youre able jack spoke manfully but the fact was that the other boy probably was able being three years older and as many inches taller jack kept on crying his papers and his opponent incensed at the contemptuous disregard of his threats advanced toward him and taking jack unawares pushed him off the sidewalk with such violence that he nearly fell flat jack felt that the time for action had arrived he dropped his papers temporarily on the sidewalk and lowering his head butted against his young enemy with such force as to double him up and seat him gasping for breath on the sidewalk tom rafferty for this was his name looked up in astonishment at the unexpected form of the attack well done my lad said a hearty voice jack turned toward the speaker and saw a stout man dressed in a blue coat with brass buttons he was dark and bronzed with exposure to the weather and there was something about him which plainly indicated the sailor well done my lad he repeated you know how to pay off your debts i try to said jack modestly but wheres my papers the papers which he had dropped had disappeared one of the boys who had seen the fracas had seized the opportunity to make off with them and poor jack was in the position of a merchant who had lost his stock in trade who took them papers he asked looking about him i saw a boy run off with them said a bystander im glad of it said tom rafferty sullenly jack looked as if he was ready to pitch into him again but the sailor interfered dont mind the papers my lad what were they worth i gave twenty cents for em then heres thirty i dont think i ought to take it said jack its my loss take it my boy it wont ruin me ive got plenty more behind thank you sir ill go and buy some more papers not tonight i want you to take a cruise with me all right sir i suppose youd like to know who i am said the sailor as they moved off together i suppose youre a sailor you can tell that by the cut of my jib yes my lad im captain of the argo now in port its a good while since ive been in york for ten years ive been plying between liverpool and calcutta now ive got absence to come over here are you an american sir yes i was raised in connecticut but then i began going to sea when i was only thirteen i only arrived today and i find the city changed since ten years ago when i used to know it where are you staying at what hotel i havent gone to any yet i used to stay with a cousin of mine but hes moved do you know any good boarding place where theyd make me feel at home and let me smoke a pipe after dinner an idea struck jack they had an extra room at home or could make one by his sleeping in the sitting room why shouldnt they take the stranger to board the money would certainly be acceptable he determined to propose it if we lived in a nicer house he said id ask you to board at my mothers would she take me my lad i think she would but we are poor and live in a small house that makes no odds i aint a bit particular as long as i can feel at home so heave ahead my lad and well go and see this mother of yours and hear what she has to say about it jack took the way home well pleased and opening the front door entered the sitting room followed by the sailor aunt rachel looked up nervously and exclaimed a man yes maam said the stranger im a man and no mistake are you this lads mother no sir answered rachel emphatically i am nobodys mother oh an old maid said the sailor whose mode of life had made him unceremonious i am a spinster said rachel with dignity thats the same thing said the visitor sitting down opposite aunt rachel who eyed him suspiciously my aunt rachel harding capt bowling introduced jack aunt rachel capt bowling is the commander of a vessel now in port aunt rachel made a stiff courtesy and capt bowling eyed her curiously are you fond of knitting maam he asked i am not fond of anything said rachel mournfully we should not set our affections upon earthly things you wouldnt say that if you had a beau maam said capt bowling facetiously a beau repeated rachel horrorstricken yes maam i suppose youve had a beau some time or other i dont think it proper to talk on such a subject to a stranger said aunt rachel primly law maam you neednt be so particular just at this moment mrs harding entered the room and was introduced to capt bowling by jack the captain proceeded to business at once your son here maam told me you might maybe swing a hammock for me somewhere in your house i liked his looks and here i am do you think you would be satisfied with our plain fare and humble dwelling capt bowling i aint hard to suit maam so if you can take me ill stay his manner was frank although rough and mrs harding cheerfully consented to do so it was agreed that bowling should pay five dollars a week for the three or four weeks he expected to stay ill be back in an hour said the new boarder ive got a little business to attend to before supper when he had gone out aunt rachel began to cough ominously evidently some remonstrance was coming martha she said solemnly im afraid youve done wrong in taking that sailor man why rachel hes a strange man i dont see anything strange about him said jack he spoke to me about having a beau said aunt rachel in a shocked tone jack burst into a fit of hearty laughter perhaps hes going to make you an offer aunt rachel he said he wants to see if theres anybody in the way rachel did not appear so very indignant it was improper for a stranger to speak to me on that subject she said mildly you must make allowances for the bluntness of a sailor said mrs harding for some reason rachel did not seem as lowspirited as usual that evening capt bowling entertained them with narratives of his personal adventures and it was later than usual when the lamps were put out and they were all in bed chapter v the captains departure jack said the captain at breakfast the next morning how would you like to go round with me to see my vessel ill go said jack promptly very likely hell fall over into the water and be drowned suggested aunt rachel cheerfully ill take care of that maam said capt bowling wont you come yourself i go to see a vessel repeated rachel yes why not i am afraid it wouldnt be proper to go with a stranger said rachel with a high sense of propriety ill promise not to run away with you said the captain bluntly if i should attempt it jack here would interfere no i wouldnt said jack it wouldnt be proper for me to interfere with aunt rachels plans you seem to speak as if your aunt proposed to run away said mr harding jocosely you shouldnt speak of such things nephew i am shocked said rachel then you wont go maam asked the captain if i thought it was consistent with propriety said rachel hesitating what do you think martha i think there is no objection said mrs harding secretly amazed at rachels entertaining the idea the result was that miss rachel put on her things and accompanied the captain she was prevailed on to take the captains arm at length greatly to jacks amusement he was still more amused when a boy picked up her handkerchief which she had accidentally dropped and restoring it to the captain said heres your wifes handkerchief govnor ho ho laughed the captain he takes you for my wife maam ho ho echoed jack equally amused aunt rachel turned red with confusion i am afraid i ought not to have come she murmured i feel ready to drop youd better not drop just yet said the captain they were just crossing the street wait till it isnt so muddy on the whole aunt rachel decided not to drop the argo was a mediumsized vessel and jack in particular was pleased with his visit though not outwardly so demonstrative aunt rachel also seemed to enjoy the expedition the captain though blunt was attentive and it was something new to her to have such an escort it was observed that miss harding was much less gloomy than usual during the remainder of the day it might be that the captains cheerfulness was contagious for a stranger aunt rachel certainly conversed with him with a freedom remarkable for her i never saw rachel so cheerful remarked mrs harding to her husband that evening after they had retired she hasnt once spoken of life being a vale of tears today its the captain said her husband he has such spirits that it seems to enliven all of us i wish we could have him for a permanent boarder yes the five dollars a week which he pays are a great help especially now that i am out of work what is the prospect of getting work soon i am hoping for it from day to day but it may be weeks yet jack earned fifty cents today by selling papers his daily earnings are an important help with what the captain pays us it is enough to pay all our living expenses but theres one thing that troubles me the rent yes it is due in three weeks and as yet i havent a dollar laid by to meet it it makes me feel anxious dont lose your trust in providence timothy he may yet carry us over this difficulty so i hope but i cant help feeling in what straits we shall be if some help does not come two weeks later capt bowling sailed for liverpool i hope we shall see you again sometime captain said mrs harding whenever i come back to new york i shall come here if youll keep me said the bluff sailor aunt rachel will miss you captain said jack slyly capt bowling turned to the confused spinster i hope she will said he heartily perhaps when i see her again shell have a husband oh capt bowling how can you say such things gasped rachel who as the time for the captains departure approached had been subsiding into her old melancholy theres other things to think of in this vale of tears are there well if theyre gloomy i dont want to think of em jack my lad i wish you were going to sail with me so do i said jack hes my only boy captain said mrs harding i couldnt part with him i dont blame you maam not a particle though theres the making of a sailor in jack if he went away hed never come back said rachel lugubriously i dont know about that maam ive been a sailor man and boy forty years and here i am well and hearty today the captain is about your age isnt he aunt rachel said jack maliciously im only thirtynine said rachel sharply then i must have been under a mistake all my life said the cooper to himself rachels fortyseven if shes a day this remark he prudently kept to himself or a fit of hysterics would probably have been the result i wouldnt have taken you for a day over thirtyfive maam said the captain gallantly rachel actually smiled but mildly disclaimed the compliment if it hadnt been for my trials and troubles she said i might have looked younger but they are only to be expected its the common lot is it said the captain i cant say ive been troubled much that way with a stout heart and a good conscience we ought to be jolly who of us has a good conscience asked rachel in a melancholy tone i have aunt rachel answered jack you she exclaimed indignantly you that tied a tin kettle to a dogs tail yesterday and chased the poor cat till she almost died of fright i lie awake nights thinking of the bad end youre likely to come to unless you change your ways jack shrugged his shoulders but the captain came to his help boys will be boys maam he said i was up to no end of tricks myself when i was a boy you werent so bad as jack i know said rachel thank you for standing up for me maam but im afraid i was i dont think jacks so very bad for my part i didnt play the tricks aunt rachel mentioned said jack it was another boy in our block youre all alike said rachel i dont know what you boys are all coming to presently the captain announced that he must go jack accompanied him as far as the pier but the rest of the family remained behind aunt rachel became gloomier than ever i dont know what youll do now youve lost your boarder she said he will be a loss to us it is true said mrs harding but we are fortunate in having had him with us so long its only puttin off our misery a little longer said rachel weve got to go to the poorhouse after all rachel was in one of her moods and there was no use in arguing with her as it would only have intensified her gloom meanwhile jack was bidding goodby to the captain im sorry you cant go with me jack said the bluff sailor so am i but i cant leave mother right my lad i wouldnt take you away from her but there take that and dont forget me you are very kind said jack as the captain pressed into his hand a fivedollar gold piece may i give it to my mother certainly my lad you cant do better jack stood on the wharf till the vessel was drawn out into the stream by a steam tug then he went home chapter vi the landlords visit it was the night before the new year in many a household in the great city it was a night of happy anticipation in the humble home of the hardings it was an evening of anxious thought for tomorrow the quarters rent was due i havent got a dollar to meet the rent martha said the cooper in a depressed tone wont mr colman wait im afraid not you know what sort of a man he is martha there isnt much feeling about him he cares more for money than anything else perhaps you are doing him an injustice i am afraid not did you never hear how he treated the underhills how underhill was laid up with rheumatic fever for three months the consequence was that when quarter day came round he was in about the same situation with ourselves a little worse even for his wife was sick also but though colman was aware of the circumstances he had no pity he turned them out without ceremony is it possible asked mrs harding uneasily and theres no reason for his being more lenient with us i cant but feel anxious about tomorrow martha at this moment verifying an old adage which will perhaps occur to the reader who should knock but mr colman himself both the cooper and his wife had an instinctive foreboding as to his visit he came in rubbing his hands in a social way as was his custom no one to look at him would have suspected the hardness of heart that lay veiled under his velvety softness of manner goodevening mr harding he said affably i trust you and your excellent wife are in good health that blessing at least is continued to us said the cooper gravely and how comfortable youre looking too eh it makes an old bachelor like me feel lonesome when he contrasts his own solitary room with such a scene of comfort as this youve got a comfortable home and dog cheap too all my other tenants are grumbling to think you dont have to pay any more for such superior accommodations ive about made up my mind that i must ask you twentyfive dollars a quarter hereafter all this was said very pleasantly but the pill was none the less bitter it seems to me mr colman answered the cooper soberly you have chosen rather a singular time for raising the rent why singular my good sir inquired the landlord urbanely you know of course that this is a time of general business depression my own trade in particular has suffered greatly for a month past i have not been able to find any work colmans face lost something of its graciousness and i fear i shall not be able to pay my quarters rent tomorrow indeed said the landlord coldly perhaps you can make it up within two or three dollars i cant pay a dollar toward it said the cooper its the first time in the five years ive lived here that this thing has happened to me ive always been prompt before you should have economized as you found times growing harder said colman harshly it is hardly honest to live in a house when you know you cant pay the rent you shant lose it mr colman said the cooper earnestly no one ever yet lost anything by me and i dont mean anyone shall if i can help it only give me a little time and i will pay all the landlord shook his head you ought to have cut your coat according to your cloth he responded much as it will go against my feelings i am compelled by a prudent regard to my own interests to warn you that in case your rent is not ready tomorrow i shall be obliged to trouble you to find another tenement and furthermore the rent of this will be raised five dollars a quarter i cant pay it mr colman said timothy harding gravely i may as well say that now and its no use agreeing to pay more rent i pay all i can afford now very well you know the alternative of course if you can do better elsewhere you will thats understood but its a disagreeable subject we wont talk of it any more now i shall be round tomorrow forenoon hows your excellent sister as cheerful as ever quite as much so as usual answered the cooper dryly theres one favor i should like to ask he said after a pause will you allow us to remain here a few days till i can look about a little i would with the greatest pleasure in the world was the reply but theres another family very anxious to take the house and they wish to come in immediately therefore i shall be obliged to ask you to move out tomorrow in fact that is the very thing i came here this evening to speak about as i thought you might not wish to pay the increased rent we are much obliged to you said the cooper with a tinge of bitterness unusual to him if we are to be turned into the street it is pleasant to have a few hours notice of it turned out of doors my good sir what disagreeable expressions you employ if you reflect for a moment you will see that it is merely a matter of business i have an article to dispose of there are two bidders yourself and another person the latter is willing to pay a larger sum of course i give him the preference as you would do under similar circumstances dont you see how it is i believe i do replied the cooper of course its a regular proceeding but you must excuse me if i think of it in another light when i reflect that tomorrow at this time my family may be without a shelter my dear sir positively you are looking on the dark side of things it is actually sinful for you to distrust providence as you seem to do youre a little disappointed thats all just take tonight to sleep on it and ive no doubt youll see things in quite a different light but positively here he rose and began to draw on his gloves positively i have stayed longer than i intended goodnight my friends ill look in upon you in the morning and by the way as its so near permit me to wish you a happy new year the door closed upon the landlord leaving behind two anxious hearts it looks well in him to wish that said the cooper gloomily a great deal he is doing to make it so i dont know how it seems to others for my part i never say them words to anyone unless i really wish em well and am willing to do something to make em so i should feel as if i was a hypocrite if i acted anyways different martha was not one who was readily inclined to think evil of anyone but in her own gentle heart she could not help feeling a repugnance for the man who had just left them jack was not so reticent i hate that man he said decidedly you should not hate anyone my son said mrs harding i cant help it mother aint he goin to turn us out of the house tomorrow if we cannot pay our rent he is justified in doing so then why need he pretend to be so friendly he dont care anything for us it is right to be polite jack i spose if youre goin to kick a man it should be done politely said jack indignantly if possible said the cooper laughing is there any tenement vacant in this neighborhood asked mrs harding yes there is one in the next block belonging to mr harrison it is a better one than this yes but harrison only asks the same rent that we have been paying he is not so exorbitant as colman couldnt we get that i am afraid if he knows that we have failed to pay our rent here that he will object but he knows you are honest and that nothing but the hard times would have brought you to this pass it may be martha at any rate you have lightened my heart a little i feel as if there was some hope left after all we ought always to feel so timothy there was one thing that mr colman said that didnt sound so well coming from his lips but its true for all that what do you refer to i mean that about not distrusting providence many a time have i been comforted by reading the verse never have i seen the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging bread as long as we try to do what is right timothy god will not suffer us to want you are right martha he is our everpresent help in time of trouble when i think of that i feel easier they retired to rest thoughtfully but not sadly the fire upon the hearth flickered and died out at length the last sands of the old year were running out and the new morning ushered in its successor chapter vii the new years gift happy new year was jacks salutation to aunt rachel as with an unhappy expression of countenance she entered the sitting room happy indeed she repeated dismally theres great chance of its being so i should think we dont any of us know what the year may bring forth we may all be dead and buried before the next new year if thats the case said jack let us be jolly as long as life lasts i dont know what you mean by such a vulgar word said aunt rachel disdainfully ive heard of drunkards and such kind of people being jolly but thank providence i havent got to that yet if that was the only way to be jolly said jack stoutly then id be a drunkard i wouldnt carry round such a long face as you do aunt rachel for any money its enough to make all of us have long faces said his aunt sourly when you are brazen enough to own that you mean to be a miserable drunkard i didnt say any such thing said jack indignantly perhaps i have ears remarked aunt rachel sententiously and perhaps i have not its a new thing for a nephew to tell his aunt that she lies they didnt use to allow such things when i was young but the worlds going to rack and ruin and i shouldnt wonder if the people was right that say its coming to an end here mrs harding happily interposed by asking jack to go round to the grocery in the next street and buy a pint of milk for breakfast jack took his hat and started with alacrity glad to leave the dismal presence of aunt rachel he had scarcely opened the door when he started back in surprise exclaiming by hokey if there isnt a basket on the steps a basket repeated his mother in surprise can it be a new years present bring it in jack it was brought in immediately and the cover being lifted there appeared a female child apparently a year old all uttered exclamations of surprise each in itself characteristic what a dear innocent little thing said mrs harding with true maternal instinct aint it a pretty un exclaimed jack admiringly it looks as if it was goin to have the measles said aunt rachel or scarlet fever youd better not take it in martha or we may all catch it you wouldnt leave it out in the cold would you rachel the poor thing might die of exposure probably it will die said rachel mournfully its very hard to raise children theres something unhealthy in its looks it dont seem to me so it looks plump and healthy you cant never judge by appearances you ought to know that martha i will take the risk rachel i dont see what you are going to do with a baby when we are all on the verge of starvation and going to be turned into the street this very day remarked rachel despondently we wont think of that just now common humanity requires us to see what we can do for the poor child so saying mrs harding took the infant in her arms the child opened its eyes and smiled my heres a letter said jack diving into the bottom of the basket its directed to you father the cooper opened the letter and read as follows for reasons which it is unnecessary to state the guardians of this child find it expedient to intrust it to others to bring up the good account which they have heard of you has led them to select you for that charge no further explanation is necessary except that it is by no means their intention to make this a service of charity they therefore inclose a certificate of deposit on the broadway bank of five hundred dollars the same having been paid in to your credit each year while the child remains in your charge the same will in like manner be placed to your credit at the same bank it may be as well to state further that all attempt to fathom whatever of mystery may attach to this affair will prove useless the letter was read in amazement the certificate of deposit which had fallen to the floor was picked up by jack and handed to his father amazement was followed by a feeling of gratitude and relief what could be more fortunate exclaimed mrs harding surely timothy our faith has been rewarded god has listened to our cry said the cooper devoutly and in the hour of our sorest need he has remembered us isnt it prime said jack gleefully five hundred dollars aint we rich aunt rachel like as not observed rachel the certificate isnt genuine it doesnt look natural it should be ive heard of counterfeits afore now i shouldnt be surprised at all if timothy got took up for presenting it ill take the risk said her brother who did not seem much alarmed at the suggestion now youll be able to pay the rent timothy said mrs harding cheerfully yes and its the last quarters rent i mean to pay mr colman if i can help it why where are you going asked jack to the house belonging to mr harrison that i spoke of last night that is if it isnt already engaged i think i will see about it at once if mr colman should come in while i am gone tell him i will be back directly i dont want you to tell him of the change in our circumstances the cooper found mr harrison at home i called to inquire asked mr harding whether you have let your house not as yet was the reply what rent do you ask twenty dollars a quarter i dont think that unreasonable it is satisfactory to me was the coopers reply and if you have no objections to me as a tenant i will engage it at once far from having any objections mr harding was the courteous reply i shall be glad to secure so good a tenant will you go over and look at the house not now sir i am somewhat in haste can we move in today certainly his errand satisfactorily accomplished the cooper returned home meanwhile the landlord had called he was a little surprised to find that mrs harding instead of looking depressed looked cheerful rather than otherwise i was not aware you had a child so young he remarked looking at the baby it is not mine said mrs harding briefly the child of a neighbor i suppose thought the landlord meanwhile he scrutinized closely without appearing to do so the furniture in the room at this point mr harding entered the house goodmorning said colman affably a fine morning mr harding quite so responded his tenant shortly i have called mr harding to ask if you are ready with your quarters rent i think i told you last evening how i was situated of course i am sorry so am i interrupted the landlord for i may be obliged to have recourse to unpleasant measures you mean that we must leave the house of course you cannot expect to remain in it if you are unable to pay the rent i suppose he added making an inventory of the furniture with his eyes you will leave behind a sufficient amount of furniture to cover your debt surely you would not deprive us of our furniture is there any injustice in requiring payment of honest debts there are cases of that description however i will not put you to the trouble of levying on my furniture i am ready to pay your dues have you the money asked colman in surprise i have and something over can you cash my check for five hundred dollars it would be difficult to picture the amazement of the landlord surely you told me a different story last evening he said last evening and this morning are different times then i could not pay you now luckily i am able if you will accompany me to the bank i will draw some money and pay your bill my dear sir i am not at all in haste for the money said the landlord with a return of his affability any time within a week will do i hope by the way you will continue to occupy this house i dont feel like paying twentyfive dollars a quarter you shall have it for the same rent you have been paying but you said there was another family who had offered you an advanced rent i shouldnt like to interfere with them besides i have already hired a house of mr harrison in the next block mr colman was silenced he regretted too late the hasty course which had lost him a good tenant the family referred to had no existence and it may be remarked the house remained vacant for several months when he was glad to rent it at the old price chapter viii a lucky rescue the opportune arrival of the child inaugurated a season of comparative prosperity in the home of timothy harding to persons accustomed to live in their frugal way five hundred dollars seemed a fortune nor as might have happened in some cases did this unexpected windfall tempt the cooper or his wife to enter upon a more extravagant mode of living let us save something against a rainy day said mrs harding we can if i get work soon answered her husband this little one will add but little to our expenses and there is no reason why we shouldnt save up at least half of it so i think timothy the childs food will not amount to a dollar a week theres no tellin when you will get work timothy said rachel in her usual cheerful way it isnt well to crow before you are out of the woods very true rachel it isnt your failing to look too much at the sunny side of the picture im ready to look at it when i can see it anywhere answered his sister in the same enlivening way dont you see it in the unexpected good fortune which came with this child asked timothy ive no doubt you think it very fortunate now said rachel gloomily but a young childs a great deal of trouble do you speak from experience aunt rachel asked jack yes said his aunt slowly if all babies were as cross and illbehaved as you were when you were an infant five hundred dollars wouldnt begin to pay for the trouble of having them around mr harding and his wife laughed at the manner in which the tables had been turned upon jack but the latter had his wits about him sufficiently to answer ive always heard aunt rachel that the crosser a child is the pleasanter he will grow up what a very pleasant baby you must have been jack said his mother reprovingly but his father who looked upon it as a good joke remarked goodhumoredly hes got you there rachel but rachel took it as a serious matter and observed that when she was young children were not allowed to speak so to their elders but i dont know as i can blame em much she continued wiping her eyes with the corner of her apron when their own parents encourage em in it timothy was warned by experience of rachels temper that silence was his most prudent course anything that he might say would only be likely to make matters worse than before aunt rachel sank into a fit of deep despondency and did not say another word till dinner time she sat down to the table with a profound sigh as if there was little in life worth living for notwithstanding this it was observed that she had a good appetite indeed miss harding appeared to thrive on her gloomy views of life and human nature she was it must be acknowledged perfectly consistent in all her conduct so far as this peculiarity was concerned whenever she took up a newspaper she always looked first to the space appropriated to deaths and next in order to the column of accidents casualties etc and her spirits were visibly exhilarated when she encountered a familiar name in either list the cooper continued to look out for work but it was with a more cheerful spirit he did not now feel as if the comfort of his family depended absolutely on his immediate success used economically the money he had by him would last eight months and during that time it was hardly possible that he should not find something to do it was this sense of security of having something to fall back upon that enabled him to keep up good heart it is too generally the case that people are content to live as if they were sure of constantly retaining their health and never losing their employment when a reverse does come they are at once plunged into discouragement and feel the necessity of doing something immediately there is only one way of fending off such an embarrassment and that is to resolve whatever may be the amount of ones income to lay aside some part to serve as a reliance in time of trouble a little economy though it involves selfdenial will be well repaid by the feeling of security it engenders mr harding was not compelled to remain inactive as long as he feared not that his line of business revived that still remained depressed for a considerable time but another path was opened to him returning home late one evening the cooper saw a man steal out from a doorway and attack a gentleman whose dress and general appearance indicated probable wealth seizing him by the throat the villain effectually prevented his calling for help and at once commenced rifling his pockets when the cooper arrived on the scene a sudden blow admonished the robber that he had more than one to deal with what are you doing let that gentleman be the villain hesitated but a moment then springing to his feet he hastily made off under cover of the darkness i hope you have received no injury sir said mr harding respectfully addressing the stranger he had rescued no my worthy friend thanks to your timely assistance the rascal nearly succeeded however i hope you have lost nothing sir nothing fortunately you can form an idea of the value of your interference when i say that i have fifteen hundred dollars with me all of which would doubtless have been taken i am glad said timothy that i was able to do you such a service it was by the merest chance that i came this way will you add to my indebtedness by accompanying me with that trusty club of yours i have some distance yet to go and the money i have with me i dont want to lose willingly said the cooper but i am forgetting continued the gentleman that you will yourself be obliged to return alone i do not carry enough money to make me fear an attack said mr harding laughing money brings care i have always heard and the want of it sometimes freedom from anxiety yet most people are willing to take their share of that you are right sir nor i cant call myself an exception still i would be satisfied with the certainty of constant employment i hope you have that at least i have had until three or four months since then at present you are unemployed yes sir what is your business i am a cooper i will see what i can do for you will you call at my office tomorrow say at twelve oclock i shall be glad to do so sir i believe i have a card with me yes here is one and this is my house thank you for your company let me see you tomorrow they stood before a handsome dwelling house from whose windows draped by heavy crimson curtains a soft light proceeded the cooper could hear the ringing of childish voices welcoming home their father whose life unknown to them had been in such peril and he felt grateful to providence for making him the instrument of frustrating the designs of the villain who would have robbed the merchant and perhaps done him further injury timothy determined to say nothing to his wife about the nights adventure until after his appointed meeting for the next day then if any advantage accrued to him from it he would tell the whole story when he reached home mrs harding was sewing beside the fire aunt rachel sat with her hands folded in her lap with an air of martyrlike resignation to the woes of life ive brought you home a paper rachel said her brother cheerfully you may find something interesting in it i shant be able to read it this evening said rachel mournfully my eyes have troubled me lately i feel that it is more than probable i am getting blind but i trust i shall not live to be a burden to you timothy your prospects are dark enough without that dont trouble yourself with any fears of that sort rachel said the cooper cheerily i think i know what will enable you to use your eyes as well as ever what asked rachel with melancholy curiosity a pair of spectacles spectacles retorted rachel indignantly it will be a good many years before i am old enough to wear spectacles i didnt expect to be insulted by my own brother but i ought not to be surprised its one of my trials i didnt mean to hurt your feelings rachel said the cooper perplexed goodnight said rachel rising and taking a lamp from the table come rachel dont go up to bed yet its only nine oclock after what you have said to me timothy my selfrespect will not allow me to stay rachel swept out of the room with something more than her customary melancholy i wish rachel wasnt quite so contrary said the cooper to his wife she turns upon a body so sudden its hard to know how to take her hows the little girl martha aited seven years there are circumstanc i hope you dont find her very much trouble that all comes on you while we have the benefit of the money i dont think of that timothy she is a sweet child and i love her almost as much as if she were my own as for jack he perfectly idolizes her and how does rachel look upon her i am afraid she will never be a favorite with rachel rachel never took to children much it isnt her way now martha while you are sewing i will read you the news chapter ix what the envelope contained the card which had been handed to the cooper contained the name of thomas merriam no pearl street punctually at twelve he presented himself at the countingroom and received a cordial welcome from the merchant i am glad to see you he said affably you rendered me an important service last evening even if the loss of money alone was to be apprehended i will come to business at once as i am particularly engaged this morning and ask you if there is any way in which i can serve you if you could procure me a situation sir you would do me a great service i think you told me you were a cooper yes sir does this yield you a good support in good times it pays me two dollars a day and on that i can support my family comfortably lately it has been depressed and paid me but a dollar and a half when do you anticipate its revival that is uncertain i may have to wait some months and in the meantime you are willing to undertake some other employment i am not only willing but shall feel very fortunate to obtain work of any kind i have no objection to any honest employment mr merriam reflected a moment just at present he said i have nothing better to offer you than the position of porter if that will suit you you can enter upon its duties tomorrow i shall be very glad to undertake it sir anything is better than idleness as to the compensation that shall be the same that you have been accustomed to earn by your trade two dollars a day i only received that in the best times said timothy conscientiously your services as porter will be worth that amount and i will cheerfully pay it i will expect you tomorrow morning at eight if you can be here at that time i will be here promptly you are married i suppose said the merchant inquiringly yes sir i am blessed with a good wife i am glad of that stay a moment mr merriam went to his desk and presently came back with a sealed envelope give that to your wife he said thank you sir here the interview terminated and the cooper went home quite elated by his success his present engagement would enable him to bridge over the dull time until his trade revived and save him from incurring debts of which he had a just horror you are just in time timothy said mrs harding cheerfully as he entered weve got an apple pudding today i see you havent forgotten what i like martha theres no knowing how long youll be able to afford puddings said rachel dolefully to my mind its extravagant to have meat and pudding both when a month hence you may be in the poorhouse then said jack i wouldnt eat any if i were you aunt rachel oh if you grudge me the little i eat said his aunt in serene sorrow i will go without tut rachel nobody grudges you anything here said her brother and as to the poorhouse ive got some good news to tell you that will put that thought out of your head what is it asked mrs harding looking up brightly i have found employment not at your trade no but at something else which will pay equally well till trade revives here he told the chance by which he was enabled to serve mr merriam the evening previous and then he gave an account of his visit to the merchants countingroom and the engagement which he had made you are indeed fortunate timothy said his wife her face beaming with pleasure two dollars a day and weve got nearly the whole of the money left that came with this dear child why we shall be getting rich soon well rachel have you no congratulations to offer asked the cooper of his sister who in subdued sorrow was eating as if it gave her no pleasure but was rather a selfimposed penance i dont see anything so very fortunate in being engaged as a porter said rachel lugubriously i heard of a porter once who had a great box fall upon him and kill him instantly and i was reading in the sun yesterday of another out west somewhere who committed suicide the cooper laughed so rachel you conclude that one or the other of these calamities is the inevitable lot of all who are engaged in this business you may laugh now but it is always well to be prepared for the worst said rachel oracularly but it isnt well to be always looking for it rachel itll come whether you look for it or not retorted his sister sententiously then suppose we waste no time thinking about it since according to your admission its sure to come either way rachel did not deign a reply but continued to eat in serene melancholy wont you have another piece of pudding timothy asked his wife i dont care if i do martha its so good said the cooper passing his plate seems to me its the best pudding you ever made youve got a good appetite that is all said mrs harding modestly disclaiming the compliment apple puddings are unhealthy observed rachel then what makes you eat them asked jack a body must eat something besides life is so full of sorrow it makes little difference if its longer or shorter wont you have another piece rachel aunt rachel passed her plate and received a second portion jack winked slyly but fortunately his aunt did not observe it when dinner was over the cooper thought of the sealed envelope which had been given him for his wife martha he said i nearly forgot that i have something for you for me yes from mr merriam but he dont know me said mrs harding in surprise at any rate he first asked me if i was married and then handed me this envelope which he asked me to give to you i am not quite sure whether i ought to allow strange gentlemen to write letters to my wife mrs harding opened the envelope with considerable curiosity and uttered an exclamation of surprise as a bank note fell out and fluttered to the carpet by gracious mother said jack springing to get it youre in luck its a hundreddollar bill so it is i declare said his mother joyfully but timothy it isnt mine it belongs to you no martha i have nothing to do with it it belongs to you you need some clothes i am sure use part of it and i will put the rest in the savings bank for you i never expected to have money to invest said mrs harding i begin to feel like a capitalist when you want to borrow money timothy youll know where to come merriams a trump and no mistake said jack by the way when you see him again father just mention that youve got a son aint we in luck aunt rachel boast not overmuch said his aunt pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall i never knew aunt rachel to be jolly but once said jack under his breath and that was at a funeral chapter x jacks mischief one of the first results of the new prosperity which had dawned upon the hardings was jacks removal from the street to the school while his father was out of employment his earnings seemed necessary but now they could be dispensed with to jack the change was not altogether agreeable few boys of the immature age of eleven are devoted to study and jack was not one of these few the freedom which he had enjoyed suited him and he tried to impress it upon his father that there was no immediate need of his returning to school do you want to grow up a dunce jack said his father i can read and write already said jack are you willing to enter upon life with that scanty supply of knowledge oh i guess i can get along as well as the average i dont know about that besides i want you to do better than the average i am ambitious for you if you are not ambitious for yourself i dont see what good it does a feller to study so hard muttered jack you wont study hard enough to do you any harm said aunt rachel who might be excused for a little sarcasm at the expense of her mischievous nephew it makes my head ache to study said jack perhaps your head is weak jack suggested his father slyly more than likely said rachel approvingly so it was decided that jack should go to school ill get even with aunt rachel thought he shes always talking against me and hectorin me see if i dont an opportunity for getting even with his aunt did not immediately occur at length a plan suggested itself to our hero he shrewdly suspected that his aunts single blessedness and her occasional denunciations of the married state proceeded from disappointment ill bet shed get married if she had a chance he thought i mean to try her anyway accordingly with considerable effort aided by a schoolfellow he concocted the following letter which was duly copied and forwarded to his aunts address dear girl excuse the liberty i have taken in writing to you but i have seen you often though you dont know me and you are the only girl i want to marry i am not young i am about your age thirtyfive and i have a good trade i have always wanted to be married but you are the only one i know of to suit me if you think you can love me will you meet me in washington park next tuesday at four oclock wear a blue ribbon round your neck if you want to encourage me i will have a red rose pinned to my coat dont say anything to your brothers family about this they may not like me and they may try to keep us apart now be sure and come daniel this letter reached miss rachel just before jack went to school one morning she read it through first in surprise then with an appearance of pleasure whos your letter from aunt rachel asked jack innocently children shouldnt ask questions about what dont concern em said his aunt i thought maybe it was a love letter said he dont make fun of your aunt said his father reprovingly jacks question is only a natural one said rachel to her brothers unbounded astonishment i suppose i aint so old but i might be married if i wanted to i thought you had put all such thoughts out of your head long ago rachel if i have its because the race of men are so shiftless said his sister they aint worth marrying is that meant for me asked the cooper goodnaturedly youre all alike said rachel tossing her head she put the letter carefully into her pocket without deigning any explanation i suppose its from some of her old acquaintances thought her brother and he dismissed the subject as soon as she could rachel took refuge in her room she carefully locked the door and read the letter again who can he be thought the agitated spinster do i know anybody of the name of daniel it must be some stranger that has fallen in love with me unbeknown what shall i do she sat in meditation for a short time then she read the letter again he will be very unhappy if i frown upon him she said to herself complacently its a great responsibility to make a fellow being unhappy its a sacrifice i know but its our duty to deny ourselves i dont know but i ought to go and meet him this was rachels conclusion the time was close at hand the appointment was for that very afternoon i wouldnt have my brother or martha know it for the world murmured rachel to herself nor that troublesome jack marthas got some blue ribbon but i dont dare to ask her for it for fear shell suspect something no i must go out and buy some im goin to walk martha she said as she came downstairs going to walk in the forenoon isnt that something unusual ive got a little headache i guess itll do me good said rachel i hope it will said her sisterinlaw sympathetically rachel went to the nearest drygoods store and bought a yard of blue ribbon only a yard inquired the clerk in some surprise that will do said rachel nervously coloring a little as though the use which she designed for it might be suspected she paid for the ribbon and presently returned does your head feel any better rachel asked mrs harding a little answered rachel youve been sewing too steady lately perhaps suggested martha perhaps i have assented rachel you ought to spare yourself you cant stand work as well as when you were younger said martha innocently a bodyd think i was a hundred by the way you talk said rachel sharply i didnt mean to offend you rachel i thought you might feel as i do i get tired easier than i used to i guess ill go upstairs said rachel in the same tone there isnt anybody there to tell me how old i am gettin its hard to make rachel out thought mrs harding she takes offense at the most innocent remark she cant look upon herself as young i am sure upstairs rachel took out the letter again and read it through once more i wonder what sort of a man daniel is she said to herself i wonder if i have ever noticed him how little we know what others think of us if hes a likely man maybe its my duty to marry him i feel im a burden to timothy his income is small and itll make a difference of one mouth it may be a sacrifice but its my duty in this way rachel tried to deceive herself as to the real reason which led her to regard with favoring eyes the suit of this supposed lover whom she had never seen and about whom she knew absolutely nothing jack came home from school at halfpast two oclock he looked roguishly at his aunt as he entered she sat knitting in her usual corner will she go thought jack if she doesnt there wont be any fun but jack whose trick i am far from defending was not to be disappointed at three oclock rachel rolled up her knitting and went upstairs fifteen minutes later she came down dressed for a walk where are you going aunt rachel asked jack out for a walk she answered shortly may i go with you he asked mischievously no i prefer to go alone she said curtly your aunt has taken a fancy to walking said mrs harding when her sisterinlaw had left the house she was out this forenoon i dont know what has come over her i do said jack to himself five minutes later he put on his hat and bent his steps also to washington park chapter xi miss hardings mistake miss rachel harding kept on her way to washington park it was less than a mile from her brothers house and though she walked slowly she got there a quarter of an hour before the time she sat down on a seat near the center of the park and began to look around her poor rachel her heart beat quicker than it had done for thirty years as she realized that she was about to meet one who wished to make her his wife i hope he wont be late she murmured to herself and she felt of the blue ribbon to make sure that she had not forgotten it meanwhile jack reached the park and from a distance surveyed with satisfaction the evident nervousness of his aunt aint it rich he whispered to himself rachel looked anxiously for the gentleman with the red rose pinned to his coat she had to wait ten minutes at last he came but as he neared her seat rachel felt like sinking into the earth with mortification when she recognized in the wearer a stalwart negro she hoped that it was a mere chance coincidence but he approached her and raising his hat respectfully said are you miss harding what if i am she demanded sharply what have you to do with me the man looked surprised didnt you send word to me to meet you here no answered rachel and i consider it very presumptuous in you to write such a letter to me i didnt write you a letter said the negro astonished then what made you come here demanded the spinster because you wrote to me i wrote to you exclaimed rachel aghast yes you wrote to me to come here you said youd wear a blue ribbon on your neck and i was to have a rose pinned to my coat rachel was bewildered how could i write to you when i never saw you before and dont know your name do you think a lady like me would marry a colored man who said anything about that asked the other opening his eyes wide in astonishment i couldnt marry nohow for ive got a wife and four children rachel felt ready to collapse was it possible that she had made a mistake and that this was not her unknown correspondent daniel there is some mistake she said nervously where is that letter you thought i wrote have you got it with you here it is maam he handed rachel a letter addressed in a small hand to daniel thompson she opened it and read mr thompson i hear you are out of work i may be able to give you a job meet me at washington park tuesday afternoon at four oclock i shall wear a blue ribbon round my neck and you may have a red rose pinned to your coat otherwise i might not know you rachel harding some villain has done this said rachel wrathfully i never wrote that letter you didnt said daniel looking perplexed who went and did it then i dont know but id like to have him punished for it said rachel energetically but youve got a blue ribbon said mr thompson i cant see through that thats just what the letter said i suppose somebody wrote the letter that knew i wear blue its all a mistake youd better go home then havent you got a job for me asked daniel disappointed no i havent said rachel sharply she hurriedly untied the ribbon from her neck and put it in her pocket dont talk to me any more she said frowning youre a perfect stranger you have no right to speak to me i guess the old woman aint right in her head thought daniel must be shes crazy poor rachel she felt more disconsolate than ever there was no daniel then she had been basely imposed upon there was no call for her to sacrifice herself on the altar of matrimony she ought to have been glad but she wasnt half an hour later a drooping disconsolate figure entered the house of timothy harding why whats the matter rachel asked martha who noticed her woebegone expression i aint long for this world said rachel gloomily death has marked me for his own dont you feel well this afternoon rachel no i feel as if life was a burden you have tired yourself with walking rachel you have been out twice today this is a vale of tears said rachel hysterically theres nothin but sorrow and misfortune to be expected have you met with any misfortune i thought fortune was smiling upon us all itll never smile on me again said rachel despondently just then jack who had followed his aunt home entered have you got home so quick aunt rachel he asked how did you enjoy your walk i shall never enjoy anything again said his aunt gloomily why not because theres nothing to enjoy i dont feel so aunt i feel as merry as a cricket you wont be long like as not youll be took down with fever tomorrow and maybe die i wont trouble myself about it till the time comes said jack i expect to live to dance at your wedding yet aunt rachel this reference was too much it brought to rachels mind the daniel to whom she had expected to link her destiny and she burst into a dismal sob and hurried upstairs to her own chamber rachel acts queerly today said mrs harding i think she cant be feeling well if she dont feel better tomorrow i shall advise her to send for the doctor i am afraid it was mean to play such a trick on aunt rachel thought jack half repentantly i didnt think shed take it so much in earnest i must keep dark about that letter shed never forgive me if she knew for some days there was an added gloom on miss rachels countenance but the wound was not deep and after a time her disappointment ceased to rankle in her too sensitive heart chapter xii seven years seven years slipped by unmarked by any important change the hardings were still prosperous in an humble way the cooper had been able to obtain work most of the time and this with the annual remittance for little ida had enabled the family not only to live in comfort but even to save up one hundred and fifty dollars a year they might even have saved more living as frugally as they were accustomed to do but there was one point in which they would none of them consent to be economical the little ida must have everything she wanted timothy brought home nearly every day some little delicacy for her which none of the rest thought of sharing while mrs harding far enough from vanity always dressed with extreme plainness idas attire was always of good material and made up tastefully sometimes the little girl asked mother why dont you buy yourself some of the pretty things you get for me mrs harding would answer smiling oh im an old woman ida plain things are best for me no im sure youre not old mother you dont wear a cap aunt rachel is a good deal older than you hush ida dont let aunt rachel hear that she wouldnt like it but she is ever so much older than you mother persisted the child once rachel heard a remark of this kind and perhaps it was that that prejudiced her against ida at any rate she was not one of those who indulged her frequently she rebuked her for matters of no importance but it was so well understood in the coopers household that this was aunt rachels way that ida did not allow it to trouble her as the lightest reproach from mrs harding would have done had ida been an ordinary child all this petting would have had an injurious effect upon her mind but fortunately she had the rare simplicity young as she was which lifted her above the dangers which might have spoiled her otherwise instead of being made vain and conceited she only felt grateful for the constant kindness shown her by her father and mother and brother jack as she was wont to call them indeed it had not been thought best to let her know that such were not the actual relations in which they stood to her there was one point much more important than dress in which ida profited by the indulgence of her friends martha the cooper was wont to say ida is a sacred charge in our hands if we allow her to grow up ignorant or only allow her ordinary advantages we shall not fulfill our duty we have the means through providence of giving her some of those advantages which she would enjoy if she had remained in that sphere to which her parents doubtless belong let no unwise parsimony on our part withhold them from her you are right timothy said his wife right as you always are follow the dictates of your own heart and fear not that i shall disapprove humph said aunt rachel you aint actin right accordin to my way of thinkin readin writin and cypherin was enough for girls to learn in my day whats the use of stuffin the girls head full of nonsense thatll never do her no good ive got along without it and i aint quite a fool but the cooper and his wife had no idea of restricting idas education to the rather limited standard indicated by rachel so from the first they sent her to a carefully selected private school where she had the advantage of good associates and where her progress was astonishingly rapid ida early displayed a remarkable taste for drawing as soon as this was discovered her adopted parents took care that she should have abundant opportunity for cultivating it a private master was secured who gave her lessons twice a week and boasted everywhere of the progress made by his charming young pupil whats the good of it asked rachel shed a good deal better be learnin to sew and knit all in good time said timothy she can attend to both i never wasted my time that way said rachel id be ashamed to nothing could exceed timothys gratification when on his birthday ida presented him with a beautifully drawn sketch of his wifes placid and benevolent face when did you do it ida he asked after earnest expressions of admiration i did it in odd minutes she answered when i had nothing else to do but how could you do it without any of us knowing what you were about i had a picture before me and you thought i was copying it but whenever i could do it without being noticed i looked up at mother as she sat at her sewing and so after a while i finished the picture and a fine one it is said the cooper admiringly mrs harding insisted that ida had flattered her but this ida would not admit i couldnt make it look as good as you mother she said i tried but somehow i didnt succeed as i wanted to you wouldnt have that difficulty with aunt rachel said jack roguishly ida could not help smiling but rachel did not smile i see she said with severe resignation that youve taken to ridiculing your poor aunt again but its only what i expect i dont never expect any consideration in this house i was born to be a martyr and i expect i shall fulfill my destiny if my own relations laugh at me of course i cant expect anything better from other folks but i shant be long in the way ive had a cough for some time past and i expect im in consumption you make too much of a little joke rachel said the cooper soothingly im sure jack didnt mean anything what i said was complimentary said jack rachel shook her head incredulously yes it was ask ida why wont you draw aunt rachel ida i think shed make a very striking picture so i will said ida hesitatingly if she will let me now aunt rachel theres a chance for you said jack take my advice and improve it when its finished it can be hung up in the art rooms and who knows but you may secure a husband by it i wouldnt marry said rachel firmly compressing her lips not if anybodyd go down on their knees to me now im sure aunt rachel thats cruel of you said jack demurely there aint any man id trust my happiness to pursued the spinster she hasnt any to trust observed jack sotto voce men are all deceivers continued rachel the best of em you cant believe what one of em says it would be a great deal better if people never married at all then where would the world be a hundred years hence suggested her nephew come to an end most likely answered aunt rachel and im not sure but that would be the best thing its growing more and more wicked every day it will be seen that no great change has come over miss rachel harding during the years that have intervened she takes the same disheartening view of human nature and the worlds prospects as ever nevertheless her own hold upon the world seems as strong as ever her appetite continues remarkably good and although she frequently expresses herself to the effect that there is little use in living she would be as unwilling to leave the world as anyone it is not impossible that she derives as much enjoyment from her melancholy as other people from their cheerfulness unfortunately her peculiar mode of enjoying herself is calculated to have rather a depressing influence upon the spirits of those with whom she comes in contact always excepting jack who has a lively sense of the ludicrous and never enjoys himself better than in bantering his aunt i dont expect to live moren a week said rachel one day my sands of life are most run out are you sure of that aunt rachel asked jack yes ive got a presentiment that its so then if youre sure of it said her nephew gravely it may be as well to order the coffin in time what style would you prefer rachel retreated to her room in tears exclaiming that he neednt be in such a hurry to get her out of the world but she came down to supper and ate with her usual appetite ida is no less a favorite with jack than with the rest of the household indeed he has constituted himself her especial guardian rough as he is in the playground he is always gentle with her when she was just learning to walk and in her helplessness needed the constant care of others he used from choice to relieve his mother of much of the task of amusing the child he had never had a little sister and the care of a child as young as ida was a novelty to him it was perhaps this very office of guardian to the child assumed when she was young that made him feel ever after as if she were placed under his special protection ida was equally attached to jack she learned to look to him for assistance in any plan she had formed and he never disappointed her whenever he could he would accompany her to school holding her by the hand and fond as he was of rough play nothing would induce him to leave her how long have you been a nursemaid asked a boy older than himself one day jacks fingers itched to get hold of his derisive questioner but he had a duty to perform and he contented himself with saying just wait a few minutes and ill let you know i dare say you will was the reply i rather think i shall have to wait till both of us are gray before that time you will not have to wait long before you are black and blue retorted jack dont mind what he says jack whispered ida fearing that he would leave her dont be afraid ida i wont leave you ill attend to his business another time i guess he wont trouble us tomorrow meanwhile the boy emboldened by jacks passiveness followed with more abuse of the same sort if he had been wiser he would have seen a storm gathering in the flash of jacks eye but he mistook the cause of his forbearance the next day as they were going to school ida saw the same boy dodging round the corner with his head bound up whats the matter with him jack she asked i licked him like blazes thats all said jack quietly i guess hell let us alone after this even after jack left school and got a position in a store at two dollars a week he gave a large part of his spare time to ida really said mrs harding jack is as careful of ida as if he was her guardian a pretty sort of a guardian he is said aunt rachel take my word for it hes only fit to lead her into mischief you do him injustice rachel jack is not a model boy but he takes the best care of ida rachel shrugged her shoulders and sniffed significantly it was quite evident that she did not have a very favorable opinion of her nephew chapter xiii a mysterious visitor about eleven oclock one forenoon mrs harding was in the kitchen busily engaged in preparing the dinner when a loud knock was heard at the front door who can it be said mrs harding aunt rachel theres somebody at the door wont you be kind enough to see who it is people have no business to call at such an hour in the morning grumbled rachel as she laid down her knitting reluctantly and rose from her seat nobody seems to have any consideration for anybody else but thats the way of the world opening the outer door she saw before her a tall woman dressed in a gown of some dark stuff with strongly marked and not altogether pleasant features are you the lady of the house inquired the visitor abruptly there aint any ladies in this house answered rachel youve come to the wrong place we have to work for a living here the woman of the house then said the stranger rather impatiently it doesnt make any difference about names are you the one i want to see no i aint said rachel shortly will you tell your mistress that i want to see her then i have no mistress said rachel what do you take me for i thought you might be the servant but that dont matter i want to see mrs harding will you call her or shall i go and announce myself i dont know as shell see you shes busy in the kitchen her business cant be as important as what ive come about tell her that will you rachel did not fancy the strangers tone or manner certainly she did not manifest much politeness but the spinsters curiosity was excited and this led her the more readily to comply with the request stay here and ill call her she said theres a woman wants to see you announced rachel who is it i dont know she hasnt got any manners thats all i know about her mrs harding presented herself at the door wont you come in she asked yes i will what ive got to say to you may take some time mrs harding wondering vaguely what business this strange visitor could have with her led the way to the sitting room you have in your family said the woman after seating herself a girl named ida mrs harding looked up suddenly and anxiously could it be that the secret of idas birth was to be revealed at last was it possible that she was to be taken from her yes she answered simply who is not your child but i love her as much i have always taught her to look upon me as her mother i presume so my visit has reference to her can you tell me anything of her parentage inquired mrs harding eagerly i was her nurse said the stranger mrs harding scrutinized anxiously the hard features of the woman it was at least a relief to know that no tie of blood connected her with ida though even upon her assurance she would hardly have believed it who were her parents i am not permitted to tell mrs harding looked disappointed surely she said with a sudden sinking of the heart you have not come to take her away this letter will explain my object in visiting you said the woman drawing a sealed envelope from a bag which she carried in her hand the coopers wife nervously broke open the letter and read as follows mrs harding seven years ago last new years night a child was left on your doorsteps with a note containing a request that you would care for it kindly as your own money was sent at the same time to defray the expenses of such care the writer of this note is the mother of the child ida there is no need to explain here why i sent away the child from me you will easily understand that it was not done willingly and that only the most imperative necessity would have led me to such a step the same necessity still prevents me from reclaiming my child and i am content still to leave ida in your charge yet there is one thing i desire you will understand a mothers wish to see face to face her own child with this view i have come to this neighborhood i will not say where i am for concealment is necessary to me i send this note by a trustworthy attendant mrs hardwick my little idas nurse in her infancy who will conduct ida to me and return her again to you ida is not to know who she is visiting no doubt she believes you to be her mother and it is well that she should so regard you tell her only that it is a lady who takes an interest in her and that will satisfy her childish curiosity i make this request as idas mother mrs harding read this letter with mingled feelings pity for the writer a vague curiosity in regard to the mysterious circumstances which had compelled her to resort to such a step a half feeling of jealousy that there should be one who had a claim to her dear adopted daughter superior to her own and a strong feeling of relief at the assurance that ida was not to be permanently removed all these feelings affected the coopers wife so you were idas nurse she said gently yes maam said the stranger i hope the dear child is well perfectly well how much her mother must have suffered from the separation indeed you may say so maam it came near to breaking her heart i dont wonder said sympathizing mrs harding i can judge of that by my own feelings i dont know what i should do if ida were to be taken from me at this point in the conversation the cooper entered the house he had come home on an errand it is my husband said mrs harding turning to her visitor by way of explanation timothy will you come here a moment the cooper regarded the stranger with some surprise his wife hastened to introduce her as mrs hardwick idas old nurse and placed in her husbands hands the letter which we have already read he was not a rapid reader and it took him some time to get through the letter he laid it down on his knee and looked thoughtful this is indeed unexpected he said at last it is a new development in idas history may i ask mrs hardwick if you have any further proof i want to be careful about a child that i love as my own can you furnish any other proof that you are what you represent i judged that the letter would be sufficient doesnt it speak of me as the nurse true but how can we be sure that the writer is idas mother the tone of the letter sir would anybody else write like that then you have read the letter asked the cooper quickly it was read to me before i set out by whom by idas mother i do not blame you for your caution said the visitor you must be deeply interested in the happiness of the dear child of whom you have taken such excellent care i dont mind telling you that i was the one who left her at your door seven years ago and that i never left the neighborhood until i saw you take her in and it was this that enabled you to find the house today you forget corrected the nurse that you were not then living in this house but in another some rods off on the lefthand side of the street you are right said timothy i am inclined to believe in the truth of your story you must pardon my testing you in such a manner but i was not willing to yield up ida even for a little time without feeling confident of the hands she was falling into you are right said mrs hardwick i dont blame you in the least i shall report it to idas mother as a proof of your attachment to the child when do you wish ida to go with you asked mrs harding can you let her go this afternoon why said the coopers wife hesitating i should like to have a chance to wash out some clothes for her i want her to appear as neat as possible when she meets her mother the nurse hesitated but presently replied i dont wish to hurry you if you will let me know when she will be ready i will call for her i think i can get her ready early tomorrow morning that will answer i will call for her then the nurse rose and gathered her shawl about her where are you going mrs hardwick asked the coopers wife to a hotel was the reply we cannot allow that said mrs harding kindly its a pity if we cannot accommodate idas old nurse for one night or ten times as long for that matter my wife is quite right said the cooper hesitatingly we must insist on your stopping with us the nurse hesitated and looked irresolute it was plain she would have preferred to be elsewhere but a remark which mrs harding made decided her to accept the invitation it was this you know mrs hardwick if ida is to go with you she ought to have a little chance to get acquainted with you before you go i will accept your kind invitation she said but i am afraid i shall be in your way not in the least it will be a pleasure to us to have you here if you will excuse me now i will go out and attend to my dinner which i am afraid is getting behindhand left to herself the nurse behaved in a manner which might be regarded as singular she rose from her seat and approached the mirror she took a full survey of herself as she stood there and laughed a short hard laugh then she made a formal courtesy to her own reflection saying how do you do mrs hardwick did you speak asked the cooper who was passing through the entry on his way out no answered the nurse rather awkwardly i may have said something to myself its of no consequence somehow thought the cooper i dont fancy the womans looks but i dare say i am prejudiced were all of us as god made us when mrs harding was making preparations for the noonday meal she imparted to rachel the astonishing information which has already been detailed to the reader i dont believe a word of it said rachel resolutely the womans an impostor i knew she was the very minute i set eyes on her this remark was so characteristic of rachel that her sisterinlaw did not attach any special importance to it rachel of course had no grounds for the opinion she so confidently expressed it was consistent however with her general estimate of human nature what object could she have in inventing such a story asked mrs harding what object hundreds of em said rachel rather indefinitely mark my words if you let her carry off ida itll be the last youll ever see of her try to look on the bright side rachel nothing is more natural than that her mother should want to see her why couldnt she come herself muttered rachel the letter explains i dont see that it does it says that same reasons exist for concealment as ever and what are they i should like to know i dont like mysteries for my part we wont quarrel with them at any rate since they enable us to keep ida with us aunt rachel shook her head as if she were far from satisfied i dont know said mrs harding but i ought to invite mrs hardwick in here i have left her alone in the front room i dont want to see her said rachel then changing her mind suddenly yes you may bring her in ill soon find out whether shes an impostor or not the coopers wife returned with the nurse mrs hardwick she said this is my sister miss rachel harding i am glad to make your acquaintance maam said the visitor rachel i will leave you to entertain mrs hardwick while i get ready the dinner rachel and the nurse eyed each other with mutual dislike i hope you dont expect me to entertain you said rachel i never expect to entertain anybody agin this is a world of trial and tribulation and ive had my share so youve come after ida i hear with a sudden change of tone at her mothers request said the nurse she wants to see her then yes maam i wonder she didnt think of it before said rachel sharply shes good at waiting shes waited seven years there are circumstances that cannot be explained commenced the nurse no i dare say not said rachel dryly so you were her nurse yes maam answered the nurse who did not appear to enjoy this crossexamination have you lived with idas mother ever since no yes stammered the stranger some of the time she added recovering herself umph grunted rachel darting a sharp glance at her have you a husband living inquired the spinster yes answered mrs hardwick have you i repeated rachel scornfully no neither living nor dead im thankful to say i never married ive had trials enough without that does idas mother live in the city i cant tell you said the nurse humph i dont like mystery it isnt any mystery said the visitor if you have any objections to make you must make them to idas mother so i will if youll tell me where she lives i cant do that where do you live yourself inquired rachel shifting her point of attack in brooklyn answered mrs hardwick with some hesitation what street and number why do you want to know inquired the nurse you aint ashamed to tell be you why should i be i dont know youd orter know better than i it wouldnt do you any good to know said the nurse i dont care about receiving visitors i dont want to visit you i am sure said rachel tossing her head then you dont need to know where i live rachel left the room and sought her sisterinlaw that womans an impostor she said she wont tell where she lives i shouldnt be surprised if she turns out to be a thief you havent any reason for supposing that rachel wait and see said rachel of course i dont expect you to pay any attention to what i say i havent any influence in this house now rachel you have no cause to say that but rachel was not to be appeased it pleased her to be considered a martyr and at such times there was little use in arguing with her chapter xiv preparing for a journey later in the day ida returned from school she bounded into the room as usual but stopped short in some confusion on seeing a stranger is this my own dear child over whose infancy i watched so tenderly exclaimed the nurse rising her harsh features wreathed into a smile it is ida said the coopers wife ida looked from one to the other in silent bewilderment ida said mrs harding in a little embarrassment this is mrs hardwick who took care of you when you were an infant but i thought you took care of me mother said ida in surprise very true said mrs harding evasively but i was not able to have the care of you all the time didnt i ever mention mrs hardwick to you no mother although it is so long since i have seen her i should have known her anywhere said the nurse applying a handkerchief to her eyes so pretty as shes grown up too mrs harding glanced with pride at the beautiful child who blushed at the compliment a rare one for her adopted mother whatever she might think did not approve of openly praising her appearance ida said mrs hardwick wont you come and kiss your old nurse ida looked at her hard face which now wore a smile intended to express affection without knowing why she felt an instinctive repugnance to this stranger notwithstanding her words of endearment she advanced timidly with a reluctance which she was not wholly able to conceal and passively submitted to a caress from the nurse there was a look in the eyes of the nurse carefully guarded yet not wholly concealed which showed that she was quite aware of idas feeling toward her and resented it but whether or not she was playing a part she did not betray this feeling openly but pressed the unwilling child more closely to her bosom ida breathed a sigh of relief when she was released and moved quietly away wondering what it was that made the woman so disagreeable to her is my nurse a good woman she asked thoughtfully when alone with mrs harding who was setting the table for dinner a good woman what makes you ask that queried her adopted mother in surprise i dont know said ida i dont know anything to indicate that she is otherwise said mrs harding and by the way ida she is going to take you on a little excursion tomorrow she going to take me exclaimed ida why where are we going on a little pleasure trip and perhaps she may introduce you to a pleasant lady who has already become interested in you from what she has told her what could she say of me inquired ida she has not seen me since i was a baby why answered the coopers wife a little puzzled she appears to have thought of you ever since with a good deal of affection is it wicked asked ida after a pause not to like those who like us what makes you ask because somehow or other i dont like this mrs hardwick at all for all she was my old nurse and i dont believe i ever shall oh yes you will said mrs harding when you find she is exerting herself to give you pleasure am i going with her tomorrow morning yes she wanted you to go today but your clothes were not in order we shall come back at night shant we i presume so i hope we shall said ida decidedly and that she wont want me to go with her again perhaps you will feel differently when it is over and you find you have enjoyed yourself better than you anticipated mrs harding exerted herself to fit ida up as neatly as possible and when at length she was got ready she thought with sudden fear perhaps her mother will not be willing to part with her again when ida was ready to start there came upon all a little shadow of depression as if the child were to be separated from them for a year and not for a day only perhaps this was only natural since even this latter term however brief was longer than they had been parted from her since in her infancy she had been left at their door the nurse expressly desired that none of the family should accompany her as she declared it highly important that the whereabouts of idas mother should not be known of course she added after ida returns she can tell you what she pleases then it will be of no consequence for her mother will be gone she does not live in this neighborhood she has only come here to see her child shall you bring her back tonight asked mrs harding i may keep her till tomorrow said the nurse after seven years absence her mother will think that short enough to this mrs harding agreed though she felt that she should miss ida though absent but twentyfour hours chapter xv the journey the nurse walked as far as broadway holding ida by the hand where are we going asked the child timidly are you going to walk all the way no said the nurse not all the way perhaps a mile you can walk as far as that cant you oh yes they walked on till they reached the ferry at the foot of courtland street did you ever ride in a steamboat asked the nurse in a tone meant to be gracious once or twice answered ida i went with brother jack once over to hoboken are we going there now no we are going to the city you see over the water what place is it is it brooklyn no it is jersey city oh that will be pleasant said ida forgetting in her childish love of novelty the repugnance with which the nurse had inspired her yes and that is not all we are going still further said the nurse are we going further asked ida in excitement where are we going to a town on the line of the railroad and shall we ride in the cars asked ida yes didnt you ever ride in the cars no never i think you will like it and how long will it take us to go to the place you are going to carry me to i dont know exactly perhaps three hours three whole hours in the cars how much i shall have to tell father and jack when i get back so you will replied mrs hardwick with an unaccountable smile when you get back there was something peculiar in her tone but ida did not notice it she was allowed to sit next the window in the cars and took great pleasure in surveying the fields and villages through which they were rapidly whirled are we most there she asked after riding about two hours it wont be long said the nurse we must have come ever so many miles said ida yes it is a good ways an hour more passed and still there was no sign of reaching their journeys end both ida and her companion began to feel hungry the nurse beckoned to her side a boy who was selling apples and cakes and inquired the price the apples are two cents apiece maam and the cakes are one cent each ida who had been looking out of the window turned suddenly round and exclaimed in great astonishment why charlie fitts is that you why ida where did you come from asked the boy with a surprise equaling her own im making a little journey with this lady said ida so youre going to philadelphia said charlie to philadelphia repeated ida surprised not that i know of why youre most there now are we mrs hardwick inquired ida it isnt far from where were going she answered shortly boy ill take two of your apples and four cakes and now youd better go along for theres somebody over there that looks as if he wanted to buy something who is that boy asked the nurse abruptly his name is charlie fitts where did you get acquainted with him he went to school with jack so i used to see him sometimes with jack yes brother jack dont you know him oh yes i forgot so hes a schoolmate of jack yes and hes a firstrate boy said ida with whom the young apple merchant was evidently a favorite hes good to his mother you see his mother is sick most of the time and cant work much and hes got a little sister she aint more than four or five years old and charlie supports them by selling things hes only sixteen years old isnt he a smart boy yes said the nurse indifferently sometime continued ida i hope i shall be able to earn something for father and mother so they wont be obliged to work so hard what could you do asked the nurse curiously i dont know as i can do much yet answered ida modestly but perhaps when i am older i can draw pictures that people will buy have you got any of your drawings with you no i didnt bring any i wish you had the lady we are going to see would have liked to see some of them are we going to see a lady yes didnt your mother tell you yes i believe she said something about a lady that was interested in me thats the one and shall we come back to new york tonight no it wouldnt leave us any time to stay west philadelphia announced the conductor we have arrived said the nurse keep close to me perhaps you had better take hold of my hand as they were making their way slowly through the crowd the young apple merchant came up with his basket on his arm when are you going back ida he asked mrs hardwick says not till tomorrow come ida said the nurse sharply i cant have you stopping all day to talk we must hurry along goodby charlie said ida if you see jack just tell him you saw me yes i will was the reply i wonder who that woman is with ida thought the boy i dont like her looks much i wonder if shes any relation of mr harding she looks about as pleasant as aunt rachel the lastmentioned lady would hardly have felt flattered at the comparison ida looked about her with curiosity there was a novel sensation in being in a new place particularly a city of which she had heard so much as philadelphia as far back as she could remember she had never left new york except for a brief excursion to hoboken and one fourth of july was made memorable by a trip to staten island under the guardianship of jack they entered a horse car just outside the depot and rode probably a mile we get out here said the nurse take care or youll get run over now turn down here they entered a narrow and dirty street with unsightly houses on each side this aint a very nicelooking street said ida why isnt it demanded her companion roughly why its narrow and the houses dont look nice what do you think of that house there asked mrs hardwick pointing to a dilapidatedlooking structure on the righthand side of the street i shouldnt like to live there answered ida you wouldnt hey you dont like it so well as the house you live in in new york no not half so well the nurse smiled wouldnt you like to go in and look at the house go in and look at the house repeated ida why should we you must know there are some poor families living there that i am interested in said mrs hardwick who appeared amused at something didnt your mother ever tell you that it is our duty to help the poor oh yes but wont it be late before we get to the lady no theres plenty of time you neednt be afraid of that theres a poor man living in this house that ive made a good many clothes for first and last he must be much obliged to you said ida were going up to see him now said her companion take care of that hole in the stairs somewhat to idas surprise her guide on reaching the first landing opened a door without the ceremony of knocking and revealed a poor untidy room in which a coarse unshaven man was sitting in his shirt sleeves smoking a pipe hello exclaimed this individual jumping up so youve got along old woman is that the gal ida stared from one to the other in amazement chapter xvi unexpected quarters the appearance of the man whom mrs hardwick addressed so familiarly was more picturesque than pleasing he had a large broad face which not having been shaved for a week looked like a wilderness of stubble his nose indicated habitual indulgence in alcoholic beverages his eyes were bloodshot and his skin looked coarse and blotched his coat was thrown aside displaying a shirt which bore evidence of having been useful in its day and generation the same remark may apply to his nether integuments which were ventilated at each knee indicating a most praiseworthy regard to the laws of health ida thought she had never seen so disgusting a man she continued to gaze at him half in astonishment half in terror till the object of her attention exclaimed well little gal what youre lookin at haint you never seen a gentleman before ida clung the closer to her companion who she was surprised to find did not resent the mans familiarity well dick howve you got along since ive been gone asked the nurse to idas astonishment oh soso have you felt lonely any ive had good company whos been here dick pointed significantly to a jug thats the best company i know of he said but its most empty so youve brought along the gal he continued how did you get hold of her there was something in these questions which terrified ida it seemed to indicate a degree of complicity between these two which boded no good to her ill tell you the particulars by and by at the same time she began to take off her bonnet you aint going to stop are you asked ida startled aint goin to stop repeated the man called dick why shouldnt she stop id like to know aint she at home at home echoed ida apprehensively opening wide her eyes in astonishment yes ask her ida looked inquiringly at mrs hardwick you might as well take off your things said the latter grimly we aint going any further today and wheres the lady you said you were going to see the one that was interested in you yes well im the one she answered with a broad smile and a glance at dick i dont want to stay here said ida now frightened well what are you going to do about it will you take me back early tomorrow entreated ida no i dont intend to take you back at all ida seemed at first stupefied with astonishment and terror then actuated by a sudden desperate impulse she ran to the door and had got it partly open when the nurse sprang forward and seizing her by the arm pulled her violently back where are you going in such a hurry she demanded back to father and mother answered ida bursting into tears oh why did you bring me here ill tell you why answered dick jocularly you see ida we aint got any little girl to love us and so we got you but i dont love you and i never shall said ida indignantly now dont you go to saying that said dick youll break my heart you naughty girl and then peg will be a widow to give due effect to this pathetic speech dick drew out a tattered red handkerchief and made a great demonstration of wiping his eyes the whole scene was so ludicrous that ida despite her fears and disgust could not help laughing hysterically she recovered herself instantly and said imploringly oh do let me go and father will pay you you really think he would said dick in a tantalizing tone oh yes and youll tell her to take me back wont you no he wont tell me any such thing said peg gruffly so you may as well give up all thoughts of that first as last youre going to stay here so take off that bonnet of yours and say no more about it ida made no motion toward obeying this mandate then ill do it for you said peg she roughly untied the bonnet ida struggling vainly in opposition and taking this with the shawl carried them to a closet in which she placed them and then locking the door deliberately put the key in her pocket there said she grimly i guess youre safe for the present aint you ever going to carry me back some years hence i may possibly answered the woman coolly we want you here for the present besides youre not sure that they want you back not want me back again thats what i said how do you know but your father and mother sent you off on purpose theyve been troubled with you long enough and now theyve bound you apprentice to me till youre eighteen its a lie said ida firmly they didnt send me off and youre a wicked woman to tell me so hoitytoity said the woman is that the way you dare to speak to me have you anything more to say before i whip you yes answered ida goaded to desperation i shall complain of you to the police just as soon as i get a chance and they will put you in jail and send me home that is what i will do mrs hardwick was incensed and somewhat startled at these defiant words it was clear that ida was not going to be a meek submissive child whom they might illtreat without apprehension she was decidedly dangerous and her insubordination must be nipped in the bud she seized ida roughly by the arm and striding with her to the closet already spoken of unlocked it and rudely pushing her in locked the door after her stay there till you know how to behave she said how did you manage to come it over her family inquired dick his wife gave substantially the account with which the reader is already familiar pretty well done old woman exclaimed dick approvingly i always said you was a deep un i always says if peg cant find out how a thing is to be done then it cant be done nohow how about the counterfeit coin she asked were to be supplied with all we can put off and we are to have half for our trouble that is good when the girl ida gets a little tamed down well give her something to do is it safe wont she betray us well manage that or at least i will ill work on her fears so she wont any more dare to say a word about us than to cut her own head off all right peg i can trust you to do whats right ida sank down on the floor of the closet into which she had been thrust utter darkness was around her and a darkness as black seemed to hang over all her prospects of future happiness she had been snatched in a moment from parents or those whom she regarded as such and from a comfortable and happy though humble home to this dismal place in place of the kindness and indulgence to which she had been accustomed she was now treated with harshness and cruelty chapter xvii suspense it doesnt somehow seem natural said the cooper as he took his seat at the tea table to sit down without ida it seems as if half the family were gone just what ive said to myself twenty times today remarked his wife nobody can tell how much a child is to them till they lose it not lose it corrected jack i didnt mean to say that when you used that word mother it made me feel just as if ida wasnt coming back i dont know why it is said mrs harding thoughtfully but ive had that same feeling several times today ive felt just as if something or other would happen to prevent idas coming back that is only because shes never been away before said the cooper cheerfully it isnt best to borrow trouble martha we shall have enough of it without you never said a truer word brother said rachel mournfully man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward this world is a vale of tears and a home of misery folks may try and try to be happy but that isnt what theyre sent here for you never tried very hard aunt rachel said jack its my fate to be misjudged said his aunt with the air of a martyr i dont agree with you in your ideas about life rachel said her brother just as there are more pleasant than stormy days so i believe there is much more of brightness than shadow in this life of ours if we would only see it i cant see it said rachel it seems to me rachel you take more pains to look at the clouds than the sun yes chimed in jack ive noticed whenever aunt rachel takes up the newspaper she always looks first at the deaths and next at the fatal accidents and steamboat explosions if retorted rachel with severe emphasis you should ever be on board a steamboat when it exploded you wouldnt find much to laugh at yes i should said jack i should laugh what exclaimed rachel horrified on the other side of my mouth concluded jack you didnt wait till id finished the sentence i dont think it proper to make light of such serious matters nor i aunt rachel said jack drawing down the corners of his mouth i am willing to confess that this is a serious matter i should feel as they say the cow did that was thrown three hundred feet up into the air hows that inquired his mother rather discouraged answered jack all laughed except aunt rachel who preserved the same severe composure and continued to eat the pie upon her plate with the air of one gulping down medicine in the morning all felt more cheerful ida will be home tonight said mrs harding brightly what an age it seems since she went away whod think it was only twentyfour hours we shall know better how to appreciate her when we get her back said her husband what time do you expect her home mother what did mrs hardwick say why said mrs harding hesitating she didnt say as to the hour but i guess shell be along in the course of the afternoon if we only knew where she had gone we could tell better when to expect her but as we dont know said the cooper we must wait patiently till she comes i guess said mrs harding with the impulse of a notable housewife ill make some apple turnovers for supper tonight theres nothing ida likes so well thats where ida is right said jack smacking his lips apple turnovers are splendid they are very unwholesome remarked rachel i shouldnt think so from the way you eat them aunt rachel retorted jack you ate four the last time we had them for supper i didnt think youd begrudge me the little i eat said his aunt dolefully i didnt think you counted the mouthfuls i took come rachel dont be so unreasonable said her brother nobody begrudges you what you eat even if you choose to eat twice as much as you do i dare say jack ate more of the turnovers than you did i ate six said jack candidly rachel construing this into an apology said no more if it wasnt for you aunt rachel i should be in danger of getting too jolly perhaps and spilling over it always makes me sober to look at you its lucky theres something to make you sober and stiddy said his aunt you are too frivolous evening came but it did not bring ida an indefinable sense of apprehension oppressed the minds of all martha feared that idas mother finding her so attractive could not resist the temptation of keeping her i suppose she said that she has the best claim to her but it would be a terrible thing for us to part with her dont let us trouble ourselves about that said timothy it seems to me very natural that her mother should keep her a little longer than she intended think how long it is since she saw her besides it is not too late for her to return tonight at length there came a knock at the door i guess that is ida said mrs harding joyfully jack seized a candle and hastening to the door threw it open but there was no ida there in her place stood charlie fitts the boy who had met ida in the cars how are you charlie said jack trying not to look disappointed come in and tell us all the news well said charlie i dont know of any i suppose ida has got home no answered jack we expected her tonight but she hasnt come yet she told me she expected to come back today what have you seen her exclaimed all in chorus yes i saw her yesterday noon where why in the cars answered charlie what cars asked the cooper why the philadelphia cars of course you knew it was there she was going philadelphia exclaimed all in surprise yes the cars were almost there when i saw her who was that with her mrs hardwick her old nurse i didnt like her looks thats where we paddle in the same canoe said jack she didnt seem to want me to speak to ida continued charlie but hurried her off as quick as possible there were reasons for that said the cooper she wanted to keep her destination secret i dont know what it was said the boy but i dont like the womans looks chapter xviii how ida fared we left ida confined in a dark closet with peg standing guard over her after an hour she was released well said the nurse grimly how do you feel now i want to go home sobbed the child you are at home said the woman shall i never see father and mother and jack again that depends on how you behave yourself oh if you will only let me go pleaded ida gathering hope from this remark ill do anything you say do you mean this or do you only say it for the sake of getting away i mean just what i say dear good mrs hardwick tell me what to do and i will obey you cheerfully very well said peg only you neednt try to come it over me by calling me dear good mrs hardwick in the first place you dont care a cent about me in the second place i am not good and finally my name isnt mrs hardwick except in new york what is it then asked ida its just peg no more and no less you may call me aunt peg i would rather call you mrs hardwick then youll have a good many years to call me so youd better do as i tell you if you want any favors now what do you say yes aunt peg said ida with a strong effort to conceal her repugnance thats well now youre not to tell anybody that you came from new york that is very important and youre to pay your board by doing whatever i tell you if it isnt wicked do you suppose i would ask you to do anything wicked demanded peg frowning you said you wasnt good mildly suggested ida im good enough to take care of you well what do you say to that answer me yes theres another thing you aint to try to run away ida hung down her head ha exclaimed peg so youve been thinking of it have you yes answered ida boldly after a moments hesitation i did think i should if i got a good chance humph said the woman i see we must understand one another unless you promise this back you go into the dark closet and i shall keep you there ida shuddered at this fearful threat terrible to a child of but eight years do you promise yes said ida faintly for fear you might be tempted to break your promise i have something to show you mrs hardwick went to the closet and took down a large pistol there she said do you see that yes aunt peg do you know what it is for to shoot people with answered the child yes said the nurse i see you understand well now do you know what i would do if you should tell anybody where you came from or attempt to run away can you guess now would you shoot me asked ida terrorstricken yes i would said peg with fierce emphasis thats just what id do and whats more even if you got away and got back to your family in new york i would follow you and shoot you dead in the street you wouldnt be so wicked exclaimed ida wouldnt i though repeated peg significantly if you dont believe i would just try it do you think you would like to try it she asked fiercely no answered ida with a shudder well thats the most sensible thing youve said yet now that you are a little more reasonable ill tell you what i am going to do with you ida looked eagerly up into her face i am going to keep you with me for a year i want the services of a little girl for that time if you serve me faithfully i will then send you back to new york will you asked ida hopefully yes but you must mind and do what i tell you oh yes said ida joyfully this was so much better than she had been led to fear that the prospect of returning home at all even though she had to wait a year encouraged her what do you want me to do she asked you may take the broom and sweep the room yes aunt peg and then you may wash the dishes yes aunt peg and after that i will find something else for you to do mrs hardwick threw herself into a rockingchair and watched with grim satisfaction the little handmaiden as she moved quickly about i took the right course with her she said to herself she wont any more dare to run away than to chop her hands off she thinks ill shoot her and the unprincipled woman chuckled to herself ida heard her indistinctly and asked timidly did you speak aunt peg no i didnt just attend to your work and dont mind me did your mother make you work no i went to school time you learned ill make a smart woman of you the next morning ida was asked if she would like to go out into the street i am going to let you do a little shopping there are various things we want go and get your hat its in the closet said ida oh yes i put it there that was before i could trust you she went to the closet and returned with the childs hat and shawl as soon as the two were ready they emerged into the street this is a little better than being shut up in the closet isnt it asked her companion oh yes ever so much you see youll have a very good time of it if you do as i bid you i dont want to do you any harm so they walked along together until peg suddenly pausing laid her hands on idas arm and pointing to a shop near by said to her do you see that shop yes said ida i want you to go in and ask for a couple of rolls they come to three cents apiece heres some money to pay for them it is a new dollar you will give this to the man that stands behind the counter and he will give you back ninetyfour cents do you understand yes said ida nodding her head i think i do and if the man asks if you have anything smaller you will say no yes aunt peg i will stay just outside i want you to go in alone so you will learn to manage without me ida entered the shop the baker a pleasantlooking man stood behind the counter well my dear what is it he asked i should like a couple of rolls for your mother i suppose said the baker no answered ida for the woman i board with ha a dollar bill and a new one too said the baker as ida tendered it in payment i shall have to save that for my little girl ida left the shop with the two rolls and the silver change did he say anything about the money asked peg he said he should save it for his little girl good said the woman youve done well chapter xix bad money the baker introduced in the foregoing chapter was named harding singularly abel harding was a brother of timothy harding the cooper in many respects he resembled his brother he was an excellent man exemplary in all the relations of life and had a good heart he was in very comfortable circumstances having accumulated a little property by diligent attention to his business like his brother abel harding had married and had one child she had received the name of ellen when the baker closed his shop for the night he did not forget the new dollar which he had received or the disposal he told ida he would make of it ellen ran to meet her father as he entered the house what do you think i have brought you ellen he said with a smile do tell me quick said the child eagerly what if i should tell you it was a new dollar oh papa thank you and ellen ran to show it to her mother yes said the baker i received it from a little girl about the size of ellen and i suppose it was that that gave me the idea of bringing it home to her this was all that passed concerning ida at that time the thought of her would have passed from the bakers mind if it had not been recalled by circumstances ellen like most girls of her age when in possession of money could not be easy until she had spent it her mother advised her to deposit it in some savings bank but ellen preferred present gratification accordingly one afternoon when walking out with her mother she persuaded her to go into a toy shop and price a doll which she saw in the window the price was seventyfive cents ellen concluded to buy it and her mother tendered the dollar in payment the shopman took it in his hand glanced at it carelessly at first then scrutinized it with increased attention what is the matter inquired mrs harding it is good isnt it that is what i am doubtful of was the reply it is new and that is against it if it were old it would be more likely to be genuine but you wouldnt condemn a bill because it is new certainly not but the fact is there have been lately many cases where counterfeit bills have been passed and i suspect this is one of them however i can soon ascertain i wish you would said the bakers wife my husband took it at his shop and will be likely to take more unless he is put on his guard the shopman sent it to the bank where it was pronounced counterfeit mr harding was much surprised at his wifes story really he said i had no suspicion of this can it be possible that such a young and beautiful child could be guilty of such an offense perhaps not answered his wife she may be as innocent in the matter as ellen or myself i hope so said the baker it would be a pity that so young a child should be given to wickedness however i shall find out before long how she will undoubtedly come again sometime the baker watched daily for the coming of ida he waited some days in vain it was not pegs policy to send the child too often to the same place as that would increase the chances of detection one day however ida entered the shop as before goodmorning said the baker what will you have today you may give me a sheet of gingerbread sir the baker placed it in her hand how much will it be twelve cents ida offered him another new bill as if to make change he stepped from behind the counter and placed himself between ida and the door what is your name my child he asked ida sir ida but what is your other name ida hesitated a moment because peg had forbidden her to use the name of harding and had told her if ever the inquiry were made she must answer hardwick she answered reluctantly ida hardwick the baker observed her hesitation and this increased his suspicion hardwick he repeated musingly endeavoring to draw from the child as much information as possible before allowing her to perceive that he suspected her and where do you live ida was a child of spirit and did not understand why she should be questioned so closely she said with some impatience i am in a hurry sir and would like to have the change as soon as you can i have no doubt of it said the baker his manner suddenly changing but you cannot go just yet why not asked ida because you have been trying to deceive me i trying to deceive you exclaimed ida really thought mr harding she does it well but no doubt she is trained to it it is perfectly shocking such artful depravity in a child dont you remember buying something here a week ago he asked in as stern a tone as his good nature would allow him to employ yes answered ida promptly i bought two rolls at three cents apiece and what did you offer me in payment i handed you a dollar bill like this asked the baker holding up the one she had just offered him yes sir and do you mean to say demanded the baker sternly that you didnt know it was bad when you offered it to me bad gasped ida yes spurious not as good as blank paper indeed sir i didnt know anything about it said ida earnestly i hope youll believe me when i say that i thought it was good i dont know what to think said the baker perplexed who gave you the money the woman i board with of course i cant give you the gingerbread some men in my place would deliver you up to the police but i will let you go if you will make me one promise oh i will promise anything sir said ida you have given me a bad dollar will you promise to bring me a good one tomorrow ida made the required promise and was allowed to go chapter xx doubts and fears well what kept you so long asked peg impatiently as ida rejoined her at the corner of the street i thought you were going to stay all the forenoon and wheres your gingerbread he wouldnt let me have it answered ida and why wouldnt he let you have it said peg because he said the money wasnt good stuff and nonsense its good enough however its no matter well go somewhere else but he said the money i gave him last week wasnt good and i promised to bring him another tomorrow or he wouldnt have let me go well where are you going to get your dollar why wont you give it to me said the child catch me at such nonsense said mrs hardwick contemptuously i aint quite a fool but here we are at another shop go in and see if you can do any better there heres the money why its the same bill i gave you what if it is i dont want to pass bad money tut what hurt will it do its the same as stealing the man wont lose anything hell pass it off again somebodyll have to lose it by and by said ida so youve taken up preaching have you said peg sneeringly maybe you know better than i what is proper to do it wont do for you to be so mighty particular and so youll find out if you stay with me long where did you get the dollar asked ida and how is it you have so many of them none of your business you mustnt pry into the affairs of other people are you going to do as i told you she continued menacingly i cant answered ida pale but resolute you cant repeated peg furiously didnt you promise to do whatever i told you except what was wicked interposed ida and what business have you to decide what is wicked come home with me peg seized the childs hand and walked on in sullen silence occasionally turning to scowl upon ida who had been strong enough in her determination to do right to resist successfully the will of the woman whom she had so much reason to dread arrived at home peg walked ida into the room by the shoulder dick was lounging in a chair hillo said he lazily observing his wifes frowning face whats the gal been doin hey whats she been doing repeated peg i should like to know what she hasnt been doing shes refused to go in and buy gingerbread of the baker look here little gal said dick in a moralizing vein isnt this rayther undootiful conduct on your part aint it a piece of ingratitude when peg and i go to the trouble of earning the money to pay for gingerbread for you to eat that you aint even willin to go in and buy it i would just as lieve go in said ida if peg would give me good money to pay for it that dont make any difference said the admirable moralist its your dooty to do just as she tells you and youll do right shell take the risk i cant said the child you hear her said peg very improper conduct said dick shaking his head in grave reproval little gal im ashamed of you put her in the closet peg come along said peg harshly ill show you how i deal with those that dont obey me so ida was incarcerated once more in the dark closet yet in the midst of her desolation child as she was she was sustained and comforted by the thought that she was suffering for doing right when ida failed to return on the appointed day the hardings though disappointed did not think it strange if i were her mother said the coopers wife and had been parted from her for so long i should want to keep her as long as i could dear heart how pretty she is and how proud her mother must be of her its all a delusion said rachel shaking her head solemnly its all a delusion i dont believe shes got a mother at all that mrs hardwick is an impostor i know it and told you so at the time but you wouldnt believe me i never expect to set eyes on ida again in this world the next day passed and still no tidings of jacks ward her young guardian though not as gloomy as aunt rachel looked unusually serious there was a cloud of anxiety even upon the coopers usually placid face and he was more silent than usual at the evening meal at night after jack and his aunt had retired he said anxiously what do you think is the cause of idas prolonged absence martha i cant tell said his wife seriously it seems to me if her mother wanted to keep her longer it would be no more than right that she should drop us a line she must know that we would feel anxious perhaps she is so taken up with ida that she can think of no one else it may be so but if we neither see ida tomorrow nor hear from her i shall be seriously troubled suppose she should never come back suggested the cooper very soberly oh husband dont hint at such a thing said his wife we must contemplate it as a possibility said timothy gravely though not as i hope as a probability idas mother has an undoubted right to her then it would be better if she had never been placed in our charge said martha tearfully for we should not have had the pain of parting with her not so martha her husband said seriously we ought to be grateful for gods blessings even if he suffers us to retain them but a short time and ida has been a blessing to us all i am sure the memory of that cant be taken from us martha theres some lines i came across in the paper tonight that express just what ive been sayin let me find them the cooper put on his spectacles and hunted slowly down the columns of the daily paper till he came to these beautiful lines of tennyson which he read aloud i hold it true whateer befall i feel it when i sorrow most tis better to have loved and lost than never to have loved at all there wife he said as he laid down the paper i dont know who writ them lines but im sure its some one thats met with a great sorrow and conquered it they are beautiful said his wife after a pause and i dare say youre right timothy but i hope we maynt have to learn the truth of them by experience after all it isnt certain but that ida will come back at any rate said her husband there is no doubt that it is our duty to take every means that we can to recover ida of course if her mother insists upon keepin her we cant say anything but we ought to be sure of that before we yield her up what do you mean timothy asked martha i dont know as i ought to mention it said the cooper very likely there isnt anything in it and it would only make you feel more anxious you have already aroused my anxiety i should feel better if you would speak out then i will said the cooper i have sometimes been tempted he continued lowering his voice to doubt whether idas mother really sent for her how do you account for the letter then i have thought mind it is only a guess that mrs hardwick may have got somebody to write it for her it is very singular murmured martha what is singular why the very same thought has occurred to me somehow i cant help feeling a little distrustful of mrs hardwick though perhaps unjustly what object can she have in getting possession of the child that i cant conjecture but i have come to one determination what is that unless we learn something of ida within a week from the time she left here i shall go on to philadelphia or else send jack and endeavor to get track of her chapter xxi aunt rachels mishaps the week slipped away and still no tidings of ida the house seemed lonely without her not until then did they understand how largely she had entered into their life and thoughts but worse even than the sense of loss was the uncertainty as to her fate it is time that we took some steps about finding ida the cooper said i would like to go to philadelphia myself to make inquiries about her but i am just now engaged upon a job which i cannot very well leave and so i have concluded to send jack when shall i start exclaimed jack tomorrow morning answered his father what good do you think it will do interposed rachel to send a mere boy like jack to philadelphia a mere boy repeated her nephew indignantly a boy hardly sixteen years old continued rachel why hell need somebody to take care of him most likely youll have to go after him whats the use of provoking a fellow so aunt rachel said jack you know im most eighteen hardly sixteen why i might as well say youre hardly forty when we all know youre fifty fifty ejaculated the scandalized spinster its a base slander im only thirtyseven maybe im mistaken said jack carelessly i didnt know exactly how old you were i only judged from your looks at this point rachel applied a segment of a pocket handkerchief to her eyes but unfortunately owing to circumstances the effect instead of being pathetic as she intended it to be was simply ludicrous it so happened that a short time previous the inkstand had been partially spilled upon the table through jacks carelessness and this handkerchief had been used to sop it up it had been placed inadvertently upon the window seat where it had remained until rachel who was sitting beside the window called it into requisition the ink upon it was by no means dry the consequence was that when rachel removed it from her eyes her face was discovered to be covered with ink in streaks mingling with the tears that were falling for rachel always had a plentiful supply of tears at command the first intimation the luckless spinster had of her mishap was conveyed in a stentorian laugh from jack he looked intently at the dark traces of sorrow on his aunts face of which she was yet unconscious and doubling up went off into a perfect paroxysm of laughter jack said his mother reprovingly for she had not observed the cause of his amusement its improper for you to laugh at your aunt in such a rude manner oh i cant help it mother just look at her thus invited mrs harding did look and the rueful expression of rachel set off by the inky stains was so irresistibly comical that after a hard struggle she too gave way and followed jacks example astonished and indignant at this unexpected behavior of her sisterinlaw rachel burst into a fresh fit of weeping and again had recourse to the handkerchief this is too much she sobbed ive stayed here long enough if even my sisterinlaw as well as my own nephew from whom i expect nothing better makes me her laughingstock brother timothy i can no longer remain in your dwelling to be laughed at i will go to the poorhouse and end my miserable existence as a common pauper if i only receive christian burial when i leave the world it will be all i hope or expect from my relatives who will be glad enough to get rid of me the second application of the handkerchief had so increased the effect that jack found it impossible to check his laughter while the cooper whose attention was now drawn to his sisters face burst out in a similar manner this more amazed rachel than marthas merriment even you timothy join in ridiculing your sister she exclaimed in an et tu brute tone we dont mean to ridicule you rachel gasped her sisterinlaw but we cant help laughing at the prospect of my death uttered rachel in a tragic tone well im a poor forlorn creetur i know even my nearest relations make sport of me and when i speak of dying they shout their joy to my face yes gasped jack nearly choking thats it exactly it isnt your death were laughing at but your face my face exclaimed the insulted spinster one would think i was a fright by the way you laugh at it so you are said jack with a fresh burst of laughter to be called a fright to my face shrieked rachel by my own nephew this is too much timothy i leave your house forever the excited maiden seized her hood which was hanging from a nail and was about to leave the house when she was arrested in her progress toward the door by the cooper who stifled his laughter sufficiently to say before you go rachel just look in the glass mechanically his sister did look and her horrified eyes rested upon a face streaked with inky spots and lines seaming it in every direction in her first confusion rachel jumped to the conclusion that she had been suddenly stricken by the plague accordingly she began to wring her hands in an excess of terror and exclaimed in tones of piercing anguish it is the fatal plague spot i am marked for the tomb the sands of my life are fast running out this convulsed jack afresh with merriment so that an observer might not without reason have imagined him to be in imminent danger of suffocation youll kill me aunt rachel i know you will he gasped you may order my coffin timothy said rachel in a sepulchral voice i shant live twentyfour hours ive felt it coming on for a week past i forgive you for all your illtreatment i should like to have some one go for the doctor though i know im past help i think said the cooper trying to look sober you will find the coldwater treatment efficacious in removing the plague spots as you call them rachel turned toward him with a puzzled look then as her eyes rested for the first time upon the handkerchief she had used its appearance at once suggested a clew by which she was enabled to account for her own somewhat ashamed of the emotion which she had betrayed as well as the ridiculous figure which she had cut she left the room abruptly and did not make her appearance again till the next morning after this little episode the conversation turned upon jacks approaching journey i dont know said his mother but rachel is right perhaps jack isnt old enough and hasnt had sufficient experience to undertake such a mission now mother expostulated jack you aint going to side against me are you there is no better plan said his father quietly chapter xxii the flower girl henry bowen was a young artist of moderate talent who had abandoned the farm on which he had labored as a boy for the sake of pursuing his favorite profession he was not competent to achieve the highest success but he had good taste and a skillful hand and his productions were pleasing and popular he had formed a connection with a publisher of prints and engravings who had thrown considerable work in his way have you any new commission today inquired the young artist on the day before idas discovery that she had been employed to pass off spurious coin yes said the publisher i have thought of something which may prove attractive just at present pictures of children seem to be popular i should like to have you supply me with a sketch of a flower girl with say a basket of flowers in her hand do you comprehend my idea i believe i do answered the artist give me sufficient time and i hope to satisfy you the young artist went home and at once set to work upon the task he had undertaken he had conceived that it would be an easy one but found himself mistaken whether because his fancy was not sufficiently lively or his mind was not in tune he was unable to produce the effect he desired the faces which he successively outlined were all stiff and though beautiful in feature lacked the great charm of being expressive and lifelike what is the matter with me he exclaimed impatiently is it impossible for me to succeed its clear he decided that i am not in the vein i will go out and take a walk and perhaps while i am in the street something may strike me he accordingly donned his coat and hat and emerged into the great thoroughfare where he was soon lost in the throng it was only natural that as he walked with his task uppermost in his thoughts he should scrutinize carefully the faces of such young girls as he met perhaps it occurred to him i may get a hint from some face i see it is strange he mused how few there are even in the freshness of childhood that can be called models of beauty that child for example has beautiful eyes but a badly cut mouth here is one that would be pretty if the face were rounded out and here is a child heaven help it that was designed to be beautiful but want and unfavorable circumstances have pinched and cramped it it was at this point in the artists soliloquy that in turning the corner of a street he came upon peg and ida the artist looked earnestly at the childs face and his own lighted up with sudden pleasure as one who stumbles upon success just as he had begun to despair of it the very face i have been looking for he exclaimed to himself my flower girl is found at last he turned round and followed ida and her companion both stopped at a shop window to examine some articles which were on exhibition there it is precisely the face i want he murmured nothing could be more appropriate or charming with that face the success of the picture is assured the artists inference that peg was idas attendant was natural since the child was dressed in a style quite superior to her companion peg thought that this would enable her with less risk to pass spurious coin the young man followed the strangely assorted pair to the apartments which peg occupied from the conversation which he overheard he learned that he had been mistaken in his supposition as to the relation between the two and that singular as it seemed peg had the guardianship of the child this made his course clearer he mounted the stairs and knocked at the door what do you want demanded a sharp voice i should like to see you just a moment was the reply peg opened the door partially and regarded the young man suspiciously i dont know you she said shortly i presume not said the young man courteously we have never met i think i am an artist i hope you will pardon my present intrusion there is no use in your coming here said peg abruptly and you may as well go away i dont want to buy any pictures ive got plenty of better ways to spend my money than to throw it away on such trash no one would have thought of doubting pegs word for she looked far from being a patron of the arts you have a young girl living with you about seven or eight years old have you not inquired the artist peg instantly became suspicious who told you that she demanded quickly no one told me i saw her in the street peg at once conceived the idea that her visitor was aware of the fact that the child had been lured away from home possibly he might be acquainted with the coopers family or might be their emissary suppose you did see such a child on the street what has that to do with me but i saw the child entering this house with you what if you did demanded peg defiantly i was about said the artist perceiving that he was misapprehended i was about to make a proposition which may prove advantageous to both of us eh said peg catching at the hint tell me what it is and we may come to terms i must explain said bowen that i am an artist in seeking for a face to sketch from i have been struck by that of your child of ida yes if that is her name i will pay you five dollars if you will allow me to copy her face well she said more graciously if thats all you want i dont know as i have any objections i suppose you can copy her face here as well as anywhere i should prefer to have her come to my studio i shant let her come said peg decidedly then i will consent to your terms and come here do you want to begin now i should like to do so come in then here ida i want you yes peg this gentleman wants to copy your face ida looked surprised i am an artist said the young man with a reassuring smile i will endeavor not to try your patience too much or keep you too long do you think you can stand still for half an hour without too much fatigue he kept her in pleasant conversation while with a free bold hand he sketched the outlines of her face i shall want one more sitting he said i will come tomorrow at this time stop a minute said peg i should like the money in advance how do i know you will come again certainly if you desire it said henry bowen what strange fortune he thought can have brought them together surely there can be no relation between this sweet child and that ugly old woman the next day he returned and completed his sketch which was at once placed in the hands of the publisher eliciting his warm approval chapter xxiii jack obtains information jack set out with that lightness of heart and keen sense of enjoyment that seem natural to a young man of eighteen on his first journey partly by boat partly by cars he traveled till in a few hours he was discharged with hundreds of others at the depot in philadelphia he rejected all invitations to ride and strode on carpetbag in hand though sooth to say he had very little idea whether he was steering in the right direction for his uncles shop by dint of diligent and persevering inquiry he found it at last and walking in announced himself to the worthy baker as his nephew jack what are you jack exclaimed mr abel harding pausing in his labor well i never should have known you thats a fact bless me how youve grown why youre most as big as your father aint you only half an inch shorter answered jack complacently and youre let me see how old are you eighteen that is almost i shall be in two months well im glad to see you jack though i hadnt the least idea of your raining down so unexpectedly hows your father and mother and your adopted sister father and mother are pretty well answered jack and so is aunt rachel he continued smiling though she aint so cheerful as she might be poor rachel said abel smiling also everything goes contrary with her i dont suppose shes wholly to blame for it folks differ constitutionally some are always looking on the bright side of things and others can never see but one side and thats the dark one youve hit it uncle said jack laughing aunt rachel always looks as if she was attending a funeral so she is my boy said abel gravely and a sad funeral it is i dont understand you uncle the funeral of her affections thats what i mean perhaps you maynt know that rachel was in early life engaged to be married to a young man whom she ardently loved she was a different woman then from what she is now but her lover deserted her just before the wedding was to have come off and shes never got over the disappointment but that isnt what i was going to talk about you havent told me about your adopted sister thats the very thing ive come to philadelphia about said jack soberly ida has been carried off and ive come in search of her been carried off i didnt know such things ever happened in this country what do you mean jack told the story of mrs hardwicks arrival with a letter from idas mother conveying the request that her child might under the guidance of the messenger be allowed to pay her a visit to this and the subsequent details abel harding listened with earnest attention so you have reason to think the child is in philadelphia he said musingly yes said jack ida was seen in the cars coming here by a boy who knew her in new york ida repeated the baker was that her name yes you knew her name didnt you i dare say i have known it but i have heard so little of your family lately that i had forgotten it it is rather a singular circumstance what is a singular circumstance i will tell you jack it may not amount to anything however a few days since a little girl came into my shop to buy a small amount of bread i was at once favorably impressed with her appearance she was neatly dressed and had a very honest face having made the purchase she handed me in payment a new dollar bill ill keep that for my little girl thought i at once accordingly when i went home at night i just took the dollar out of the till and gave it to her of course she was delighted with it and like a child wanted to spend it at once so her mother agreed to go out with her the next day well they selected some knickknack or other but when they came to pay for it the dollar proved counterfeit counterfeit yes bad issued by a gang of counterfeiters when they told me of this i said to myself can it be that this little girl knew what she was about when she offered me that i couldnt think it possible but decided to wait till she came again did she come again yes only day before yesterday as i expected she offered me in payment another dollar just like the other before letting her know that i had discovered the imposition i asked her one or two questions with the idea of finding out as much as possible about her when i told her the bill was a bad one she seemed very much surprised it might have been all acting but i didnt think so then i even felt pity for her and let her go on condition that she would bring me back a good dollar in place of the bad one the next day i suppose i was a fool for doing so but she looked so pretty and innocent that i couldnt make up my mind to speak or act harshly to her but i am afraid that i was deceived and that she was an artful character after all then she didnt come back with the good money no i havent seen her since what name did she give you havent i told you it was the name that made me think of telling you she called herself ida hardwick ida hardwick repeated jack yes ida hardwick but that hasnt anything to do with your ida has it hasnt it though said jack why mrs hardwick was the woman who carried her away mrs hardwick her mother no not her mother she said she was the woman who took care of ida before she was brought to us then you think this ida hardwick may be your missing sister thats what i dont know yet said jack if you would only describe her uncle abel i could tell better well said the baker thoughtfully i should say this little girl was seven or eight years old yes said jack nodding what color were her eyes blue so are idas a small mouth with a very sweet expression yet with something firm and decided about it yes and i believe her dress was a light one with a blue ribbon round the waist did she wear anything around her neck a brown scarf if i remember rightly that is the way ida was dressed when she went away with mrs hardwick i am sure it must be she but how strange that she should come into your shop perhaps suggested his uncle this woman representing herself as idas nurse was her mother no it cant be said jack vehemently what that ugly disagreeable woman idas mother i wont believe it i should just as soon expect to see strawberries growing on a thorn bush you know i have not seen mrs hardwick no great loss said jack you wouldnt care much about seeing her again she is a tall gaunt disagreeable woman while ida is fair and sweetlooking idas mother whoever she is i am sure is a lady in appearance and manners and mrs hardwick is neither aunt rachel was right for once what did rachel say she said the nurse was an impostor and declared it was only a plot to get possession of ida but then that was to be expected of aunt rachel still it seems difficult to imagine any satisfactory motive on the part of the woman supposing her not to be idas mother mother or not returned jack shes got possession of ida and from all that you say she is not the best person to bring her up i am determined to rescue ida from this shedragon will you help me uncle you may count upon me jack for all i can do then said jack with energy we shall succeed i feel sure of it where theres a will theres a way i wish you success jack but if the people who have got ida are counterfeiters they are desperate characters and you must proceed cautiously i aint afraid of them im on the warpath now uncle abel and theyd better look out for me chapter xxiv jacks discovery the first thing to be done by jack was of course in some way to obtain a clew to the whereabouts of peg or mrs hardwick to use the name by which he knew her no mode of proceeding likely to secure this result occurred to him beyond the very obvious one of keeping in the street as much as possible in the hope that chance might bring him face to face with the object of his pursuit following out this plan jack became a daily promenader in chestnut walnut and other leading thoroughfares jack became himself an object of attention on account of what appeared to be his singular behavior it was observed that he had no glances to spare for young ladies but persistently stared at the faces of all middleaged women a circumstance naturally calculated to attract remark in the case of a wellmade lad like jack i am afraid said the baker it will be as hard as looking for a needle in a haystack to find the one you seek among so many faces theres nothing like trying said jack courageously im not going to give up yet a while id know ida or mrs hardwick anywhere you ought to write home jack they will be getting anxious about you im going to write this morning i put it off because i hoped to have some news to write he sat down and wrote the following note dear parents i arrived in philadelphia right side up with care and am stopping at uncle abels he received me very kindly i have got track of ida though i have not found her yet i have learned as much as this that this mrs hardwick who is a doubledistilled sherascal probably has ida in her clutches and has sent her on two occasions to my uncles i am spending most of my time in the streets keeping a good lookout for her if i do meet her see if i dont get ida away from her but it may take some time dont get discouraged therefore but wait patiently whenever anything new turns up you will receive a line from your dutiful son jack jack had been in the city eight days when as he was sauntering along the street he suddenly perceived in front of him a shawl which struck him as wonderfully like the one worn by mrs hardwick not only that but the form of the wearer corresponded to his recollections of the nurse he bounded forward and rapidly passing the suspected person turned suddenly and confronted the woman of whom he had been in search the recognition was mutual peg was taken aback by this unexpected encounter her first impulse was to make off but jacks resolute expression warned her that he was not to be trifled with mrs hardwick exclaimed jack you are right said she rapidly recovering her composure and you if i am not mistaken are john harding the son of my worthy friends in new york well ejaculated jack internally shes a cool un and no mistake my name is jack he said aloud did you leave all well at home asked peg you cant guess what i came here for said jack to see your sister ida i presume yes answered jack amazed at the womans composure i thought some of you would be coming on continued peg who had already mapped out her course you did yes it was only natural what did your father and mother say to the letter i wrote them the letter you wrote them exclaimed jack certainly you got it didnt you i dont know what letter you mean a letter in which i wrote that idas mother had been so pleased with the appearance and manners of the child that she could not determine to part with her you dont mean to say that any such letter as that has been written said jack incredulously what has it not been received inquired peg nothing like it when was it written the second day after our arrival said peg if that is the case said jack not knowing what to think it must have miscarried we never received it that is a pity how anxious you all must have felt it seems as if half the family were gone but how long does idas mother mean to keep her perhaps six months but said jack his suspicions returning i have been told that ida has twice called at a bakers shop in this city and when asked what her name was answered ida hardwick you dont mean to say that you pretend to be her mother yes i do replied peg calmly i didnt mean to tell you but as youve found out i wont deny it its a lie said jack she isnt your daughter young man said peg with wonderful selfcommand you are exciting yourself to no purpose you asked me if i pretended to be her mother i do pretend but i admit frankly that it is all pretense i dont understand what you mean said jack then i will explain to you though you have treated me so impolitely that i might well refuse as i informed your father and mother in new york there are circumstances which stand in the way of idas real mother recognizing her as her own child still as she desires her company in order to avert suspicion and prevent embarrassing questions being asked while she remains in philadelphia she is to pass as my daughter this explanation was tolerably plausible and jack was unable to gainsay it can i see ida he asked to his great joy peg replied i dont think there can be any objection i am going to the house now will you come with me now or appoint some other time now by all means said jack eagerly nothing shall stand in the way of my seeing ida a grim smile passed over pegs face follow me then she said i have no doubt ida will be delighted to see you i suppose said jack with a pang that she is so taken up with her new friends that she has nearly forgotten her old friends in new york if she had answered peg she would not deserve to have friends at all she is quite happy here but she will be very glad to return to new york to those who have been so kind to her really thought jack i dont know what to make of this mrs hardwick she talks fair enough though looks are against her perhaps i have misjudged her chapter xxv caught in a trap jack and his guide paused in front of a large threestory brick building the woman rang the bell an untidy servant girl made her appearance mrs hardwick spoke to the servant in so low a voice that jack couldnt hear what she said certainly mum answered the servant and led the way upstairs to a back room on the third floor go in and take a seat she said to jack i will send ida to you immediately all right said jack in a tone of satisfaction peg went out closing the door after her she at the same time softly slipped a bolt which had been placed upon the outside then hastening downstairs she found the proprietor of the house a little old man with a shrewd twinkling eye and a long aquiline nose i have brought you a boarder she said who is it a lad who is likely to interfere in our plans you may keep him in confinement for the present very good is he likely to make a fuss i should think it very likely he is highspirited and impetuous but you know how to manage him oh yes nodded the old man you can think of some pretext for keeping him suppose i tell him hes in a madhouse said the old man laughing and thereby showing some yellow fangs which by no means improved his appearance just the thing itll frighten him there was a little further conversation in a low tone and then peg went away fairly trapped my young bird she thought to herself i think that will put a stop to your troublesome appearance for the present meanwhile jack wholly unsuspicious that any trick had been played upon him seated himself in a rockingchair and waited impatiently for the coming of ida whom he was resolved to carry back to new york impelled by a natural curiosity he examined attentively the room in which he was seated there was a plain carpet on the floor and the other furniture was that of an ordinary bed chamber the most conspicuous ornament was a large fulllength portrait against the side of the wall it represented an unknown man not particularly striking in his appearance there was besides a small table with two or three books upon it jack waited patiently for twenty minutes perhaps ida may be out he reflected still even if she is mrs hardwick ought to come and let me know its dull work staying here alone another fifteen minutes passed and still no ida appeared this is rather singular thought jack she cant have told ida i am here or i am sure she would rush up at once to see her brother jack at length tired of waiting jack walked to the door and attempted to open it there was a greater resistance than he anticipated good heavens thought jack in consternation as the real state of the case flashed upon him is it possible that i am locked in he employed all his strength but the door still resisted he could no longer doubt that it was locked he rushed to the windows they were two in number and looked out upon a yard in the rear of the house there was no hope of drawing the attention of passersby to his situation confounded by this discovery jack sank into his chair in no very enviable state of mind well thought he this is a pretty situation for me to be in i wonder what father would say if he knew that i had managed to get locked up like this i am ashamed to think i let that treacherous woman mrs hardwick lead me so quietly into a snare aunt rachel was about right when she said i wasnt fit to come alone i hope shell never find out about this adventure of mine if she did i should never hear the last of it chapter xxvi dr robinson time passed every hour seemed to poor jack to contain at least double the number of minutes moreover he was getting hungry a horrible suspicion flashed across his mind the wretches cant mean to starve me can they he asked himself despite his constitutional courage he could not help shuddering at the idea he was unexpectedly answered by the opening of the door and the appearance of the old man are you getting hungry my dear sir he inquired with a disagreeable smile upon his features why am i confined here demanded jack angrily why are you confined really one would think you didnt find your quarters comfortable i am so far from finding them agreeable that i insist upon leaving them immediately returned jack then all you have got to do is to walk through that door you have locked it why so i have said the old man with a leer i insist upon your opening it i shall do so when i get ready to go out myself i shall go with you i think not whos to prevent me said jack defiantly whos to prevent you yes youd better not attempt it i should be sorry to hurt you but i mean to go out if you attempt to stop me you must take the consequences i am afraid you are a violent young man but ive got a man who is a match for two like you the old man opened the door samuel show yourself he said a brawny negro six feet in height and evidently very powerful came to the entrance if this young man attempts to escape samuel what will you do tie him hand and foot answered the negro thatll do samuel stay where you are he closed the door and looked triumphantly at our hero jack threw himself sullenly into a chair where is the woman that brought me here he asked peg oh she couldnt stay she had important business to transact my young friend and so she has gone she commended you to our particular attention and you will be just as well treated as if she were here this assurance was not calculated to comfort jack how long are you going to keep me cooped up here he asked desperately wishing to learn the worst at once really my young friend i couldnt say i dont know how long it will be before you are cured cured repeated jack puzzled the old man tapped his forehead youre a little affected here you know but under my treatment i hope soon to restore you to your friends what ejaculated our hero terrorstricken you dont mean to say you think im crazy to be sure you are said the old man but but i tell you its a lie exclaimed jack energetically who told you so your aunt my aunt yes mrs hardwick she brought you here to be treated for insanity its a base lie said jack hotly that woman is no more my aunt than you are shes an impostor she carried off my sister ida and this is only a plot to get rid of me she told me she was going to take me to see ida the old man shrugged his shoulders my young friend he said she told me all about it that you had a delusion about some supposed sister whom you accused her of carrying off this is outrageous said jack hotly thats what all my patients say and you are a maddoctor yes then you know by my looks that i am not crazy pardon me my young friend that doesnt follow there is a peculiar appearance about your eyes which i cannot mistake theres no mistake about it my good sir your mind has gone astray but if youll be quiet and wont excite yourself youll soon be well how soon well two or three months two or three months you dont mean to say you want to confine me here two or three months i hope i can release you sooner you cant understand your business very well or you would see at once that i am not insane thats what all my patients say they wont any of them own that their minds are affected will you supply me with some writing materials yes samuel shall bring them here i suppose you will excuse my suggesting also that it is dinner time he shall bring you some dinner at the same time the old man retired but in fifteen minutes a plate of meat and vegetables was brought to the room ill bring the pen and ink afterward said the negro in spite of his extraordinary situation and uncertain prospects jack ate with his usual appetite then he penned a letter to his uncle briefly detailing the circumstances of his present situation i am afraid the letter concluded that while i am shut up here mrs hardwick will carry ida out of the city where it will be more difficult for us to get on her track she is evidently a dangerous woman two days passed and no notice was taken of the letter chapter xxvii jack begins to realize his situation its very strange thought jack that uncle abel doesnt take any notice of my letter in fact our hero felt rather indignant as well as surprised and on the next visit of dr robinson he asked hasnt my uncle been here to ask about me yes said the old man unexpectedly why didnt you bring him up here to see me he just inquired how you were and said he thought you were better off with us than you would be at home jack looked fixedly in the face of the pretended doctor and was convinced that he had been deceived i dont believe it he said oh do as you like about believing it i dont believe you mailed my letter to my uncle have it your own way my young friend of course i cant argue with a maniac dont call me a maniac you old humbug you ought to be in jail for this outrage ho ho how very amusing you are my young friend said the old man youd make a firstclass tragedian you really would i might do something tragic if i had a weapon said jack significantly are you going to let me out positively i cant part with you you are too good company said dr robinson mockingly youll thank me for my care of you when you are quite cured thats all rubbish said jack boldly im no more crazy than you are and you know it will you answer me a question it depends on what it is said the old man cautiously has mrs hardwick been here to ask about me certainly she takes a great deal of interest in you was there a little girl with her i believe so i really dont remember if she calls again either with or without ida will you ask her to come up here i want to see her yes ill tell her now my young friend i must really leave you business before pleasure you know jack looked about the room for something to read he found among other books a small volume purporting to contain the adventures of baron trenck it may be that the reader has never encountered a copy of this singular book baron trenck was several times imprisoned for political offenses and this book contains an account of the manner in which he succeeded after years of labor in escaping from his dungeon jack read the book with intense interest and wondered looking about the room if he could not find some similar plan of escape chapter xxviii the secret staircase the prospect certainly was not a bright one the door was fast locked escape from the windows seemed impracticable this apparently exhausted the avenues of escape that were open to the dissatisfied prisoner but accidentally jack made an important discovery there was a fulllength portrait in the room jack chanced to rest his hand against it when he must unconsciously have touched some secret spring for a secret door opened dividing the picture in two parts and to our heros unbounded astonishment he saw before him a small spiral staircase leading down into the darkness this is a queer old house thought jack i wonder where those stairs go to ive a great mind to explore there was not much chance of detection he reflected as it would be three hours before his next meal would be brought him he left the door open therefore and began slowly and cautiously to go down the staircase it seemed a long one longer than was necessary to connect two floors boldly jack kept on till he reached the bottom where am i thought our hero i must be down as low as the cellar while this thought passed through his mind voices suddenly struck upon his ear he had accustomed himself now to the darkness and ascertained that there was a crevice through which he could look in the direction from which the sounds proceeded applying his eye he could distinguish a small cellar apartment in the middle of which was a printing press and work was evidently going on he could distinguish three persons two were in their shirt sleeves bending over an engravers bench beside them and apparently superintending their work was the old man whom jack knew as dr robinson he applied his ear to the crevice and heard these words this lot is rather better than the last jones we cant be too careful or the detectives will interfere with our business some of the last lot were rather coarse i know it sir answered the man addressed as jones theres nothing the matter with this said the old man there isnt one person in a hundred that would suspect it was not genuine jack pricked up his ears looking through the crevice he ascertained that it was a bill that the old man had in his hand theyre counterfeiters he said half audibly low as the tone was it startled dr robinson ha said he startled whats that whats what sir said jones i thought i heard some one speaking i didnt hear nothing sir did you hear nothing ferguson no sir i suppose i was deceived then said the old man how many bills have you there he resumed seventynine sir thats a very good days work said the old man in a tone of satisfaction its a paying business it pays you sir said jones grumbling and it shall pay you too my man never fear jack had made a great discovery he understood now the connection between mrs hardwick and the old man whom he now knew not to be a physician he was at the head of a gang of counterfeiters and she was engaged in putting the false money into circulation he softly ascended the staircase and reentered the room he left closing the secret door behind him chapter xxix jack is detected in the course of the afternoon jack made another visit to the foot of the staircase he saw through the crevice the same two men at work but the old man was not with them ascertaining this he ought in prudence immediately to have retraced his steps but he remained on watch for twenty minutes when he did return he was startled by finding the old man seated and waiting for him there was a menacing expression on his face where have you been he demanded abruptly downstairs answered jack ha what did you see i may as well own up thought jack through a crack i saw some men at work in a basement room he replied do you know what they were doing counterfeiting i should think well is there anything wrong in that i suppose you wouldnt want to be found out he answered i didnt mean to have you make this discovery now theres only one thing to be done whats that you have become possessed of an important i may say a dangerous secret you have us in your power i suppose said jack you are afraid i will denounce you to the police well there is a possibility of that that class of people has a prejudice against us though we are only doing what everybody likes to do making money will you let me go if i keep your secret what assurance have we that you would keep your promise i would pledge my word your word foley for this was the old mans real name snapped his fingers i wouldnt give that for it that is not sufficient what will be you must become one of us one of you yes you must make yourself liable to the same penalties so that it will be for your own interest to remain silent otherwise we cant trust you suppose i decline these terms then i shall be under the painful necessity of retaining you as my guest said foley smiling disagreeably what made you pretend to be a maddoctor to put you off the track said foley you believed it didnt you at first well what do you say asked foley i should like to take time to reflect upon your proposal said jack it is of so important a character that i dont like to decide at once how long do you require two days suppose i join you shall i get good pay excellent answered foley in fact youll be better paid than a boy of your age would be anywhere else thats worth thinking about said jack gravely my father is poor and ive got my own way to make you couldnt have a better opening youre a smart lad and will be sure to succeed well ill think of it if i should make up my mind before the end of two days i will let you know very well you cant do better but theres one thing i want to ask about said jack with pretended anxiety its pretty risky business isnt it ive been in the business ten years and they havent got hold of me yet answered foley all youve got to do is to be careful hell join said foley to himself hes a smart fellow and we can make him useful itll be the best way to dispose of one who might get us into trouble chapter xxx jacks triumph the next day jack had another visit from foley well said the old man nodding have you thought over my proposal what should i have to do asked jack sometimes one thing and sometimes another at first we might employ you to put off some of the bills that would be easy work anyway said jack yes there is nothing hard about that except to look innocent i can do that said jack laughing youre smart i can tell by the looks of you do you really think so returned jack appearing flattered yes youll make one of our best hands i suppose mrs hardwick is in your employ perhaps she is and perhaps she isnt said foley noncommittally that is something you dont need to know oh i dont care to know said jack carelessly i only asked i was afraid you would set me to work down in the cellar you dont know enough about the business we need skilled workmen you couldnt do us any good there i shouldnt like it anyway it must be unpleasant to be down there we pay the workmen you saw good pay yes i suppose so when do you want me to begin i cant tell you just yet ill think about it i hope itll be soon for im tired of staying here by the way thats a capital idea about the secret staircase whod ever think the portrait concealed it said jack as he spoke he advanced to the portrait in an easy natural manner and touched the spring of course it flew open the old man also drew near that was my idea he said in a complacent tone of course we have to keep everything as secret as possible and i flatter myself his remark came to a sudden pause he had incautiously got between jack and the open door now our hero who was close upon eighteen and strongly built was considerably more than a match in physical strength for foley he suddenly seized the old man thrust him through the aperture then closed the secret door and sprang for the door of the room the key was in the lock where foley whose confidence made him careless had left it turning it he hurried downstairs meeting no one on the way to open the front door and dash through it was the work of an instant as he descended the stairs he could hear the muffled shout of the old man whom he had made prisoner but this only caused him to accelerate his speed jack now directed his course as well as he could toward his uncles shop one thing however he did not forget and that was to note carefully the position of the shop in which he had been confined i shall want to make another visit there he reflected meantime as may well be supposed abel harding had suffered great anxiety on account of jacks protracted absence several days had elapsed and still he was missing i am afraid something has happened to jack he remarked to his wife on the afternoon of jacks escape i think jack was probably rash and imprudent and i fear poor boy he may have come to harm he may be confined by the parties who have taken his sister it is possible that it is no worse at all events i dont think it right to keep it from timothy any longer ive put off writing as long as i could hoping jack would come back but i dont feel as if it would be right to hold it back any longer i shall write this evening better wait till morning abel who knows but we may hear from jack before that time if wed been going to hear wed have heard before this he said just at that moment the door was flung open why its jack exclaimed the baker amazed i should say it was returned jack aunt have you got anything to eat im most famished where in the name of wonder have you been jack ive been shut up uncle boarded and lodged for nothing by some people who liked my company better than i liked theirs but ive just made my escape and here i am well hearty and hungry jacks appetite was soon provided for he found time between the mouthfuls to describe the secret staircase and his discovery of the unlawful occupation of the man who acted as his jailer the baker listened with eager interest jack said he youve done a good stroke of business in getting away said jack no in ferreting out these counterfeiters do you know there is a reward of a thousand dollars offered for their apprehension you dont say so exclaimed jack laying down his knife and fork do you think i can get it youd better try the gang has managed matters so shrewdly that the authorities have been unable to get any clew to their whereabouts can you go to the house yes i took particular notice of its location thats lucky now if you take my advice youll inform the authorities before they have time to get away ill do it said jack come along uncle fifteen minutes later jack was imparting his information to the chief of police it was received with visible interest and excitement i will detail a squad of men to go with you said the chief go at once no time is to be lost in less than an hour from the time jack left the haunt of the coiners an authoritative knock was heard at the door it was answered by foley the old man turned pale as he set eyes on jack and the police and comprehended the object of the visit what do you want gentlemen he asked is that the man asked the sergeant of jack yes secure him i know him said foley with a glance of hatred directed at jack hes a thief hes been in my employ but hes run away with fifty dollars belonging to me i dont care about stealing the kind of money you deal in said jack coolly its all a lie this man tells you why do you arrest me said foley its an outrage you have no right to enter my house like this what is your business demanded the police sergeant im a physician if you are telling the truth no harm will be done you meanwhile we must search your house where is that secret staircase ill show you answered jack he showed the way upstairs how did you get out he asked foley as he touched the spring and the secret door flew open curse you exclaimed foley darting a look of hatred and malignity at him i wish i had you in my power once more i treated you too well we need not follow the police in their search the discoveries which they made were ample to secure the conviction of the gang who made this house the place of their operations to anticipate a little we may say that foley was sentenced to imprisonment for a term of years and his subordinates to a term less prolonged the reader will also be glad to know that to our hero was awarded the prize of a thousand dollars which had been offered for the apprehension of the gang of counterfeiters but there was another notable capture made that day mrs hardwick was accustomed to make visits to foley to secure false bills and to make settlement for what she had succeeded in passing off while jack and the officers were in the house she rang the door bell jack went to the door how is this she asked oh said jack its all right come in ive gone into the business too mrs hardwick entered no sooner was she inside than jack closed the door what are you doing she demanded suspiciously let me out but jack was standing with his back to the door the door to the right opened and a policeman appeared arrest this woman said jack shes one of them i suppose i must yield said peg sulkily but you shant be a gainer by it she continued addressing jack where is ida asked our hero anxiously she is safe said peg sententiously you wont tell me where she is no why should i i suppose i am indebted to you for this arrest she shall be kept out of your way as long as i have power to do so then i shall find her said jack she is somewhere in the city and ill find her sooner or later peg was not one to betray her feelings but this arrest was a great disappointment to her it interfered with a plan she had of making a large sum out of ida to understand what this was we must go back a day or two and introduce a new character chapter xxxi mr john somerville jacks appearance on the scene had set mrs hardwick to thinking this was the substance of her reflections ida whom she had kidnaped for certain reasons of her own was likely to prove an incumbrance rather than a source of profit the child her suspicions awakened in regard to the character of the money she had been employed to pass off was no longer available for that purpose under these circumstances peg bethought herself of the ultimate object which she had proposed to herself in kidnaping ida that of extorting money from a man who has not hitherto figured in our story john somerville occupied a suite of apartments in a handsome lodging house in walnut street a man wanting yet several years of forty he looked many years older than that age late hours and dissipated habits though kept within respectable limits left their traces on his face at twentyone he inherited a considerable fortune which combined with some professional income for he was a lawyer and not without ability was quite sufficient to support him handsomely and leave a considerable surplus every year but latterly he had contracted a passion for gaming and shrewd though he might be naturally he could hardly be expected to prove a match for the wily habitues of the gaming table who had marked him for their prey the evening before his introduction to the reader he had passed till a late hour at a fashionable gaming house where he had lost heavily his reflections on waking were not the most pleasant for the first time within fifteen years he realized the folly and imprudence of the course he had pursued the evening previous he had lost a thousand dollars for which he had given his iou where to raise the money he did not know after making his toilet he rang the bell and ordered breakfast for this he had but scanty appetite he drank a cup of coffee and ate part of a roll scarcely had he finished and directed the removal of the dishes than the servant entered to announce a visitor is it a gentleman he inquired hastily fearing that it might be a creditor he occasionally had such visitors no sir a lady no sir a child but what could a child want of me no sir it isnt a child said the servant in reply then if its neither a gentleman lady nor child said somerville will you have the goodness to inform me what sort of a being it is its a woman sir answered the servant his gravity unmoved why didnt you say so when i asked you because you asked me if it was a lady and this isnt leastways she dont look like one you can send her up whoever she is said somerville a moment afterward peg entered his presence john somerville looked at her without much interest supposing that she might be a seamstress or laundress or some applicant for charity so many years had passed since he had met with this woman that she had passed out of his remembrance do you wish to see me about anything he asked you must be quick for i am just going out you dont seem to recognize me mr somerville i cant say i do he replied carelessly perhaps you used to wash for me once i am not in the habit of acting as laundress said the woman proudly in that case said somerville languidly you will have to tell me who you are for it is quite out of my power to remember all the people i meet perhaps the name of ida will assist your recollection or have you forgotten that name too ida repeated john somerville throwing off his indifferent manner and surveying the womans features attentively yes i have known several persons of that name he said recovering his former indifferent manner i havent the slightest idea to which of them you refer you dont look as if it was your name he added with a laugh the ida i mean was and is a child she said but theres no use in beating about the bush mr somerville when i can come straight to the point it is now about seven years since my husband and myself were employed to carry off a child a female child of a year old named ida you were the man who employed us she said this deliberately looking steadily in his face we placed it according to your directions on the doorstep of a poor family in new york and they have since cared for it as their own i suppose you have not forgotten that i remember it he said and now recall your features how have you fared since i employed you have you found your business profitable far from it answered peg i am not yet able to retire on a competence one of your youthful appearance said somerville banteringly ought not to think of retiring under ten years i dont care for compliments she said even when they are sincere as for my youthful appearance i am old enough to have reached the age of discretion and not so old as to have fallen into my second childhood compliments aside then will you proceed to whatever business brought you here i want a thousand dollars said peg abruptly a thousand dollars repeated somerville very likely i should like that amount myself did you come here to tell me that i have come here to ask you to give me that amount have you a husband yes then let me suggest that your husband is the proper person to apply to in such a case i think i am more likely to get it out of you said peg coolly my husband couldnt supply me with a thousand cents even if he were willing much as i am flattered by your application said somerville with a polite sneer since it would seem to place me next in estimation to your husband i cannot help suggesting that it is not usual to bestow such a sum on a stranger or even a friend without an equivalent rendered i am ready to give you an equivalent of what nature i am willing to be silent and how can your silence benefit me that you will be best able to estimate explain yourself and bear in mind that i can bestow little time on you i can do that in a few words you employed me to kidnap a child i believe the law has something to say about that at any rate the childs mother may have what do you know about the childs mother demanded somerville hastily all about her said peg emphatically how am i to credit that it is easy to claim a knowledge you do not possess shall i tell you the whole story then in the first place she married your cousin after rejecting you you never forgave her for this when a year after marriage her husband died you renewed your proposals they were rejected and you were forbidden to renew the subject on pain of forfeiting her friendship forever you left her presence determined to be revenged with this object you sought dick and myself and employed us to kidnap the child there is the whole story briefly told woman how came this within your knowledge he demanded hoarsely that is of no consequence said peg it was for my interest to find out and i did so well i know one thing more the residence of the childs mother i hesitated this morning whether to come here or to carry ida to her mother trusting to her to repay from gratitude what i demand from you because it is for your interest to comply with my request you speak of carrying the child to her mother how can you do that when she is in new york you are mistaken said peg coolly she is in philadelphia john somerville paced the room with hurried steps peg felt that she had succeeded he paused after a while and stood before her you demand a thousand dollars he said i do i have not that amount with me i have recently lost a heavy sum no matter how but i can probably get it today call tomorrow at this time no in the afternoon and i will see what i can do for you very well said the woman well satisfied left to himself john somerville spent some time in reflection difficulties encompassed him difficulties from which he found it hard to find a way of escape he knew how difficult it would be to meet this womans demand gradually his countenance lightened he had decided what that something should be when peg left john somervilles apartments it was with a high degree of satisfaction at the result of the interview all had turned out as she wished she looked upon the thousand dollars as already hers the considerations which she had urged would she was sure induce him to make every effort to secure her silence then with a thousand dollars what might not be done she would withdraw from the business for one thing it was too hazardous why might not dick and she retire to the country lease a country inn and live an honest life hereafter there were times when she grew tired of the life she lived at present it would be pleasant to go to some place where they were not known and enroll themselves among the respectable members of the community she was growing old she wanted rest and a quiet home her early years had been passed in the country she remembered still the green fields in which she played as a child and to this woman old and sinstained there came a yearning to have that life return but her dream was rudely broken by her encounter with the officers of the law at the house of her employer chapter xxxii a providential meeting by gracious if that isnt ida exclaimed jack in profound surprise he had been sauntering along chestnut street listlessly troubled by the thought that though he had given mrs hardwick into custody he was apparently no nearer the discovery of his young ward than before what steps should he take to find her he could not decide in his perplexity his eyes rested suddenly upon the print of the flower girl yes he said that is ida fast enough perhaps they will know in the store where she is to be found he at once entered the store can you tell me anything about the girl in that picture he asked abruptly of the nearest clerk it is a fancy picture he said i think you would need a long time to find the original it has taken a long time said jack but you are mistaken that is a picture of my sister of your sister repeated the salesman with surprise half incredulous yes persisted jack she is my sister if it is your sister said the clerk you ought to know where she is jack was about to reply when the attention of both was called by a surprised exclamation from a lady who had paused beside them her eyes also were fixed upon the flower girl who is this she asked in visible excitement is it taken from life this young man says it is his sister said the clerk your sister repeated the lady her eyes fixed inquiringly upon jack in her tone there was a mingling both of surprise and disappointment yes madam answered jack respectfully pardon me she said there is very little personal resemblance i should not have suspected that you were her brother she is not my own sister explained jack but i love her just the same do you live in philadelphia could i see her asked the lady eagerly i live in new york madam said jack but ida was stolen from us about three weeks since and i have come here in pursuit of her i have not been able to find her yet did you call her ida demanded the lady in strange agitation yes madam my young friend said the woman rapidly i have been much interested in the story of your sister i should like to hear more but not here would you have any objection to coming home with me and telling me the rest then we will together concert measures for recovering her you are very kind madam said jack bashfully for the lady was elegantly dressed and it had never been his fortune to converse with a lady of her social position i shall be glad to go home with you and shall be very much obliged for your advice and assistance then we will drive home at once with natural gallantry jack assisted the lady into the carriage and at her bidding got in himself home thomas she directed the driver and drive as fast as possible yes madam how old was your sister when your parents adopted her asked mrs clifton jack afterward ascertained that this was her name about a year old madam and how long since was that asked the lady waiting for the answer with breathless interest seven years since she is now eight it must be murmured the lady in low tones if it is indeed as i hope my life will indeed be blessed did you speak madam tell me under what circumstances your family adopted her jack related briefly how ida had been left at their door in her infancy and do you recollect the month in which this happened it was at the close of december the night before new years it is it must be she ejaculated mrs clifton clasping her hands while tears of joy welled from her eyes i i dont understand said jack naturally astonished my young friend said the lady our meeting this morning seems providential i have every reason to believe that this child your adopted sister is my daughter stolen from me by an unknown enemy at the time of which i speak from that day to this i have never been able to obtain the slightest clew that might lead to her discovery i have long taught myself to think of her as dead it was jacks turn to be surprised he looked at the lady beside him she was barely thirty the beauty of her girlhood had ripened into the maturer beauty of womanhood there was the same dazzling complexion the same soft flush upon the cheeks the eyes too were wonderfully like idas jack looked and as he looked he became convinced you must be right he said ida is very much like you you think so said mrs clifton eagerly yes madam i had a picture a daguerreotype taken of ida just before i lost her i have treasured it carefully i must show it to you when we get to my house the carriage stopped before a stately mansion in a wide and quiet street the driver dismounted and opened the door jack assisted mrs clifton to alight bashfully our hero followed the lady up the steps and at her bidding seated himself in an elegant parlor furnished with a splendor which excited his admiration and wonder he had little time to look about him for mrs clifton without pausing to remove her street attire hastened downstairs with an open daguerreotype in her hand can you remember ida when she was first brought to your house she asked did she look anything like this picture it is her image answered jack decidedly i should know it anywhere then there can be no further doubt said mrs clifton it is my child you have cared for so long oh why could i not have known it before how many lonely days and sleepless nights it would have spared me but god be thanked for this late blessing i shall see my child again i hope so madam we must find her what is your name my young friend my name is harding jack harding jack repeated the lady smiling yes madam that is what they call me it would not seem natural to be called john very well said mrs clifton with a smile which went to jacks heart at once and made him think her if any more beautiful than ida as ida is your adopted sister i call her my ward i am her guardian you know you are a young guardian but as i was about to say that makes us connected in some way doesnt it i wont call you mr harding for that would sound too formal i will call you jack i wish you would said our hero his face brightening with pride it almost upset him to be called jack by a beautiful lady who every day of her life was accustomed to live in a splendor which it seemed to jack could not be exceeded even by royal state had mrs clifton been queen victoria herself he could not have felt a profounder respect and veneration for her than he did already now jack said mrs clifton in a friendly manner which delighted our hero we must take measures to discover ida immediately i want you to tell me about her disappearance from your house and what steps you have taken thus far toward finding her jack began at the beginning and described the appearance of mrs hardwick how she had been permitted to carry ida away under false representations and the manner in which he had tracked her to philadelphia he spoke finally of her arrest and her obstinate refusal to impart any information as to where ida was concealed mrs clifton listened attentively and anxiously there were more difficulties in the way than she had supposed can you think of any plan jack she asked anxiously yes madam answered jack the man who painted the picture of ida may know where she is to be found you are right said the lady i will act upon your hint i will order the carriage again instantly and we will at once go back to the print store an hour later henry bowen was surprised by the visit of an elegant lady to his studio accompanied by a young man of seventeen i think you are the artist who designed the flower girl said mrs clifton i am madam it was taken from life you are right i am anxious to find the little girl whose face you copied can you give me any directions that will enable me to find her i will accompany you to the place where she lives if you desire it madam said the young artist politely it is a strange neighborhood in which to look for so much beauty i shall be deeply indebted to you if you will oblige me so far said mrs clifton my carriage is below and my coachman will obey your orders once more they were on the move in due time the carriage paused the driver opened the door he was evidently quite scandalized at the idea of bringing his mistress to such a place this cant be the place madam he said yes said the artist do not get out mrs clifton i will go in and find out all that is needful two minutes later he returned looking disappointed we are too late he said an hour since a gentleman called and took away the child mrs clifton sank back in her seat in keen disappointment my child my child she murmured shall i ever see thee again jack too felt more disappointed than he was willing to acknowledge he could not conjecture what gentleman could have carried away ida the affair seemed darker and mere complicated than ever chapter xxxiii ida is found ida was sitting alone in the dreary apartment which she was now obliged to call home peg had gone out and not feeling quite certain of her prey had bolted the door on the outside she had left some work for the child some handkerchiefs to hem for dick with strict orders to keep steadily at work while seated at work she was aroused from thoughts of home by a knock at the door whos there asked ida a friend was the reply mrs hardwick peg isnt at home returned ida then i will come in and wait till she comes back answered the voice outside i cant open the door said the child its fastened outside yes so i see then i will take the liberty to draw the bolt mr john somerville opened the door and for the first time in seven years his glance fell upon the child whom for so long a time he had defrauded of a mothers care and tenderness ida returned to the window how beautiful she is thought somerville with surprise she inherits all her mothers rare beauty on the table beside ida was a drawing whose is this he inquired mine answered ida so you have learned to draw a little answered the child modestly who taught you not the woman you live with no said ida you have not always lived with her i am sure no sir you lived in new york with a family named harding did you not do you know father and mother asked ida with sudden hope did they send you for me i will tell you that by and by my child but i want to ask you a few questions first why does this woman peg lock you in whenever she goes away i suppose said ida she is afraid ill run away then she knows you dont want to live with her oh yes she knows that said the child frankly i have asked her to take me home but she says she wont for a year and how long have you been with her about three weeks but it seems a great deal longer what does she make you do i cant tell what she made me do first why not because she would be very angry suppose i should promise to deliver you from her would you be willing to go with me and you would carry me back to my father and mother asked ida eagerly certainly i would restore you to your mother was the evasive reply then i will go with you ida ran quickly to get her bonnet and shawl we had better go at once said somerville peg might return you know and then there would be trouble oh yes let us go quickly said ida turning pale at the remembered threats of peg neither knew as yet that peg could not return if she would that at this very moment she was in legal custody on a charge of a serious nature still less did ida know that in going she was losing the chance of seeing jack and her real mother of whose existence even she was not yet aware and that this man whom she looked upon as her friend was in reality her worst enemy i will conduct you to my own rooms in the first place said her companion you must remain in concealment for a day or two as peg will undoubtedly be on the lookout for you and we want to avoid all trouble ida was delighted with her escape and with the thoughts of soon seeing her friends in new york she put implicit faith in her guide and was willing to submit to any conditions which he saw fit to impose at length they reached his lodgings they were furnished more richly than any room ida had yet seen and formed indeed a luxurious contrast to the dark and scantily furnished apartment which she had occupied since her arrival in philadelphia well you are glad to get away from peg asked john somerville giving ida a comfortable seat oh so glad said ida and you wouldnt care about going back the child shuddered i suppose she said peg will be very angry she would beat me if she got me back again but she shant i will take good care of that ida looked her gratitude her heart went out to those who appeared to deal kindly with her and she felt very grateful to her companion for delivering her from peg now said somerville perhaps you will be willing to tell me what it was peg required you to do yes said ida but she must never know that i told i promise not to tell her it was to pass bad money ha exclaimed her companion quickly what sort of bad money it was bad bills did she do much in that way a good deal she goes out every day to buy things with the money i am glad to learn this said john somerville thoughtfully why asked ida curiously are you glad she is wicked i am glad because she wont dare to come for you knowing i can have her put in prison then i am glad too ida said her companion after a pause i am obliged to go out for a short time you will find books on the table and can amuse yourself by reading i wont make you sew as peg did he added smiling i like to read she said i shall enjoy myself very well if you get tired of reading you can draw you will find plenty of paper on my desk mr somerville went out and ida as he had recommended read for a time then growing tired she went to the window and looked out a carriage was passing up the street slowly on account of a press of other carriages ida saw a face that she knew forgetting her bonnet in her sudden joy she ran down the stairs into the street and up to the carriage window oh jack she exclaimed have you come for me it was mrs cliftons carriage just returning from pegs lodgings why its ida exclaimed jack almost springing through the window of the carriage in his excitement where did you come from and where have you been all this time he opened the door of the carriage and drew ida in my child my child thank god you are restored to me exclaimed mrs clifton she drew the astonished child to her bosom ida looked up into her face in bewilderment was it nature that prompted her to return the ladys embrace my god i thank thee murmured mrs clifton for this my child was lost and is found ida said jack this lady is your mother my mother repeated the astonished child have i got two mothers this is your real mother you were brought to our house when you were an infant and we have always taken care of you but this lady is your real mother ida hardly knew whether to feel glad or sorry and you are not my brother jack no i am your guardian said jack smiling you shall still consider him your brother ida said mrs clifton heaven forbid that i should seek to wean your heart from the friends who have cared so kindly for you you may keep all your old friends and love them as dearly as ever you will only have one friend the more where are we going asked ida suddenly we are going home what will the gentleman say what gentleman the one that took me away from pegs why there he is now mrs clifton followed the direction of idas finger as she pointed to a gentleman passing is he the one asked mrs clifton in surprise yes mamma answered ida shyly mrs clifton pressed ida to her bosom it was the first time she had ever been called mamma for when ida had been taken from her she was too young to speak the sudden thrill which this name excited made her realize the full measure of her present happiness arrived at the house jacks bashfulness returned even idas presence did not remove it he hung back and hesitated about going in mrs clifton observed this jack she said this house is to be your home while you are in philadelphia come in and thomas shall go for your luggage perhaps i had better go with him said jack uncle abel will be glad to know that ida is found very well only return soon as you are idas guardian she added smiling you will need to watch over her well thought jack as he reentered the elegant carriage and gave the proper direction to the coachman wont uncle abel be a little surprised when he sees me coming home in this style mrs cliftons a trump maybe that aint exactly the word but idas in luck anyhow chapter xxxiv never too late to mend meanwhile peg was passing her time wearily enough in prison it was certainly provoking to be deprived of her freedom just when she was likely to make it most profitable after some reflection she determined to send for mrs clifton and reveal to her all she knew trusting to her generosity for a recompense to one of the officers of the prison she communicated the intelligence that she had an important revelation to make to mrs clifton absolutely refusing to make it unless the lady would visit her in prison scarcely had mrs clifton returned home after recovering her child than the bell rang and a stranger was introduced is this mrs clifton he inquired it is then i have a message for you the lady looked at him inquiringly let me introduce myself madam as one of the officers connected with the city prison a woman was placed in confinement this morning who says she has a most important communication to make to you but declines to make it except to you in person can you bring her here sir that is impossible we will give you every facility however for visiting her in prison it must be peg whispered ida the woman that carried me off such a request mrs clifton could not refuse she at once made ready to accompany the officer she resolved to carry ida with her fearful that unless she kept her in her immediate presence she might disappear again as before as jack had not yet returned a hack was summoned and they proceeded at once to the prison ida shuddered as she passed within the gloomy portal which shut out hope and the world from so many this way madam they followed the officer through a gloomy corridor until they came to the cell in which peg was confined peg looked up in surprise when she saw ida enter with mrs clifton what brought you two together she asked abruptly a blessed providence answered mrs clifton i saw jack with her said ida and i ran out into the street i didnt expect to find my mother there is not much for me to tell then said peg i had made up my mind to restore you to your mother you see ida ive moved she continued smiling grimly oh peg said ida her tender heart melted by the womans misfortunes how sorry i am to find you here are you sorry asked peg looking at her in curious surprise you havent much cause to be ive been your worst enemy at any rate one of the worst i cant help it said the child her face beaming with a divine compassion it must be so sad to be shut up here and not be able to go out into the bright sunshine i do pity you pegs heart was not wholly hardened few are but it was long since it had been touched as now by this warmhearted pity on the part of one whom she had injured youre a good girl ida she said and im sorry ive injured you i didnt think i should ever ask forgiveness of anybody but i do ask your forgiveness the child rose and advancing toward her old enemy took her large hand in hers and said i forgive you peg from your heart with all my heart thank you child i feel better now there have been times when i have thought i should like to lead a better life it is not too late now peg peg shook her head who will trust me when i come out of here she said i will said mrs clifton you will repeated peg amazed yes after all i have done to harm you but i am not quite so bad as you may think it was not my plan to take ida from you i was poor and money tempted me who could have had an interest in doing me this cruel wrong asked the mother one whom you know well mr john somerville surely you are wrong exclaimed mrs clifton in unbounded astonishment that cannot be what object could he have can you think of none queried peg looking at her shrewdly mrs clifton changed color perhaps so she said go on peg told the whole story so circumstantially that there was no room for doubt i did not believe him capable of such great wickedness ejaculated mrs clifton with a pained and indignant look it was a base unmanly revenge to take how could you lend yourself to it how could i repeated peg madam you are rich you have always had whatever wealth could procure how can such as you understand the temptations of the poor when want and hunger stare us in the face we have not the strength that you have in your luxurious homes pardon me said mrs clifton touched by these words half bitter half pathetic let me at any rate thank you for the service you have done me now when you are released from your confinement come to me if you wish to change your mode of life and live honestly henceforth i will give you the chance after all the injury i have done you you are yet willing to trust me who am i that i should condemn you yes i will trust you and forgive you i never expected to hear such words said peg her heart softened and her arid eyes moistened by unwonted emotion least of all from you i should like to ask one thing what is it will you let her come and see me sometimes pointing to ida as she spoke it will remind me that this is not all a dream these words which you have spoken she shall come said mrs clifton and i will come too sometimes thank you they left the prison behind them and returned home there was a visitor awaiting them mr somerville is in the drawing room said the servant he said he would wait till you came in mrs cliftons face flushed i will go down and see him she said ida you will remain here she descended to the drawing room and met the man who had injured her he had come with the resolve to stake his all upon one desperate cast his fortunes were desperate but he had one hope left through the mothers love for the daughter whom she had mourned so long whom as he believed he had it in his power to restore to her he hoped to obtain her consent to a marriage which would retrieve his fortunes and gratify his ambition mrs clifton entered the room and seated herself quietly she bowed slightly but did not as usual offer her hand but full of his own plans mr somerville took no note of this change in her manner how long is it since ida was lost inquired somerville abruptly mrs clifton heard this question in surprise why was it that he had alluded to this subject seven years she answered and you believe she yet lives yes i am certain of it john somerville did not understand her he thought it was only because a mother is reluctant to give up hope it is a long time he said it is a long time to suffer said mrs clifton with deep meaning how could anyone have the heart to work me this great injury for seven years i have led a sad and solitary life seven years that might have been gladdened and cheered by my darlings presence there was something in her tone that puzzled john somerville but he was far enough from suspecting that she knew the truth and at last knew him too rosa he said after a pause i too believe that ida still lives do you love her well enough to make a sacrifice for the sake of recovering her what sacrifice she asked fixing her eye upon him a sacrifice of your feelings explain you speak in enigmas listen then i have already told you that i too believe ida to be living indeed i have lately come upon a clew which i think will lead me to her withdraw the opposition you have twice made to my suit promise me that you will reward my affection by your hand if i succeed and i will devote myself to the search for ida resting not day or night till i have placed her in your arms this i am ready to do if i succeed may i claim my reward what reason have you for thinking you would be able to find her asked mrs clifton with the same inexplicable manner the clew that i spoke of and are you not generous enough to exert yourself without demanding of me this sacrifice no rosa he answered firmly i am not unselfish enough i have long loved you you may not love me but i am sure i can make you happy i am forced to show myself selfish since it is the only way in which i can win you but consider a moment put it on a different ground if you restore me my child now will not even that be a poor atonement for the wrong you did me seven years since she spoke rapidly now for the grief and loneliness and sorrow which your wickedness and cruelty have wrought i do not understand you he said faltering it is sufficient explanation mr somerville to say i have seen the woman who is now in prison your paid agent and that i need no assistance to recover ida she is in my house confusion he uttered only this word and rising left the presence of the woman whom he had so long deceived and injured his grand scheme had failed chapter xxxv jacks return it is quite time to return to new york from which ida was carried but three short weeks before i am beginning to feel anxious about jack said mrs harding its more than a week since we heard from him im afraid hes got into some trouble probably hes too busy to write said the cooper wishing to relieve his wifes anxiety though he too was not without anxiety i told you so said rachel in one of her usual fits of depression i told you jack wasnt fit to be sent on such an errand if youd only taken my advice you wouldnt have had so much worry and trouble about him now most likely hes got into the house of reformation or somewhere i knew a young man once who went away from home and never came back again nobody ever knew what became of him till his body was found in the river half eaten by fishes how can you talk so rachel said mrs harding and about your own nephew too this is a world of trial and disappointment said rachel and we might as well expect the worst for its sure to come at that rate there wouldnt be much joy in life said timothy no rachel you are wrong god did not send us into the world to be melancholy he wants us to enjoy ourselves now i have no idea that jack has jumped into the river or become food for the fishes even if he should happen to tumble in he can swim i suppose said rachel with mild sarcasm you expect him to come home in a coach and four bringing ida with him well said the cooper goodhumoredly thats a good deal better to anticipate than your suggestion and i dont know but its as probable rachel shook her head dismally bless me interrupted mrs harding looking out of the window in a tone of excitement theres a carriage just stopped at the door and yes it is jack and ida too the strange fulfillment of her own ironical suggestion struck even aunt rachel she too hastened to the window and saw a handsome carriage drawn not by four horses but by two standing before the door jack had already jumped out and was now assisting ida to alight no sooner was ida on firm ground than she ran into the house and was at once clasped in the arms of her adopted mother oh mother she exclaimed how glad i am to see you once more havent you a kiss for me too ida said the cooper his face radiant with joy you dont know how much weve missed you and i am so glad to see you all and aunt rachel too to her astonishment aunt rachel for the first time in her remembrance kissed her there was nothing wanting to her welcome home but the observant eyes of the spinster detected what had escaped the cooper and his wife in their joy at idas return where did you get this handsome dress ida she asked then for the first time the coopers family noticed that ida was more elegantly dressed than when she went away she looked like a young princess that mrs hardwick didnt give you this gown ill be bound said aunt rachel oh ive so much to tell you said ida breathlessly ive found my mother my other mother a pang struck to the honest hearts of timothy harding and his wife ida must leave them after all the happy years which they had watched over and cared for her she must leave them at length while they were silent in view of their threatened loss an elegantly dressed lady appeared on the threshold smiling radiant with happiness mrs clifton seemed to the coopers family almost a being from another sphere mother said ida taking the hand of the stranger and leading her up to mrs harding this is my other mother who has always taken such good care of me and loved me so well mrs harding said mrs clifton her voice full of feeling how can i ever thank you for your kindness to my child my child it was hard for mrs harding to hear another speak of ida this way i have tried to do my duty by her she said simply i love her as if she were my own yes said the cooper clearing his throat and speaking a little huskily we love her so much that we almost forgot that she wasnt ours we have had her since she was a baby and it wont be easy at first to give her up my good friends said mrs clifton earnestly i acknowledge your claim i shall not think of asking you to make that sacrifice i shall always think of ida as only a little less yours than mine the cooper shook his head but you live in philadelphia he said we shall lose sight of her not unless you refuse to come to philadelphia too i am a poor man perhaps i might not find work there that shall be my care mr harding i have another inducement to offer god has bestowed upon me a large share of this worlds goods i am thankful for it since it will enable me in some slight way to express my sense of your great kindness to ida i own a neat brick house in a quiet street which you will find more comfortable than this just before i left philadelphia my lawyer by my directions drew up a deed of gift conveying the house to you it is idas gift not mine ida give this to mr harding the child took the parchment and handed it to the cooper who took it mechanically quite bewildered by his sudden good fortune this for me he said it is the first installment of my debt of gratitude it shall not be the last said mrs clifton how shall i thank you madam said the cooper to a poor man like me this is a most munificent gift you will best thank me by accepting it said mrs clifton let me add for i know it will enhance the value of the gift in your eyes that it is only five minutes walk from my house and ida will come and see you every day yes mamma said ida i couldnt be happy away from father and mother and jack and aunt rachel you must introduce me to aunt rachel said mrs clifton with a grace all her own ida did so i am glad to make your acquaintance miss rachel said mrs clifton i need not say that i shall be glad to see you as well as mr and mrs harding at my house very frequently im much obleeged to ye said aunt rachel but i dont think i shall live long to go anywheres the feelins i have sometimes warn me that im not long for this world you see mrs clifton said jack his eyes dancing with mischief we come of a shortlived family grandmother died at eightytwo and that wouldnt give aunt rachel long to live you impudent boy exclaimed aunt rachel in great indignation then relapsing into melancholy im a poor afflicted creetur and the sooner i leave this scene of trial the better im afraid mrs clifton said jack aunt rachel wont live to wear that silk dress you brought along id take it myself but im afraid it wouldnt be of any use to me a silk dress exclaimed rachel looking up with sudden animation it had long been her desire to have a new silk dress but in her brothers circumstances she had not ventured to hint at it yes said mrs clifton i ventured to purchase dresses for both of the ladies jack if it wont be too much trouble will you bring them in jack darted out and returned with two ample patterns of heavy black silk one for his mother the other for his aunt aunt rachel would not have been human if she had not eagerly examined the rich fabric with secret satisfaction she inwardly resolved to live a little longer there was a marked improvement in her spirits and she indulged in no prognostications of evil for an unusual period mrs clifton and ida stopped to supper and before they returned to the hotel an early date was fixed upon for the hardings to remove to philadelphia in the evening jack told the eventful story of his adventures to eager listeners closing with the welcome news that he was to receive the reward of a thousand dollars offered for the detection of the counterfeiters so you see father i am a man of fortune he concluded after all rachel it was a good thing we sent jack to philadelphia said the cooper rachel did not notice this remark she was busily discussing with her sisterinlaw the best way of making up her new silk chapter xxxvi conclusion as soon as arrangements could be made mr harding and his whole family removed to philadelphia the house which mrs clifton had given them exceeded their anticipations it was so much better and larger than their former dwelling that their furniture would have appeared to great disadvantage in it but mrs clifton had foreseen this and they found the house already furnished for their reception even aunt rachel was temporarily exhilarated in spirits when she was ushered into the neatly furnished chamber which was assigned to her use through mrs cliftons influence the cooper was enabled to establish himself in business on a larger scale and employ others instead of working himself for hire ida was such a frequent visitor that it was hard to tell which she considered her home her mothers elegant residence or the coopers comfortable dwelling jack put his thousand dollars into a savings bank to accumulate till he should be ready to go into business for himself and required it as capital a situation was found for him in a merchants countingroom and in due time he was admitted into partnership and became a thriving young merchant ida grew lovelier as she grew older and her rare beauty and attractive manners caused her to be sought after it may be that some of my readers are expecting that she will marry jack but they will probably be disappointed they are too much like brother and sister for such a relation to be thought of jack reminds her occasionally of the time when she was his little ward and he was her guardian and protector one day as rachel was walking up chestnut street she was astonished by a hearty grasp of the hand from a bronzed and weatherbeaten stranger release me sir she said hysterically what do you mean by such conduct surely you have not forgotten your old friend capt bowling said the stranger rachel brightened up i didnt remember you at first she said but now i do now tell me how are all your family they are all well all except me i dont think i am long for this world oh yes you are you are too young to think of leaving us yet said capt bowling heartily rachel was gratified by this unusual compliment are you married asked capt bowling abruptly i shall never marry she said i shouldnt dare to trust my happiness to a man not if i were that man said the captain persuasively oh capt bowling murmured rachel agitated how can you say such things ill tell you why miss harding im going to give up the sea and settle down on land i shall need a good sensible wife and if youll take me ill make you mrs bowling at once this is so unexpected capt bowling said rachel but she did not look displeased do you think it would be proper to marry so suddenly it will be just the thing to do now what do you say yes or no if you really think it will be right faltered the agitated spinster then its all settled what will timothy say that youve done a sensible thing two hours later leaning on capt bowlings arm mrs rachel bowling reentered her brothers house why rachel where have you been asked mrs harding and she looked hard at rachels companion this is my consort capt bowling said rachel nervously this is mrs bowling maam said the captain when were you married asked the cooper it was dinner time and both he and jack were at home only an hour ago wed have invited you but time was pressing i thought you never meant to be married aunt rachel said jack mischievously i i dont expect to live long and it wont make much difference said rachel youll have to consult me about that said capt bowling i dont want you to leave me a widower too soon i propose that we drink mrs bowlings health said jack can anybody tell me why shes like a good ship because shes got a good captain said mrs harding thatll do mother but theres another reason because shes well manned capt bowling evidently appreciated the joke judging from his hearty laughter he added that it wouldnt be his fault if she wasnt well rigged too the marriage has turned out favorably the captain looks upon his wife as a superior woman and rachel herself has few fits of depression nowadays they have taken a small house near mr hardings and rachel takes no little pride in her snug and comfortable home one word more at the close of her term of imprisonment peg came to mrs clifton and reminded her of her promise dick
