chapter one the purple palace the woman with platinum blonde hair and green eyes put her little finger in her mouth hey she said for an old guy youre not badlooking she sipped some champagne from her glass then she smiled she smiled and suddenly her whole face changed before she had looked like a naughty child now she was a beautiful woman she had high cheekbones below her beautiful green eyes she had a long straight nose and a wide mouth her shiny blonde hair was cut short her eyes were shining as she looked straight at me yeah she went on you really dont look too bad do you know something mister i could fall for a guy like you what could i say im in my early thirties well thats what i tell people the truth is that im nearer forty and the woman i was looking at couldnt have been a day more than twentythree i meet lots of women in my line of work but i rarely meet anyone as beautiful as this one and on the few occasions when i have met a real stunner she certainly hasnt wanted to have anything to do with me still the woman had a point im not badlooking dark hair brown eyes good teeth nice clothes and ive kept myself in shape i go to the gym three times a week its true that my face shows the marks of my time as an amateur boxer there are some small scars round my eyes and my nose isnt quit straight any more somebody broke it in a fight the only problem the woman continued is your job no one ever got rich by doing your job and i like expensive things she smiled again she had another point i was sure that she spent a lot of money and i certainly wasnt rich im a private investigator that is a private detective in los angeles california my clients are often people who live on the edges of la society protection security blackmail corruption missing persons small crimes these are the things i deal with every day sometimes i even have a murder case the only jobs i dont do are divorce cases and marriage problems my life isnt easy but there is usually enough money each month to pay the rent for my apartment and the rent for my office but there isnt any place in my life for a woman who looks like a million dollars and dresses as if she had a million dollars and the woman i was looking at now was obviously one of those still what the hell the blonde said she put down her glass of champagne and took a step towards me come on charlie were alone tonight kiss me charlie my names not charlie its lenny lenny samuel some people call me len still i wasnt going to argue i stood up and took a step towards the blonde hey fella sit down a mans voice shouted the blonde smiled i opened my arms hey fella i told you to sit down the man shouted again i stared into the blondes beautiful green eyes then i felt a hand on my shoulder sit down now the voice said i turned around the man standing behind me was taller than me and heavier im onemetreninety tall and i weigh just over ninety kilos all muscle but this guy was bigger than me in every way and he was angry sit down fella he shouted i cant see the screen it you stand there i sat down and i looked up at the movie screen again now the blonde actress was kissing a man it was a closeup shot the woman was thirty metres away from me and her face was five metres high her name was gail lane she was the hottest actress in hollywood and this was the closest i had ever got to her im sorry fella i said to the man behind me i guess i got carried away i go to the movies a lot especially when business is bad and just then business was very bad indeed my last case had ended a few weeks before someone had stolen a racehorse from a beautiful woman id found the horse but i hadnt any money since then id tidied my office cleaned my car gone to the gym a lot and waited for the phone to ring it hadnt rung i didnt have any new clients so most days i went to the movies the movie ended and the lights came on i got up and went to the mens washroom there was a floortoceiling mirror there and i stood in front of it and looked at myself it was true i wasnt badlooking i was wearing a black leather jacket a bright checked shirt and a pair of new black trousers my brown timberland boots completed the picture i took out my dark glasses and put them on cool i said to the mirror and i walked out of the movie theatre it was just before midnight i decided that i didnt need the dark glasses i walked round the corner to the parking lot and i got into my old grey chrysler then i drove slowly past the bars and clubs trying to decide what to do it was too early to go to bed but it was too late to start calling friends to see if they wanted to go out i was bored i wanted something to happen i was just passing the purple palace one of las most expensive nightclubs when something did happen a shiny white opentop car suddenly pulled out from the sidewalk i hit the brakes and the chrysler stopped but the white car didnt stop it hit the side of the chrysler with a loud crash i was ok i got out of the car the chrysler was ok too they dont make cars like that anymore but the white car wasnt ok and neither was its driver the front of the car was badly smashed and oil was running out from under the engine the driver was still sitting at the wheel and there was some blood on his face the driver of the white car was wearing a smart suit and he had short wellcut hair he looked about twentyfive but his hair was steel grey after a few moments he opened the car door he walked towards me with an angry face im going to make you pay for this he said he tried to grab my arm his breath smelt of whisky then he tried to hit me he tried but he didnt succeed i used to be a boxer and this man was drunk i leant back and the blow missed i was about to knock the man to the ground when he suddenly closed his eyes and fell over i hadnt touched him i felt a hand on my shoulder that guys a fool a voice said i turned around it was a woman with platinum blonde hair and beautiful green eyes chapter two what do you want me to do that guys a fool gail lane repeated im sorry mister i opened my mouth to say something but no words came out i was standing in the middle of a busy street in downtown la with the hottest actress in hollywood say something gail said hey well mmm what do you want me to do i managed to say well lets start by getting my car off the road gail said your car i asked yeah she replied its my car he shouldnt have been driving it hes had far too much to drink the parking attendant brought the car round to the front of the club and mike took the keys i argued with him but he wouldnt let me drive mike i asked do you repeat everything someone says gail asked sharply mike devine is his name have you ever heard of him i had mike devine was the son of joel devine who was a rich and successful movie producer mike had never done a days work in his life but he was never short of money his father made sure of that as a result mike devine had got into lots of trouble there were always stories about him in the newspapers stories about gambling debts accidents women things like that now mike devine lay in the street next to my chrysler gail and i pushed the damaged white car to the sidewalk a crowd of people was standing there staring at us then someone recognized gail suddenly people started to point at us and talk gail looked at me she smiled and her face changed just like it had in the movie she touched my arm there is something else you can do for me she said in a quiet warm voice i cant stay here people have seen me ive got to get home will you help me please sure i said lets go i was delighted i was excited perhaps gail would invite me into her apartment there would be soft lights and soft music anything might happen she smiled at me again youre a nice guy she said we walked over to the chrysler mike devines eyes were open now there was blood on his smart suit when he saw gail he stood up and held on to the side of my chrysler get into this guys car before the police come mike gail said to the young man she pulled mike devine by his jacket opened the back door of the chrysler and pushed him in oh i muttered youd like me to take him home too he lives at hollywood boulevard gail said sweetly thank you for your help its a pleasure i replied please get in i opened the front passenger door gail looked puzzled for a moment then she laughed no thanks she said im taking a cab thank you again for your help her lips touched my cheek briefly and then she was gone she ran to the sidewalk where the doorman of the purple palace called a cab for her i watched her go then i got into the chrysler there was a strange noise coming from the back seat i turned round mike devine was being sick i opened the window and drove away a few minutes later mike devine was unconscious hollywood boulevard was a tall new building with windows of black glass i stopped outside it and switched off the chryslers engine a doorman came out of the building and walked up to the car he was a short heavy man with a small moustache hey you cant park here mister the doorman said i pointed at the unconscious figure lying on the back seat does he live here i asked the doorman looked at mike then he opened the back door of the car and stepped away as the smell reached him yeah he lives here the doorman replied apartment help me to take him up to his apartment i said together the doorman and i carried mike devine into the hallway and across to the elevator the doorman came up with us in the elevator and waited while i found some keys in mike devines trouser pocket i unlocked the apartment door ok the doorman said are you a friend of mr devine well no i replied but im a friend of a friend why were very careful about who comes in and out of this building but if youre a friend of mr devines friend then i guess you can go in the doorman replied but youll have to give me your name i gave him one of my business cards huh a private eye the doorman muttered a private detective i replied but can you keep an eye on my car ok the doorman replied and got back into the elevator i opened the apartment door and pulled mike devine into a big living room i knew at once that something was wrong all the lights were on clothes and books were lying all over the floor paintings hung sideways on the walls wheres the bathroom i asked mike he muttered something and pointed to a door i took him into the bathroom and turned on the shower full power icecold then i pushed him into the shower with his clothes on he made a noise when the icecold water hit his face but five minutes later mike could stand up on his own with his eyes open i threw him a towel get dried then put some clean clothes on i said ill wait for you in the livingroom i closed the bathroom door and started to look around the apartment more carefully the livingroom was a real mess the windows were open and the curtains were moving in the gentle wind there was a corridor on my left i guessed there were bedrooms behind the doors in the corridor i opened the first door quietly i saw large bedroom it was decorated in white white walls white carpet a huge white bed i stepped into the room and walked towards the bed i dont know what i was looking for then i heard a noise behind me before i could turn round something hit me on the back of the head i guess i must have fallen heavily to the floor but i was unconscious by then chapter three mike devine i could feel hands touching my body the hands turned me onto my side someone started to empty the pockets of my leather jacket they took out my wallet my business cards my gun i opened my eyes a little a face was looking at me it had short blonde hair and green eyes and it was smiling at me i smiled back but the blonde womans face didnt change i closed my eyes and opened them again she was still smiling at me i moved my head a little it hurt sit up a voice said it wasnt gail lanes voice it was a man who spoke i opened my eyes wide and saw that i had been looking at a photograph of gail the photograph was on a low white bedside table mike devine was sitting on the edge of the bed he was wearing a white bathrobe with palm beach resort written on it he was holding my gun and he was pointing it at my head now mike devine said in a quiet hard voice who are you and what are you doing on my bedroom floor i touched the back of my head it still hurt i looked at my watch two oclock i must have been unconscious for over an hour mike devine had obviously woken up after the cold shower i had given him you can see who i am i replied youve got my business cards look in my wallet and youll find my detectives licence then please give me my things back mike devine laughed the gun was still pointing at my head im not that stupid he said and he threw the wallet over to me you open the wallet and show me your licence i picked up the wallet and showed him my detectives licence ok mike devine went on now tell me what youre doing here my apartment has been wrecked and youre lying on my bedroom floor i told mike what had happened and how i had helped him to get home he looked at me and shook his head no he said after a moment i dont remember a thing and i dont believe you he walked over to a phone by the bed and picked it up get me security he said there was a pause after a few moments he spoke again security hi this is mike devine in ive got an intruder here can you come up no im not in danger ive got his gun mike hung up and sat down on the bed youre making a mistake i said well soon find out he replied two minutes later someone rang the bell of the apartment door and mike devine went to open it a moment later he came back into the bedroom with another man it was the doorman with the moustache the man who had helped me carry devine in from the car wheres the intruder the doorman asked mike devine pointed at me the doorman gave a short loud laugh hes a private eye the doorman said he brought you home and he and i carried you up here mike devine looked at me in surprise he threw my gun back to me im sorry fella he said ive got a couple of questions i said to the doorman did you let anyone in here earlier this evening and did anyone leave after i got here the answer to both questions is no the doorman replied i dont let people into apartments when the owners out and no one left if anyone had gone out through the hallway i would have seen them mike devine thanked the doorman then turned to me theres one thing mr samuel i dont seem to have any money on me could you lend me fifty bucks i smiled rich people theyre the ones whove never got any money i opened my wallet and gave mike fifty dollars he walked over to the doorman and gave him the money theres no need to say anything about this to anyone mike said the doorman thanked him and left the apartment i sat on the bed and thought about what had happened who had hit me on the head had mike himself done it if he hadnt hit me there must have been someone else in the apartment certainly someone had wrecked the livingroom perhaps that person had hit me on the head when i came into the bedroom but why i asked myself the question but my head hurt and i felt tired i couldnt think of an answer look mike said im sorry its late can i offer you a bed for the night i dont know whos been here whoever hit you on the head must have got out while i was in the bathroom perhaps they thought they were hitting me but the doorman said that no one had left the building i replied so perhaps theyre still here somewhere or perhaps theyre hiding in another apartment but they must have a key to your apartment the first thing to do is to make sure theyre not still here together we searched every room in mike devines apartment we found no one suddenly i had an idea i wont take your offer of a bed for the night i said my cars outside the police will take it away if i leave it in the street any longer put the car in the garage mike said theres a garage underneath the apartment building and the elevator goes straight down to it my idea had been a good one mike had told me something that i had already guessed so someone could have left the apartment then taken the elevator down to the garage and driven away without the doorman seeing them i said at that moment the phone rang mike devine answered it yes he said yes i see then he hung up he looked terrible who was it i asked someone i owe some money to he replied he said that he wrecked the apartment he said it was a warning he said he was sorry he had hit you he thought you were me and he said that next time he wouldnt wreck my apartment he would wreck me so the person who had hit me on the head was trying to frighten mike devine and he had succeeded mike was looking very frightened indeed mr samuel mike said i think i need some protection i will pay you to stay here for the rest of the night will two hundred bucks be all right plus the fifty you borrowed i replied with a smile i left the apartment and went down to the hallway i told the doorman i was staying for the rest of the night then i went out into the street quickly i drove the chrysler into the underground garage ten minutes later i had turned off the lights in mike devines living room and i was sitting in a comfortable chair with my gun beside me mike had gone to sleep in his huge white bed the hours passed nothing happened there were no intruders i didnt get any sleep the phone rang at six oclock i answered it mr devines apartment i said whos that a womans voice asked i knew that voice it was gail lane at that point mike devine picked up a phone in his bedroom and began to speak i hung up immediately so i never knew what she said to him chapter four crazy ellens i knocked on mike devines bedroom door its lenny samuel i called through the door im leaving now mr devine theres one of my business cards on the table in the livingroom you can send me the two hundred and fifty dollars later mike muttered something inside the bedroom i didnt understand what he said i left the apartment got the chrysler from the garage and drove home after a couple of hours sleep a hot shower and some clean clothes i was a new man i drove downtown to my office building parked the car and went into crazy ellens crazy ellens is a bar and a cafe and a diner and a meeting place its next to the building where my office is on west beaumont drive dont ask me where the name of the bar came from the owner of crazy ellens isnt a mad woman called ellen or even a sane woman called ellen the owner is a man an old greek called costas ive known him for more years than i want to remember i go to his bar a lot people know that if im not in my office ill probably be at crazy ellens hi len costas shouted as i came in it was shortly after nine o clock and the place was empty hey you look tired didnt you sleep hi costas i said taking a seat at the bar im ok give me some black coffee some orange juice and a couple of fried eggs please i ate my breakfast and i chatted to costas about baseball then i went to my office two rooms on the fourth floor of an old building on the floor of the waiting room there was a pile of mail i stepped over it and went through to my private room theres not a lot to see a desk a couple of chairs a grey filing cabinet a window with a broken blind i blew the dust off my chair and sat down at the desk the red light on the answerphone told me that some phone messages were waiting for me i pressed the play messages button there were two messages the first message was from a man who didnt give his name the message was short and simple if you know whats good for you samuel youll take a holiday the voice said next time it wont be just a little knock on the head interesting this was a warning and it was connected with mike devine in some way but who was warning me i didnt recognize the voice and the caller hadnt left a number for me to phone but i knew the second caller as soon as he started to speak it was a man called rik rik roma and i were old friends hi len how are things rik said listen i may have a job for you can you meet me for lunch today give me a call and he left a phone number for me to call riks full name is ricardo and he is italianamerican his family came from sicily in the s rik and i worked together in the lard the los angeles police department my family is hispanic my full name is leonardo though people always call me len or lenny my family came to the us from puerto rico so rik and i had something we could talk about rik and i left the lapd at about the same time rik went to work as a security man at a big movie studio in hollywood i became a private eye rik had done very well over the years he had been very successful in his work and he was now head of security at magic movie productions he always had new cars and he lived in a luxury house in the hills with two swimming pools me well ive got an old car a small apartment and a little wooden cabin in the hills you can guess how well ive done i called rik and we arranged to meet at gate four of the magic movie productions studios at one oclock i spent the rest of the morning at the gym in the basement of my office building then i had a quick shower and drove across town to the studios rik was standing outside gate four rik is tall and thin with a high forehead and short black hair he has deep brown eyes when he looks at you you think he is looking through you i got out of my car and rik put his arm around my shoulder then he led me through the gate showing his security pass to the guard you have to show a pass i laughed sure len the securitys real tight here rik replied we had lunch in the studio commissary the movie studios name for a restaurant with fifteen nuns twenty japanese warriors fifty english peasants several princesses and a giant were making a fantasy movie in studio twelve rik explained these are the extras they walk on and off the set but they dont have speaking parts the stars and the other actors have their own private diningrooms they dont eat at the commissary so what other movies are being made here at the moment i asked i have always been fascinated by moviemaking since i was a child i was really interested rik laughed we dont make very many movies here at the studios any more most of the studio area is used for tourism we get lots of tourist groups visiting hollywood they come in to see the old sets the sets of movies we made in the past but now most of our movies are made on location often in other countries for example many of the best people for special effects are in england so we often work there and we shoot scenes all over the world sometimes we do part of a movie here and then go on location for the rest of it i was disappointed id been hoping to see a movie being made i told rik this he smiled ill see what i can do he said ill try to arrange something after lunch but before we eat i want to ask you a question are you busy at the moment or would you like to do a job for us something a little unusual i didnt need time to think yeah i said im pretty busy but i guess i could do something for you rik laughed you always were a bad liar this is what its about he took a photograph out of his pocket and passed it over to me do you recognize her gail lane was smiling at me from the photograph yes i replied i spoke to her this morning chapter five death behind the door i gave the photo back to rik and i listened to him carefully you obviously know who she is he began but what do you mean about speaking to her this morning shes working here at the studios today she was on the set at seven oclock dont worry about it i replied i meant that i dreamt about her i was speaking to her in my dreams yeah so were a few million other men rik said with a laugh but this is serious len gail lane is the hottest actress in hollywood this year the studio has invested a lot of money in her shes a big star in the us already and shell soon become a world star thats why the things that have happened have worried the studio bosses so much what has happened rik i interrupted tell me youre being very mysterious well len ill tell you rik spoke quietly now although the nuns at the next table certainly werent listening to us this is very secret only one other person knows about it you must promise not to tell anyone about what im going to tell you if its secret why are you talking to me about it i asked why arent you telling your own studio security staff because no one else in magic movie productions must find out about this rik replied those are the orders of homer frank the studios chief executive gail lane is working on a movie here at the moment rik went on its an international thriller and the budget is huge were spending hundreds of millions of dollars on this movie so that makes gail very valuable and someone has been sending death threats rik do you mean that gail lane has been getting letters from someone whos threatening to kill her i asked not exactly rik replied with a shake of the head then he paused while the waitress came to take our orders i ordered tuna with a green salad and rik ordered pasta the threats were sent by email directly to homer frank rik continued gail doesnt know about them she hasnt been told mr frank is afraid that shell get scared i can understand that i said id get scared if someone said they were going to kill me what exactly did these messages say there were three messages all sent during the last three days rik answered in a low voice they said death behind the door will be the death of gail lane stop the movie or well stop her all the messages were the same i was puzzled sorry rik i said i heard the words but i didnt understand them rik sighed ok ill try again gail lane is making a movie for magic movie productions called death behind the door the message says that unless we stop making the movie gail will be killed our food arrived and we stopped talking for a few minutes the tuna was great it was juicy with a lime and sweet pepper sauce i was thinking hard while i ate it rik ate his pasta hungrily there obviously wasnt anything wrong with that either rik youve got to tell gail about these threats i said as we finished eating she might not want to risk being in this movie you must give her the choice we cant afford to stop the movie len rik said quiently its half finished now there are hundreds of milions of bucks invested in it mr frank wont stop the movie but we are going to protect miss lane and thats where i want your help i dont think id be a good bodyguard rik i said quickly gail lane is very attractive i couldnt be near her and do the job properly rik laughed no no len he said gail already has two bodyguards very good ones i want you to join the movie crew so that youre on the set all the time i want you to keep an eye on everyone else perhaps these threats are just a hoax a joke from a mad person but we cant be sure ok i said five hundred dollars a day plus expenses four hundred rik replied fourfifty i said ok fourfifty rik replied with a quick smile but what will i do on the set i asked i dont know anything about how movies are made youre going to be miss lanes adviser on detectives and investigations rik said in the movie she plays a private detective you can tell her about how detectives work you can start work tomorrow and bring your passport with you my passport i asked why i said this movie is an international thriller rik answered weve finished the asian scenes already today is the last day of shooting here at the studios after today the whole crew moves on to south america when weve finished there well go on to europe what scenes are you shooting today rik i asked todays scenes will be shot with some of the stars stuntdoubles rik said theres lots of fighting in todays scenes therell be blood everywhere not real blood of course i ordered coffee rik wasnt telling me everything i was sure of that he was hiding something but what perhaps id never know but you said that gail was working here today too i said can i watch the shooting for a while rik shook his head sorry len its a closed set that means no visitors carla chapman the director of the movie insists on that she says that visitors always upset the actors but im not a visitor i said im miss lanes adviser on being a detective you said so yourself rik thought for a minute ok len theres not time to get you a security pass but ill get you onto the set using mine we finished our coffee and left the commissary a group of cowboys was just arriving we walked over to studio nine there was a big sign outside death behind the door set closed rik spoke to the security guards who let us both in follow me rik whispered be careful it will be very dark inside and dont make a noise or carla will kill us and there really will be blood everywhere we walked very quietly through the darkness of the studio everywhere there were boxes and ropes metal wires and electric cables in the distance we could see a bright light when we got closer we could see that it was a huge bright blue screen like a movie theatre screen we could see someone hanging down on a rope in front of the screen this is a bluescreen rik whispered later these shots will be combined with some shots of a rocky mountainside when the audience sees the movie in a movie theatre theyll think that the actor was really climbing a mountain i watched in silence i was fascinated the person on the rope was still quite high up in front of the screen at least fifteen metres from the floor suddenly there was a loud scream and the actor fell to the studio floor lights went on everywhere we ran towards the person on the floor it was a woman with short blonde hair its gail i said to rik chapter six the bodyguards there was a moment of silence on the set rik and i stared at the blonde woman on the floor then people came running from all directions rik took charge stand back rik shouted get an ambulance i was quickly pushed to the back of the crowd of actors and technicians who came and stood around the woman i walked slowly away from them there was nothing i could do gail is dead i thought she died in front of me and im the man who was going to protect her i felt terrible i had wanted to protect gail lane i had only met her once but i had liked her very much even if i didnt admire her choice of boyfriend sadly i walked towards some other sets which were not in use that day after a minute i came to one which was like the inside of a japanese home it looked like a real room but there was no ceiling and there were only three walls there were several doors which didnt open there was nowhere to go and i had nowhere to go now because of gails death my job had finished before it had really started i left the japanese room and walked slowly on through halfbuilt sets and across open spaces studio nine was the size of an aircraft hangar and several boeing s could have been parked inside it ten minutes later i saw something that i didnt believe i saw her gail just for a moment i saw her bright blonde hair as a door near the end of the building opened and closed i couldnt believe it slowly and carefully i walked towards the door soon i realized that i was looking at a row of dressingrooms the rooms where actors change their clothes and wait during shooting each dressingroom had a door and a window there was a light on inside one of the rooms though all the others were dark and empty i stepped quietly over to the lighted window and looked in gail lane was sitting at a table with a cup in her hand her face was wet and her eyes were shiny she had been crying i didnt have time to think about what i could see as i looked through the window someone grabbed my right arm and twisted it behind my back i turned round and tried to grab my attacker that was a mistake my feet were kicked from under me i fell to the floor and my attacker jumped on top of me i struggled and i tried to get free but my face was pressed against the floor and the attacker was still holding my right arm and now they had their knee on the back of my neck i tried to turn over that didnt work but my left arm was still free so i reached behind my back and grabbed hold of a foot i twisted the foot as hard as i could there was a scream of pain from my attacker and i quickly pushed them off my back then i dived grabbing the person from behind i forced the attacker to stand up with both arms held behind them the attacker suddenly started kicking my legs stand still or ill really hurt you i said oh yes a voice said behind me it was a womans voice then two fists hit me low down on my back the pain was terrible next someones fingers stabbed at the base of my neck just above my shoulders i let go of the person i was holding and turned as quickly as i could i turned just in time to receive a kick to the head i spun around and fell heavily to the floor then i knew nothing when i woke up i was still lying on the floor a woman was sitting on my chest holding me down another woman was sitting on my legs let me get up i said i can explain why im here josies just been injured and youre here looking into gails dressingroom window the woman on my chest said she had shiny dark hair and was wearing a suit and you havent got a pass she went on youll stay where you are until someone from security comes i lay on the floor for what seemed to be a long time then i heard footsteps so you think youve caught him a voice said i knew that voice it was rik the women got off me there he is said the darkhaired woman take him away i looked up at rik sorry rik i said i got lost and then i pointed at the two women these animals attacked me fine rik said let me introduce you to annie and arabella miss lanes bodyguards he pointed at the women in turn i told you they were good annie was the one with dark hair arabella had red hair and she was wearing a suit like annies and who is he arabella asked angrily his name is lenny samuel hes an adviser for miss lane rik replied hes going to advise her on how to behave like a private detective oh really arabella laughed what does he know we caught him easily enough wait i interrupted whats happened gail lane cant be in two places at the same time if gail is here in her dressingroom who was that over there on the set the person who had the accident is called josie shes not dead but shes quite badly injured she was gails stuntdouble someone who did the most dangerous parts of gails acting rik explained the rope she was attached to broke it was a terrible accident or a warning i said i stood up slowly my back and neck hurt i shook hands with annie and arabella i can see that miss lane is well protected i added yeah when she wants to be arabella replied angrily what do you mean i asked sometimes she goes out at night without us annie said we cant protect her then she was angry too perhaps after this accident shell be more careful i said id like to introduce mr samuel to miss lane rik said but perhaps this isnt a good time gail is very upset about josies accident annie said but ill ask her if shell meet mr samuel for a few minutes i guess there wont be any more shooting today annie went into the dressingroom and closed the door behind her we waited outside in silence then the door opened miss lane will meet mr samuel for a few minutes she cant talk for long she doesnt feel well annie said i followed annie into the dressingroom gail was sitting at a table holding a handkerchief she looked up and those green eyes were full of worry she held out her hand im pleased to meet you she said in a low voice im sorry im very upset josie was a friend as well as my double mr samuel will be advising you on how private detectives behave rik explained arabella laughed quietly gail looked at me again more closely i could feel her beautiful eyes staring at me havent we met before she asked i thought for a moment arabella and annie got angry when gail went out without them when she went out with mike devine for example no miss lane i replied chapter seven from la to ba rik and i left gail lanes dressingroom and walked back to the set where the accident had happened the police had arrived and were taking statements from everyone rik and i told them what we had seen the area around the huge screen was closed off with yellow tape and a number of detectives were carefully searching the floor there a greyhaired lieutenant from the lapd a man called dickinson had taken charge i had met him before i asked him what he thought had happened i dont know yet its hard to say dickinson replied the rope was checked before shooting started and it was ok then so why did it break someone must have made a cut in the rope to make it break easily i said mm dickinson said you might be right if you have any other ideas call me you know where to find me rik had to stay in the studio while the police detectives were making their investigation i waited with him im used to waiting and watching and there was plenty to watch on the movie set two hours later the police had gone and rik and i were sitting in his smart office well have to shoot here for an extra day because of josies accident rik told me then the whole crew is moving to argentina to buenos aires i want you to come along rik was interrupted by one of his phones ringing he answered it yes i see he said i will yes sir i will ive got a new man here now he put the phone down that was mr frank hes had another email the message said this time we got the double next time it will be the star mr frank is very worried so it wasnt an accident i said softly and you told me it was a closed set with no visitors allowed so the person who cut the rope was probably someone working on the movie rik nodded yes or someone who had hidden in the studio before shooting started we just dont know he said thats why i want you to join us in buenos aires i want you on the set all the time gail has arabella and annie with her whenever she isnt acting but i want you to watch out for anything suspicious how many people are there in the movie crew i asked therell be two hundred and five of us flying to buenos aires rik replied and probably about two hundred argentines will join us in ba you need a lot of people to make a movie and you want me to keep an eye on all of them i exclaimed rik smiled im sure youll find out who has been threatening gail he said i know you len youre always in trouble just stay with the crew and the trouble will find you two days later i was flying at ten thousand metres over brazil on my way to buenos aires i sat back in the comfortable seat of the aerolineas argentinas boeing and i thought about what had happened during the past few days what was the relationship between gail and mike devine why did someone want to stop the shooting of death behind the door why was someone threatening to kill gail who had injured josie gails double and was he or she on the plane with us there were plenty of questions but no answers i looked at rik asleep in the next seat there was certainly something he hadnt told me i thought about gail sitting in the firstclass section at the front of the plane i thought about the worry i had seen in her eyes at the studio then i thought about carla chapman she was also in the firstclass section i had met her briefly at the airport before we got onto the plane carla was one of hollywoods bestknown movie directors a powerful and very hardworking person she was a strong proud fortyfiveyearold with shoulderlength black hair and goldframed glasses at the airport she had shaken my hand firmly and she had said it was nice to meet me then she had told me to keep out of the way during shooting after that she had wrapped her long black coat around her and walked away i hadnt yet seen brent foster gails costar in the movie he was being flown to argentina in his own private jet i hadnt met him but i felt that i knew him because i had seen so many of his movies he always played bad guys but he always got the girls he looked a little like me but he was younger and heavier and he had blond hair and blue eyes i was looking forward to meeting brent after a while i stopped thinking about my job and i looked out of the window at the clouds i wanted to help gail but i had to wait for something new to happen it was midmorning when the landed at ezeiza international airport outside buenos aires there was mist in the air and the weather was cool it took several hours to get all the baggage and equipment through customs at last it was done and we got into buses for the long journey to the city centre most of the movie crew were going to stay at the bisonte palace hotel in fact we had booked all the rooms in the hotel but gail carla brent and a few others were going to be at the luxurious alvear palace hotel near the recoleta cemetery where we would be shooting there was no work till the next day so after we had checked in at the hotel i lay on my bed and fell asleep when i woke it was early evening and it was dark i had a shower and then i went out for a walk i was going to meet rik and some of the members of the crew for dinner at ten oclock an early time for dinner in ba i walked slowly through the streets smelling the diesel smoke from the brightly painted collective buses the streets were full of people young people were walking hand in hand and large families were talking together on the sidewalks everyone seemed happy i began to like ba very much i soon arrived at corrientes a long wide street full of movie theatres restaurants and cafes i stopped at a place called cafe pernambuco and went in inside were groups of students talking excitedly elderly men reading newspapers and smartly dressed women eating cakes i ordered a coffee and sat back to enjoy the scene after a while i noticed a younger woman sitting by a window she was dressed in black with a black scarf over her head her head was turned away from me so i couldnt see her face she looked at her watch again and again and she looked up every time the cafe door opened i ordered another coffee and picked up a newspaper from a nearby table from behind the newspaper i could watch the woman in black without her seeing me suddenly she turned her head towards me and called to the waiter i saw the womans face it was gail lane i looked around the cafe where were annie and arabella her bodyguards then i remembered annies words sometimes she goes out at night without us gail was alone who was she waiting for chapter eight cafe pernambuco gail spoke to the waiter he smiled and a few moments later he returned with a cup of hot chocolate and a glass of water i watched gail for half an hour drinking my coffee slowly nobody joined her i asked the waiter for some orange juice too much coffee is bad for me and i went on watching after another hour and two more orange juices i had to go to the mens washroom when i came back gail was paying the waiter she was about to leave had someone come in and spoken to her or had she got tired of waiting i made a quick decision as gail was standing up i walked across the room as if i had just come in through the door i walked up behind gail and said in a quiet voice excuse me miss lane may i speak to you gail looked very frightened and she held on to the chair then she sat down i pulled out another chair i sat down and looked at gail her hands were white and they were shaking so it was you she whispered you what was me i asked it was you who sent the message gail whispered well im here what do you want miss lane believe me i didnt send you a message im here by chance i said looking into those beautiful green eyes youre not who you say you are she said you arrived at the studios on the day of josies accident but ive seen you before i know that youre right miss lane i replied we have met before in the street outside the purple palace in la it was the night when mike devine crashed his car into mine the night i took him home gail smiled for the first time so thats who you are she said quickly you helped me then and she stopped speaking and ill help you now i said finishing her sentence i working for the studio and theyve told me to do everything can to help you so here i am what can i do gail smiled again then she looked sad theres nothing you can do theres nothing anyone can do tell me your problem i said what about the message you mentioned what was the message gail opened her handbag pulled out an envelope and gave it to me inside it was a piece of alvear palace hotel notepaper i read the message if you want to have the photos go to cafe pernambuco avenida corrientes at pm sit at a table by the window i put the note back into the envelope what photos are those miss lane i asked quietly and what is so important about those photos what makes you come to a cafe you dont know to meet a person you dont know gail looked down at the table i she started i cant tell you she said you wouldnt believe me mr samuel tell me i said with what i hoped was a friendly smile gail took a deep breath you must keep this to yourself dont tell anyone she began im being blackmailed years ago when i was much younger when i was just starting to act i was friends with a man you need friends when youre a young actress this man helped me to meet people who worked in the movies it was all quite innocent we were just friends wed go out for a meal or to see a show sometimes wed go dancing in a club and the photos are of you and this man i interrupted yes i believe so gail replied theyre pictures of us dancing together at a club i thought for a moment and the name of this man is he someone important i asked gail laughed important no dangerous yes i didnt know that when i met him i thought he was a business man i didnt know he was a gangster and a murderer i thought he was just a kind person who was helping me to start working in the movies and his name i asked again hes changed his name since i first knew him she replied vincenzo calabrese was his name then vincent calab is what he calls himself now and now hell kill anyone who doesnt do what he tells them hes a madman mr samuel this was very bad news vincent calab was a wellknown gangster he was a ruthless criminal and he had a gang of ruthless men to carry out his commands so the message was from vincent i said no gail replied ive had similar messages before this is from someone whos somehow got some photos of vincent and me the last message said that unless i paid two hundred and fifty thousand dollars the photos would be sent to the newspapers mr samuel if those photos are printed in the newspapers my career will be finished if these messages arent from calab have you any idea who is blackmailing you i asked i wondered if it was someone working on the movie but i didnt say so gail shook her head she picked up the envelope and opened her handbag as she opened the bag i saw a small gun inside it i have to go gail said i dont think anyone is going to come no perhaps they just watched you this time to see if you obeyed their instructions i said ill walk with you to the alvear palace downtown buenos aires is a safe place but youre a star and someone might recognize you dont worry about me gail said ive got something here to protect me she touched her handbag if youre thinking of taking that gun onto the movie set tomorrow i said forget about it the security will be very tight here in ba then you take it gail said with a smile and give it to me tomorrow when were on the set ok i replied but let me walk back to the hotel with you now gail nodded i paid the waiter for my coffee and orange juice then we walked out into the evening air it was quite a long walk back to gails hotel we didnt talk a lot but it was a peaceful friendly time which both of us enjoyed outside the hotel i said goodbye i put gails gun into my pocket and i called for a cab to take me back to the bisonte palace as the cab drove through the busy streets i was a happy man just before going into the hotel gail had kissed me on the cheek chapter nine recoleta we start shooting tomorrow at nine at the recoleta cemetery rik said to me quietly during dinner ive hired a very good argentine security company to search everyone whos working on location i want you to stand with the security guys at the cemetery entrance len youll soon be able to recognize everyone so the next morning at half past seven i was standing at the entrance to the recoleta cemetery on calle junin opposite plaza alvear the recoleta district is one of the richest and smartest in buenos aires and the richest people in ba are buried in the graves in the cemetery we were going to shoot a scene in the cemetery a scene in which gail as a private detective had a meeting with an international criminal brent that morning calle junin was closed to traffic trucks full of movie equipment buses for the extras mobile dressingrooms for the stars and catering trucks were all parked in the calle junin electric cables joined the lights and the other equipment to powerful generators outside the cemetery standing next to me was a man called jose luis from the argentine security company his men and women were searching everyone as they arrived in my jacket pocket was gails gun in a mailing envelope fortunately no one had decided to search me gail and brent foster came from their mobile dressingrooms and stood at the cemetery entrance gail was looking worried as soon as she had been searched i gave her the mailing envelope excuse me miss lane i said this package is for you gail took the package and smiled at me for a moment then she walked into the cemetery by nine oclock carla was ready to begin shooting huge lights lit up the front of one of the biggest tombs in the cemetery the tomb was built of white stone and it was the size of a small house the front of the roof was decorated with lifesize white statues two cameras were going to shoot the scene one camera was lifted up in the air on a crane another was on metal rails laid on the ground when she edited the scene back at the studios carla would edit together shots from the two cameras carla sat in a big folding chair with director written on the back when everybody was ready she shouted cameras action brent foster wearing a white raincoat walked along a path towards the camera on rails then he stopped by the front of the tomb after a moment gail came running up to brent cut carla shouted brent i want you to look a bit more nervous gail that was great but id like you to look a little more excited please they repeated the scene seven times before carla was satisfied then we all stopped for coffee the makeup artists repaired brent and gails makeup the cameras moved to new positions soon another scene was being shot in front of the tomb this time it was a conversation between brent and gail i wasnt really bored but there wasnt anything for me to do annie and arabella were there to look after gail so i decided to take a walk around the cemetery the tombs were magnificent there were many styles of architecture but all the tombs showed the wealth of the people buried in them i must have been walking around for half an hour before i decided it was time to go back and check on the shooting i went towards the tomb where the movie crew was working i was thinking about gail and the messages she had received when i saw someone dressed in black lying on the ground beside the back wall of the tomb i ran quickly to see who it was it was annie her hands were tied behind her back and there was tape across her eyes and mouth i looked around carefully i felt that someone was watching me but i couldnt see anyone i walked very quietly along the side of the tomb towards the front at that moment something made me look up at the roof was someone hiding there all i could see was the line of white stone statues statues holding flowers statues holding plants statues holding books statues holding huge stone balls then one of the statues with a stone ball moved was i dreaming no the statue took a step forward towards the front edge of the roof and then stood still again i ran around to the front of the tomb as fast as i could gail and brent were still standing there in the bright lights of the set i looked up and saw the statue right above them the heavy stone ball was now raised above its head i dived forward pushing brent out of the way and throwing gail to the ground cut shouted carla crash the heavy stone ball hit the ground just where the two stars had been standing at that moment arabella jumped on top of me stay away from miss lane she shouted as she pulled me away from gail what do you think youre doing carla shouted at me theres no time to explain i replied running around to the back of the tomb closely followed by arabella but we were too late the statue had gone arabella untied annie and took the tape off her face what happened arabella asked someone jumped on me from behind annie muttered angrily i dont know who it was was it him arabella asked pointing at me i dont know annie replied it could have been we walked back to the set i explained to carla what had happened gail and brent were ok gail was laughing nervously and brent looked a bit shocked then i found rik and told him what had happened i knew trouble would find you len rik said with a smile i was right no i replied i was just lucky im pleased that i was able to save gail but it was only luck why dont you call the police rik looked away from me no len he said quickly we dont want to involve the police we have to go on to istanbul in three days time we cant change the schedule we cant wait for an investigation ok but theres another thing i said im meant to be advising gail on how private detectives behave i havent had a chance to speak to her about that yet making you her adviser was just a way to get you onto the set rik answered still i suppose youre right gail and brent are going to a tango show tonight with carla and me why dont you come along with us you can talk to gail there ok i said and one more thing i need some transport of my own this is a big city and i need to be mobile if im going to protect gail rik thought for a moment we can hire a car for you he said a motorbike would be better i replied it will be much quicker in heavy traffic ill see what i can do rik said i spent the afternoon on the movie set i watched brent and gail acting the same scene again and again movie schedules are made up of short periods of hard work followed by hours of standing and waiting but no one tried to kill gail no one tried to sell her any photographs gail didnt need the gun arabella and annie didnt attack me no statues moved i was bored when shooting ended for the day gail came over to me ive got to talk to you she said looking around to see if anyone was listening not here i said there are too many people here how about tonight at the tango show she stared at me how did you know about that our visit to the tango show was meant to be a secret i laughed im a detective i said chapter ten tango just before ten oclock that night i was sitting on a shiny harleydavidson motorbike parked by the sidewalk opposite the alvear palace hotel rik had hired this stunning machine for me to use while we were in ba to match the harleydavidson i was wearing a black suit with a blue tie and a white silk scarf and a blue crash helmet i watched the doors of the hotel carefully at ten oclock carla and brent came out a few moments later they were followed by gail who was wearing a long green dress the three of them stood together on the sidewalk suddenly a black limousine stopped beside them and i saw rik in the front of the car next to the driver carla brent and gail got into the back of the limo which drove off down avenida alvear i waited until it was a hundred metres ahead of me then i moved the harleydavidson out into the traffic behind it after a short time the limo turned on to the wide street called avenida de julio driving towards the la boca district i followed but i stayed a hundred metres behind it from that position i soon noticed a red ford which was driving about sixty metres behind the limo its just a coincidence i thought but when we left the avenida de julio and started to travel through much smaller streets the red ford stayed in the same position by the time we reached the narrow alleys of the la boca district it was obvious that the ford was either following the limo or that the people in it were going to the same tango show the limo stopped in a dark street outside what looked like a large private house the four passengers got out of the car and went into the house the limo drove away i slowed down and watched the red ford it parked fifty metres away from the large house and two young men got out they were wearing smart suits and they had short hair they walked quickly along the street and went into the house i locked the motorbike and walked up to the red ford there was a copy of the buenos aires herald on the back seat thats interesting i thought an english language newspaper perhaps the men are just tourists i went into the house a waiter led me into a restaurant with long tables and a stage at one end i joined rik carla and the movie stars at one of the tables for a couple of hours we ate it was an excellent meal and then at midnight the dancing started the show was great it was loud exciting and very lively but there was something sad about the music after an hour i had discovered that at an argentine tango show you only watch the performance you dont have to dance yourself i was pleased about that but i was sitting next to gail who wasnt pleased about it i want to dance too she said you cant i replied these are professional dancers who have spent their lives dancing the tango they dont want an american amateur joining in ill show you gail said standing up quickly a dance was just finishing and before i could stop her gail had jumped up onto the stage i called one of the male dancers over to our table and i spoke to him briefly in spanishhe nodded and smiled then he went back to the stage and when the music began again he started to dance with gail she was fantastic gail danced the tango as if she had been born in buenos aires we watched her in great surprise so did the two young men in suits who were sitting at another table at the end of the dance the other dancers applauded gail while she walked back to our table when she sat down her face was bright with excitement im an american amateur am i mister she said and what did you say to that dancer i thought for a moment then i told a lie i wanted gail to be happy i said that you were a famous american dancer i replied i said that he would enjoy dancing with you in fact id told him that gail couldnt dance the tango but that it was her birthday and she wanted to celebrate soon brent carla and rik went to the bar gail and i were alone you said you wanted to talk to me gail i said quietly i suppose i should thank you for saving my life at the cemetery gail said everything happened so quickly this morning if you hadnt been there that stone ball would have killed me i nodded perhaps you were very brave i said have you had any more messages gail shook her head no she said do you think that the person who has the photos is trying to kill me i dont know i replied but i dont think so whoever has the photos he wants you alive so that you can pay for them but whoever dropped the stone he wanted you dead gail opened her handbag heres the gun she said giving me the package will you bring it onto the set for me again tomorrow i feel much safer with it ok i said and i quickly put the envelope in my pocket as i saw brent carla and rik returning to our table are you having fun rik asked sure i answered were just talking about being a private eye i dont believe youre a detective at all gail said with a sudden smile prove it right i said do you see that table in the corner by the door the table with two men in dark suits sitting at it gail replied yes thats it i said those two men followed you here im going outside now when ive gone you go over to their table and ask them why they were following you i think that that will make them leave and then ill follow them ill find out who they are ok gail said lets try it i left the tango show and i went and sat on the harleydavidson i put the gun into one of the motorbikes big carriers my guess was right two minutes later the men in suits came hurrying out of the house and got into the red ford the engine started at once and they drove off as fast as they could along the narrow streets i followed them carefully soon we were out on the straight wide avenida de julio again and i had to stay closer to the ford so that i didnt lose it in the traffic the ford increased its speed and so did i theyve seen me i thought soon we were both travelling at over a hundred and twenty kilometres per hour it was nearly two oclock but there was still a lot of traffic on the streets the red ford moved easily between the slower cars the driver was very clever he was very clever but it was easy for me to follow the ford on the big motorbike i got behind the ford for a moment but it accelerated again it went through a red traffic light and i followed it so did a police car a few moments later i heard the sound of the police cars siren behind me then i saw the flashing light as the police car came alongside me a policeman in the front or the car shouted at me to stop so i slowed down and stopped the red ford drove on at high speed down the wide avenue que pasa a tall policeman asked me as we stood by the side of the road he told me to get off the motorbike and get into the back of the police car there was another policeman in the car he asked me in spanish for some identification i gave him my passport he looked at it for a minute when he spoke again he spoke in english so the policeman said as he handed my passport back to me you are a visitor to this country but you think you can break all the traffic laws speeding dangerous driving going through red traffic lights i can explain officer i began my name is garcia captain roberto garcia the policeman said captain garcia i began again i can explain i told the policeman about my job about the movie about gail and about the two men in the red ford yes we saw the men in the red ford the captain said and why did you stop me and not them i asked captain garcia smiled and shook his head i couldnt stop the car you were following it had diplomatic licence plates he said diplomatic plates which embassy did the car belong to i asked although i was sure i already knew the answer the united states of america senior captain garcia replied chapter eleven misunderstandings and messages i sat in the back of the police car on the avenida de julio and waited for captain garcia to charge me i waited for him to charge me with speeding dangerous driving and going through red traffic lights but he didnt charge me instead he took out a notebook and wrote something in it then he tore out the page he had written on i believe your story the captain said but you must obey our traffic laws im not going to charge you this time but if we catch you riding your motorbike dangerously again youll be in serious trouble i nodded and one more thing the captain said with a smile heres my phone number he passed me the piece of paper from his notebook if i can help you in any way call me muchas gracias i said i got out of the police car and onto the motorbike as i rode away very slowly on the harleydavidson i thought that i had been very lucky what would the captain have done if he had searched the motorbike and had found gails gun at seventhirty the next morning i was back at the recoleta cemetery i was standing by the gate with the argentine security chief watching everyone being searched i had already seen rik and told him about the chase the night before and about my meeting with the buenos aires police i didnt tell him about the gun a line of technicians and actors was waiting to be searched it was quite cold and the people in the line were becoming impatient because of the problem of the day before all the security guards were very careful and the search was taking a long time i saw annie and arabella near the front of the line and i waved to them i was trying to be friendly why arent you being searched arabella shouted to me i smiled and shook my head but when it was arabellas turn to be searched she refused there was an argument with one of the argentine security guards minutes went by and the other people in the line were becoming more and more impatient the security guard called for help on his radio and rik came running across to the gate hey whats all this rik asked arabella you know the rules everyones got to be searched i know that arabella replied i dont mind being searched but only after theyve searched this guy she pointed at me he hasnt been searched hes just standing and watching now everyone was looking at me i called to rik and he came to speak to me theres something ive got to tell you rik i said very quietly not now len rik replied get over to the front of the line and let them search you we must start shooting on time today rik theres been a misunderstanding i said come on arabella shouted whats the matter have you got something to hide i didnt move if he wont let the guards search him well search him ourselves annie said and before i could do anything she and arabella ran over and started to search my clothes they didnt find anything in my jacket or trousers then arabella said take off your boots very very slowly i took off my boots annie picked them up turned them upside down and shook them the package with gails gun in it fell out of my left boot annie grabbed the envelope tore it open and held the gun in the air i knew that there was something wrong about that guy arabella said rik took the gun he was very angry samuel he shouted youre fired go back to your hotel and wait for me there he turned to annie and arabella well done now lets get on with the search so we can start shooting i turned and walked away i got onto the harleydavidson and drove it slowly back to the hotel i waited for rik in reception i felt terrible i had been a fool why had i agreed to take gails gun onto the set for her it was a stupid thing to do an hour later rik came into the reception area of the bisonte palace why did you do it len he said shaking his head why were you carrying a gun you knew we would search everyone today its gails gun i explained i was bringing it onto the set for her shes frightened well you were stupid rik said you cant stay here any longer youll have to go back to la wait there for instructions from me weve only got three more days here before we move on to turkey ill try to find a way for you to join us in istanbul its very important that nothing bad happens to gail rik thought for a minute hey ive got an idea i know how we can get you onto the set in istanbul you can be one of the extras but people will recognize me i said no they wont rik said not after the makeup artists have finished working on you rik made some phone calls and booked me a flight to la on american airlines the flight was leaving that afternoon i packed my case wrote a note for gail which i left at the alvear palace and returned the harleydavidson to rik then i took a cab to ezeiza airport i checked in and went to sit on the high balcony overlooking the airline desks i bought a coffee and i thought again about what had been happening who had sent gail the messages about the photographs of her with a gangster who had injured josie and tried to kill gail and how was the us embassy involved i didnt have answers to any of these questions before i went to the plane i made three phone calls one was to captain garcia i explained that i had to leave argentina but i didnt explain why i told him i was worried about gail he replied that there wasnt much he could do when she was on the set but he said he would arrange for her to be guarded for the rest of the time my second phone call was to la i called an old friend called toni trenton she was a journalist on the la messenger she wrote about crime and criminals years ago i had been in love with toni but that wasnt why i called her i asked toni to find out all she could about three people gail lane mike devine and vincent calab my third call was to myself i called my answerphone in la to find out if there were any messages for me there was only one i listened to it it was brief samuel the voice said youve got to help me im in desperate trouble please call me on i recognized the voice it was mike devine chapter twelve lunch and information when i got back to la it was late evening i was very tired i went straight to my apartment and i went to bed the next morning i was up early and went for a run in the park i was still tired but i felt better after a shower and a good breakfast i got into the chrysler and drove downtown to my office i stopped at crazy ellens for a coffee and a chat with costas have you been away len costas asked i told him where id been some people have been looking for you costas said they said they knew you often came in here i drank my coffee slowly its nice to be popular i thought can you remember what these people looked like i asked costas has a very good memory he is proud of it well he said wiping the bar with a cloth the first visit was yesterday morning two heavies came in here they were real big guys in their twenties with mean faces real tough guys they werent police i think they were carrying guns they said they wanted to see you about a bet thats strange i thought but id been involved in a case about a missing racehorse a few weeks before some bad guys had been making illegal bets perhaps the heavies visit was connected with that and the second visit i asked costas also yesterday in the afternoon he said a young guy about twentyfive although he had grey hair he looked rich but he seemed really worried mike devine i thought i finished my coffee many thanks costas i said i left crazy ellens and went to my office there had obviously been some visitors there while i had been away they had emptied all the drawers of my desk and my filing cabinet onto the floor that was ok i never keep anything important at the office because people come and search it while im away i picked up some of the papers and put them back in the filing cabinet then i sat down at my desk and i called mike devine his answerphone took the call and i left a message mike was probably still asleep after that i called toni trenton and arranged to meet her for lunch she said shed already got some information for me we arranged to meet at pastroudis italian restaurant at one o clock i spent the rest of the morning tidying my office and calling mike devine but mike didnt pick up his phone his answerphone took the calls again i walked to pastroudis it wasnt far from the office i was sitting at my favourite table by the window when toni came in she had blue eyes short dark hair and a warm smile she was wearing a smart blue trouser suit she looked great i almost fell in love again then i remembered why we had broken up it had been nearly fifteen years before toni had said i had to choose between her and boxing she didnt like to see me being knocked about i had chosen boxing and she now had a successful career as a crime reporter on the la messenger toni kissed me on the cheek and we spent five minutes talking about what we had both been doing i told her about gail and argentina she told me about crime in la then we ordered our food right lenny toni said when the waiter had gone you asked me about three people do you want to hear about them i smiled and nodded ok first mike devine toni said he was the easiest theres so much written about him in the papers hes a playboy he goes out partying most nights hes only interested in pleasure and he has lots of money i added toni looked at me not any longer she said at least thats what people are saying his father got tired of paying mikes debts and told him to stop partying and get a job mike didnt listen so old joel devine stopped giving him money so where does mike devine get his money now i asked hes been borrowing lots of money from banks from people he knows from everywhere thats what people are saying now hes head over heels in debt toni replied now do you want to hear about gail lane next yes please i said as the waiter brought our food toni had seafood and rice and i had lobster toni ate her lunch and told me gails story gails interesting she said you know about her friendship with mike devine of course i think that hes been borrowing money from her too thats one thing youd think that it would be easy for me to find out lots of other things about a movie star but it wasnt easy nobody knows much about her gail became a star quite recently before that she certainly spent time with gangsters ill tell you more about that in a minute but some people say that recently shes also been involved with a us senator senator theo z democrates i knew about senator democrates he was from a greek family he was single he had never married and he was one of the most powerful men in the government he was the chairman of an important government committee he was also multimillionaire mmm thats interesting i said democrates is an honest man but he has a reputation for ruthlessness and a lot of ruthless people work for him i ate my lobster thoughtfully some things were beginning to become clear vincent calab was the third name toni said and i expect you know a lot about him already hes a ruthless man too hes a gangster from chicago who moved here ten years ago and got involved with the movie industry people say that he has been laundering money they say he invests illegal money stolen money in movies when the movies make a profit he gets his money back and then the money is legal lots of criminals do that kind of thing hollywood could be a good place to do moneylaundering making movies takes a lot of money yeah i see what you mean i said calabs an unpleasant man toni went on hes a madman hes very violent he kills anyone who works against him but the police have never been able to charge him with any crime hes really very dangerous because he isnt quite sane some people call him mad vince i hope youre not getting involved with him lenny no i replied but i think gail lane was innocently involved with him some years ago yes toni said i heard about that too stay away from calab lenny hes a very bad guy i didnt reply i was thinking about the visitors who had searched my office i thought they were the two heavies that costas had told me about and i also thought they might be calabs men perhaps i was involved with him whether i liked it or not we finished eating i thanked toni for her help and asked if i could borrow her mobile phone i dialled mike devines number and this time i got a reply come to the apartment will you mike said i need your help toni and i sat and talked for a little while longer then as usual we argued over who was going to pay for the meal as usual toni won the argument she was still sitting at the table when i left pastroudis she was lovely perhaps i had made a mistake when i chose boxing i thought a big mistake chapter thirteen miss sullivan and mr x i took a cab to hollywood boulevard the doorman with the moustache recognized me and he called mike devine to tell him i was on my way up to apartment mike was waiting by the elevator and led me into his livingroom he looked tired and worried what can i do for you mike i asked as i sat on a white sofa why didnt you call me back before mike devine asked angrily i smiled firstly because i was in argentina and secondly because im still waiting for you to pay me two hundred and fifty dollars i replied oh im sorry i guess i forget about that mike said and took out a chequebook he quickly wrote a cheque and gave it to me is this a good cheque i asked waving it in the air will your bank pay me the money of course its a good cheque mike said angrily what do you mean samuel what do you know you told me you were in big trouble and i heard a story that it was money trouble i said so i wondered if there was any money in your bank to pay this cheque mike devine put his hands over his face youre right he said in a dull voice im broke i havent got a cent but thats not all im in worse trouble than that do you want to tell me about it i asked and i sat back on the sofa mike began to speak it was a long story and toni trenton had told me some of it already mike had borrowed money from everyone he knew then a week before he had had a visitor it was the day after you brought me home from the purple palace mike explained in the afternoon the doorman called to say there was a woman to see me a woman called miss mary sullivan i didnt recognize the name but i have a lot of friends he waved his hand in the air anyway the woman came up here and i asked her what she wanted what did she look like i asked midthirties nice clothes short brown hair she talked in a very polite and formal way mike replied but what she said really frightened me she said that she represented a powerful person he went on she called this person mr x she wouldnt give me his real name she said that mr x had bought most of my debts he had paid the people i had borrowed money from so now i owed the money to him over eight hundred thousand dollars she said wow i said thats a lot of money and mr x wanted his money now the woman told me mike continued i explained that i couldnt pay even this apartment is owned by my father then miss sullivan said that there was another way for me to pay off the debt i had to leave la at once and promise never to see gail lane again if i kept my promise for a year mr x would forget about the debt and what did you say i asked what could i say mike devine replied i agreed to go miss sullivan gave me seventytwo hours to leave la but youre still here mike i said mike devine started to cry yes i cant go i cant live without gail i love her even if she doesnt love me and all my friends are here in la i dont know where to go have you heard from miss sullivan again i asked yes the day before yesterday mike replied thats why i called you she told me that i had broken our agreement by not leaving i asked for more time and she gave me until tomorrow morning she said that i had to call her tomorrow evening from somewhere a long way from la did she say what would happen if you didnt leave la i asked yes she said that i had cheated people and told lies to get money from them she said i would go to prison mike devine stopped then after a while he spoke again slowly and sadly all my life ive had everything ive wanted he said if i went to prison i would have nothing my father wont help me he says that prison would be good for me but hes wrong i would die if i went to prison youve got to help me samuel what can i do i smiled well i dont have eight hundred thousand dollars to lend you i said my advice is to do what mr x wants but im broke i dont have any money at all i cant afford to stay anywhere mike replied well ive got a cabin up in the hills at a place called crystal lake i said its a long way from la i suggest you go there now and do what miss sullivan told you to do call

her phone number mike gave me the number and i told him how to find crystal lake i gave him the name of a farmer there who kept a key to my cabin i hadnt been up to crystal lake for many months it was a place i used to go to when i wanted to do some fishing over the years i had caught a lot of fish in the lake near the cabin i dont know how to thank you mike devine said you must think im a bad person well i said you certainly are in lots of trouble im not going to be able to help you much after today im going to europe soon but ill do what i can enjoy yourself at crystal lake try to catch some big fish when i got back to my office i rang my friend hank hank works for the phone company this is len i said can you give me some help hank will you check this phone number on your computer i want to know whose number it is i gave hank the number mary sullivan had given mike then i waited while he checked his computer ive got it hank said a minute later its the private office of senator theo z democrates i have an address for the office i noted down the address and i thanked hank this was interesting news theo democrates was the senator toni had told me about the man who might have been involved with gail i put down the phone and it started to ring almost immediately i answered it it was rik lenny hi how are things rik has something happened to gail i asked no dont worry rik said quickly the movies going well now and were getting ready to leave for istanbul the day after tomorrow i want you to join us there thats why im calling you ive spoken to mr frank about you go to the magic movie productions studios now go to the main office mr franks secretary will give you an envelope in it youll find an air ticket and some instructions a makeup artist and someone from the costume department are already in istanbul and they will know what to do with you but rik i said i was puzzled what do you mean why do i need to see costume and makeup people im not an actor youre going to be brent fosters double rik replied you look and sound a lot like him when youre made up people will think you are him chapter fourteen a new man i left my office and drove to the magic movie productions studios i asked for mr franks office at gate four and was sent to a large administration building i waited and after ten minutes i was taken to mr franks office i had expected to talk to a secretary but i was taken in to see mr frank himself homer frank was a tall bald man with a neat grey beard he walked round his huge desk to shake my hand make yourself comfortable he said pointing to some leather armchairs in one corner of the enormous office i wanted to see you myself before you left for istanbul your air ticket and riks instructions are in this he handed me a long thin brown envelope i hope that rik has told you how important it is for this studio that nobody hurts gail death behind the door is going to be a blockbuster and nothing must stop us finishing it and its important that gail shouldnt know anything about the threats she would worry and that would upset her then she wouldnt act well i think shes already worried i replied and i told mr frank about the attack on gail in the recoleta cemetery yes i know about that the studio boss replied rik called me soon after it happened and before that there was josies accident yeah josies accident theres one thing i wanted to ask you mr frank i said rik told me that you had received the death threats against gail by email thats correct frank said i dont know a lot about computers i went on but isnt the address of the sender usually given on an email message where did the messages come from homer frank looked out of the window as he answered i dont know he replied quickly when i switched on my computer the messages were waiting for me but there was no senders address could i see the messages there might be some clues in them i said frank shook his head no im afraid i deleted the messages after i read them just then a secretary came into the room excuse me mr frank he said but theres an urgent phone call for you who is it frank asked the caller wouldnt give his name its a man and he says hes a friend of vincent the secretary replied then he left the room homer franks face suddenly looked much older he walked across to his desk and picked up a red phone then he sat on the desk with his back towards me it was a short phone call frank said yes three times and no twice then he put the phone down and sat still and silent after a minute he got up and walked back to the corner where i was sitting youll have to excuse me samuel he said abruptly theres some urgent work which i must do go to istanbul and make sure that nothing bad happens to gail i left the administration building and got into my chrysler i sat and thought for a while before looking in the envelope i had in my hand my conversation with homer frank had been a waste of time but i still had a job to do and something was wrong about those email messages had frank really received them had he lied about them and who was the friend of vincent whose phone call had upset frank so badly finally i opened the envelope it contained an american airlines ticket to new york and a turkish airlines ticket from new york to istanbul the american airlines flight was going to leave at nine oclock that night i looked at my watch it was nearly five oclock i drove quickly back to my apartment packed my bag and took a cab to la international airport soon i was sitting in the departure lounge reading riks instructions on arrival at ataturk airport take a cab to the swissotel rooms for the whole movie crew have been booked there we will all arrive the next day on a direct flight from buenos aires at the swissotel contact julie grant the makeup artist and steve tovich from the costume department they know what to do the plane tickets are in your name but your hotel room is booked in the name of alan davies that will be your name in istanbul i caught the turkish airlines flight in new york and i enjoyed my first turkish meal as we flew over the atlantic i hadnt visited europe for ten years and this was going to be my first visit to turkey i was looking forward to exploring istanbul and i read a guidebook during the flight to prepare myself there were long lines of passengers at the immigration desks when we landed at ataturk airport several planes must have landed at the same time and it took me an hour to reach a polite immigration official who quickly put a stamp in my passport after that bad start everything got better and better it was late afternoon and the weather was very warm the cab driver who took me to the hotel was friendly and he pointed out the sights on the way the swissotel was amazing it was a huge building with wonderful views over the bosphorus the channel which divides europe from asia the water was full of ships and boats of all kinds i checked in and found a message from julie grant waiting for me you must be very tired get a good nights sleep and call me in the morning im in room good advice i thought i had a shower and then a fine dinner in a splendid diningroom my table was near one of the huge windows night was falling and the bosphorus was covered with little moving points of light it was very beautiful after dinner i went for a walk in the hotel grounds but at ten oclock i was ready for bed i slept for twelve hours and when i woke i was a new man alter breakfast i called room julie grant and steve tovich came to see me in my room almost immediately julie had a box containing makeup and steve was carrying a bag of clothes i dont know how youre going to do this i said as julie opened her box brent is five years younger than me and at least twenty kilos heavier also hes got blue eyes and short straight blond hair julie replied no problem just relax and youll soon see what we can do but the makeup isnt just for a scene in the movie i went on nervously im going to have to look like brent for several days because i mustnt look like me relax steve said theres no problem so i relaxed first of all julie washed my hair then she bleached it and dyed it so that it looked blond next she cut it in brents style after that she changed the shape of my eyebrows and put a pair of blue contact lenses into my eyes lastly she put a layer of latex on the lower part of my face to make it look wider you can have a shower and wash your hair without changing any of this julie said then she started to work with brushes and paints to make my face look like brents after julie had finished it was steves turn he fastened some padding around my chest to make my body look fatter then he took some clothes out of his bag they were the kind of clothes brent wore he told me there were lots of them i put some of them on amazing i said as i looked in the mirror both julie and steve clapped their hands and smiled now julie said as they were getting ready to leave the flight from buenos aires arrives later this afternoon i suggest that you spend the next few hours getting used to your new self heres a video containing scenes from some of brents movies watch it then try to move and talk like him they left and i looked at myself in the mirror i was brent foster it was incredible at four oclock the phone rang it was gail lane lenny im in the hotel and ive had another message she said chapter fifteen topkapi gail i said how do you know my room number im called alan davies here rik told me about his plan lenny gail replied im so happy that youre working on the movie again wait until you see me i said i want to see you now gail said i want to show you this message it was waiting for me here at the hotel i thought carefully this was the time to find out what gail thought about my new self im going down to reception for a few minutes i said if you dont find me there come up to my room in fifteen minutes ok lenny ill see you gail said and she hung up i took the elevator down to reception and i sat in a corner seat i picked up a newspaper gail soon appeared and she took a seat by one of the tall windows i put down my newspaper and walked across to her she looked at me in surprise then she smiled brent my dear are you feeling better she asked i smiled back and nodded my head im so pleased gail went on you had such a terrible headache on the plane i smiled again waved and walked over to the elevator the makeup was great i now looked so much like brent that his costar couldnt see that i was really lenny samuel i went back to my room after ten minutes there was a knock at the door come in i shouted i tried to sound like brent gail came into the room then stopped what are you doing here she said i thought this was lennys i mean alan davies room i smiled stood up and kissed her cheek hi gail i said in my own voice lenny gail said that makeup is fantastic i saw brent ten minutes ago in reception you look just like him that was me in reception i replied with a smile please sit down gail she immediately became serious again this was waiting for me when i arrived she said and she handed me a small white envelope the swissotel address was printed on the envelope and the message inside it was written on swissotel notepaper its just like the message in buenos aires i thought that was on alvear palace notepaper welcome to istanbul miss lane i read you waited at the cafe pernambuco in buenos aires that showed that you could be trusted you can have the photos on your return to california but you will have to pay for them i will contact you again in la i gave the message back to gail im very worried she said im not worried about the money i can afford to pay but if i pay for these photos now how will i know there are no more copies of them you wont and im sure there are i said but this is one problem that can wait until we get back to la when this person contacts you again ill be around to find out who the blackmailer is youre wonderful lenny gail said with a little smile i didnt say anything gail went to her room to get some rest soon my phone rang again this time it was rik he said he was on his way up to see me wow rik said a few minutes later julie and steve did a great job you too len you look and sound just like brent now let me tell you whats going to happen tomorrow were shooting at the topkapi palace it would be good if you visited the area by yourself today look around the outside of the palace and explore the streets which lead to it youre going to be brents double tomorrow youll have no problems getting onto the set ive arranged a pass for you in the name of alan davies all youve got to do tomorrow is to sit and watch the shooting then very early the next day well shoot the last outdoor scenes here in turkey first well shoot the scene in which youll be brents double in that scene brent and gail are together and brent drives gail away from the palace in a ford mustang not many people know this rik went on but brent cant drive a car hes frightened of cars so youll act in the first part of the car chase instead of brent what do you mean by car chase rik i asked yeah well when brent drives gail away in the mustang another car follows it down the hill towards the golden horn later on well shoot a real car chase through istanbul we dont need the stars to be involved in that well use stuntdoubles dressed like the movie actors but the first part the escape from topkapi has to be shot in closeup it has to look real rik explained so you and gail will be in the car all you have to do is to drive quite quickly down the hill the mercedes containing the bad guys will follow you that sounds easy i replied then i asked rik about the last couple of days of shooting in ba no problems rik said there was one strange thing though at ezeiza airport an argentine police captain called garcia spoke to me he said that he had been keeping an eye on gail too do you know anything about that len whos garcia a friend of mine i said with a smile im glad to hear that nothing bad happened arabella and annie still believe that you were involved in the attack at the recoleta cemetery rik added i hope they dont recognize you in this makeup they will make a lot of trouble if they do gail is the only other person who knows that alan davies is really lenny samuel soon rik said goodbye and went off to get some sleep i took a cab to the topkapi palace i had my guidebook with me but i didnt read it i looked out of the window of the cab at the fascinating city of istanbul i had read enough to know that the topkapi palace was over five hundred years old when i got there i discovered that the palace was much much bigger than i had thought it was the guidebook said that the four magnificent courtyards and the surrounding buildings had once been the home of more than five thousand people it was going to be difficult to protect gail in such a large area i spent an hour walking around the outside of the palace there was no time to go into any of the beautiful buildings that day i tried to remember which streets led away from the gateway down to the golden horn standing outside the palace entrance i looked out over the bosphorus and the sea of marmara and then down the hill to sultanahmet square and aya sofia i walked down to aya sofia and looked at that magnificent building which was more than fifteen hundred years old first it had been a church and then a mosque but now it was a museum it was stunning i walked for a while among the crowds of people in the streets i liked istanbul though it was as different from la as anything could be at last i waved for a cab and rode back to the hotel i was excited about the next couple of days pretending to be a movie star was going to be fun chapter sixteen mustang and mercedes at six oclock the next morning buses took the technicians extras and most of the other people who were needed that day to the topkapi palace there a hundred turkish workers were waiting for us and the crew started to prepare the sound system the lighting and the cameras a row of trailers was parked outside the palace these were the mobile dressingrooms and the makeup department soon dozens of policemen were needed to keep the crowd away from the crew even at this early hour many people wanted to watch what was happening as it was a tuesday the palace itself was closed to visitors all day the crowd became excited at seven oclock when gail and brent arrived in a long black limousine carla was already on the set working with the lighting cameraman i was just leaving one of the makeup trailers when the two stars arrived julie grant had been repairing my makeup i wasnt needed for that days shooting but carla wanted to see me standing next to brent she wanted to check that we looked the same carla thought that i was a double called alan davies of course and i wanted her to go on believing that hey man a voice said and i felt a hand on my shoulder i turned around and saw that it was the real brent foster well i just cant believe this brent said as he looked at me ive had lots of doubles in my time but none of them looked as good as you he held out his hand i took his hand and shook it the names davies alan davies i said its a great pleasure to meet you at that moment carla came over and looked at the two of us carefully for a few seconds i was worried wonderful she said which of you is the double ill see you later alan brent said and walked off towards his dressing room the morning passed slowly carla was shooting some outdoor scenes of gail and brent running through the courts of the topkapi being chased by two men in red tshirts i wasnt in any of the scenes i didnt think gail was in any danger that morning arabella and annie were with her when she wasnt on the set i was pleased that neither of them recognized me i had never really found out what the story of the movie was so i asked julie about it i dont know either she replied none of us knows really not even the actors thats carlas way of working she shoots lots of scenes and then puts the story together during editing back at the studios in la i see i said although i really didnt understand at all but the actors must know who they are playing for example the two men in red tshirts what parts are they playing theyre the bad guys in the movie julie replied brent is playing a criminal but he isnt a real bad guy the men in tshirts are playing new york gangsters i do know that but im not sure why theyre chasing brent and gail in this scene well thanks i said and went and sat down in a cool part of the courtyard the sun was getting hotter by midday it was very hot indeed in the late afternoon i watched the technicians lay the metal rails for the camera to run on this was near the imperial gate the main entrance to the palace gail and brent were going to run across the courtyard and out through the gate then shooting would stop for the day very early the next morning we would start again this time it would be gail and me running out of the imperial gate and getting into the ford mustang i was going to be in a movie i was so excited i could hardly sleep that night i neednt have got so excited we arrived at the set at four oclock the next morning we had to shoot the scene before there was much traffic on the roads it took nearly an hour to get the cameras and lights in the right positions then carla asked gail and me to rehearse our scene we had to run out of the gate and get into the car who would have thought that a simple thing like getting into a car could he so difficult carla made us do it again and again then she shot the scene three times each time she changed the position of the cameras after that she did some shots of me closing the car door and starting the engine i had to do this several times too ok alan carla said as she put her head in through the car window that was fine now i want you to start the car and drive away remember you are being chased i want a real fast start spin the car wheels as you start the car the two guys in red will come running out of the gate and they will reach the car just as you drive off then theyll get into the mercedes and follow you well be behind both cars in these carla pointed to two trucks with cameras on them just go down the hill as far as the tramlines but dont let the mercedes catch you she said itll be easy ok i hope so i said with a nervous smile when carla walked away gail touched my arm dont worry lenny youll be fine she said it wasnt as easy as carla had said the first time i tried to do a highspeed start the cars engine stopped the second time i spun the wheels so much that a cloud of smoke and dust came up from the ground the cameramen couldnt see us the third time i started too quickly and the guys in red couldnt reach our car before we drove away carla was very patient ok lets do it once more she said with a smile cameras action i tried again this time it was good the mustang shot forward as the two men in red shirts came running out of the imperial gate they just reached the mustang as we drove away with our wheels spinning and our tyres screaming then they jumped into a black mercedes which was waiting with its engine running i looked in the drivingmirror as i drove away from the topkapi palace the mercedes was just swinging out behind us behind the mercedes were the two trucks with cameras on them i felt great we had done it i looked at gail the windows were open and her hair was blowing in the wind she looked beautiful watch the road lenny gail said and stop looking at me but she laughed we were outside the palace area now and although it was only halfpast five there was quite a lot of traffic on the road i had to go slowly behind a crowded minibus and the mercedes got much closer to us looking quickly in the drivingmirror i overtook the minibus and i put my foot down but the mercedes continued to get closer i put my hand on the horn the loud sound made a group of people who were crossing the road jump out of the way the black mercedes was coming closer and closer but the camera trucks were now far behind they couldnt get any shots from that distance something was wrong this wasnt meant to happen i shouted to gail as i swerved to avoid a bus carlas going to make us do this scene again gail didnt reply she was staring in horror at an old man who was pushing a cart across the road in front of us i hit the brakes the tyres screamed then i put my foot down on the accelerator again and turned the steering wheel hard we rushed past the cart missing it by a few centimetres but a moment later there was a crash as the mercedes hit it pushing it off the road i looked in the mirror and i was pleased to see that the old man was ok even if his cart wasnt but the mercedes was getting close to us again and soon it was only a few metres behind us bang the mercedes hit the back of the mustang fortunately the road in front was clear and i put my foot down again crack crack two gun shots what was happening i looked in the mirror again the passenger in the mercedes was leaning out of his window with a gun in his hand this was definitely not meant to happen i shouted to gail get down shut up and drive faster she replied from the floor of the car i pushed the accelerator to the floor chapter seventeen the bridge over the golden horn i looked in the drivingmirror and saw that the mercedes had been stopped by a tram which was crossing in front of it i slowed down a little and turned right starting to drive back towards the centre of the city i thought that if we were in a crowded place the passenger in the mercedes wouldnt use his gun again i hadnt even started to think about who these people were or why they were trying to kill us i tried hard to remember the map from my guidebook the mustang raced through the narrow streets towards the railway station there were more people here and i used the horn all the time this didnt help very much as all the other drivers were doing the same everybody does it in istanbul then i saw some water between two buildings and realized where we were we were near the pier where all the bosphorus ferries start their journeys crack another shot id guessed that the man in the mercedes wouldnt use his gun in crowded places it wasnt a very good guess i looked down at gail who was sitting on the floor of the car the safest place to be i drove the mustang through the crowds and came out on to a wider road by the side of the bosphorus the road which led to the wide galata bridge the galata bridge crosses the part of the bosphorus which is called the golden horn as we got near the bridge i looked in the drivingmirror and saw that the mercedes was very close to us again but i also saw another car a small blue fiat it was right behind the mercedes and going very fast oh no i thought there are two cars chasing us now ahead of me a traffic light changed to red i closed my eyes and put my foot down hard we crossed the junction safely behind us the mercedes and the fiat were stopped by the buses and trucks crossing in the other direction i told gail it was safe to get up and i was pleased to see how calm she was out of the corner of my eye i saw a broken metal barrier there was another red light but i didnt stop in a moment we were driving onto the bridge we could see the galata tower on the other side of the golden horn if we could get out of the car on the other side of the bridge we could run into the narrow streets near the tower we could escape the gunman but suddenly the mercedes was a hundred metres behind us again following us onto the bridge i heard the noise of a siren good i thought the police are coming we were on the wide bridge with the blue water beneath us in one minute we would be safe but then i looked in the mirror and i saw the mercedes right behind us again and the blue fiat was still behind the mercedes crack there was another shot and gail got down onto the floor again sooner or later one of these bullets was going to hit us i decided the time had come to fight back the bridge was wide and there wasnt any other traffic on it that was very strange but it was useful i braked hard very suddenly i pulled the steering wheel round and using the handbrake i turned the car right around now we were facing the mercedes i put my foot on the accelerator and i drove straight at it the driver of the mercedes tried to swerve to avoid a crash the mustang and mercedes just touched each other but that was enough the mercedes skidded sideways and the blue fiat which was right behind it crashed into it i turned the mustang round again and started to drive back over the bridge but suddenly the car was going slower and slower it was like climbing up a steep hill and the view ahead was changing i couldnt see the galata tower any more only sky then i realized what was happening the galata bridge was opening the galata bridge is made in two halves it can open in the middle each half of the bridge can swing upwards so that big ships can pass along the golden horn and the bridge was opening now and we were driving towards the gap in the middle we were going to drop off one end of the roadway into the water below i hit the brakes the tyres screamed and we stopped right on the end of our half of the bridge are you ok i asked gail who was still on the floor fine she replied lets get out of here she got up onto her seat what the hell she said when she saw where we were a moment later gail opened her door then she screamed theres just water below me lenny she said i cant get out of the car i think we can both get out on my side i replied quickly we must try before the car falls into the water i started to open my door and started to get out but as i moved the car started to tip forward the mustang was balanced right on the end of the roadway every time i moved the car moved too we were trapped in the car then we looked at what was happening behind us two men in dark suits had got out of the blue fiat and they had taken charge they had pulled the driver and the passenger out of the mercedes and they had taken the passengers gun now one of the men from the fiat was guarding the two men in red tshirts and the other was talking into a mobile phone the man with the phone looked at our car he said something to his partner and he started to climb up the bridge towards us he had to crawl forward on his hands and knees he stopped when he saw that the mustang was balanced on the end of the bridge he was still a few metres away from us but i could see that he was about thirty a handsome man with bright eyes you must be miss lane he said to gail im sergeant kamal of the istanbul police your embassy asked me to make sure that nobody hurt you while you were in our city then he looked at me why did you drive onto the bridge sir he asked i know the barrier is broken but didnt you see the red light didnt you hear the siren which sounds when the bridge is going to open i didnt know what to say so i just smiled well dont move sergeant kamal said well soon get you down from here he neednt have worried we werent going to move i watched the sergeant crawl back down towards the bridge entrance lots of traffic was stopped there and a large crowd of people was standing and watching us i wondered what sergeant kamal was going to do it would be impossible to bring a truck or a crane up the steep slope of the bridge gail and i sat and waited then suddenly she started to talk to me she talked quickly and seriously lenny she began i havent told you all of the truth about myself theres something you ought to know chapter eighteen gails story gail and i sat in the mustang hanging over the end of the galata bridge above the blue waters of the golden horn theres someone i must tell you about gail said you already know about the photos of me dancing with vincent calab well hes not the only man ive been involved with there have been two others one of them is mike devine ive been going out with him for several years but hes really only a friend i dont see him very often any more because he started to borrow money from you i guessed gail looked at me in surprise how did you know she asked i smiled mike told me that hed been borrowing money from everyone he knew i guessed that included you i replied mikes a nice guy when he isnt drinking gail said but when he drinks too much hes an enemy to himself he has other enemies too i said what do you mean lenny gail asked i told her about my meeting with mike devine in la i told her that i had lent him my cabin in crystal lake i told her about mary sullivan gail was silent for a minute mmm she said having to leave la is probably the best thing that could happen to mike who do you think miss sullivan is working for i asked i dont know gail replied what do you think well she told mike to leave la but she also told him not to see you again gail i said thats very interesting isnt it gail sighed but she didnt say anything i think miss sullivan works for someone whos very important i said someone with enough power to order men from the us embassy in buenos aires to follow you someone with enough power to ask the turkish police to protect you sergeant kamal isnt an ordinary policeman gail can you think who this person might be gail looked out over the blue water i said there was something i wanted to tell you she said i said i had been involved with two other men please listen a minute and stop asking me questions there is someone important in my life she went on hes someone ive known for about eighteen months we are engaged to be married but its still a secret youre right hes a very powerful man but hes also a very jealous one hes a politician and hes afraid that if theres any scandal about us he wont be elected wait a minute i said if we are talking about senator democrates hes already been elected so whats the problem how did you know i was talking about theo gail asked never mind youre right lenny it is theo democrates hes been elected to the senate of course but he wants to be the next president when i first met you i thought you were one of the people he pays to look after me i shook my head no i replied its true that im here to protect you but magic movie productions hired me not senator democrates the studio why did the studio hire you gail asked the studio hired arabella and annie as my bodyguards i decided to tell gail the truth she knew now that someone was trying to kill her i told her that homer frank had received messages which threatened her life i understand i know this movie is very important for the studio gail said then she sat silently for a few minutes time passed the mustang moved gently whenever one of us moved the crowd of people at the entrance to the bridge stood and stared at us then i heard the sound of a large engine in the distance it was coming closer was it a ship moving towards the bridge i was worried but gail seemed not to hear the noise suddenly sergeant kamal crawled up to the mustang again and told us that help was coming soon please sit still and do nothing he said and crawled back towards the crowd theres something else lenny gail said i told you that i hadnt been in contact with vincent calah for years thats not true he called me a couple of weeks ago what did he say i asked it wasnt what he said that scared me gail replied it was how he said it he was horrible he sounded completely mad the message was very simple he said that if i didnt want to get hurt i should stop working on death behind the door he didnt explain why he just told me to leave the movie he was giving me an order and what did you say i asked well i dont like people giving me orders i told him that she answered with a quick smile he started shouting so i hung up i dont expect people do that to him very often i said but we need to know why calab wants to stop the movie and im sure well find the answer to that question back in hollywood the sound of the engine i had heard was getting louder and louder whats that noise gail asked suddenly we both tried to look out of the car but our movements made the mustang move so we sat still again then sergeant kamal and another policeman came crawling up towards us with two long chains in their arms the engine noise was very loud now and suddenly there was a great shadow over the car we could not look up the two policemen seemed to be fastening the chains to the back wheels of the mustang then the sergeant fixed the chains together over the cars roof the noise got even louder and suddenly a great hook came down from the sky had someone found a crane that could reach us i couldnt see one the mustang started to move the back of the car started to rise but the mustang was moving forwards further over the end of the bridge i held gails arm oh no i said were going to fall with a noise like a scream the mustang slid slowly off the end of the bridge and it started to fall towards the blue sea then suddenly we stopped falling and we were swinging slowly from side to side a moment later we were moving upwards gail and i looked at each other in amazement i must be dreaming gail said i leant out of the window and looked up above us were the two giant rotors of a chinook helicopter i looked down and saw the galata bridge far below us youre not dreaming i said to gail with a laugh were flying chapter nineteen hollywood again the turkish air force chinook did not carry the mustang very far it carried the car carefully to the road near the bridge entrance first the front wheels touched the ground then the back wheels were gently lowered two policemen quickly removed the chains from the hook and the helicopter flew away what a pity the flight was so short gail said i wanted to see istanbul from the air sergeant kamal was waiting for us when we got out of the car youre wonderful gail said to him you saved our lives i dont know how to thank you sergeant kamal smiled the two men who were chasing you in the mercedes were americans he said but they werent members of your movie crew ive been talking to your director miss chapman at topkapi palace the two men who should have been in the car have been found near the imperial gate they were unconscious they had both been hit on the head and tied up but they are ok now the men who chased you are being questioned at police headquarters so well soon know who they are working for the sergeant took us back to the movie set in a police car carla chapman was waiting for us are you both ok she asked we were so worried you drove away from the palace so fast it must have been terrifying gail told carla about our adventure on the galata bridge and about the helicopter carla was shocked when she heard about the danger to the star of her movie still theres one good thing carla said with a smile we got some really good shots of the car chase before you got too far from the cameras what a pity we couldnt shoot you on the bridge it wasnt possible to shoot any more scenes that day so we all went back to the hotel so there were still two more days of shooting to be done before we all went back to hollywood i wasnt needed as brents double any longer but i had to go on being alan davies of course i went to watch the shooting on both days i had plenty of time to think about gails problems on the second day i made two decisions the first was to go on using my brent foster clothes and makeup for a few days after we returned to la the second was to send a fax to homer frank from brent asking for an appointment to see him well go and see frank together i explained to gail and well find out what he really knows about these threats but ill go as brent not as myself so the morning after the long flight back from istanbul gail and i drove to gate four of the magic movie productions studios in hollywood gail was looking beautiful and i was still pretending to be brent foster i was wired for sound i had a microphone hidden in my clothes it would transmit to a tape recorder in my car every word that anyone near me said would be recorded the security guards at the gate took one look at us and let us through we were big stars we didnt have to wait at the entrance to the administration building either we were taken straight into homer franks huge office gail frank said its good to see you i was only expecting brent its a real surprise to see you too it was to be a morning of surprises the real brent foster got a surprise too though i only heard about it the next day he also came to the studios that morning but the security guards stopped him at the gate they wouldnt let him in they had already seen me go in with gail so they thought brent was someone pretending to be brent foster we got several surprises too our first surprise came a few minutes after we had sat down in the leather chairs in franks office the office door opened and franks secretary came in with his hands above his head he was followed by annie and arabella with their hands above their heads they were followed by two short men in long black jackets carrying long black guns and they were followed by a slim man in his fifties with shiny black hair he was wearing a beautiful suit i looked at gail i told arabella and annie wed be here she said quietly you can guess who the others are vincent calab the man in the beautiful suit stopped in surprise when he saw gail then he walked over to her took her hand and kissed it what the hell is going on homer frank asked in a high frightened voice who are you weve never met im sorry sir the secretary said this man told me that you were expecting him i knew you werent and i told him you were busy but he wouldnt listen to me thats right thats how i am calab said with a thin nasty smile i never listen to anyone i give the orders all i wanted was a little help from gail here gail who i helped so much in the past the gangsters voice rose suddenly from a whisper to a scream and what did she say to me no is what she said was i going to take that no i wasnt he looked around the room wildly gail said to him why have you been trying to kill me vincent you know why calab replied youre still alive though youre still alive because of a private eye a private eye who im still trying to find then calab turned to me mr foster im pleased to meet you sir i didnt say anything calab didnt know that the private eye had driven gails car as brents double now like homer frank he thought i really was brent but i was worried about calab he was very dangerous one minute he was calm and sane the next minute he was a madman you say that weve never met calab said to homer frank and that is true but youve taken a lot of my money havent you ive invested over one billion dollars in your stupid little studios im the person whos been paying your bills and now you have a movie thats going to be a big success i expected to get all my money back ive asked for it but you tell me that you wont give my money back you say that theres no evidence that i gave you any money calabs voice had been calm and quiet while he spoke to the chief executive but now it rose to a scream again no of course there isnt any evidence that was our arrangement there musnt be any evidence i gave you the dirty money so you could give it back to me clean then the gangster was calm again so you refuse to give me my money he said very well ill make sure that death behind the door is never finished with gail lane dead your studio will have no future if you dont agree to pay me the money now i will kill your star just wait a minute i said quickly i was angry and i forgot to speak like brent foster im only a stupid actor and there are some things that i dont understand lets start with josie why did you injure her we wanted to frighten miss lane calab replied that was a good way to do it and the stone ball in the cemetery in buenos aires i asked was that one of your tricks too yes that was a good trick wasnt it calab smiled one of my men hid in the cemetery overnight he was painted white and when you all arrived he stood on the roof with the stone ball but we were still only trying to frighten miss lane the ball would have missed her well i know you werent just trying to frighten gail in istanbul i said because i was in the car with her your men were trying to kill us calab smiled his thin smile again enough of your stupid questions he shouted of course i wanted to kill her with miss lane dead the movie couldnt be finished hey boss one of the gunmen said to calab theres something wrong here i go to the movies a lot and ive seen all of brent fosters movies this guy looks like brent but he doesnt talk like him are you sure hes really foster calab walked up to me and looked closely at my face then he quickly pulled off the layer of latex and scratched away some of my makeup with his fingernails so calab said he was pleased his voice was quiet but very dangerous weve found the private eye now he turned to frank will you pay me my money homer frank shook his head calab turned to his men ok shoot miss lane he screamed then lots of things happened very quickly arabella and annie were flying through the air at the two heavies with guns the women kicked the guns from the heavies hands at the same moment i jumped forward at calab but suddenly there was a small gun in his hand i grabbed calabs arm as he fired the gun the bullet missed me but i heard a scream from the other side of the room i pushed calabs arm behind his back he was a strong man and he fought wildly like an animal i looked over calabs shoulder in here lieutenant i shouted it was an old trick but the gangster was so angry that he fell for it as he looked round i kicked his legs and let go of his arm as he fell i kicked him hard on the side of his head i picked up calabs gun and looked around arabella and annie had won their fight with the two heavies and had taken their guns gail and the secretary were ok but there was blood on homer franks shoulder calabs bullet had hit him he was in a lot of pain but he would live i walked over to the desk and picked up the phone get me the lapd i said i want to speak to lieutenant dickinson gail and i spent the rest of the day at the studios with dickinson i told him about my hidden microphone the lieutenant listened to the tape recording of what had happened in franks office what do you think will happen to homer and vincent and his men gail asked me as we finally left the office vincent calab will get himself a good lawyer but his words are on the tape i replied and his words on the tape will send him to jail itll probably take months to find out if homer frank has really been laundering calabs money soon i said goodbye as gail drove off with arabella and annie i went to try and find rik my job was over and i wanted to get paid before everyone knew about frank and calab however rik wasnt in his office i waited for an hour then i left the studios and drove back to my own office the red light on my answerphone told me that i had some messages there were two calls for me i pressed the button and listened to the first one it was gail lenny when i got home there was a letter for me a letter about the photos please call me as soon as you can chapter twenty the end i called gail at once the letter says that i have to take the two hundred and fifty thousand dollars to the studios this afternoon at four oclock gail told me i have to wait alone in the gate four parking lot near the phone booth then ill get another message ok i replied get the money and do what the letter says ill be there too but you wont see me dont bring arabella and annie are you sure lenny gail asked anxiously im really worried yes im sure i replied ill talk to you later i put down the phone and i thought for a moment then i played the second message on the answerphone it was mike devine phoning from crystal lake hi samuel he said im having a great time up here i caught some real big fish yesterday its so good here i dont even miss la thanks again for your help well i thought thats one satisfied client although of course he hadnt paid me yet except with a bad cheque i opened one of the drawers of my filing cabinet and i pulled out a phone repairmans uniform and a toolbox then i phoned costas i asked him to lend me the ladder that he keeps for working on the roof of his bar at three oclock i was back at the studios dressed as a phone repairman and carrying costas ladder and my toolbox i showed the security guard at gate four a phone company pass which id got from hank the guard let me through i climbed up on to the roof of a low building near the parking lot and i pretended to work on the phone lines exactly at four oclock gail arrived in her car i saw her park in the far corner of the lot near a phone booth i took a pair of binoculars out of my tool box and i watched gails car at fourfifteen the phone in the booth rang gail got out of her car to answer it she was carrying a plastic bag which i thought must contain the money she answered the phone and listened for a moment then she left the booth got back in her car and drove away she had left the plastic bag in the booth i waited five minutes later i saw a man walk across the parking lot to the phone booth he had an envelope in his hand which he put on top of the phone in the booth then he picked up the plastic bag and walked back across the lot and into a building i knew who the man was at halfpast four gail drove back into the parking lot and collected the envelope from the phone booth then she drove away again i packed up my things and climbed down from the roof it was a short walk to the building which the man had gone into i knew this building i had been inside it before i didnt knock at the office door i just opened it and walked in hi rik i said hi len rik replied are you working for the phone company now he didnt look surprised to see me i wanted to tell you whats been happening i began and ive come to collect my money of course i dont think youre going to get paid rik said with a laugh homer franks been arrested but youve just been paid rik havent you i said calmly what do you mean len rik asked he didnt sound happy i was thinking about the time we were in the lapd together i said you were investigating gangsters yeah thats right rik said i followed gangsters day and night it was a terrible job i nodded and i suppose you took photos of them too i added rik sat very still but he didnt say anything and when you left the lapd you took some of the photos with you i went on you thought they might be useful one day and one day they were very useful it was the day when a girl you had seen dancing with a gangster became a movie star rik stared at me and today you got paid two hundred and fifty thousand bucks i said a quarter of a million why did you blackmail gail rik and why did you hire me you didnt care about gail i suppose you wanted to keep her alive so that you could blackmail her rik said nothing weve known each other a long time rik i said im not going to tell the police about this just give me the money ill give it back to gail and well forget all about it ill forget all about it unless you tell anyone you have more copies of those photos rik opened the top drawer of his desk he took out gails plastic bag and gave it to me i dont know what youre talking about len he said but i found this bag in a phone booth in the parking lot im head of security so i took it i was going to try and find out who it belonged to sure rik i said with a smile thats your story but i know youre the blackmailer i saw you leave the envelope with the photographs in the booth when you took the bag rik shook his head he didnt say anything else i left his office and drove back to mine i was feeling sad id always liked rik roma i called gail she asked me to bring the bag over to her apartment immediately gail let me into her apartment and she kissed me on the cheek the apartment was plain but beautiful the furniture was expensive there was a wonderful view i gave gail the plastic bag i didnt tell her that rik was the blackmailer i said that i had followed a man who taken the bag from the phone booth i said i had fought him and taken the bag from him i said i didnt know him and that i hadnt tried to find out who he was and i said that if she heard from him again she had to call me straight away you are wonderful lenny gail said theres something i want to tell you and theres someone i want you to meet i want to tell you that im leaving the movie business no more movies for me and i want you to meet theo the man im going to marry she
