jack higgins drink with the devil chapter one rain swept in from belfast lough and as he turned the corner there was the rattle of smallarms fire somewhere in the darkness of the city center followed by the cramp of an explosion he didnt even hesitate but started across the square a small man no more than five feet five in jeans reefer coat and peaked cap a seamans duffle baghanging from one shoulder a sign said albert hotel but it was more a lodging house than anything else of a type used by sailors and constructed originally by the simple expedient of knocking three victorian terrace houses together the front door stood open and a snall balding man peered out a newspaper in one hand there was another explosion in the distance jesus he said the boys are active tonight the small man said from the bottom of the steps i phoned earlier about a room keogh is the name his voice was more english than anything else only a hint of the distinctive belfast accent ah yesmr keogh off a boat are ye something like that well come away in out of the rain and ill fix you up at that moment a land rover turned the corner followed by another they were stripped down three paratroopers crouched behind the driver hard young men in red berets and flak jackets each one carrying a submachine gun they vanished into the darkness and rain on the other side of the square jesus the old man said again then went inside and eogh followed him it was poor sort of a place a square hall with a reception desk and a narrow staircase the white paint hadyllowed over the years and the wallpaper was badly faded damp showing through here and there the old man pushed a register across the desk for keogh to sign ruc regulations home address next port of call the lot fine by me keogh quickly filled it in and pushed the register back across the desk martin keogh wapping london i havent been to london in years a fine city keogh took out a packet of cigarettes and lit one the old man took a room key down from a board at least they dont have paras hurtling around the streets armed to the teeth crazy that sitting out in the open even in the rain what a target suicide if you ask me not really keogh told him its an old para trick developed years ago in aden they travel in twos to look after each other and with no armor in the way they can respond instantly to any attack and how would you be knowing a thing like that keogh shrugged common knowledge da now can i have my key it was then that the old man noticed the eyes which were of no particular color and yet were the coldest he had ever seen and for some unaccountable reason he knew fear and at that moment keogh smiled and his personality changed totally he reached across and took the key someone told me there was a decent cafe near here the regent stratght across the square to lurgen thats right street its by the old docks ill find it and keogh turned and went upstairs he found the room easily enough opened the door the lock of which had obviously been forced on numerous occasions and went in the room was very small and smelled of damp there was a single bed a hanging cupboard and a chair there was a washbasin in the corner but no toilet there wasnt even a telephone still with any luck it would only be for the one night he put his duffle bag on the bed opened it there was a toilet bag spare shirts some books he pulled them to one side and prized up the thick cardboard base of the bag disclosing a walther ppk pistol sew eral clips of ammunition and the new small carswell silencer he checked the weapon loaded it and screwed the silencer intplace then he slipped it inside his jeans against the small of his back regent son he said softly and went out whistling a small sad tune there was a public telephone by the reception desk of the oldfashioned kind in a booth keogh nodded to the old man went inside and closed the door he fund some pound coins and dialed a number jack barry was a tall pleasantlooking man whose hornrimmed spectacles gave him a bookish look he had the look also of the schoolmaster which was exactly what he had once been but not nownow he was chief of staff of the provisional ira and he was seated by the fire at his dublin home reading the paper his portable phone at his side when it rang he picked it up and his wife jean called now dont be long your suppers ready barry here keogh said in irish its me ive booked in at the albert hotel under the name of martin keogh next step is to meet the girl will that be difficult no ive organized it trust me im off to this regent cafe now her uncle owns it good man keep me posted use the mobile number only he switched off his phone and his wife called again come away in its getting cold he got to his feet obediently and went into the kitchen keogh found the regent cafe witi no trouble one window was boarded up obviously from bomb blast but the other was intact offering a clear view of the interior there were hardly any customers just three old men at one table and a ravagedlooking middleaged woman at another who looked like a prostitute the girl sitting behind the counter was just sixteen he knew that because he knew all about her her name was kathleen ryan and sran the cafe on behalf of her uncle michael ryan a protestant gunman from his earliest youth she was a small girl with black hair and angry eyes above pronounced cheekbones not pretty by any conventional standard she wore a dark sweater denim miniskirt and boots and sat on a stool engrossed in a book when keogh went he leaned on the counter is it good she looked him over calmly and that look told him of someone infinitely older than her years very good the midnight court but thats in irish surely keogh reached for the book and saw that he was right and why shouldnt it be you think a protestant shouldnt read irish why not its our country too mister and if youre sinn fein or any of that old rubbish id prefer you went elsewhere catholics arent welcome an ira street bomb kitled my father my mother and my wee sister girl dear keogh held up his hands defensively im a belfast boy home from the sea whos just come in for a cup of tea you dont sound belfast to me english id say and thats because my father took me to live there when i was a boy she frowne for a moment then shrugged all right she raised her voice tea for one mary she said to keogh no more cooking were closing soon the tea will do just fine a moment later a grayhaired woman in an apron brought tea in a mug and placedit on the counter milk and sugar over there help yourself keogh did as he was told and pushed a pound coin across the woman gave him some change the girl ignored him reached for her book and stood up ill be away now mary give it another hour then you can take an early night and she went through to the back keogh took his tea to a table by the door sat down and lit a cigarette five minutes later kathleen ryan emerged wearing a beret and an old trenchcoat she went out without looking at him keogh sipped some more tea then got up and left it was raining harder now as she turned on to the waterfront and she increased her pace head down the three youths standing in the doorway of a disused warehouse saw her coming as she passed under the light of a street lamp they were of a type to be found in any city in the world vicious young animals in bomber jackets and jeans thats her pat the one wearing a baseball cap said thats her the ryan bitch from thecafe i can tell for myself you fool the one called pat saidnow hold still and grab her on the way past kathleen r yan was totally unaware of their existence as they stayed back in the shadows it was only the quick rush of feet that aleed her and by then it was too late one arm arounder neck half choking her pat walked round in front and tilted her chin well now what have we got here a little prod bitch ryan isnt it she kicked back catching the youth in the baseball cap on the shin leave me be you taig bastard taig bastard is it pat said and usdecent catholic boys he slapped her face up the alley with her time she learned her manners she didnt scream for it was not in her nature but cried out in rage and bit the hand that fastened on her mouth bitch baseball cap called out and punched her in the back and then they ran her along the alley through the rain there was a stack of packing cases clear under an oldfashioned gas street lamp as she struggled two of them pulled her icross a packing case and pat moved up behind and racked her skirt up time you learned he said no time you learned a voice called pat turned and martin keogh walked up the alley hands in the pockets of his reefer put her down i mean she doesnt know where youve been does she stuff you wee man the one in the baseball cap said released his hold on the girl and swung a punch at keogh who caught the wrist twisted and ran him face first into the wall you bastard the third youth cried and rushed him keoghs left hand came out of his pocket holding the walther and he slashed the youth across the face splitting the cheek from the left eye to the corner of the mouth he raised the gun and fired the distinctive muted cough of the silenced weapon flat in the rain baseball cap was on his knees the other clutching his cheek blood pouring through his fingers pat stood there rage on his face you bloody swine its been said before keogh touched him be io tween the eyes with the silenced end of the walther not another word or ill kill you the youth froze kathleen ryan was pulling her skirt down keogh said back to that cafe of yours girl ill see you soon she hesitated staring at him then turned and ran away along the alley there was only the rain now and the groans of the injured pat said wildly we did what you told us to do why this oh no keogh said i told you to frighten the girl a little and then id come andsave her he found a cigarett onehanded and lit it and what were we into gang rape shes a dirty little prod who cares i do keogh told him and im a catholic you give us a bad name pat rushed him keogh swayed to one side tripping him with his right foot and dropped oaeknee down hard in his back pat lay there sobbingin the rain keogh said you need a lesson son he jammed the muzzle of the walther against the youths thigh and pulled the trigger there was a muted report and pat cried out keogh stood up only a flesh wound it could have been your kneecap pat was sobbing now damn you taken care of a long time ago keogh took an envelope from his pocket and dropped it down five hundred quid that was the price now get yourself i i to the royal victoria casualty department best in the world for gunshot wounds but then they get a lot of experience he walked away whistling the same eerie little tune and left them there in the rain when he reached the cafe there were no longer any customers but he could see kathleen ryan and the woman mary standing behind the counter the girl was on the telephone keogh tried the door but it was locked kathleen ryan turned as the door rattled and nodded to mary who came from behind the counter and unlocked it as keogh entered mary said she told me what you did for her god bless you keogh sat on the edge of a table and lit a cigarette the girl was still talking no ill be fine now ill be at the dram in twenty minutes dont fret she put the phone dowrfd turned her face calm my uncle michael he worrios about me and why not keogh said desperate times you dont take prisoners do you i could never see the point and youre carrying a walther from what i saw very knowledgeable for one so young oh i know guns mister i was raised on them what did you do after i left i sent them on their way home was it with a pat on the head no the nearest casualty department they needed a lesson they got one the one who seemed to be in charge will be on sticks for a while if thats a comfort to you she frowned her eyes dark whats your game no game i didnt like what was going on thats all he stood up and stubbed out his cigarette still you seem fine now so ill be on my way he got the door open she said quickly no hang on he turned and she added you can walk me to my uncles pub thats the orange drum on connors wharf its about a quarter of a mile my name is kathteen ryan whats yours martin keogh wait for me outside he did as he was told and saw her go to the phone again probably speaking to her uncle he thought a few moments later she joined him this time carrying a large umbrella as she put it up against the driving rain he said and wouldnt a taxi be safer i like the city at night she tolcrhim i like the rain ive a right to go my own way and to hell with those fenian bastards a point of view he replied as they started to here get under this she said pulling him under the umbrella and took his arm a sailor you said just for the past couple of years a sailor from belfast raised in london who carries a walther there was a question in her voice a dangerous place this old town as you saw tonight dangerous for you you mean and thats why youre carrying she frowned youre not a fenian oryou wouldnt have done what you did to that lot im not anybodys girl dear he paused to light a cigarette she said give me one i will not you with your green years ahead of you god but you re one for the questions kate she turned to glance at him why do you call me that no one else does oh it seems to suit they were walking along the waterfront now container ships anchored at the quay and further out the red and green lights of a freighter moving out to sea kathleen ryan said so the gun why are you carrying jesus its the persistent one you are a long time ago i was a soldier did three tours of duty in this very town and theres always the chance of someone with a long memory and agrudge to work off what regiment one para dont tell me you were at bloody sunday in londonderry thats right like i said a long time ago her hand tightened on his arm god but you lads gave those fenians a roasting that day how many did you kill thirteen wasnt it the lights of the pub were plain across a cobbled quay now keogh said how old are you t sixteen so young and so full of hate i told you the ira killed my father my mother and my wee sister that only leaves uncle michael the sign said the orange drum and one was painted on the brick wall beside it with the legend our country too the girl put the umbrella down opened the door and led the way in the interior was a typical belfast pub with several booths a few tables and chairs and a long mahogany bar bottles of every kind of drink were ranged on shelves against a mirrored wall there were only half a dozen customers all old men four of them playing cards by an open fire two others talking softly to each other a hardlooking young man with one arm sat behind the bar reading the belfast telegraph he glanced up and put the paper down are you okay kathleen michael told me wjtt happened im fine ivor thanks to mr keogh here is uncle michael in the back at that moment a door opened and a man walked through keogh knew him at once from the photos barry had supplied at his briefing in dublin michael ryan aged fiftyfive a loyalist of the first order who had served in the uvf and red hand of ulster the most extreme protestant group of all a man who had killed for his beliefs many times he was of medium height hair graying slightly at the temples eyes very blue and there was an energy to him this is martin keogh the girl said ryan came round the bar and held out his hand you did me a good turn tonight i shant forget lucky i was there thats may be i owe you a drink anyway bushmills whiskey would be fine keogh told him over here ryan indicated a booth in the corner the girl took off her raincoat and beret and eased behind the table her uncle sat beside her and keogh was opposite ivor brought a bottle of bushmills and two glasses can i get you anything kathleen no im okay ivor he painly worshiped her but nodded and walked away ryari said ive checked with a contact at the royal victoria they just received three very damaged young men one with a bullet in the thigh is that a fact keogh said kathleen ryan stared at him you didnt tell me no need lets see what youre carrying ryan asked no need to worry all friends here keogh shrugged took the walther from his pocket and passed it across ryan examined it expertly carswell silencer the new job very nice he took a browning from his pocket and passed it over still my personal favorite preferred weapon of the sas keogh said lift ing the browning in one hand and the parachute regiment he served with one para the girl said bloody sunday is that a fact michael ryan said a long time ago lately ive been at sea belfast but raised in london kathleen tells me my mother died in childbirth my father went to london in search of work hes dead now ryan had ejected the magazine from the butt of the walther and a good prod you must be because of what you did for kaleen to be horiest with you religion doesnt mean a thing to me keogh told him but lets say i know which side im on at that moment the door was flung open and a man in a cloth cap and raincoat rushed in a revolver in one hand michael ryan you bastard ivot you now he cried and raised the revolver ryan was caught the magazine from the walther on the table beside it keogh said what do i do shoot him all right bang youre dead he picked up the browning and fired once the man dropped the hand holding the revolver to one side keogh said blanks mr ryan i could tell by the weight what kind of a game are we playing here ryan was laughing now go on joseph and get yourself a drink at the bar the supposed gunman turned away the old men by e fire continued their card game as if nothing had happened michael ryan stood up just a test my old son in a manner of speaking lets adjourn to the parlour and talk some more there was a fire in the grate of the small parlour curtains drawn as rain drummed against the window it was warm and comfortable and ryan and keogh sat opposite each other the girl came in from the kitchen with a teapot milk and cups on a tray ryan said if youre a seaman youll have your papers of course keogh said ryaff held out his hand and keogh shrugged opened his reefer and took a wallet from his inside pocket there you go ships papers union card the lot the girl poureda and ryan examined everything closelypaid off the ventura two weeks ago deck hand and diver whats all that the venturas a supply ship in the north sea oilfields besides general ships duties i did some diving not the really deep stuff just underwater maintenance welding when necessary that sort of thing interesting a man of parts any special skills from the parachute regiment just how to kill people the usual weaponry skills a considerable knowledge of explosives keogh lit a cigarette but wheres all this leadingt i ryan persisted can you ride a motorcycle since i was sixteen and thats a long time ago so what ryan leaned back took out a pipe and filled it from an old pouch visiting relatives are you not that i know of keogh said a few cousins scattered here and there i came back on a whim nostalgia if you like a bad idea really but i can always go back and get another berth i could offer you a job ryan said and the girl brought a taper from the fire to light his pipe what here in belfast no in england doing what why the kind of thing you did tonight the kind of thing youre good at it was very quiet keogh was aware of the girl watching him eagerly do i smell politics here since nineteen sixtynineive worked for the loyalist cause ryan said servedfx years in the maze prison i hate fenians i hate ie bloody sinn fein because if they win theyll drive us all out every protestant in the country ethnic cleansing to the hilt now if things get that bad ill take as many of them to hell with me as i can so wheres this leading a job in england a very lucrative job funds for our rganization in other words we steal from someone keogh said we need money keogh ryan said money i for arms the bloody ira have their irishamerican sympathizers providing funds we dont he leaned forward im not asking you for patriotism ill settle for greed fifty thousand pounds there was a long pause and ryan and the girl waited her face somber as if she expected him to say no keogh smiled thats a lot of motey mr ryan so youll he expecting a lot in return backup is what i expect from a man who can handle anything and from the way youve carried yourself tonight you would seem to be that kind of man keogh said what about your own people youve s many gunmen out on the street as the ira more even i know that from army days he lit a cigarette and leaned back unless theres another troth here that you in it for the money youre in it for yourself kathleen ryan jumped ups damn you for saying that my uncle has given more for our people than anyone i know better you get out of here while you can ryan held up a hand softly child any intelligent man would see it as a possibility its happened before god knows and on both sides so keogh said i can he as hungry as the next man where money is concerned but my cause is a just one the one certainty in my life any money that passes through zo my hands goes to the protestant cause thats what my life is about then why not use some of your own men becausepeople talk too much a weakness in all revolutionary movements the ira have the same problem ive always preferred to use what i call hired help and for that i go to the underworld an honest thief who is working for wages is a sounder proposition than some revolutionary hothead so thats where i come in keogh said hired help just like anyone else you need exactly so are you in or out if its no then say so after what you did for kathleen tonight youll come to no harm from me well thats nice to know keogh shrugged oh what the hell i might as well give it a try a change from the north sea terrible weather there at this time of the year good man yourself ryan smiled a couple of bushmills kathleen and well drinklb it where are you staying ryan asked a fieapit called the albert hotel keogh told him fleapit indeed ryan toasted him our coun may you die in ireland keogh replieg an excellent sentiment ryan swallowed his bushmills in a single gulp so what happens now ill tell you in london well fly there you me z i and kathleen theres someone i have to see keogh turned to the girl an activist is it a little young i would have thought i bloody told you they blew up my family when i was ten years old mr keogh she said fiercely i grew up fast after that a hard world and ill make it harder for the other side believe me you hate well ill say that keogh turned back to her uncle so thats it then he shook his hand what am i really getting into i should know more all right a taster only how well do you know the northwest of england the lake district ive never been there a wild and lonely area at this time of theyear with the tourists gone so a certain truck will be psing through there a meat transporter you and i will hijack it very simple very fast a fiveminute job you did say meat transporter ryan smiled thats what this truck is whats inside is another matter you find that out later and what happens afterwards we drive to a place on the cumbrian coast where theres an old disused jetty there will be a boat waiting a siemens ferry do you know what that is the germans used them in world war two to transport heavy equipment and men in coastal attacks youre well informed we drive on board and sail for ulster ive found a suitable spot on the coast where theres a disused quarry pier we drive the track off the boat and disappear into the night all beautifully simple so it would seem keogh said and the crew of this siemens ferry what are they doing earning their wages as far as they are concerned its just some sort of illegal traffic or other they do it all the time theyre those sort of people crooks you mean exactly the boat is tied up near wapping at the moment thats wy were going to london to finalize things there was a pause and then kathleen ryan said what do you think mr keogh that youd better start calling nmartin as it seems were going to spend some tird together but do yot think it would work its greatest virtue as your uncle says is its simplicity it could work perfectly just like a swiss watch on the other hand even swiss watches break down sometimes o ye of little faith ryan smiled of course it will work its got to my organization needs the means to buy arms for our people its essential theres a passage in the koran that says there is more truth in one sword than ten thousand words z i take your point keogh stood up its late id better get back to my hotel join us here for breakfast in the morning ryan told him well catch the noon plane ill take care of the tickets ill say goodnight then the bar is closed kathleen will let you out ill keep your walther here no way of passing through airport security with that but it doesnt matter our london connection will provide any weapons we need he held out his hand ill see you in the morning the girl pened the door and rain drove in on the wind a dirty old night she said you can say that again keogh turned up his collar an ulster frytp will do me fine for breakfast especially if you cook it yourself two eggs and dont forget the sausage go on get on your way she pushed him out and laughed that distinctive harsh laugh of hers and closed the door keogh had difficulty finding a phone box most of them seemed to be vandalized he finally struck luck when he was quite close to the hotel he closed the glass door to keep out the rain and rang the dublin number barry was seated at the desk of his small study with his chief of intelligence for u ster a man named john cassidy when he took the call its me keogh said worked like a charm im in it up to my neckryans taken me on board tell me everything which keogh did ia a few brief sentences finally he said what could be in this meat transporter gold bullion if its the job im thinking of it was put to the loyalist army council about a year ago and thrown out as being too risky so ryan has decided to do it on his own initiative exactly but then he always was the wild one thats why i wanted you in there when i got the whisper through an informer that he was up to something up to something big keogh told him thats right stay in close touch youve got those alternate numbers for the mobile phone and watch your back al barry leaned back thoughtfully and lit a cigarette cassidy said trouble michael ryan up to his old tricks he ran i through what keogh had told him cassidy said my god if it is gold bullion the bastards would have enough money to arm fora civil war what are you going to do i dont need to do a thing except have a suitable reception committee waiting when that boat delivers the truck somewhere on the ulster coast then well have enough money to start a civil war and youre certain of knowing the time and place oh yes the man on the other end of the phone just now is one of our own hes infiltrated under a false identity hell be going along for the ride every step of the way a good man the best would i be knowing him barry told him keoghs real name cassidy laughed out loud god save us the devil himself so god help michael ryan there was no one at the reception desk when keogh entered the hotel he went up the staffs quickly and unlocked the door to his room it was unbelievably depressing and he looked around with distaste it certainly wasnt worth taking off his clothes he switched off the light lit a cigarette lay on the bed and went over the whole affair the astonishing thing was as had been said the simplicity of it hed have to consider that again once ryan had taken him fully into his confidence of course not a bad fella ryan a man hard to dislike and then there was the girl so much hate there in one so young and all blamed on the bomb which had killed her family he shook his head there was more to it than that had to be and finally he drifted into sleep kathleen ryan took a cup of tea in to her uncle just before she went to bed ryan was sitting by the fire smoking his pipe and brooding you think it will work she asked ive never been more certain and with keogh along he shrugged fifty million pounds in gold bullion kathleen just think of that a strange one she said can you trust him ive never trusted anyone in my life he said cheerfully not even you no dont you fret over keogh ill have my eye on him but can you be sure of course i can i know him like i know myself kathleen my love were cut from the same bolt of cloth like me hes got brains thats obvious hes also a killer its his nature he can do no other just like me he reached up to kiss her cheek now off to bed with you she went out and he sat back sipping his tea and thinking of a lonely road in the lake dct a road that not even his niece knew he had visited london the lake district chapter two if there is such a thing as an irish quarter in london its to be found in kilbum along with a profusion of pubs to make any irish republican happy but there are also the protestant variety identical with anything to be found in belfast the william mary was one of those its landlor hugh bell an orange protestant to the hilt perfofihing the same function in london for the loyalist movement as sinn fein did for the ira in the early evening of the day they had arrived in london ryan keogh and kathleen sat with him in a baclcroom an assortment of handguns on the table bell a large jovial man with white hair poured himself a whiskey a nything you like michael and theres more where that came from ryan selected a browning hefted it and put it in his pocket keogh found a walther would you have a carswell for this he asked a man of taste and discernment i see bell observed he got up went to a cupboard rummaged inside and came back there you go the latest model keogh screwed it onto the end of the walther just the ticket and the young lady bell asked my niece doesnt carry ryan told him the girl bridled instantly im as good a shot as you uncle michael and you know it how am i expected to protect myself kick them in the balls bell laughed i inight have a solution he went back to th cupboard and returned with a small automatic colt quite rare slips in a ladys handbag or stocking quite easily and no bloody stopping power ryan told him enough if youreetose enough bell said the girl took the weapon from him and smiled this will do me just fine she slipped it into her handbag ryan said all right what about the irish rose siemens ferry tied up in wapping near the pool of london captain frank tully but you know that the kind of mt wholl do anything for money the worst kind of drugs anything that pays hes twice run arms for the ira to the republic what about his crew theres four bell opened a drawer and took out a piece of paper he put reading spectacles on the end of his nose mick dolan and jock granttheyre from liverpool bert fox from london and a kraut named mullerhans muller theyve all got form all been inside well at least we know what were dealing with keogh observed thats right ryan told him just your average scum bell said these arent good people michael i hope you know what youre doing i usually do ryan grinned and took a folded piece of paper from his pocket these are my requirements see if you can fill the bill bell had a look stun grenades smoke grenades thats fine two ak assault rifles okay semtex is that essential i might have to blow my way into my target all right ill see what i can do thats it then ryan smiled at hi niece and keogh something to eat and then well go and see tully it was very cold on the thames tower bridge on the right and the floodlit tower of london just beyond it a couple of ships passed from the pool of london red and green lights clear in the evening darkness as the taxi stopped at the end of cable wharfe and ryan kathleen and keogh got out the taxi moved away and they walked along the waterfront the ferry was moored at the far end cables reach ing to the pier in the sickly yellow light of two lamps they could see the legend on the stera plain irish rose enough to make a man feel at home ryan said im not sure thats the right word for it keogh told him they started up the gangway land a man in reefer coat and peaked cap appeared and where do you think youre going he asked in a hard liverpool voice were expected ryan said tell captain tully the man laughed out loud captain tully is that what he calls himself he laughed again all right this way the boat was very flat the central section including the wheelhouse rising up from the deck three quarters of the way along she was about five hundred feet in length what do you think ryan whispered to keogh as theyfollowed that they werent designed for heavy weather keogh told him they went upa ladder to the wheelhouse stopped on the landing below their escort opened a door and stood to one side here we are then thank you mr dolan the man who sat behind the chart table wore a seagoing officers coat had hair down to his shoulders and a face that was so ravaged by drink and bad living that it was impossible to determine his age mr ryan here we are again he stood up and extended his hand and who might this gorgeous young lady be my niece captain tully you might well remember that this is my associate martin keogh mr keogh tully shook his hand enthusiastically a real pleasure im sure it is keogh told him to business then tully said ryan opened the briefcase he was holding and took out a folded chart there is your destination marsh end south of ravenglass on the cumbrian coast you have two days can you manage that tully unfolded the chart and examined it no problem what then ill arrive by track which well take across to kilalla on the coast of county down he took out another chart theres a disused quarry pier there we put the track on shore and you sail away we do indeed mr ryan there isf course the small matter of recompense ryan took a large envelope from the briefcase and passed it across fifty thousand pounds there another fifty on the termination of the contract at kilalla satisfactory oh very mr ryan i can assure you of that excellent then well see you on friday raoming at marsh end problem tully said we wont let you down good well be off then as they walked along the waterfront kathleen ryan said i didnt like anything about that bowser you arent expected to ryan turned to keogh what about you hell cut your throat if he thinks theres a pound in it which is why i have you along so lets get back and ryan walked to the corner and waved to a taxi the man who had greeted them at the gangway was dolan when he went back into the chartroom he found tully examining the charts ryan had given him what do you think its big tully said fifty thousand now and another fifty when we lit the ulster coast whatever is in that truck must he worth more so the number he gave me to contact him its a pub in kilburn called the william and mary i think ill go up there and have a nose around he folded the charts you look after things here he moved to the door and turned this could be a big payday mick well im with you on that dolan said whatever it takes good man tully said and went out the saloon bar of the william mary was packed men standing shouldertoshoulder at the bar as they drank it was a cheerful enough scene and very noisy as tully peered in through one of the windows he decided to take his chances round the back and followed a narrow alley that brought him to a high wall a gate opening into a yard there was a chink of light showing at a window curtains partly drawn lie approached cautiously and peered inside ryan bell and kathleen sat at a table a map unfolded before them keogh stood by the fire ryan laughed as bell said something to him but tully couldnt bear what it was it was then that he noticed the back door in the shadows he tried the handle gingerly and the door opened to his touch he found himself in a narrow corridor there was no light on and he groped his way forward aware of coats hanging from a peg rack at that moment a door opened light flooding out and bell apared tully froze trying to bury himself in the hangg coats and bell called ill only be a minute he went down the corridor opened a door and went inside a few moments later there was the sound of a toilet flushing he returned went into the backroom and closed tho door tully went forward and put his ear to the door and was instantlyaw are of everything being said inside right then catds on te tablr ryan said its time you knew what the rest of us do martin im all in favor of that keogh told him i put this job together a year or so ago hugh here helped with the planning of the english end of things unfortunately the army council turned it down flat thought the whole thing too risky bunch of old women bell said so whats it all about kegh demanded whats on the meat transporter it was kathleen who answered gold martin gold bullion fifty million pounds god save us keogh managed to look astonished and why would it be transported in such a way let me explain ryan said bullion used to be landed at loncron docks on the thames but over the past twentyfive years the waterfront has been in decline shippers prefer amsterdam however bullion deliveries were rerouted to glasgow how long has this been going on five years ever since they built a new smelter at barrowinfurness see it thereon the map right at the bottom of the lake district mainly shipbuilding there the latest atomic submarine came out of their yards so whats the smelter got to do with things they melt the gold down and reprocess it into smaller ingots the banks prefer it that way gold is heavy stuff i see keogh said ryan continued the transporter travels from glasgow to carlisle then cuts across to maryport on the coast and follows the coast road down to barrow and we hit it somewhere on that road exactly this coming friday but how do we stop it and whats more to the point how do we get in it was bell who answeredits no ordinary truck theres a driver and two armed security guards in the cabin behind him the truck looks standard but its reinforced in every possible way and theres a battery of electronic security devices a firstclass radio system nd how do you handle that keogh asked bell opened a drfiwer in the table and took out a black handheld computer with several rows of buttons and a readout screen i know this looks as if you use it to turn your television on and off but its a bit of pure genius called a howler you see privileged information again we know the code for the securityystem of the truck the howler has already selected it you press the red button three times and the entire security system in the truck electronic door locks radio the lot is neutralized that means the doors are open and where in the hell did you get that keogh asked oh a young electronic whiz kid at queens blni versity in belfast who is sympathetic to our cause keogh nodded slowly and the driver and the guards what happens there stun grenade should take care of them ryan looked bleak for a moment mind you ill kill them if i have to this is serious business keogh nodded all fight what happens after the heist we drive it to marsh end where the irish rose will be waiting he smiled wellbe well out to sea and on our way and the police running round in circles there was a long silence while keogh brooded finally he nodded you know youre right it could work ryan laughed delightedly good man yourself martin lets have a drink on it bell got up opened a cupboard and took out a bottle of bushnills and three glasses and at that moment there was a crash in the yard outside as a trashcan went over when ryan suggested the drink tully decided it was time to go he opened the back door closed it softly behind him and sated across the yard it was then that he blundered into thetrashcan dislodging the metal lid which clanged as it fell to the stone flagging he carried on got the gate open and ran along the alley as he reached the far end keogh emerged into the alley but by then it was too late as tully crossed the busy main road and was lost in the evening crowd when keogh returned bell had turned on the yard light and was standing at the back door with ryan and the girl was there someone ryan demanded oh yes keogh said and youre not going to like it one little bit i just caught a glimpse of him as he turnea into the road it looked remarkably like tully to me the bastard was checking up on us ryan said and led the way back into the parlour so what do we do now bell demanded this blows everything no i dont agree keogh said he wants to see the affair go through because he wants the rest of his money that makes sense ryan nodded id say he was simply sniffing around to find ou more which means hes a shifty swine kathleen put in who knows more than he did if he overheard our discussion kgh pulled on his reefer coat where are you going ryan demande back to the irish rose keogh tooi out his walther and checked it im going to do some sniffing around myself ill come with you ryan told him no need i can handle it keogh smiled after all thats what youre paying me for as he turned for the door kathleen ryan sa id take care martin ah but i always do girl dear he smiled and went out there was the sound of the yard gate opening and closing and he was gone it was raining again as keogh paid off the taxi and turned along cable wharfe it was a place of shadows a touch of fog in the air he kept to those shadows by the old disused warehouses and paused when he was close to the gangway there was no sign of life he thought about it for a while then decided to take a chance and darted across to the stern of the ferry which at that point was lower than the wharf he dropped down to the deck paused for a moment then moved through the darkness to where the central section and the wheelhouse reared into the night there was a light up there keogh went up an iron ladder to the lauding below the wheelhouse then approached crouching he could hear voices smell cigarette smoke they were all in there tully and his crew keogh stood protected by a life raft and listened he heard the man dolan say gold are you kidding us frank no im bloody not the truck that we pick up at marsh end will be loaded with the stuff theyre going to knock it off on its way to the smelters in barrowinfurness but who are they dolan demanded well theyre irish thats for certain id have said ira but i dont think so why not two things our destination kilalla thats ulster not the republic another thing the william and mary in kilbum thats a prod pub not catholic i think theyre probably the other side loyalists dolan asked same difference as far as im concerned tully told him i couldnt care less which side theyre on all im interested in is that gold there was a stirring amongst the crew dolan said you mean were going to knock it off who knows tully laughed after all lads anything can happen at sea but lets get moving prepare to cast off weve only got two days to get up there keogh crouched behind the life raft as the crew emerged and descended io the deck he stayed there thinking about it then stood up and moved to the wheelhouse door tully leaning over the table was aware of a small wind that lifted the chart for the cumbrian coast a little he looked up and found keogh laning against the door lighting a cigarette as they used to say in those old agatha christie plays all is revealed i was outside old son and i heard your little speech to that motley crew of yours tully tried to open a door and keoghs hand came out of his pocket holding the walther dont be stupid tully glowered at him what do you want well i know you were at the william and mary by rights i should put a bullet between your eyes but ill settle for the fifty thousand pounds ryan gave you earlier you can go to hell keogh raised the walther and fired there was the usual dull cough and the lobe of tullys right ear disintegrated he cried out sharply and clutched at the ear blood spurting that was for starters keogh said come on the envelope tully got the drawer open with his free hand took out the envelope and tossed it over keogh put it in his pocket tully took a handkerchief from his pocket and held it to his ear my god look what youve done so whats thedifference keogh said you couldnt look worse than you do fuck you tully opened a cupboard onehanded took out a bottle of scotch and pulled the cork with his teeth he took ong swallow now what now nothing keogh told him ill see you at marsh end on friday tully looked astonished you mean its stillon too late to get anyine else now keogh told him this is what i call an iknowthatyouknowthatiknow situation so behave yourself and youll get this envelope back plus the other fifty thousand pounds when we reach kilalla sod you tully said yes i know that keogh told him but you will be at marsh end on friday yes damn you i will good man yourself now you can escort me to the gangway and well say goodnight the engines rumbled into life at that moment tully led the way out negotiating the ladder with difficulty blood streaming from his ear only dolan and the german muller were working on deck muller was casting off and dolan was about to haul in the gangway he looked up in astonishment here whats going on whats going on is that you leave the gangway alone until ive gone down it keogh said dolan tried to rush him and keogh wiped him across the face with the walther dolan staggered back with a cry of pain and keogh went down the gangway he turned at the bottom and smiled up at tully to our next merry meeting at marsh end bastard tully called keogh laughed and walked away through the jack barry was sitting at the desk of his study when the portable phone rang keogh said its me barry said where are you wapping high street in old london town so whats happening you were right about the gold is that a fact tell me its complicated but here goes and keogh went through the whole business stepbystep when he was finished barry said christ but its the ruthless bastard you are will tully play he will a hundredthousandpound payday he isnt going to turn that down right lets say everything works what happens on board the irish rose once you put to sea theyll try to take you of course but well be prepared you ryan and his niece god save us all oh he will he will what about the kilalla end oh i think i can promise you an interesting reception a consitlerable contribution to ira funds it could win us the war just think of that keogh told him and its only taken seven hundred years barry laughed go onark hero get on with it and keep in touch and he switched off his phone in the parlour at the william mary ryan and kathleen sat at the table and listened to what keogh had to say keogh helped himself to a bushmills on the side bell said you shot him only a little keogh sipped his bushmills the lobe of his right ear kathleens face was infused with excitement that taught the bastard a lesson ryan said you think hell still come of course he will he wants his hundred thousand pounds buthell try for more on the run to ulster yes well we know that so well just have to be prepared i suppose so ryan took a deep breath well catch the glasgow express in the morning well leave at carnforth and take the local train to barrow then what well be met ryan told him something else i didnt tell you i have acousin who runs a sheep farm in the lake district not far from ravenglass but enough of that now im for bed well need an early start as the irish rose moved down the thames tully stood at the wheel his head disembodied in the light of the binnacle his fight ear was covered by a taped bandage the door of the wheelhouse ophed and dolan entered with a mug in one hand put it down by the wheel tea he said are you okay im fine tully told him so what about that little bastard oh when the right time comes im going to cut his balls off tully reached for the mug and drank some tea theres an old sinn fein saying our day will come well mine certainly will where keoghs concerned he swung the wheel and increased power chapter three the glasgow express wasnt particularly busy keogh sat opposite kfithleen at a corner table ryan took the one opposite almost immediately he opened his briefcase and took out a file he started to work his way through it reading glasses perch ed on the end of his nose the girl took the copy of the midnight court from her carrying bag and an irish dictionary which she put on one side a strange one keogh thought a strange one indeed he sat there gazing out of the window wondering what she would say what her reaction would be if she knew he was everything she hateda roman catholic and an ira enforcer god but the fat would be in the fire the day that got out about an hour out of london an attendant appeared pushing a trolley with tea coffee sandwiches and newspapers ryan stopped working and took a coffee the girl asked for tea and so did keogh he also bought the times and the daily mail and spent the next hour catching up on the news there wasnt much on the irish situation a bomb in derry had taken out six shops in one streeta titfortat killing of two catholics on the falls road in retaliation for the shooting of a protestant in the shankill an army air corps helicopter flying in to the command post at crossmaglen had come under machine gun fire as well just another day theyd say in ulster and then halfway through the times he came to an article entitled how long oh lord how long it was written by a retired member of parliament once a minister at tile northern ireland office who not unreasonably felt that sixteen years of bloody war in ireland was enough his preferred solution was an independent ulster as a member of the british commonwealth incredible how naive on the subject even politicians could be keogh closed the paper lit a cigarette and sat back watching the girl to his amusement he saw that she frequently consulted the dictionary she glanced up and saw him smile she frowned whats so funny not much you just seem to be having some difficulty with that its not easy i only started learning three months ago theres a phrase here thafs danmed difficult to work out keogh a fluent irish speaker could have helped but to disclose the fact would have been a serious error people who spoke irish were catholics and nationalists it was as simple as that ryan had finished the file put it back in his briefcase and leaned back in the corner closing his eyes he seems tired keogh observed he does too much almost burns himself out hes a believer you see our cause is everything to him meat and drink you too i think you have to have something to believe in in this life in yourcase the death of your family gave you that the murder of my family martin the murder there was no answer to thal could never be her face was white and intense eyes filled with rage keogh said peace girl dear peace go on read your book and he picked up the daily mail and started on that another half hour and the attendant turned they had more tea and ham sandwiches ryan was still asleep well leave him be the girl said they ate in companionable silence when they were finished keogh lit another cigarette sixteen kate and the whole of life ahead of you and what would you like to do with it if peace ever comes to ireland oh i know that well enough i always wanted to be a nurse ever since my time in the hospital after the bomb i was at the royal victoria for three months the nurses were great nursing is it well for that you need to pass your exams and you not even at seho she laughed that distinctive harsh laugh of hers you couldnt be more wrong mister mst people do their ordinary level exams at sixteen i did mine at fourteen most people do the advanced levels at eighteen i did mine four months ago in english literature french and spanish i have a thing for languages you see there was a kind of bravado in her voice im qualified to go to university if im so minded and im only sixteen and are you she shrugged ive more important things to do for the moment our struggle is all that matters now shut up martin and let me get on with my book and she returned to the midnigtij court they got off the train at carinforth it was desolate enough hardly anyone about rain drifting across the platform ryan checked his watch theres a local train to barrowinfurness leaving in forty minutes well get a cup of tea i need to talk to you both the cafe was deserted only an aging woman serving behind the bar kathleen ryan went and got the tea and brought it back on a tray i mind the time when this station was open for business twentyfour hours ryan said steam en gines thundering through one after another he shook his head everything changes you know the area well keogh asked oh yes ive visited the lake district a number of times over the years i was up this way only four weeks ago his niece said in genuine surprise i didnt know that uncle michael you thought id gone to dublin ryan said well i didnt i was up here arranging things and theres a lot more you dont know and now is the time for the telling go on keogh told him ryan produced the ordnance survey map of the area which they had consulted in london and unfolded it theres ravenglass on the coast a bit of a winding road from barrow to get there maybe twentyfive miles marsh end is about five miles soutbf ravenglass so keogh said see here to one side of ravenglass the valley running up into the mountains eskdale its called ive got what you might call friends there but you never told me that kathleen said in astonishment im telling you nowam i not now this is the way of it my own cousin colin power had an english wife named mary a farmers daughter from eskdale colin was a tenant farmer in county down but when her parents died the farm in eskdale was left to her so they moved over exactly this was twenty years ago they brought with them a young boy colins nephew benny he had brain damage from birth his parents wanted to put him in a home but mary having no child of her own took him on and raised him and theyre up there now in eskdale kathleen demanded right at the head of the valley a remote desolate place follys end its called and thats an apt name for it too much rain too much wind the sheep dont thrive ryan shrugged it was too much for colin he died of a heart attack five years ago only mary and benny to run the place a lot of work for two people i would have thought keogh said ryan laughed out loud just wait fill you see benny at that moment the local train pulled in at the platform and he glanced through the indow thats us lets get moving and he stood up and led the way out there were only a handful of passengers getting off the train at barrowinfurness they went through the ticket barrier passed into the concourse and stood outside a voice called uncle michael its me the words heavy and slurred there was an old land rover parked on the other side and the man standing beside it was quite extraordinary he was at least six feet four in height and built like an ox with enormous shoulders he wore a tweed cap and a shabby tweed suit with patches on the elbows he rushed forward eagerly a childlike expression on the fleshy face its me uncle michael he said again michael gave him a brief hug good man yourself benny is your aunt well very well looking forward to seeing you the words came out with difficulty slow and measured ryan said my niece kathleen you and she will be cousins two or three times removed benny pulled off his cap revealing a shock of untidy yellowing hair he nodded beaming with pleasure kathleen she reached up and kissed his cheek its good to meet you he was overcome nodding eagerly and ryan in troduced keogh who held out his hand bennys grasp was so strong that keogh grimaced with pain easy soneasy does it he turned to ryan i see what you mean about running the farm this lad must be up to the work of ten men at least ryan said anyway lets get going benny took kathleens suitcase and ryans and raced ahead to the land rover ryan said to keogh and kathleen he could beat five men in any barroom brawl but in the heart of him hes a child mind that well and give him time when he speaks some times he has difficulty getting the words out benny put the luggage in the back and keogh slung his duffle in benny ran round to open the front passenger door he pulled off his cap and nodded eagerly again to kathleen in you go kate keogh told her make the big fellas day well sit behind they all got in and benny ran round and climbed behind the wheel he started the engine and ryan said a great driver this lad make no mistake he patted benny on the shoulder away we go benny is the truck all right benny nodded oh yes he turned into the main road and ryans niece said what truck wsuld that he later girl later just sit back and admire the scenery some of the best in england when they reached the coast road t started to rain ryan said it does that alot up here i suppose its the mountains they lifted up on the fight a spectacular sightthe peaks covered by low cloud on the left the sea was angry rolling in fast whitecaps everywhere a heavy sea mist following the isle of man out there and then dear oldireland ryan told them keogh said i dont know whether youve ha a forward weather forecast for friday but one things for sure if its rough weather that siemens ferry is in for one hell of a ride well just have to see wont we ryan told him about fortyfive minutes out of barrow they came to an area where there were marshes on their left stretching out to sea vanishing into the mist there was a sign up ahead and ryan touched benny on the shoulder the big man slowed down and ryan said marsh end lets take a quick look benny benny turned down a track and drove slowly along a causeway through a landscape of total desolation reeds marching into the mist there was an old cottage to the right and then a jetty about one hundred yards long stretching out into the sea benny cut the engine so thats it keogh said thats it ryan nodded only something like the siemens with its shallow draught could get in you can say that again when the tides out id say its nothing but marsh and mud flats ryan tapped benny on the shoulder off we go benny and the big man nodded obediently and reversed toward tiie upper end of eskdale valley mountains rearing before them benny turned into a broad track and dropped down into a low gear there were gray stone walls on either hand sheep huddled together in the rain a desolate sort of place keogh said ryan nodded a hard way to make a living they came to a wooden sign post that bore the legend follys end and that just about sums it up ryan observed a moment later and they came to farm gates wide open and beyond it the farm two large barns the farmhouse itself all built in weathered gray stone benny turned off the engine and got out as they followed the front door opened and a black and white sheepdog bounded out a moment later a woman appeared she wore a heavy knitted sweater mens trousers and green wellington boots her hair was iron gray the face strangely young looking ryan went forward as she held her arms open they embraced warmly and turned here you are then my cousin mary power the beamed kitchen had a stonelflagged floor a wood fire burning in ar open hearth she served them herself ladling lamb and potato stew from a large pot moving round the table then sat at the end its good to see you girl she said to kathleen when you reach my age relatives are hard to come by and its good to meet you kathleen told her and you mr keogh what would your speciaiity be mary power asked well i like to think i can turn my hand to most things keogh spooned some stew to his mouth and smiled but ill never be the cook you are ryan pushed his plate away mary power said more he shook his head tea would be fine she got up and started to clear the plates and kathleen helped her keogh said could we all know where we stand here you mean where mary stands ryan said simple shes hacking me to the hilt on this if things go well she gets a hundred thousand pounds that means she can kiss this place goodbye and go back to county down she showed no response at all simply took plates to the sink then reached for the kettle and made tea everythings in order the truck is in the back barn ive aired the cottage at marsh end and theres a fire in the stove somebody will hhve to stay there ryan nodded and accepted a mug of strong tea perhaps kathleen could stay with you and martin and myself could make out at the cottage fine she opened a tin box and took out a ca try this i made it myself and she reached for a knife and cut it into slices there was a motorcycle on its stand just inside the barn a black leather bikers jacket draped across it and there was a helmet keogh recognized it at once hell where did you get this beauty benny a montesa dirt bike you know this modeltm ryan asked of course spanish theyll do half a mile an hour over rough ground if you want them to and is that good kathleen asked it is if youre a shepherd operating in hill country keogh told her these things will go anywhere he turned to ryan you bought this for benny not really a bit small for him i thoughtit might suit our circumstances ill explain later he said to mary lets have a look at the track she turned to benny show us benny he nodded eagerly almost ran to the back of the barn tossed some bales of hay to one side then felt for a hidden catch the wooden wall swung open inside in an extension of the barn stood a large track painted green and white the legend on the side of the truck read shelby meat importers keogh said is this what i think it is an exact replica of the track were going to heist so whats the point a decoy thats all benny will dump this down on the coast road all doors locked and so on that should hold the police up ncely while they try to get inside itll give us extra time if we need it to get away with the real mccoy very ingenious and benny can handle this benny can handle anything with an engine like you wouldnt believe benny should be a formula one driver only hes too big benny nodded delightedly right lets go back inside and have a cup of tea and then benny can take us to the front line so to speak he coast road was down below a secondary road joining it at the side of a wood the land rover pulled in and ryan got out with keogh and kathleen and benny followed so this is it keogh asked thats right ryan told him four oclock friday afternoon give or take fifteen minutes and the transporter reaches this junction take my word for it all carefully checked theres one thing i dont understand keogh said its all right saying the howler takes out the trucks security system but hbw do you get the damn thing to stop in the first place a good point but thats where kathleen comes in ryan put an arm around her ill explain when we get back the second barn was filled with farm machinery there was also an old ford van ryan said now if you were driving along a country road and you saw that van burning and a young girl lying in the road blood on her face would you stop id have to say i would keogh said and so will they ryan put an arm around kathleen a chance to earn your oscar girl i wont let you down i know you wont now lets go in and well take it stepbystep as i told you the transporter reaches the junction at approximately four oclock on friday they were all there in the kitchen maryland kathleen at the table with ryan benny at the door and keogh by the fire ryan said kathleen and i will drive to the scene of the action in the ford van you follow on the montesa ive got a couple of twoway radios in the case youll have one with you youll carry on a couple of miles and wait for the transporter when you see it you call me useeagle one as a call sign ill use eagle two what do i do then overtake the truck and join us weql set fire to the ford and kathleen lies down in the road and does her thing ive some of that false blood actors use shell put it on her face then they stop or we hope they do and you use the howler to screw up the transporters whole security system theyll be cut off from the world and if they fight no problem ive got two ak rifles in my case stun grenades and gas grenades even semtex and pencil timers but the doors will be unlocked anyway thanks to the howler fifteen minutes after we leave the farm benny will drive the replica transporter down to the coast road where hell dump it and clear off back to the farm on foot so we neutralile the guards what then you and kathleen get the hell out of it on the montesa all the way to the jetty at marsh end ill follow in the track but why cant we all go together in the truck keogh asked ryan put an arm around kathleen again because the tracks the vulnerable end of things if anything goes sour thats where it will i want her out of it if things do go wrong then as long as you and kathleen get to the irish rose theres always the chance of getting away kathleen said what do you think martin keogh said that its going to be one hell of a friday in kilburn just before evening hugh bell was sitting at the desk in his office when th door opened and the barman looked in some gentlemen to see you sir he was pulled to one side and a very large man in a navy blue raincoat entered hands in pockets so there you are you old bastard scully what do you want and bell knew fear ive brought an old friend to see you he stood to one side and a small man entered his face was thin and wasted he wore wire spectacles beneath an old trilby hat and a fawn raincoat mr reid bell said his mouth dry nice to see you hugh the belfast accent was very pronounced a word would seem to be in order a word bell said i dont understand you dont reid took off his hat and sat at the table and me all the way from belfast on behalf of the army council but what would they want with me reid took out an old silver case and selected a cigarette scully lit it for him with his lighter dont fence with me hugh the other year michael ryan put up a harebrained scheme to knock off some bullion truck up in the northwest of england dont deny it because you were involved the army council turned it down thats true bell said lamely i do recall something of that dont bullshit me hugh things get out as things always do and the whisper is thamichael is going ahead with this job on his own initiative right now he smiled thinly it would seem obviousthat you would be the man to know the truth of the matter he turned wouldnt you agree scully oh i would indeed mr reid and scullys smile was terrible he was in deep trouble bellknew that but he also knew that disclosing what he did know would do him no good at all when scully was brought in it always meant a bad end to things he was not known as the shankill butcher for nothing bell made his decision and took a deep breath sure i cant deny i know something of the matter mr reid michael did come to me the other day and discuss certain aspects the word i got was that a bullion track would be heisted is that true well it was in the original plan submitted to the army council and transshipped to somewhere in county down do you know where god save us but i dont scully i reid said the big man took a browning from his pocket and advanced bell said hurriedly no need for that i know where ryan is staying here in london ill take you there now scully relaxed and reid smiled very sensible hugh ill get my coat bell went into the bedroom picking up his jacinths put it on then quickly opening the opposite door darted along the corridor exited into the alley at the side of the pub and ran for the main road when the phone in the hall rang at follys end it was mary power who answered it she came into the kitchen and said to ryan its for you mr bell ryan went out to the hall and picked up the phone yes hugh were in trouble reid turned up from the army council with that sod scutly they know michael theyve heard a whisper did you tell them anything did i hell i ran for my life but they knew the plan i mean they would wouldnt they you submitred it to them originally the original plan was sketchy hugh no mention of follys end or the precise target and at that stage the boat was only an idea did you tell them about the irish rose did you tell them wed he putting in at kilalla of course not good then well get on with it keep your head down and mind your back hugh go to ground for a while after replacing the phone he stood there in the hall lighting a cigarette and thinking about it no point in alarming anyone no point at all he returned to the kitchen hugh bell nothing important he smiled at keogh ills tay up here in case there are any more calls from hugh youll have to spend the night at the cottage down at marsh end on your own no room here take the ford van ill be on my way then keogh swallowed his teaand got up ill see you in the morning bell didnt know where he was going he hesitated and started across kilburn high street at that moment an old mercedes limousine turned out of a side street scully at the wheel reid beside him hes there reid said crossing the road get him scully gunned the motor bell alarmed at the sound turned he tried to run and slipped in the rain the mercedes hit him at fifty miles an hour bounced him into the gutter and moved on a woman screamed as a crowd converged a uniformed woman police officer pushed her way through but by thetim she knelt down beside hugh bell he was very dead indeed chapter four the morning was bleak heavy clouds draped across the mountaing after breakfast ryan sat at the table drinking tea and thinking about things wondering about bell and reid and that bastard scully on the other hand there shouldnt be ay danger from them as long as bell kept out oflleir clutches the original plan submitted to the army council had been simply the idea of the thing that he knew of a track somewhere in the northwest of england that carried bullion that he thought it could be lifted and taken to ulster by boat so reid was at a dead end without bell he decided to take a chance went out into the hall and phoned the william mary the barman answered at once ryan said ryan here angus i was wanting a word with hugh is he there hes dead mr ryan killed in kilburn high street last night what happened ryan said he was knocked down crossing the road hitandrun accident the police found the car that did it abandoned a few streets away have they traced who was in it the police sergeant who called earlier said it had been stolen in hampstead a year ago he thinks it must have been standing in some garage all very unfortunate ryan said indeed it is mr ryan will you be coming in no ive got business to attend to well if you let me kqow where you are and give me a phone number ill keep you posted it was enough ryan smiled softly im away now but just one more thing angus put mr reid on the phone mr reid i dont understand angus said stop arsing around and put him on reid who had been standing beside angus listening in took the phone from him and shoved the barman across to scully michael old son dont you think its time to be reasonable was it you or scully at the wheel not that it matters when the time comes youre my meat you always did have a touch of the theatrical about you michael so you intend to carry out that harebrained scheme of yours goodbye reid michael ryan said and put down the phone he opened the back door lit a cigarette and stared into the rain thinking of hugh bell good friend and comrade in arms for so many years at least scully hadnt had the chance to squeeze the truth out of him there was some comfort in that the kitchen door opened and kathleen looked out there you are is everything all right fine i thought id take martin something to eat down at the cottage benny says hell drive me thats fine i want to go over the planning again so dont mind me ill see you later then she went back into the kitchen and ryan stayed there looking at the rain thinking about reid and scully they would have to go back home now nothing else for it there would be a confrontation even tually had to be but he would handle that when tile time came he thought of reid the skulllike face and wire spectacles and his smile was terrible to see you little bastard he said softly you want it all yourself dont you well ill see you in hell before i allow that to happen keogh hadnt bothered with the bedroom of the small cottage at marsh end simply built up the fire and lay on the couch he slept surprisingly well got up at seven and put the kettle on he stood at the open door looking out at the rain and noticed the creek on his right hand on impulse he went back inside stripped found a towel in the small bathroom and ran naked across the yard he draped the towel over a bush and plunged into the creek swimming strongly to the other side passing into the reeds for a while disturbing wildfowl and birds of every description who rose in clouds into the rain calling angrily the salt water was cold and invigorating what a grand way to start the day he said softly as he emerged from the creek and reached for the towel he wentback to the cottage toweling himself vigorously then he dressed and made a cup of tea there was milk bread eggs and bacon in the larder lie stood there sipping tea wondering whether to cook something when theresvas the sound of an engine in the yard he looked out andsaw the land rover with benny and kathleen in london at the william mary reid and scully were getting ready to leave their search of bells small office had yielded no clues scully said nothing mr reid what do we do we go back to belfast reid said dont worry ryan has got to come home and no place for him to hide well bide our time but well get the bastard in the end he raised his voice angus get in here angus stumbled through the door yes mr reid anythinganything at all you can tell me they took a train thats all i know i did hear the glasgow express mentioned glasgow scully said why would they go them not glasgow you fool that line goes up through the northwest theyll get off somewhere he turned back to angus anything else i dont think so angus brightened oh yes the other week i overheard mr bell on the phone it must

london angus nodded yes thats what he said did you hear him mention that nan again angus nodded just before they let i was in the stillroom checking boules i heard ryan say to mr bell the irish rose

thing keep your mouth shut give me any trouble and ill send scully to give you a seeing to theyll find you in the thames with your balls cut off reit went through the door and angus plainly terrified stood back scully patted his face you mind what mr reid says theres a good boy and he went out keogh ate the ham sandwich she had brought sitting at the end of the table and she sat opposite a mug of tea in her hands benny had gone back to the farm keogh finished it and lit a cigarette how are you how do you feel about the job you mean she shrugged ill be fine ive done things for uncle michael before dangerous firings i can look after mysell at your age you shouldnt have to he stood up come on well get a breath of air the mist drifted in creating a strange and somber world reeds lifted onther side of the creek water gurgled in the mud flats and as they walked along the broad track birds lifted in piotest on either hand a strange place this keogh observed yes im not sure that i like it she frowned it makes me feel uneasy i know what you mean they reached the jetty and paused the tide was out and iron girders were exposed corroded by rust i wonder what it was built for she said god knows been here for years victorian from the look of it but it still looks substantial enough they walked along it waves lapping around the girders below with a hollow booming sound then was no rail at the end only at the sides keogh peered over and noticed a jumble of granite blocks in the shallows theres your answer he said they must have shipped granite from here in the old days she stood to one side hands gripping the rail and looked out to sea a strangely forlorn figure in her raincoat and beret keogh leaned on the rail beside her what do you want kate what do you rally want out of life god knows all ive ever known was the troubles i was born the year they started all i know is the bombing and the killing my family friends all gone her face wa bleak life is supposed to be for the living but all i see is death does that make any sense to you perfect sense keogh nodded the terrible thing and you so young she laughed youre not exactly a graybeard yourself a very old thirtytwo he said and he laughed steps boomed along the jetty and they turned and saw ryan coming toward them god what a lousy day he said keogh pointed down into the water its to be hoped the tide is in at the right time tomorrow it will be ive doublechecked and its a high one he took out a cigarette one more thing hugh bell is dead my god kathleen said how did that happen so ryan told them as they walked back along the jetty keogh said reid cant touch you once youre back home with that transporter all right maybe your army council dont like people going their own way and acting without orders but youll be a bloody hero to them theyll welcome you with open arms when they hear about the bullion lets hope so its reid im concerned about unless i miss my guess hed like to have it all for himsell wellfuck him kathleen said angrily you mind your tongue girl ryan told her but if he doesnt know about kilalla he isnt a threat keogh said not when we land but later ryan shrugged who knows anyway lets go back to the farm ive got the land rover at th cottage mary power provided a simple meal at one oclock vegetable soup a cheese salad and the inevitable tea afterwards as she cleared the table she said to benny mind your chores now the sheep in the north meadow need seeing to he nodded eagerly got his cap and went out a moment later keogh standing at the window saw him cross the yard a sack across his shoulders against the rain the dog at his heels hes a worker that lad ill say that for him and in the mind still a child she said he has to be told everything ryan finished his tea and stood up i want to look at the ambush site again well go in the ford van me and kathleen you follow on the montesa ill give you one of the radios when we get there you carry on up the road a mile or two then contact me use the call sign eagle one like i said ill be eagle two fine by me keogh told him as the ford turned into the track toward the road leading down eskdale the girl was at the wheel she glanced at her uncle you know in not even licensedto do this im under age and you handling a wheel to the manner born since you were fourteen i mind thatnight when i took a bullet and crashed my car neakilkelly and you phoned me from a roadside phone box and told me to get the boys to come and get you and came yourself you little devil and in a stolen car well who showed me how to hotwire a stolen carg i know and to my shame he laughed the state i was in when you got there soaked to the skin in a stinking ditch a bullet in the shoulder and then you crashed through that ruc roadblock great days uncle michael were they he lit a cigarette and opened the window sometimes im not so certain anymore i must be getting old lie smiled suddenly one thing i am sure of youre a remarkable girl kathleen and you deserve better dammit you could be an early entrant for the university oh hold your tongue she toldhim ive more important things to do with my life he sat there thinking about it and a moment later they reached the junction and pulled in koc h rolowed two hunded yards hind lie was wearing the bikers black leatber jacket and the helmet in spite of the rain he was enjoying himself and fle montesa responded well the ford van turned into a layby a few yards from the junction keogh raised a clenched fist in greeting and carried on ryan sat in the van the twoway radio in his hand opened the door and looked out at the layby this will do fine after all we dont want to block the road so effectively and this thing burning so that i cant get by in the transporter at that moment keoghs voice crackled over the radio eagle two this is eagle one are you receiving me loud and clear ryan said anything to report nothing but birds the sea and this bloody rain can i go now ill see you back at the farm over and out ryan switched off the radio and smiled at kathleen ive seen enough girl so back to follys end it is mary power served the evening meal at seven oclock roast lamb potatoes carrots cabbage what fascinated keogh was the vast amount of food benny managed to put away jesus but youd think it was going to be his last meal on top of earth keogh said well if he does the work of three men hes entitled to eat three mens food kathleen put in but not to forget his manners mary power said and she reached over and hit benny over the knuckles with a wooden spoon now be a good boy and go and do the milking he pulled on his cap bread and cheese in one hand yes aunty he mumbled and went out away into the parlour with you and itt serve tea in there she told them kathleen ryan started to clear the plates and keogh said firmly my mm off you go with your uncle theres a good girl good girl yourself she said but went anyway following ryan out no irishman i ever knew would volunteer to do the work of a woman so i take it you wanted to speak to me mary power said something like that keogh stacked the plates for her are you happy with everything so far happy she filled the sink with hot water and slid the plates in ive forgotten what that word means my husband and i came here full of hope but this is only a place to die in subsistence farming of the worst kind the land is a creel master here i can see that so when michael came to me with word of this ploy he wanted to organize it was like a line thrown to a drowning man if it comes off benny and i can go back to ulster and if it doesnt well be trapped here forever michael made it clear there would be no police trouble whatever happens nothing to connect us with you lot and with luk thats the way it should stay lets hope so politics mean nothing to me but michael is a good man and i trust him keogh left her there and mt into the parlour the girl sat in the windowseat with her copy of the midnight court ryan was filling his pipq by the fire and lit it with a taper a good woman that keogh said shes had a bad time the worst ryan told him but better times coming god willing wed better check the weaponry in the barn after weve had our tea that suits me fine keogh said and me kathleen put in id like to try out that colt pistol mr bell gave me well well see ryan told her and at that mo ment mary power brought in a tray with the tea things later in the dimly lit barn keogh and ryan laid out the weaponry from ryans big case there were the two ak assault rifles spare clips the stun and smoke grenades and the semtex with its timing pencils there was even a spare walther in a leather ankle holster keogh checked it out where did that come from oh i thought it might come in useful i always liked the idea of an ace in the hole ryan said keogh examined each ak separately running his hands over the various parts expertly he loaded one and passed it to ryan that latest silencer they have is pretty damn good try it he took a wooden plank to the other end of the barn propped it against the bales of hay and came back kathleen and benny stood watching ryan raised the ak and fired three single shots there was the familiar crack the weapon always made ila the silenced mode and three bullet holes appeared in the plank keogh loaded the second ak and passed it across and that one ryan pressed the trigger again and achieved the same result he lowered the weapon and placed it on the trestle table thats all right then kathleen came forward holding the colt automatic now me keogh said its all yours she raised the colt in both hands took careful aim and fired kicking up straw to one side of the plank try again ryan told her the anger showed on her face but she took aim again and achieved the same result she was furious now and keogh said lotk most people cant hit a barn door with a handgun so dont take it to heart come with me he stopped six or seven feet away from the plank i wouldnt try it from any further away than this if i were you just point and shoot she tried again clipping the plank with one shot but her second was on target much better keogh saidbut holding the barrel against the target and pulling the trigger gets an even better result he turned and walked back ad ryan was laughing even benny wassmiling and she was annoyed well what about you small man lots of advice for others but little on displayfrom yourself keogh turned face calm and it was as if she was only noticing for the first time how cold his eyes were his hand went under his jacket at the rear the walther swung up he fired six times doubletapping splinters flew from the plank and it toppled over benny had his hands over his ears in spite of the silencer and kathleens look of astonishment was something to see keogh didnt say a word simply ejected the clip and refilled it it was ryan who put it into words here endeth the lesson now lets turn in its going to be a hell of a day tomorrow about four miles south of marsh end and some five miles off the coast the irish rose was on course rolling heavily in a troubled sea winds four to five in the wheelhouse the german muller was at the wheel tully sat at the clma table a cardboard box in front of him and the crew crowded round seven or eight handguns in there so take your pick i want every man armed dolan took a smith wesson this will do me fine the others helped themselves jock grant the en gineer said whats our estimated time of arrival about eleven oclock in the morning but i cant be sure i mean i dont know this marsh end place so navigating could be awkward and we need to go in on the tide so what happens dolan asked i dont know is the answer when bell first spoke to me he said wed to be ready to leave late afternoon he said the tide would be turning then and the timing was essential well go in and wait i mean ryans bound to turn up to finalize things but hes bound to expect trouble after what happened dolan persisted look he doesnt have any choice once he has that truck hes got to get it away ill tell him it was all a mistake that i didnt mean any harm that i was just making sure everything was on the level thats all what happens when we get to sea is another matter dolan said but that little keogh bastard is red hot i mean look what he did to your ear fm n of forgetting butlust remember theres five of us and only ryan and keog and the girl and shes the key if we can get our hands on her ryan will cave in soon enough well have to make it up as we go along we wont hit the irish coast till dawn ill think of something but to start with everybody behaves i dont know bert fox sounded dubious it could get nasty tully exploded in anger the biggest payday ever are sou in or out make your minds up it was dolan who spoke for all of them were with you mr tully no question isnt that right lads there was a chorus of approval and tully said get back to work they all went leaving muller at the wheel tully went out on the bridge and stood there staring into the darkness he touched his bandaged ear which still hurt like hell and it was keogh he was thinking of and what hed do to the little bastard when the time came chapter five the following morning when keogh rose at seven the weattler seemed to have deteriorated there was heavy mist now over the marsh and when he opened the front door the rain was relentless he made a cup of tea and shaved atcthe kitchen sink there was a small portable radirn the windowsill he switched it on and managed to find the early morning bbc news broadcast he continued to shave and was wiping his face clean when the weather forecast came on and he listened intently for the irish sea it was winds three to four with some sea fog and rain squalls which could have been worse he finished lais tea and started to dress when there was the sound of a vehicle outside he pulled on his boots and went to the window and saw kathleen getting out of the ford keogh took his reefer down from a peg and opened the door another dirty old morning he said cheerfully we thought youd like a proper breakfast ive come to fetch you now isnt that the kind thought he got into the passenger seat first well tae a run to the end of the jetty id like to see how things are fine by me she drove along the broad track and moved on to the jetty stopping just before the end keogh got out and went and peered over and she joined him only a few feet of water down there at the moment he said the tide must be way out and thats bad they wouldnt get in still its supposed to start turning around about tenthirty he looked out to sea pity about this damn mist irish rose could be hoveto out there but w cant see he smiled suddenly and queezed her shoulder never mind its going to be fine i have a good feeling about it now lets get that breakfast and the irishrose muller at the wheel was indeed hoveto about a mile out tully stood on the bridge with dolan peering into the mist god damn this weather dolan said cant see a thing he turned to tully is it off is it hell tully said if theres one thing i do well its navigate you know that no we wait for the turn of the tide and go in he turned fiercely nothing stops me getting my hands on that truck nothing and he went into the wheelhouse it was about half past ten and keogh and ryan were in the barn carefully checking the weapons again keogh picked up the walther in the ankle holster can i take this ive always liked an ace in the hole myself be my guest ill put it on just before we leave and he put it in the pocket of his reefer everything else goes with us in the large case ryan said ill bring it with me in the transporter just in case w have to impress friend tully exactly kathleen looked in im going down to marsh end in the ford with benny he thinks hes lost some sheep and they might have w andered tlgat way all right ryan told her but tberes any sign of the irish rose dont go near martin and i will be along in a wee while in the land rover ill see you there she said and went out katidleif n left the ford outside the cottage and she and benny walked down the track into the marsh it was still raining heavily and very misty suddenly there was the sound of a sheep baaing over on the right benny paused a curiously intent look on his face and then he smiled and nodded and moved off at surprising speed considering his size and kathleen went after him there were five sheep standing in water up to their bellies marooned from the look of it as miserable as any living creature could be benny laughed waded through the creek picked one upnd carried it across to dry land good he said kathleen nodded ill walk down to the jetty and she turned away as he waded back to the other sheep she walked along the track cocooned in mist and somewhere a dog barked and then the irish rose emerged as she went forward moored stem first against the end of the jetty the ramp wasnt down yet for the tide was still too low and a boy of perhaps twelve in a hooded anorak stood watching he had a fishing rod in one hand and a small terrier at his heel the legend irish rose was plain across the stern and the boy moved forward to examine il as he did so tully vaulted over the rail now then you little bastard what do you want he grabbed the boy by the front of his anorak and shook him and kathleen ryan ran forward you great bully let him go she struck out at tully who released his grip in astonishment and the boy turned and ran away followed by the dog tully grabbed for the girls wrist so its you is it leave me be she slapped his face and dolan and fox appeared at the stern laughing a hot one there captain needs sorting out are you up to it or do you need help tully was angry now as she slappedat him again you little bitch ill teach you he had both her wrists now and pulled her toward him and somewhere there was a terrible cry and benny arrived on the run he grabbed tully from behind pulling him away and throw him to the ground then he turned to the girl you go now tully scrambled up and punched him in the back benny swung an arm backwards and knocked him down again with casual ease and tully cried out dolan get down here dolan and fox vaulted the rail fox carrying an iron bar benny took a list in the face from dolan with no apparent ill effect but punched him in the breastbone in return knocking him oao his back kathleen screamed stop it fox rushed in wielding his iron bar benny actually took the blow on his left arm twisted foxs wrist so that he dropped the bar then he gave him a slap backhanded that spun fox around and sent him on his face benny look out kathleen called tully had got to his feet and picked up the iron bar he swung at bennys skull but the big man turned just in time so that it bounced off his shoulder he tore the iron bar from tullys hand then wrapped his great hands around his throat and actually lifted him off his feet there was a shot flat in the rain and keogh and ryan ran out of the mist benny no ryan called out benny paused still holding tully off the ground then gently lowered him tully collapsed groaning sitting on the ground head on his knees what brought this on ryan asked she told him when she was finished keogh said so some boy saw the boat so what it might mean something later but not now i agree ryan turned to benny good lad benny for looking after kathleen back to the farm with yo now he nodded to her go with him well sort things here im sorry uncle michael not your fault girl it comes from having to deal with scum she took bennys hand argl led him away tully dolan and fox were on their feet distinctly the worse for wear ryan stood looking at them what a sorry bunch of shites you are go on get on board before i forget myself and shoot the lot of ye in the wheelhouse tully saw at the chart table the rest of the crew grouped around him ryan said the only reasonim talking at all is that i need you well be back here between fourthirty and five with the transporter so you be ready for sea do you understand the crew shifted uncomfortably it was tully who said yes well be ready to go you came snooping at the william and mary ryan said so mr keogh informs me now why would you do that i was worried tully said i just wanted to make sure everything was kosher its kosher enough for me to promise to blow your fucking head off if you try anything on the trip to kilalla do you hear me yes good well be off now and you be ready to leave at the approrriate time he went down the ladder followed by keogh and then crossed to the rail and dropped down to the jetty what do you think keogh asked oh theyll try to cut our throats halfway across and doesnt that bother you why should it thats why i have you along keogh dolan said who was that bloody great ape king kong i dont know tully replied and lnassaged his neck i thought i was on the way out so what happens now fox demanded we wait we do as were told just remember one thing when we put to sea king kong wont be along for the ride the boot will be on the other foot then just before three keogh stood beside the montesa in the barn and pulled on the bikers leather jacket he lifted the dark cord slacks he was wearing above the fight ankle and strapped the walther into place he slipped the silenced version into the back of his waistband under the jacket and was ready to go kathleen was wearing a denim jacket and jeans and she carried the colt in an inside pocket ryan inspected the inside of the weaponry case then snapped it shut and ut it in the back of the ford he turned to them embracing mary power then took bennys hand were going now benny you understand benny nodded eagerly yesuncle michael you do as auntylary tells you yes uncle michael youre a good lad michael ryan turned to kathleen and keogh time to go then the moment of truth and it was just like the test runs keogh toldhimself trailing the ford on the montesa and the damn rain didnt it ever stop up here the ford pulled into the layby he swerved to one side and halted ryan was round the back of the ford the door wide and opening the big case he took out one of the ak assault rifles stock folded came across un zipped keoghs leather jacket and shoved it inside on your way boy keogh gunned the engine reaching eighty in fifteen seconds arriving at the junction in three minutes he pulled in and waited when the green and white transporter with shelby meat importers on the side drove by so exactly the same as the replica it had a dreamlike quality to it as if it was not really happening and he hurriedly switched on his radio eagle one to eagle two target on course there was a pause and then a crackle eagle two message received come home keogh put the radio away gunned his engine and went after the track fast for a few seconds he trailed it then pulled out to overtake one arm raised in salutation went round a bend ahead and disappeared crazy bastard the transporter driver said to the two security guards sitting in the catin behind him they wore blue serge suits for uniforms would have given the game away but each man carried a browning in a shoulder holster probably kill himself one of these days one of them said guys like that usually do well thats his business his friend told him so lets have a cup of coffee he opened a thermos and somewhere up ahead there was the muffled sound of an explosion and smoke lifted into the air jesus whats that the driver demanded and they went round the corner leading to the junction keogh swerved into an open field gate got off the motorcycle and pushed it up on its stand the suitcase containing the weaponry was on the ground by the wall and he saw kathleen at the side of the road smearing the false blood on her face as ryan ran to the back of the ford a noment later there was a muffled explosion and flames flickered around the vehicle a larger explosion followed as he ran and black smoke lifted into the sky the transporter came round the corner and skidded to a halt at the horrific scene keogh pulled out his ak and unfolded the stock but it wasnt necessary ryan switched on the howler and punched the buttons the door he cried to keogh the door keogh ran to the offside door pulled on the handle and it opened to his touchl he was aware of the driver the two behifi one already with a gun in his hand ryan lobbed in a stungrenade it was enough a moment later he had the driver from behind the wheel dazed and bewildered keogh pulled out tho two security guards they dragged them behind the field wall and ecured them with the plastic handcuffs kathleen was on her feet wiping the blood away ryan said good you got your oscar he ran to the back of the truck and opened the doors revealing the containers inside would you look at that now keogh said would you indeed ryan picked up the suitcase with the waponry and shoved it up into the cabin of the transporter go on martin get the hell out of it keogh folded the ak and put it back inside his bikers jacket come on girl he said to kathleen he flung a leg across the motorcycle she jumped onto the pillion behind him and put her arms around him as they drove away ryan switched on the engine of the transporter and followed leaving only the burning van hissing in the rain and the three men slowly regaining their senses behind the wall it was almost half an hour later that a local farmer in his station wagon came upon the scene of carnage when keogh and kathleen on the montesa reached marsh end and turned along the track to the jetty the irish rose already had the ramp down tully was waiting on deck with dolan and fox and keogh ran the montesa straight on board and braked to one side kathleen slid from the pillioniind keogh dismounted he had the ak out in sexfids and unfolded the stock theres no need for that tully said did it work like a dream then where is it weve got to get out of here ive got the engines turning over and a nan on the wheel take it easy keogh said hell be here go and make sure everythings ready tully turned away reluctantly and keogh smiled at kathleen and took out a cigarette we did it kate we did it she was incredibly excited know i know mattin but where is uncle michael hes coming girl dear that transporter isnt as nippyas the lesa but it was another agonizing twen minutes before the green and white transporter appeared from the mist came along the jetty andbounced on board it rolled to a halt and braked and ryan got out i thought id had it the damned engine died on me already dolan and bert fox were hurriedly clamping the huge wheels to the deck kathleen said what happened theres an automatic choke system it was jammed full on must have been the blast from the stun grenade once id got it in i managed to get going again tully called from the bridge can we go for christs sake ryan waved as soon as you like the irish rose slipped out into the estuary and fled into the mist leaving the land behind we did it ryan said we certainly did keogh offered him a cigarette only one matter of interest still to be resolved and whats that ryan asked accepting a light oh exactly at what point on the way to kilalla they intend to hit us well the best way of handling that is to impress them ryan said get your ak out and ill do the same conspicuous display at all times and im carrying too kathleen said ive got my colt in my inside pocket for gods sake stay out of it girl and leave it to martin and me he got back in the cab opened the case and took out the other ak ie got down again held it against his thigh and moved to the rail there were a couple of ships boats on either side at the stem suspended in davits and an inflatable in yellow plastic with an outboard motor handy for his illicit runs ashore ryan oh the outboard looks pretty good to me keogh said close to brand new probably stolen if i know tully so what do we do now keogh ad give him time hes got to work the ship well wait till were a few miles out to sea then well have words he looked up at the wheelhouse and saw tully looking down at them from the stem window ryan waved grinning in the wheelhouse muller was again at the wheel tully sat at the chart table dolan standing beside him grant and fox were below in the engine ioom you see what theyre carrying dolan demanded yes aks those things could cut us to pieces i know weve got to box clever hide your gun in the chart drawer mullers too the go below and tell fox and grant to stow theirs somewhere in the engine room ill keep mine in my pocket but i dont understand look its obvious hes leaving us to make our way out to sea after a while hell be coming to see me and armed like that theres nothing we can do theyll search the lot of us at gun point and wont find anything except yours which might make ryan think thats all there is dolan looked dubious and tully pushed him go on get moving ivegot a course to lay dolan went out and muller said in his heavily accented english so we still go toilalla well we cant exactly turn due south ryans no fool for the time being well simply make for the coast of county down in a general way until we see what happens with guns such as they have it could be difficult i you worry too much tully said its going to work and im going to take that truck from them one way or another i promise you iyan waited for an hour before making his move right he said you stay up in the cab kathleen nice and comfortable while martin and i go and sort out the bad guys i could die for a cup of tea well if you look in the case beside the weapons youll find a damn great thermos flask courtesy of mary power theres an old cake tin in there too no cake just ham and cheese sandwiches uncle michael youre the wonder of the world you think of everything not this time thank mary power he turned to keogh here we go martin moment of truth tully watched them coming r yan in the lead and debated for a wild moment trying to shoot him as he mounted the steel ladder to the bridge but hastily abandoned the idea as keogh stood back ak raised to cover ryan ryan reached the bridge safely and stood outside the open door coveringully muller at the wheel and dolan top of the morning ryan said and raised his voice come away up martin keogh joined him a moment later there you are tully hows the ear tully glowered at him its been better im sorry to hear that search them ryan told him keogh quickly ran a hand over muller then dolan he found the smith wesson revolver tully had in his pocket very naughty ryan said im surprised at you im the captain tully protested what do you expect oh almost anything from you where are the other two grant and fox are in the engine rom well pay them a visit and take another look at this pig boat on the way as you like tully shrugged and went to the voice pipe and whistled fox replied and tully said mr ryan wants a look at the engine room were on our way down good ryan said lets get moving he nodded to dolan you too from the deck below ihe wheelhouse a companionway led to a narrow passage door on either side one of the doors had toilet painted on it keogh opened it and found a stall lavatory a wash basin and a shower is this for the whole boat no i have a separate one tully said qt goes with my cabin thats uiader the wheelhouse and these other doors crew quarters keogh opened the doors and had a glimpse of untidy bunlcs and general disorder what a stink doesnt anybody wash on this boat tully was enraged but kept his mouth shut ryan said so wheres the engine room end of the passage right lead the way the both of you tully opened a door at the end and the throbbing of the engines became very pronounced they went down a companionway and found themselves in the engine room itself grant and fox oiling the pistons and other moving parts they paused in their work and tullsaid is everything olca as much as it ever will be with this old bag of bones grant told him keogh said hands high boys ran raised his rifle and sullenl thedid as the were told keogh retired satisfied clean as a whistle fine ryan said well go back then chapter six the sea was building up as they went out on deck and the irish rose was already beginning to roll from side to side rain swept in clearingthe mist a little they went back up to the wheelhouse climbing the ladder one by one tully sat down at the chart table so what no ive done a boat crossing from the lake district coast to ulster twice over the years ryan told him is that a fact yes so i know where the isle of man ishalfway between the two and we pass south skirting what they call the calf of man if you say so oh but i do and there it is on your top chart id say we should be seeing the lighthouse there at midnight so what that should give us a landfall at kilalla around fillce it depends on the weather and so it does but keep on course i have a marine compass in any ease and id be ver hurt if i discovered we werent proceeding in a esterly di all right tully said sullenly now what happens well as there is nowhere else id particularly like to spend the night on this disgusting pig boat well use the cab of the truck it even has a bunk behind the drivers seat he turned to keogh give him your radio martin keogh took it fom his pocket and put it on the chart table there you go whats this tully demanded twoway radio i have onetoo so we can keep in touch us down there and you up here another thing you have one of your men standing on the deck down there where i can shoot hith if anything untoward happens you bastard i always was but i keep my word and im going to give you a chance to be sensible he took an envelope from his pocket and threw it down thats the fifty thousand pounds mr keogh took from you tully was truly shocked my god count it when were gone its all there ryan smiled looking like the devil himself no blood o shed no aggravation and you get another fifty thousand at kilalla in a few hours think about it he nodded to keogh lets go you first martin ill mind your back and you cover me they went down the ladder one after the other and tully opened the envelope and examined the money damn him he said whats he playing at dolan asked hes giving me a way out isnt he play the game and settle for a hundred thousand and will you theres fifty million pounds in gold sitting out there dolan fifty million all right dolan said but these are hard bastards well so am i tully sat there frowning and examining the chart dolan said have you any ideas not at the moment if we dont pass the calf of man hed know it on top of that hes got marine compass he shook his head no welfhave to stay on course and wait for our chance theres bound to he one maybe in the early hours of the morning when were closer to ireland dolan nodded theyll he tired then and seasick with any luck i didnt tell the bastard but i checked the weather forecast and its deteriorating winds gusting to seven around midnight and you know what this old tub is like in rough weather the original beast xo the radio crackled and keogh voice sounded as the song says is that the captain of the ship tully pressed the answer button what do you want a man on deck all right tully turned to dolan down you go mick two hours then ill have mullerrieve you and youd better take an oilskin youll need it he smiled savagely see its started to rain again dolans shift being over it was muller who stood by the ladder clearly visible in the sickly yellow glow of the deck lights a miserablelooking figure as he tried to shelter from the rain under the lower canopy of the wheelhouse now isnt that the great sight keogh demanded as he devoured one of mary powers ham sandwiches kathleen laughed as she passed ht a cup of tea youre a terrible man martin ryan said his bad luck hes on the wroag side here ill put the heater on for a while a warm glow spread throughout the cabin within seconds god but thats nice kathleen said ryan took another sandwich youll be fine back there in the cabin nice and cosy on that bunk bed you get your head down and get some sleep what about you and martin oh we can snatch an hour or two just sitting here well take it in turns they finished eating and she put the rest of the sandwiches and the thermos away and looked out into the darkness where the sea was angry whitecaps driving in rolling the irish rose from one side to the other kathleen clutched at keoghs arm exciting isnt it he said sardonically damn you martin im bloody terrified and you know it it always gets worse before it gets better thats the way of it he teased her she pufiched him in the shoulder you can stop that ryan looked at his watch nine oclock get on the bunk and try to sleep youll be better off yes well first i want to go to the toilet the one thing we dont have he said its all fight for you and martin you can stand at the side of the truck i cant do that dear god ryan picked up the radio and called the wheelhouse tully come in what do you want tully demanded my niece wants the toilet keogh is going to escon her and just to keep you in order hell take muller with him all fight tully said keogh opened the door on his side and stepped down his ak at the ready the stock folded the wind was much stronger now driving in the rain as he approached muller the lady needs the toilet so you lead the way and watch yourself muller glared at him but did as he was told opening the door to the companionway and leading the way down keogh followed the girl at his heels he kept muller covered while she went inside when she came out keogh said to muller go on you first muller obeyed sullenly and took up his statfon under the wheelhouse canopy whilst keogh and kathleen returned to the truck and climbed inside lie down now ryan told her there are blankets there try and sleep she did as she was told and keogh and her uncle sat there looking out as rain streamed down the windscreen and the ship rolled better than a rollercoaster this ryan said the germans built them for inshore work keogh told him the bottoms almost flat he lit a cigarette ive been thinking very convbnient tully having the one pistol i know i wouldnt believe that for one minute that ploy of yours giving him the fifty housand back will it work id like to think so but i doubt it hes a greedy animal that one but it was worth the try so whats your best guess oh hell stay on course because i can check with my marine compass i should imagine hell wait till were close to the irish coast the early hours would be best theyll expect us to be tried so i suggest you get your head down for a while and ill keep watch and keogh with the soldiers habit ingrained of snatching an hour of sleep when he could simply leaned back in his seat closed his eyes and was asleep in the instant his breathing deepened and ryan watched him for a while hell on wheels one and capable of anything but who are you marin he thought who are you really he sat there the ak in his lap watching muller occasionally glancing up at the light in the wheelhouse and waited keogh came awake vrlth a start ryans hand on his shoulder he checked his watch and saw that it was midnight you should have wakened me michael you need your sleep too less than you do im older will you look over keogh saw the lighi at once flickering out there in the darkness would that be the calf of man thats right and were dead on course ive checked with the compass so far so good then ill just step out for a moment call of nature he opened the door and stepped down the wind so strong that it bounced against him it was dolan on duty again and keogh waved cheerfully try to smile you miserable sod he called and relieved himself at the side of the truck he climbed back inside and ryan said now me and got out on his side tully watching all this from the stem window of the wheelhouse suddenly clenched his fist excitement surging through him thats it christ thats it he turned to muller ill take the wheel relieve dolan tell him to get up here go on its important muller did as he was told and afew moments later dolan came in water streaming from his oilskins whats up i only did an hour i think ive got it tully said that girl is going to want to go to the toilet again shes bound to so what well try this for size keogh held muller at gunpoint while she went in thats right what would happen if there was someone waiting in there with a shooter someone whod bring her out with the barrel under her elfin what would mr bloody keogh do what could he do my god its a thought dolan sai yes well you cant do it theyll miss you if youre off the deck too long so get down tothe engine room and get fox grant will have to manage on his own tell fox to get his shooter and go to that toilet now he can sit there and wait how long for as long as it bloody well takes now get out of here and he hung on to the wheel as a sudden squall hit the irish rose from the north ho it was just after thvo the wind very strong now and ryan checked his watch we must be close three oclock was a fair arrival time kathleen came awake with a groan and sat up jesus i feel awful what time is it ryan told her and she swung her legs to the floor ill have to go to the toilet again all fight give me a minute he called tully what do you want tully replied my niece needs the toilet well handle itthe same as last time thats okay tully replied then shaking with excitement he got the two guns from the chart table drawer and passed one to muller when the fight moment comes put the wheel on the chain lock in this weather the german asked itll only be for a moment tully whistled down the voice pipe and when grant answered he said jodk were in business get your gun and wait at the top of the engine room companionway the going to the toilet ill be there grant answered tully punched the chart table with one fist itll work it bloody well has to dolan went down the companionway and stood sullenly under the threat of keoghs ak i shant be long kathleen said fox hearing the voices had moved into the shower pulling the curtain closed she went into the toilet cubicle and he waited pouncing when she came out twisting her left wrist behind her back and ramming the muzzle of his pistol into her neck now then you bitch get that door open she cried out martin watch yourselfl and fox released her wrist got the door open and pushed her out between keogh and dolan his pistol still against her neck give that rifle to dolan he ordered go on do it kathleen screamed shoot them martin the both of them dont mind me ill kill her i swear it fox cried no need just cool it keogh handed the ak butt first to dolan who stepped back covering him with it a look of unholy pleasure on his face now then you bastard the door to the engine roomcompanionway opened at the end of the passage and grant stepped out a revolver in his han im here boys he called fox lowered his pistol and turned to look at him and everything happened at once kathleen half turned her hand slipping inside her denim jacket she found the colt pulled it out rammed the muzzlein foxs stomach and pulled the trigger twice keogh hitched his right trouser leg revealing the walther in the ankle holster dropped to his left knee pulling the gun out in one fluid motion his first bullet catching dolan in the left shoulder he dropped the ak spinning round and keoghs second smashed his spine grant got off one wild shot keogh fired back creas ing his shoulder and the scotsman disappeared fast keogh picked up the ak and put a hand on the girls arm are you all fight fine she laughed shakily i did what you told me and you were fight hold it against them and you cant miss so lets get out of here he got the door of the companionway open and called across to the truck michael they tried to jump us are you all right ryan called opening his door and sheltering behind it fine cover us were coming through he pushed kathleen out keep behind my back girl and he turned looking up at the wheelhouse and fired a quick burst into the air when he saw a movement up there at the window kathleen reached her uncle in safety get back into the rear cabin youll be safe there s did as she was told and he called to keogh whoas sheltering behind the passenger door what happened keogh told him so you were right after all i usually am a bad habit in the wheelhouse it was several minutes before grant reached the bridge by a circuitous route involving the engine room hatch he was very pale eyes wild blood staining his left shoulder he pulled off his jacket found a piece of engine room rag and tried to bandage his shoulder that little bitch shot fox she had a gun then keogh killed dolan and had a go at me what do we do now i dont damn well know do i tully answered he went to the stem window killed the wheelhouse light then opened the window keeping in the shadows and peered down he saw the truck doors standing open like wings and realized ryan and keogh must be standing bghind them he took careful aim at keoghs side aiming below the door in the hope that he might get lucky and catch feet or ankles he emptied his revolver firing six times the response was terrible as both ryan and keogh fired a long burst back dissolving the wheelhouse windows into a snowstorm of flying glass tully and grnt went down on the floor fast but muller wasnt so lucky several rounds catching him in the back he fell the wheel started to spin and tully crawled to it and hf crouching pulled it round then secured the wheel with the chain lock thatll hold for a while but how long for and what do ye bloody do grant asked i dont know do i it was ten minutes later that the radio crackled and ryan said you there tully yes theres still three of us tully lied muller grant and me are you going to be sensible why should i be you need me more than i need you ryan the irish rose rolled heavily as the wind howled in unless you can handle a ship like this and i dont think so especially not in weather like this so what do you suggest i dont know only one things certain you cant touch us up here if we keep our heads down and we cant get at you id call that stalemate so what do you suggest i dont know ill think about it hes right keogh called across to him no way of storming the wheelhouse theyd have every advantage and even if we did and by some miracle sug c eeded in knocking them off where would be the advantage ryan said could we sail this thing on our own you and me martin i doubt it keep pointing it at ireland is about the best you could do as long as the engines kept going with no one to handle them ryan ajabok his head i dont think so nothing happened for some fifteen minutes and then tullys voice crackled over the radio ryan are you there what do you want were three miles off the down coast still aiming for kilalla you could still land us there take the other fifty thousand and go your way and no harm done i dont believe you youd shoot me like a dog ix after thats happened its not on and kilalla is miles away north of here anyway so what do you suggest i can turn this tub round and put out to sea again any time i want and we sail on forever like the flying dutchman you up there in the wheelhouse and us down here ryan said and where would that get us nowhere from your point of view tully went off the air again its no good keogh said ill have to try and rush the ladder and you can give me covering fire covering fire are you mad or what ryan said you wouldnt stand a chance and you know crouched down in the wheelhouse tully said to grant hows the arm it hurts like hell but it was only a crease ill survive with you in the engine room add me up here we could still sail back to england couldnt we i suppose so what are you suggesting im going to try hlm with an offer one last time tullys voice sounded over the radio ryan what do you want i could turn out to sea like i said we could go round in circles till the diesel oil runs out then wed just drift until someone called the coastguard and they came to investigate and then the fat would be in the fire for all of us true enough ryan said so what do you suggest why not cut your losses theres the big yellow inflatable behind you in the stern with a good outboard motor were only two miles off the coast now as far as i know you could make it easily now that the winds dropping and leave the gold to you ryan demanded so what do we get out of this your lives tully said and you trying to pick us off as we get in the i cant even see it from the wheelhouse the trucks in front of it think about it ill give you five minutes and then ill mrn this thing around he went off the air and kathleen said angrily we cant do it uncle michael not after all weve been through i know girl i know he turned to keogh what do you think macdn i dont think we have much choice so its live to fight another day and then ryan smiled that unholy smile of his of course there is another possibility which is to make sure tully doesnt get the gold either kathleen gasped and keogh said and how would you do that so ryan told them minute later fie called tully all right youre on oive me a few moments while keogh cheeks that you really cant see that inflatable because of the truck and ill come back to you in the wheelhouse tully laughed hoarsely and turned to grant its worked the bastards going to go weve won if he means it of coarse he does no other way out nothing for him here now ryans voice sounded again okay tully everything checks ill see you in hell one of these days the transmission ended and tully laughed exultantly ive beaten the bastard fifty million pounds and its all mine all ours you mean grant said of course tully smiled we need each other so lets get this tub turned around sheltered by the truck keogh and ryan slid the inflatable over th stem rail and tethered it by its line keogh went over first and got to work on the outboard motor it roared into life instantly with a strong heai tbeat over you go girl ryan told kathleen keogh helped her in and the inflatable tossed this way and that in the choppy sea the stem of the irish rose rising up and falling again just above them come on michael for gods sake keogh called not before i leave tully his goingaway pres ent ryan held it up a half pound block of scmrex and a oneminute timing pencil he pulled open the stem deck hatch dropped the semtex inside and closed the hatch again he was over the rail on the instant untied the line and keogh gunned the motor they were perhaps fifty yards away when the stem of the irish rose exploded into the darkness in a vivid tongue of flame the end was incredibly quick the ship tilting the prow rising dramatically and it slid backwards under the surface vanishing in seconds in a hiss of sam and you can chew on that you bastard michael ryan said and put an arm around his niece all right martin take us to some sort of shore it was folsr oclock in the mor ning the sky lightening just a lle when they coasted into a wide beach the land rising on the other side cloaked with trees keogh killed the outboard moor jumped over with the line and waded outf the water ryan helped kathleen over the side and followed her what do we do with the infiatablet keogh ryan was inspecting itin the light of a small torch no name on it as far as i can see hoo a couple of holes in it martin keogh waded in again and pushec the inflatable out to sea again it drifted for a while then an eddy took it out some distance he took careful aim with his silenced walther and fired twice after a while the inflatable went down tt and where do you think wed he uncle michael kathleen asked god knows girlbut it hardly matters were home he turned to keogh what now martin i think it best we part company keogh told him you go your way michael ryan and ill go mine martin kathieen sounded distressed cant we stay together i dont think so kate your uncle will have his plans and the army council and reid to consider one trip back home to dear old ireland has been exciting enough for me ill say goodbye michael he shook ryans hand the irl grasped his arm reached up and kissed his cheek god bless you martin and thanks for all youve done i didnt have the chance to pay you ryan said lm sorry not to worry keogh smiled it was a great ploy he started to walk away and ryan called who are you martin who are yon really god saveus there are days in the week when i dont know that myself and keogh turned into the trees he disappeared and ryan said off we go girl well find a road follow it and see where we are he led the way up through the trees a ghostly pas sageas dawn came so that it was comparatively easy to see the way they came to a narrow country road in a few minutes there was a turning opposite and a signpost you stay here in shelter and ilt see where we he walked through the rain to the signpost examined it nd came back standing beside her in the shelterof the trees to light a cigarette drumdonald three miles to the left scotstown five miles the other way we might as well go for the shorter walk they stayed there for a moment and she said all for nothingwe dont even know where the irish rose went down dont we he laughed and took another black instrument from his pocket that looked rather like the howler another gadget that young electronic genius at queens university found for me its called a master navigator i gave himarsh end and kilalia and he programmed in their positions this thing has given a constant reading of course and position all the way across i know exactly where the irish rose went down my god she said and you never told me there are things i keep close to myself so what do we do now reid will be looking for us and that swine scully and the army council ryan said no time to take a trip i think they say americas grand at this time of the year well get to the safe house at bundoran false passports there you know how careful i am theyre always in stock but money uncle michael what about that oh i wasnt exactly honest with martin i still have the second fifty thousand pounds i was to pay tully in an envelope in my breast pocket my god what a man you are it should keep us going for a while when it runs out ill think of something such as ive robbed banks in ulster and got away with it no reason i cant do the same in america sometimes i think youre a raving madman p nd sometimes i am but lets get going he took her arm and they started along the road to drumdonald there was silence only the rain and then keogh stepped out of the trees where he had sheltered while listening to the conversation you bloody old foxi he said softly and there was a kind of admiration there he turned and started to walk the opposite way toward scotstown it was six oclock in the morning and in dublin jack barry was half awake lying in the big bed beside his wife when the portable phone hed placed at the side of the bed sounded he slid out of bed picked it up and went into the bathroom yes a reverse charge call for you from a mr keogh will you take it of course barry said a moment later keoghs voice sounded in his ear that you jack where are you a public telephone box in a village called scots town on the down coast whats going on i have twenty men from the county down brigade waiting at kilalla send them home jack the irish rose wont be coming tell me barry ordered which keogh did when he was finished barry said christ what a ploy and to end like that i know quite a fella michael ryan i was thinking barry said standing in the trees listening to him talk to his niece you could have shot the bugger and taken that master navigator wed have knowne location of the damn thing boat then a major salvage operation to get that gold up jack that sounds like an excuse have you gone soft on me i liked him jack and i liked the wee girl the bullion didnt reach its destinotion the loyalists wont be able to arm for a civil war let it end there barry laughed harshly damn you right as usual scotstown you say theres a pub there called the loyalist but dont believe it the landlord kevin stringer is one of our own ill phone him now and tell him to expect you ill send a car for you later sounds good to me watch yourback keogh came out of the phone box and stood there for a moment in the rain thinking of michael ryan and his niece aware with some surprise that he wished the enemy well then he lit a cigarette and went down the village street in search of the pub new york state ireland london washington ireland chapter seven paolo salamone walked across the grass with his lawyer marco sollazo in spite of the sicilian names they were both good americans born and bred there the similarity ended salamone was off the streets of newyorks little italy and hed followed the usual mifia route first as one of the boys the piccioti gaining advancementand respect hed acted as an executioner three times which had gained him entry into the family of don antonio russo as a sicario a specialist assassin hed been to prison twice on comparatively minor matters including drag dealing his downfall occurred two years earlier when on taking out one of den antonios competitors a street policeman had unexpectedly arrived on the scene salamone in a gun baffle had received a bullet in the leg which had put him down unfortunately his own bullet had killed the police officer who just happened to be a woman his sentence of twentyfive years insteadof life reflected the skill of his lawyer don antonios nephew marco sollazo the only reason salamone had been transferred to green rapids from the ossining correctional facility was because he had taken a full nursing course and was therefore thought of more use in the green rapids medical facility marco sollazo was thirtyfive a saturnine rather handsome man in an armani striped suit and college tie dark hair swept back a product of groton and harvard law school carefully nurtured by his uncle he was don antonios pride and joy maico you told me there was a chance youd get me a rehearing involuntary manslaughter now you tell me i could he here another twentythree years im doing my best marco said its difficult yeh well im doing my best i know plenty about the family but i dont speak out paolo i dont think don antonio would he pleased to hear you speak like that it would distress him paolo said fiastily hell dont get me wrong id never betray my godfather its just like i could do with some help here i know i know marco sounded sympathetic ill explore every avenue i mean the don has much influence who knows saiamone plucked at his arm what if i give you something good something real good and what would that be there were prisoners and their visitors wandering evcrywbere on the grass and salamone pulled solazo over to a bench and sat down he pointed across to a man who was in his mid sixties with gray hair the young darkhaired woman with him seemed about twentyfive liam kelly he calls himself the woman is his niece jean kelly shes a theater nurse down at green rapids general hospital sot hes doing twentyfive for shooting a policeman in pleasantville ten years ago when he was robbing a bank i met him in ossining then he had an angina attack and the moved him down here because of the hospital i followed a few months later to join the staff you see weve got a good facility here but green rapids is very special any problem and we send the patient slraight down so where is this leading the other month he had an attack i should tell you theyre irish but not the usual kind that funny accent they have in the north of ireland anyway hes not in good health and he got a fever they had him on a drip in a private room i was night nurse at the time and had to check him out so when he was delirious he said all sorts of crazy things kept going on about some ship called the ldsh rose and then he would say he was the only one who knew where it had gone down the only one who knew where the gold was there was a long pause sollazo sat there frowning the only one who knew where the gold was he said that thats right so what did you make of itt salamone was enjoying himself i went to the prison library weve got a great computer service here i tapped in the irish rose name and bingo go on sollazo told him there was an item in the new york times in the aumnm of nineteen eightyfive it seems a truck carryin fifty million pounds in gold bullion was knocked off up in the northwest of england on the coast it said police inquiries indicated it had put to sea on a ferry called the irish rose then what the ship disappear but lifebes and what was left of a lifeboat were waslled up on the irish coast end of story and it said nothing about who was behind it not a word interesting sollazo said lets take a walk they strolled across the grass and passed the bench where kelly and his niece were sitting heads together she glanced up casually and salamone said hi liam hows yourself paolo was the reply sollazo and salamone passed on and kathleen ryan said her accent more american than irish now who was that one uncle michael paolo salamone hes a nurse in the hospital weve something in common were both doing twentyfive years for shooting a policeman only in his case it was for shooting a policewoman anyway how are you im fine they keep me busy at the hospital still no man in your life too much bother she smiled lucky i managed the job at green rapids at least i can see you regularly and for how long another fifteen years he shook his head you cant waste your lif like this kathleen he was angry now and stood up god how could lhave been so stupid a smalltown bank i said a piece of cake and then that policeman came round the corner it was just one of those things well thank god you managed to drive off and get the hell out of it he took out a pack of cigarettesand lit one she said you know you shouldnt smoke so i can extend my life a year or two here in good old green rapids detention center he grinned wryly and dropped the cigarette to the ground all fight ill be good com on ill walk you to the gate there were a number of people going in the same direction and she noticed salamone and sollazo they reached the security exit and paused ryan kissed her on the cheek thanks for coming ill see you friday she went through security and approached her car as she unlocked her door she saw sollazo walking towards a silver porsche he glanced at her casually then looked away for some reason it made her feel uncomfortable and she got in her car quickly and drove off sollazo watched her go and reached for his mobile phone and called his office when his secretary answered he said rosa check the files for a report in the new york times of a robbery in the north of england connected with a ship called the irish rose which apparently went down at sea vepy well sir anything else yes get our people in london to check for any newspaper stories there theyll probably be more detailed i want this like yesterday ill get nght on it im having dinner early with don antonio at the long islan house no the trump tower apartment as soon as you get that stuff from england fax it to me there i will sollazo drove away thinking about the situation and particularly the fact thatthe way gold prices had climbed fifty million pounds in bullion in was now worth double in her room at green rapids general hospital kathleen ryan undressed and were to the shower she was due on the evening shift in an hour on call for emergency surgery until six in the moming not that she minded for she loved her work was good at it it had been her uncle who had insisted that shefind a life for herself after his trial and sentencing and shed put in five hard years of training ossining had been the bad time she hadnt been able to see him much while he was at that grim fortress in a way his heart problem had been a blessing the less restrictive regime at green rapids allowed a great deal of visiting and getting a post at the town hospital had made all the difference but it hurt her to see him there a shadow of the man he had been in those great days back in ireland whentheyd taken on the might of the ira even on occasion the british army and won at that memory a thrill passed through her that was almost sexual she toweled off dried her cropped hair and put on her uniform she comd her hair checking herself in the mirror strong face dark eyes not pretty but striking this girl who had at the age of fourteen killed two members of the ira with a hand grenade who at the age of sixteen had shot dead at close quarters a man named bert fox it all came back the lake district that lonely road and the taking of the transporter and martin keogh and the final brutal confrontation on the irish rose and at the memory the old excitement surged through her theres got to he more than this she said aloud he cant rotin there for another fifteen years despair flooded over her and she sat down opened a bottom drawer in her desk and took out abriefcase inside was a large envelope containing fifty thousand dollars in cash money she had painstakingly saved money against the day they would have to move fast she and uncle michael for from the time he had been moved from ossining to the easier regime of green rapids she had entertained the wild hopethat he might he able to escape she had even approached a forger in new york an old cell mate of her uncle in ossining who had provided her with two false irish passports at a thousand dollars each a special price as a favor she found them now and examined them daniel forbes that was her uncleand she was nancy forbes a waste the whole thing for as she soon discovered in spite of its liberal regime security at green rapids was stringent she looed at the photoin the false passport and somehow it wa a stranger whatever happened to kathleen ryan she asked softly at that moment the door opened and another nurse lboked in ready jeanon my way kathleen told her ill be right with you she closed the briefcase put it back in the drawer and went out don antonio russo was seventy years of age and of ample proportions his loose cream linen suit accentuating his bulk his hair was long and gray swept back from his fleshy arrogant face a man who had always been used to having his own way he got up leaning on his cane as solazo entered the sumptuous living room of the trump tower apartment marco good to see you they embraced a glass of champagne don antonio snapped his fingers at a manservant oh by the way there are some faxes for you cant your office give you a night off sony uncle this is important may i of course sollazo went into the office found tim faxes and read them quickly he returned to the living room accepted his glass of champgne and sat opposit russo can we talk business always good solazo mid him in detail of his conversation with alam when he was finished the don said more than interesting and tim faxes they confirm the mention in tiew but in more detail naturally as usual with newspapn the accounts differ but broadly speaking they agree as to general details a truck carrying fifty million pounds in gold bullion was knocked off on a country road in the english lake dislrict a young boy told the police hed been chased away from a ferry called the lrh rose at an olddisused jetty no far from the scene of the action he also said hed seen a truck of the right description mm off the main road toward the ferry later in the day obviously the bullion track put to sea on the ferry and what happened end of story over next few days a smashedup ships boat ifebelts and so on all bearing the name irish rose were washed up on the coast of county down i see don antonio sat there frowning and salamone said that in a fever this man kelly spoke of being the only one who knew where the boat went down thats right and you said bullion of the order of fifty million pounds yes but thatwas ten years ago gold prices have greatly increased id say at least one hundred million pounds in present terms now that kind of nuhey is always interesting i was thinking sollazo sd with the right kind of salvage boat these recovery jobs are quite easy these days as long as you know where the ship is which the authorities dont so they tell me don ntonio sat there thinking about it finally he nodded i wonder who this man kelly was working for was it just business or the ira or something like that its a thought sollazo said you know a few years ago i had dealings with the ira we used to provide arms through a sicilian connection their chief of staff was a man called barryjack barry sollazo said its all peace talk with the ira these days gerry adams at the white house speaking for their sinn fein party so what the don said barry is an old foxl if anyone will know anything of this affair it will be him his private number in dublin will be in my special address book in the top righthand drawer of my desk see if you can get him in dublin jack btry was sitting by the fire bored out of his mind and reading a newspaper rain brushing the window when the phone rang bary here mr jack barry is that you an old friend i hope don antonio russo dear god barry said and what can i do for you more what can we do for each other mr barry im talking serious business here does the name irish rose mean anything to you barry swallowed hard should it what would you say if i told you that i know the whereabouts of a man who calls himself kelly but in a fever speaks of being the onl one who knowswhere the ship has gone down the only one who knows where the gold is id be more than interested fine it seems to me we might have a mutual interest here that could profit both of us my nephew marco sollazo who is also my lawyer will be with you tomorrow i look forward to meeting him don antonio put the phone down we have a good source at green rapids detention center an excellent one phone now we need a copy of kellys photo as quickly as possible then get in touch with the airport and tell them to have the gulfstream ready to go lets say midnight theyre four hours ahead in are land so youll be able to see barry late morning of course uncle and then dinner don antonio smiled suddenly i flare quite an appetite in dublin on the followlng morning it was just coming up to n n when barry answered the sound of the bell at his front door and found marco sollazo standing there mr barry and youd be mr sollazo thats right come in for a moment while i get my coat youll have to excuse the mess im on my own these days my wife died last year marco sollazo waited in the small parlour there was a sofa two easy chairs a fireplace faded family photos of children at various stages of their development itall fitted with the image of the pleasantfaced sixtyyearold man in the cardigan whom he had just met and yet this man had been for several crucial years chief of staff of the provisional ira he came in wearing a raincoat and cloth cap well take a walk in the park and then have a drink and a bite to eat at cohans bar anything you like barry took an umbrella down from a hatpeg in the hall just in case he said this is ireld remember they crossed the road to where the park waited behind green painted railings sollazo said your home is it unsafe to talk there do they have you wired for sound hell no oh they tried it back in the old days the british secret intelligence service irish intelligence dublin special branch i had my own experts who used to come round once a week and sweep the house i expect yur uncle had to take the same precautions and still does well im not chief of staff for the ira anymore he smiled a time for peace mr sollazo thats what they tell me so no more ira barry laughed out loud if you believe that youll believe anything theres another chief of staff in my place our command structure intt throughout the country and as your president and the british prime minister have found to their cost we dont intend to give up our arms yes i understand from the newspapers that the x refusal of your people to comply in the matter of arms is a main talking point when the president visits london on friday they can talk until theyre blue in the face it wont make any difference well hangon to our arms come what may you dont think this peace will last it never has before they turned through the park gates and it started to rain and barry raised the umbrella i told yot it would anyway lets get down to business ollazo took the photo his contact at green rapids had provided the previous night do you know this i certainly do barry nodded his name is michael ryan once a notorious gunman for the loyalist cause a black orangeman from belfast would it surprise you to know that hes been in prison in america of ythe past ten years barry smiled now theres a wonder he dropped out of sight in nineteen eightyfive but totally and i could never figure that out what did he do he shot a policeman while robbing a bank they gave him twentyfive years poor sod barry whistled he must be sixtyfive now i dont suppose hes got much chance of seeing the light of day not really he can apply for probation after fifteen years but hed be around seventy by then and not much chance of parole anyway he shot a policeman remember what name is he using liam kelly he has a history of heart trouble so they moved him from ossining to green rapids detention center the medical facilities are good and the general hospital in the town is exceptional hes visited regularly by his niece who is a nurse at the hospital she calls herself jean kelly ive seen her small and rather ugly in a peasant kind of way dark hair around twentyfive or six that would be kathleen ryanshe is his niece well now fancy that and after all these years the rain increased in a sudden rush and he took sollazo by the arm lets make for the shelter over there id like to hear what youve got to say about the irish rose when sollazo had finished talking baiy sat there frowning slightly finally he spoke tell me something why have you ўomilo me business sollazo told him strictly business that bullion would be worth one hundred million pounds at todays prics and youd like to get your hands on it let me be explicit my uncle feels that a joint venture would be the way to tackle this affair between ourselves and you of the ira a half hare each what could be fairer if peace fails fifty million in gold would buy you a great many arms my friend indeed it would and your uncle with his usual instinct for doing the right thing has sent you to en tirely the right place and not for the reason you i think you should explain you see i know as much as anyone about the irish rose affair as much as ryan himself but how could you i know ryan was up to something the usual whispers even a hint that it was gold go i infiltrated one of my own men into his organization a man well call martin keogh not his real name thats right one of my very best operators he actually was with ryan every step of the way and took part in the robbery he was on the irish rose when it went down tell me sollazo said tell me everything later sitting ina corner booth at cohans bar drinkillg guinness and eating ham sandwiches sollazo said i a remarkable story and this man keogh is he stillaround in a manner of speaking he left the ira some years ago and worked asa freelance or mercenary call it what you like hes worked for just about everybody in his time the old kgb the plo even the israelis and where is he now with british intelligence that seems rather surprising the brits set up a highly secret outfit to combat terrorism and handle the really dirty jobs back in nintn sventytwo since then its ben headed by a man called brigadier charles ferguson and he isnt responsible to the director of the security services hes responsible only to the prime minismr thats why its known in the trade as the prime ministers private army and the man you call keogh works for this ferguson indeed he does hes fergusons trouble shooter the old fox blackmailed him into joining him some three years ago offered to wil his slate clean no repercussions as to his ira past he needed someone like that on his team set a thief to catch a thief you get the idea i do indexed and what is this keoghs real name dillonsean dillon in his day the most feared enforcer i had they walked back through the park lazo said quite a man this dillon but hardly likely to give us any assistance we dont need him he told me everything there was to know about the whole affair and now ive told you the man reid the one who killed the man in london is he still around serving a sentence for murder hes in prison in ulster one thing this loyalist army council you men toned im right in assuming they would dearly like to get their hands on the bulliont they certainly would the loyalist side are heavily dissatisfied with the way the peace process is going they think of themselves as being sold out the militant elements envisage civil war eventually that gold would be more than useful it would help them to obtain the kind of weaponry they would need and you wouldnt like that so may l take it that you will join us on this venture not officially not at the moment let me explain people are desperate for peace here you cant trust anybody and that includes sinn fein and the ira itself if i approach the present chief of staff hed have to discuss it with members of the army council and the whole thing would leak in no time i see so what do you suggest we keep it between ourselves for the moment barry smiled wryly and dont think im after it for myself money means nothing to me but my cause does you get tl position of the irish rose out of ryan then a quiet sort of expedition is all we need to start with small boat a diver to go down and make sure its there and afterwards that would be up to you im sure you can arrange some sort of phoney marine expedition a suitable front while the real business of raising the gold goes on he grinned ive every faith in you there was a black limousine parked at the curb by the house a hardlooking man with a broken nose leaning against it he wore a dark blue chauffeurs uniform my driver and bodyguard from the look of him giovanni moil soazo took barrys hand a real pleasure i like meeting legends mr barry one so seldom gets the chance ill be in touch he got into the passenger seat and mod went round and slid behind the wheel did it go well signore he asked as he drove away very well sollazo told him to theairport giovanni we return to new york and he leaned back closed his eyes and went over everything barry had told him it was nine oclock in the evening in new york when he presented himself once again at the trump tower apartment don antonio sat there hands clasped over the silv handle of his cane and listened as sollazo told hineverything be had learned from barry when he was finished the old don nodded an amazing story so we proceed of course a very lucrative venture the essential first step is to obtain the location of the irish rose from this man ryan i agree on the other hand why should he deal with me at all when there is nothing in it for him do you think you could accomplish his release from prison i doubt ltit was a policeman he killed rememher the don nodded there are more ways than one of skinning a eat im sure you will come up with something and you do have salamone at the prison he could prove invaluable i leave this in your capable hands he smiled now a glass of wine i see the president is visiting london by the way chapter eight don antonio was right for in london the most important matter on the prime ministers agenda was his meeting due with the president of the united states at the end ofthe week it was brigadier charles fergusons sole concern h was agitated and showed it as his daimler languisid in heavy traffic sometimes i think this whole damned city has ground to a halt sure and sometimes it has sean dillon said sitting on the jump seat opposite he was a small man no more than five feet five with hair so fair that it was almost white handsome enough with a slight perpetual smile on his mouth as if mocking the world he saw about him he wore an easyfitting blue flannel suit the jacket singlebreasted and a dark blue silk polo id like to remind you that my appointment is with the prime minister dillon i can hardly be late for that hes a decent enough stick dillon said hell see you right the woman sitting next to ferguson wore a fawn armani trouser suit and black hornrimmed glasses that contrasted with her red hair she was in her late twenties and attractive enough to be worth a page or two in vogue she was in fact detective chief inspector hannah bemstein from special branch at scotland yard on loan to ferguson as his assistant youre hopeless dillon she said no respect for anyone you irish its all that rain girl dear he said dont waste your time on him ferguson told her a hopeless case the daimler wasadmitted through the security gates at the end of downing street and drew up at the door otlumber ten i shant be more than twenty minutes ferguson told them will that old bwser simon carter be there dillon asked that is no way to refer to the deputy director of security services ferguson said yes well dont forget to tell him i think his security plans for the american presidents visit stink hardly appropriate dillon try and possess yourself in patience until i return he cwssed the pavement the policeman on duty saluted the door opened and he went in the grand gentleman that he is sure and the empire is in safe hands dillon took a cigarette from his old silver case and lit it we dont have an empire any longer dillon she said is that a fact and does the government know that she shook her head hopeless dillon thats what you are and youll kill yourself if you keep on smoking those things true but then i always knew id come to a bad when ferguson was shown into the prime ministers study simon carter was already seated a small man in his early fifties with snowwhite hair he had oice been a professor of history never an agent in the field himself he was one of the faceless men who controlled britains security system he disliked ferguson had for years and resented the brigadiers privileged position a the fact that he was answerable to the prime minister only sorry im late prime minister he made no excuses and the prime minister smiled thats all right he picked up a file the security plans the deputy director and his people have planned for the presidents visit youve read this naturally im particularly anxious that his visit to the house of commons goes well on friday morning refreshments on the terrace at tenthirty no problems there prime minister carter said the one place during his whole trip which will provide no security problem at all is the house of commons he turned to the brigadier the usual arrogant look on his face dont you agree ferguson ferguson would have let it go but carters look made him angry well do you brigadier the prime minister asked seems all right on the surface of things but to be frank prime minister dillon doesnt think much of it at all he believes general security at the house of commons to be very poor indeed dillon carters eyes bulged that damned coundrel i really must protest prime minister that brigadier ferguson continues to employ a man once an ira gunman a man with a record in the general field of eurgpe an terrorism that can only be described as infamous i protest in my mm ferguson said dillon has been of considerable ervice to the crown as you well know prime minister not least to the royal family itself yes im well aware of that the prime minister frowned but this is too important for personal bickering gentlemen my decision he sat back and said to carter id like you to meet with the brigadier and dillon at the house of commons id like you to hear what he has to say carter controlled his anger with difficulty if you say so prime minister yes im afraid i do and now you must excuse me i have a cabinet meeting everyone stands in line to get into the house of commons not only tourists but constituents waiting to see members of parliament ferguson dillon and hannah bemstein waited their turn ferguson with some impatience the grand place this dillon said they tell me they have twentysix restaurants and bars and the food and drink subsidized by the taxpayer a fine job being an mp yes well at least they dont have to queue to get in the damn place ferguson told him a very large police sergeant watching the line intently saw lannah stiffened to attention and came forward chief inspector bernstein nice to see you maam here let me pass you through you wont remember me oh but i recall you verynvell sergeant hall isnt it yes maam i was first on the scene when you shot that bastard who held up the supermarket you were on your way to the american embassy your wicked past catches up dillon murmured this is a colleague mr dillon and my boss brigadier ferguson she said sergeant hall became very military let me pass you all through brigadier thats very kind sergeant my pleasure sir he led them through the barrier and saluted and they walked on toward the central lobby how fortunate you were here chief inspector ferguson told her we could have stood in that wretched queue forever humiliating isnt it dillon said they moved on through various corridors and finally went out onto the terrace overlooking the thames westminster bridge to the left and the embankment on the far side of the river a row of tall victorian lamps ran along the parapet there was quite a crowd visitors as well as mps enjoying a drink from the terrace bar dillon hailed a passing walter half a bottle of krug nonvintage and three glasses he smiled on me brigadier how generous ferguson said though remembering how you made six hundred thousand pounds out of that michael aroun affair in ninetyone dillon id say ou can afford it true brigadier true dillon leaned over the parapet and looked down at the waters of the thames flowing by he said to hannah you notice the rather synthetic carpet were standing on is green yes notice where it changes to red thats the house of lords end you see just there where the scaffolding goes down into the water i see great on tradition you brits im jewish dillon as you well know oh i do oranddad a rabbi your father a professor of surgery and you an ma from cambridge university now what could be more british at that moment carter appeared and approached them impatiently right ferguson please dont waste my time what haveyou got to say dillon ferguson said i think your security is shot full of holes dillon told carter too many people twentysix restaurants and bars scores of entrances and exits not only for mps but staff and workmen come now everyone has a security pass everyone is checked ther theres the river the river what nonsense its tidal dillon and the current is lethal never less than three knots and sometimes five is that so then im sor i should think you would be carter turned to ferguson may i go ferguson looked at dillon and the irishman smiled wearily the great conceit of yourself you have mr carter a little bet with the man brigadier ill turn up on the terrace on friday morning when the president and the prime minister are here and all quite illegal mr carter gets five hundred pounds if i fail and a fivepound note if i succeed youre on damn you carter told him and held out his hand to ferguson shake on it he started z to laugh what an amusing little chap you are dillon and he walked away do you know what youre doing dillon ferguson demanded dillon leaned over the parapet and looked at the water swirling fifteen feet b low oh yes i think so especially if the chief inspector here can come up with the right information fergusons suite of offices was on the third floor of the ministry of defence overlooking horse guards avenue and it was an hour later that dillon and hannah bemstein went into her office she sat down at her desk all right what do you want the biggest expert on the thames river now who would that be someone in customs and excise or maybe the river police ill try them both she said good ill go and make the tea while youre doing it he went into the outer office whistling and put the kettle on when it had boiled he made the tea arranged the cups and a milk jug on a tray and took it in hannah was on the phone thank you inspector she put the phone down and sat back as dillon poured the tea how domesticated that was the river police telling me who the greatest expert on the river thames is she turned to her computer and tapped the keys subject corn ing up dillon not river police not customs but a london gangster dillon started to laugh the information rolled on the screen harry salter aged sixtyfive did seven years for bank robbery in his twenties no prison time since hannah said but look athis record from criminal intelligence owns pleasure boats on the river the dark man pub at wapping and a warehouse development worth more than one million pounds the cunning one him dillon said a smuggler dillon every racket on the river cigarettes booze diamonds from holland anything not qhite dillon told her look what it says no drug connection no prostitution no strip clubs he sat back whatweve got here is an oldfashioned gangster he probabl objects to men who swear in front of women hes still a gangster dillon suspected of killing other gangsters and wheres the harm in that if they leave the civilians alone lets see his picture it rolled around and dillon studied the fleshy face intently just as i expected fair enough well he looks like bill sykes to me hannah said known associates billy salter age twentyfive his nephew the information came up on the screen again six months for assault another six months for assault twelve months for affray a hottempered lad and these two joe baxter and sam hall more of the same dillon a very unsavory bunch who might just suit my purposes except for one thing and what would that be the river police had a tipoff salter and his gang will be down river tonight at nine in one of his pleasure boats the river queen theres a dutch boat coming in called the amsterdam the river queen will be at anchor off harley dock as the amsterdam goes past one of the stewards throws a package across uncut diamonds two hundred thousand pounds and the river police waiting to pounce not at all theyll be waiting for the river queen to berth at cable wharfe by salters pub the dark man at wapping theyll pick him up there what a shame it could have been such a lovely relationship anything else i can do for you hannah bernstein demanded not really i can see youve shafted me pretty thoroughly and taken pleasure in it ill just go away and think again at eightthirty dillon was waiting on harley dock in an ancient and inconspicuous toyota van he had borrowed from the vehicle pool at the x ministry of defence he was already wearing a black diving suit the cowl up over his head occasionally a boat passed on the river and he sat behind the wheel of the toyota and watched through a pair of infrared night glasses as the river queen arrived and anchored there was movement on deck two men and two more on the upper deck wheelhouse he waited and then there was a noise of engines down river and the amsterdam appeared a mediumsized freighter with his night glasses he could actually see the man at the rail and the bundle he hurled it landed on the pleasure boats canopy the freighter moved on and dillon was already clamping a tank to his inflatable he picked up his fins moved to the edge of the dock and pulled them on then lie pulled on his mask reached for his mouthpiece and jumped he surfaced b the anchor line pulled off his inflatable and the tank thenlis fins and fastened them to the line he waited for a moment then went up handoverhand he went in through the anchor chain port and crouched on deck listening there was the sound of laughter coming from the deck cabin and he went forward stood and peered through a port hole salter was there his nephew billy baxter aad hall salter was cutting open a yellow life jacket at the table he took out the cloth bundle two hundred grand dillon unzipped his diving suit and took out the silenced walther he went to the door paused then threw it open and stepped inside god bless all here there was silence the four of them grouped around the table like some tableau harry salter and his nephew seated baxter and hall standing beer glasses in their hands salter said and whats your game then open the bundle im fucked if i will i dont think youve got the bottle to use that thing dillon fired on the instant shattering the whiskey glass on the table at salters right hand doing the same thing to the beer glass baxter was holding billy salter cried out sharply as a jagged splinter of glass cut his right cheek there was silence and so then dillon said more okay you made your point salter said what do you want the diamondsshow me tell him to get stuffed billy said a hand to his cheek where blood flowed then what salter asked him he unfastened the cloth bundle inside was a yellow oilskin pouch with a zip fastener open it dillon ordered salter did as he was told and tossed the pouch across where it fell at dillons feet he picked it up unzipped the front of his diving suit and stowed it away he half turned and took the key out of the door salter said ill find you nobody does this to harry salter and gets away with it and didnt i hear james cagney saying that in an old gangster film on the midnight movie show on television last week dillon grinned i know it doesnt look it right now but ive actually done you a good turn maybe you can do me one sometime he slipped out and closed the door hall and baxter rushed it but too late as dillon turned the key in the lock he vaulted over the stem down into the water retrieved his inflatable jack air tank and fins and pulled them on then he went under the surface and swam back to harley dock on board e river sueen in the saloon baxter stood on the table and unclipped the deck hatch above his head when it was open harry salter and hall gave him a push up a few momentslater and he was outside the saloon door and openinlg it her hows my face billy asked his uncle salter inspected it youll live its only a scratch theres sticking plaster in the medical kit in the wheelhouse so what are we going to do billy demanded find out who shopped us salter said lets face it only a limited range of people lnew about this job so the sooner i run that bastard to earth the sooner ill find our friend he turned to baxter and hall haul up the anchor and lets get out of here and back to wapping dillon had stripped his diving suit dressed in shirt jeans and his old reefer and was already making his way to wapping it was tenthirty as he drove along streets that were deserted and lined by decaying warehouses of what had once been the greatest port in the world eventually he cut through a part of the city that was considerably more busy and eventually passed the tower of london and reached wapping high street he parked the toyota at the curb and proceeded on foot to cable wharfe he had already checked out salters pub the dark man earlier it was almost eleven oclock and closing time a drink would give him an excuse to be in the area so he walked along the wharf openly and went into the saloon bar there were two old women at a marbletopped table drinking stout andthre men at the end of the bar with beer in front of them who looked as if they might be seamen but only just the barmaid was in he forties blonde hair swept back from a face that was heavily made up whats your pleasure sunsmne she asked dillon dillon smiled that special smile of his nothing but warmth and immense charm well if its only drink were talking about lets make it bushmills sorry but youll have to drink up fast she told him as she gave him the bushmills closing time and ive got to think of my license with coppers around and where would they be io the three at the end of the bar theyre no more seamen than my arse so what are they up to god knows then ill get out of it dillon swallowed his bushmills ill say goodnight to you the two old women were leaving and dillon followed them along the wharf aware of a police van parked in a courtyard to the left a police car across the road a trifle conspicuous he said softly reached wapping high street and doubled back he found what he wanted another disused warehouse carefully negotiated stairs leading to the first floor and crouched on one ofthe old loading platforms beneath a crane he hid a perfect view of the river the wharf and the dark man he took out his infrared night glasses focused them and the river queen came into view as the river queen docked all hell broke loose the police van and car that dillon had noticed earlier drove onto the wharf and at the same time two river police patrol boats moved out of the shadows where they had been waiting and pulled alongside as uniformed police came over the rail they found hall and baxter tying up salter and billy came out of the saloon and looked up at the half dozen policemen on the wharf the line parted and a tall man in his fifties in the uniform of a superintendent came forward why its superintendent brown our old friend billy salter said and how are you tony brown smiled permission to come aboard harry and he climbed down followed by the other police officers so whats all this salter demanded well harry i know there wouldnt be anything in the pub youre too smart for that and weve turned you over often enough however ive reason to believe youre carrying an illegal shipment of diamonds on this vessel to the amount of two hundred thousand pounds very silly harry to slip like that after all these years brown turned to the sergeant at his elbow read him his rights and the rest of ffou start looking diamonds on the river queen salter laughed out loud tony my old son you really have got it wrong this time it was almost one oclock in the morning when they finished salter and his crew were sitting at the table in the saloon playing gin rummy when the superintendent looked in a word harry the police had finished their fruitless task and were getting into the van the two patrol boats started up and moved away it was raining now and salter and brown stood under the canopy on deck so what gives salter asked har i dont know what happened tonight but i had what seemed like the hottest tip in my life iz well whoever your snout was i hope you didnt pay the bastard brown shook his head youre getting old harry too old to do ten years in parldaurst think about it i will tony brown clambered up onto the wharf and turned weve known each other a long time harry so ill do you a favor id be very careful in future about the dutch end of things he got in the police car beside his driver and they moved away jesus billy said we could all have gone down the steps for a long time that bastard back there when he took the stones what was it he said that hed done you a good turn thats right quite a coincidence saiter said onlyi dont believe in them anyway lets go up to the pub and get a drink dillon waited until ll was quiet then went back down the stairaof the old warehouse and walked to the pub there was a light on in the saioon and when he looked in he saw saiter sitting on a stool at the end of the bar billy sticking plaster on his face sat drinking at one of the tables with baxter and hail dillon moved on turned up the side ailey and looked in the kitchen the barmaid was drinking a cup of tea and reading a newspaper he opened the kitchen door she looked up in alarm i see the peelers have gone dillon said christ who are you old friend of harrys if hes as bright as i think he is he might even be expecting me ill go through to the bar harry salter drank his scotch and wated looking at his reflection in the old victorian mirror behind the bar a small wind touched his cheek as the door opened there was a sliding sound as the yellow oilskin bag slid along the bar and stopped in front of him there you go dillon said the other three stopped talking and salter lifted the bag in one hand then turned to look at dillon standing there at the end of the bar in his old reefer coat dillon took out a cigarette and lit it and salter a crrok from the age of fifteen knew trouble when he saw it and whats your game my old son he asked its him billy cried the fucking bastard leave off billy salter told him after what hedid look at my bleeding face billy picked up the lager bottle in front of him smashed it on the edge of the table and hurled himself at dillon the broken bottle extended dillon swayed to one side caught the wrist and hammered billys arm against the bar so that he howled with pain and dropped the bottle dillon held him facedown on the bar billys arm tight as an iron bar god mr salter but he never learns this nephew of yours dont be a silly boy billy salter said if he hadnt nicked the stones down river wed be booking in at tower bridge division police station with the prospect of going down the steps for ten years all want to know is the reason for all this he smiled at dillon youve got a name my old son dillonscan dillon salter went behind the bar and dillon released billy who stood there massaging his arm then went and sat down with baxter and hall his face sullen salter said youre no copper i can smell one of those a mile off god save us dillon aid ive had enough trouble with those bowsers to last me a lifetime lets put it this way mr salter i work for one of those government organizations that isnt supposed to exist salter tood there looking at him for a long moment then said whats your pleasure bushmills whiskeyif you dont have krug champagne salter laughed out loudi like it i really do bushmills i can manage right now krug ill supply next time he took a bottle down from the shelf and poured a generous measure so whats it about cheers dillon toasted him well the thing is i wanted to meet the greatest expert on the thames river and when i accessed the police computer it turned out to he you the trouble was that no sooner did i find you than i discovered i was going to lose you someone i work with very big at special branch found out the river police were going to stiff you very inconvenient salter said well it would have been so i decided to do something about it dillon smiled the rest you kllow salter poured himself another drink you want something from me thats it isnt it some sort of kickback your expertise mr salter your knowledge of the river what for you may have read in the papers that the president of the united states and the prime minister are to meet on the terrace at the house of commons on fiday morning so what i think the security stinks and i have to prove it so sometime after midnight on friday morning i want you to helpe float in to the terrace ill hide out in one of the storerooms behind the terrace bar and give them a nice smprise at the appropriate moment salter stared at him in amazement you must be raving bloody mad are you a lunatic or something its been suggested before salter turned to the other three did you hear that weve got a bleeding loony here he turned back to dillon but i like you not only will i do it you can call me harry terrific dillon said could i have another bushmills i i can do better much better salter opened the fridge at the back of the bar took out a bottle and turned krug champagne my old soa how does that suit you chapter nine the following day was thursday and when dffion went into hannah bemsteins office on the third floor at the ministry of defence it was just before noon my god dillon what tim do you call this hes been asking for you the hard night i had girl dear in fact i only came in to ask you to have a delicious light luncheon with me youre quite mad she pressed her intercom hes here brigadier send him in there was a pause and you chief inspector she led the way opening the door for dillon who advanced to the desk where ferguson was working at a pile of papers he didnt look up god save the good work dillon said and waited ferguson ignored him and the irishman laughed god save you kindly is the correct answer to that brigadier ferguson sat back i am well aware that as a boy you went to the royal academy of dramatic art dillon i am well aware that you actually acted with the national theatre lyngstrand in the lady from the sea ibsen that was dillon reminded him until you decided to take up the theater of the street for the ira as my mother god rest her was irish i do my bestto understand you but your constant role of the stage irishman proves wearisome god save us your honor but ill try to mend my ways for gods sake be serious youre leaving me with egg on my face because of this ridiculous bet with carteryou know how much the intelligence service hates our very existence theyd like nothing better than to make me look a fool in front of the prime minister dont i know that dillon said thats why i thought id make carter look the fool feiguson frowned are you seriously telling me you think you can of course the brigadier frowned where have you been its almost noon i had a hard night preparing the way so to speak you wouldnt want to know dillon said but one thing ill promise you the next time youll see me will be at tenthirty tomorrow morning on the terrace together with the president of the united states and the prime minister ferguson sat back

you shouldnt know ill discuss it with this goodlooking woman here if i can take her to lunch ferguson laughed in spite of himself oh go on you rogue get out of here but if it costs me five hundred pounds it comes out of your salary they returned to hannahs office she said you really think you can pull it off nothin is impossible tthe great dillon a magician that s what british ntelligence called me in the great days in ulster they never laid hands on me once hannah your lot the master of disguise did i tell you about the time i dressed as a woman i dont want to know this dillon because if i do i have to consider how many you killed fighting a war hannah that what i was doing but that was then and this is now get your coat and well away i am right about jewish people no shellfish but you can eat smoked salmon of course why good knag champagne scrambled eggs and smoked salmon the best in town but where he held her coat for her jesus girl but will you stop asking all these questions he took her to the piano bar at the dorchester the best in london with its magnificent mirrored ceiling was greeted by themanager as an old friend and led to a booth dillon ordered his usual krug champagne nonvintage and scrambled eggs smoked salmon and a salad for both of them god but you live well dillon she said thats an armani suit youre wearing and you can afford these prices im still trying to spend some of that six hundred thousand pounds i got out of michael aroun for failing to blow up the prime minister and the war cabinet at numlsisr ten during the gulf war youve no shame have you none at all why pretend it what i was and its what i am the same man hannah my love and times youve been glad of it the ehampagne came was opened and poured he toasted her to the bestlooking policeman in london that kind of flattery gets you nowhere now tell me whats going on when he was finished she gazed at him in horror you used me you used privileged police intelligence to get a notorious gangster and his men off the hook hes not such a bad old stick dillon sipped some champagne and i needed him how could you do such a thing come off it hannah ferguson does things to suit himself all the time what about that lithuanian bastard platoff the other month if ever a man deserved to be shot it was him but he was more useful to us than the other people so ferguson did a deal and as i remember you brokered it she glared at him damn you dillon sure and you look lovely when youre angry the waiter approached atthat moment with their food eat up like a good girl dillon you are a sexist pig and you are a nice jewish girl who should be having babies and making her husbands life miserable instead of shooting pele on behalf of scotland yard she laughed in spite of herself this is lovely so tell me how you intend to do it the river ill swim in but the current there can be ferocious with the tide running its suicide dillon you mustnt yes youre right thats woy the terrace is a weak spot in the security system but how can you hope to get away with it difficult but not impossible and he explained the river queen was still tied up at cable wharfe when dillon turned up in the toyota at eleven oclock that evening the pub was just closing and he sat there watching the last customers emerge and walk away toward wapping high street the barmaid stood at the door talking to billy she dosed the door and he crossed to the boat dillon got out of the toyota good man yourself billy could you be giving me a hand billy looked at him a kind of reluctant admiration on his face you know youre mad dont you i mean my uncles told me what youre up to crazy for one thing you wont even get into the terrace the currents real murder out there if i dont get back you can sell the toyota my hand on it he held it out and billy shook it instinctively mad bastard okay what have we got here and he openeitrihe rear door of the van in the saloon dillon laid out his gear watched by salter and the other three there was his heavy nylon diving suit with hood nylon socks and gloves youre going to need that bleeding lot salter told him that waters bloody cold tonight i never thought it wouldnt be dillon laid out his fins and clipped the air tank hed brought to the inflatable he checked his weight belt then opened a hang bag and took out a small halogen lamp and a waterproof purse you wont need that lamp salter said ive passed the terrace regularly in the early hours and they leave that row of victorian lamps on even if you get there dillon you could get done they must have security guards prowling one glimpse and youve had it yes well i know that dillon opened the waterproof pouch and checked the contents and whats that picldocks i need to get into one of the store rooms as i told you to spend the rest of the night salter shook his head and you know how to use those things he shook his head no dont answer that with that accent of yours are you sure youre not going to shoot the prime minister perish the thought dillon unzipped a water proof bag and checked the contents and what have you got there salter asked white shirt bow e nice white jacket black slacks and shes itlon smiled after all i am supposed to be a waiter he zipped the bag up again and billy fell about laughing dillon i like you i really do youre crazy you dont give a stuff just like me ill take that as a compliment dillon stood up and looked down at his gear thats it theng he turned im in your hands aow harry all right my old son lets go over it there was a very large scale map on the table and they all gathered round it here we go house of commons embankment opposite and theres westminster bridge now im telling you this is one of the worst times of the year a very high tide turning around three oclock in the morrdng and to float you in i need the tide on the mrn and driving down river but its an abnormal speed a good five knots maybe you should consider that i have dillon told him theres no way you can control that current by swimming its too strong but if youre hanging on the stern as i approach and i drop you at just the right moment you could have a chance fine dillon said itll do me crazy salter shook his head crazy dillon grinned found a packet of cigarettes and went out on deck standing under the canopy and looked at the rain salter joined him i love this old river he leaned against the bulkhead i was a river rat when i was a kid my old man did a runner and my mum did bits of cleaning to keep body and sl together anything i could nick i did fags booze anything and progressed from there ive never done drugs never done women thats filth as far as im concerned mind you ive always been a hard bastard ive killd in my time but only some sod who was out to kill me i see and you oh ive been at war with the world for more than twenty years with that accent does that mean what i think it does dillon said not any longer harry i do work for a rather shadowy branch of the security services lets leave it at that all fight my old son salter grinned but with what youve got ahead of you youre going to need food in your belly well all go up to wapping high street best fishandchips shop in london there just before three the river queen passed under westminster bridge and turned fighting the surging tide the deck lights were out only a subdued light in the wheelhouse dillons gear was laid out in the stem and salter stood there with him im going to take over from billy at the wheel when he comes down here hell have a twoway radio you hang off at the stem youll be okay as far as the propellers go with the design of this boat theyre well undemeat then what at what i consider the right moment ill call billy on the radio and when he gives you the shout you go if i get it right the current should bang you against the terrace if i dont god help you thanks harry dillon grinned youre a hell of a fella get stuffed you bloody lunatic salter told him and walked away dillon turned to hall and baxter who stood waiting all right lads lets get this lot on ten minutes later lqe hung on a line bp from the stem rail his two equipment bags trailing from his belt aware of billy leaning over the rail above him they were in the shadows the water very turbulent and dillon was conscious of the fierceness of the current and then billy called down to him and he let go the line he went down five or six feet and the force of the current was incredible like a great hand seizing him in a relentless grip he was thrown to the surface was aware of the river queen disappearing into the dark of the lights of the victorian lamps on the terrace and then he went under again a moment later he banged against the stonework of the terrace surfaced and cannoned into the scaffolding that dropped oown into the water at the division of the lords and commons he hung there for a long moment and then unbuckled his inflatable and air tank and let the current take them he did the same with his fins and mask paused then started to climb he went over the parapet trailing his two equipment bags and crouched in the shadows a door opened further along the terrace and a security guard appeared he walked forward stood at the parapet and lit a cigarette the smoke pungent on the damp air dillon waited for five agonizing minutes until finally the man tossed the stub of his cigarette into the river turned and went back inside dillon unfastened the lines of his equipment bags then unzipped his diving suit and stood there naked except for swimming trunks he dropped the diving suit into the river then picked up the equipment bags and went to the side of the terrace bar where there were storerooms he opened the small equipment bag took out the halogen lamp and opened the purse containing the picldocks he switched on the lamp and went to work it took him less than five minutes and the door opened he made a quick exploration there were stacks of towels and tablecloths cartons of wine glasses there were also two toilets and a washbasin in another room at the rear he opened the larger equipment bag took out the clothes it contained and a towel he had put in he dried himself thoroughly took off the swimming trunks and dressed in the waiters clothes he had brought he checked his watch it was now a quarter to four depending on what tiale the terrace staff started he had about four to five hours to kill there was a sizeable stock cupboard with various kinds of linen inside there was no key in the door so he lockedit from the inside arranged some piles of towels into a rough bed it was surprising how cheerful he felt harry will be pleased he thought and fell almost instantly asleep he came awake with a start aware of the door handle rattling he glanced at his watch and saw it was almost nine oclock he heard a voice call the bloody doors locked ill go and see if i can find a key footsteps retreated the outer door opened and closed dillon opened the door in seconds moved into one of the toilet stalls and locked it he waited and after a while the outer door opened and someone entered there were two of them because after the door was opened a man said right take those tablecloths and get cracking a woman said all right mr smith the door banged and the man started whistling and moving around after a while he moved into the next toilet stall and sat down and lit a cigarette dillon flushed the toilet and went out the mans white jacket hung on a peg by the basin a plastic identity card on the jacket dillon unpinned it and fastened it to his own jacket sothat it was half obscured by his lapel when he went outside the terrace was already a scene of activity waiters everywhere at work in the bar and making uptables dillon picked up a napkin from a table draped it over one arm and reached for a tray he went straight out past two security guards and up the steps for an hour he went walkabout visiting restaurants not only in the commons but the house of lords keeping constantly on the move his tray at the ready not once was he challenged god knows what ferguson would make of that as for carter it was just after ten that he made his way back to the terrace it was a hive of activity he went in past the security guards and paused a grayhaired man in black coat and striped trousers was ordering waiters here and there telling them what to do he didnt even give dillon a second glance when he spoke to him youcanapes from the rear table yes sir dillon said he stood against the watl with other waiters and a few moments later members of parliament started to flood in it was amazing how quickly the terrace filled up and the waiters got to work and served refreshments dillon did his bit taking a tray of canapgs around and then he caught sight of ferguson hannah bernstein and carter entering dillon turned away but stood close enough to hear carter say sorry for you ferguson that little bastards left you with egg on your face if you say so fergeson said a moment later an lmnouncement sounded over the tannoy ladies and gentlemen the prime minister and the president of the united states they came through the entrance and stood there and the crowd broke into spontaneous applause dillon crossed to the table picked up a canap dish with a lid hovered over it for a moment then turned the president and the prime minister were moving through the crowd pausing to speak to people they reached simon carter ferguson and hannah bernstein and stopped dillon heard the president say brigadier fergu son good to see you again he greeted carter then hannah dillon walked forward excuse me gentlemen he was aware of the look of amazement on hannahs face of fergusons incredulous frown and on carters face nothing but shock dillon lifted the lid of the cana dish disclosing a fivepound note nestling on top your river sir carter was incandescent with rage but the most interesting reaction was from president clinton why mr dillon is that you he said it was the middle of the afternoon and hey were together in fergusons office the three of them there was a look of unholy joy on fergusons face you cunnig irish bastard and you a half one the look on carters face delicious i had to explain to the president and the prime minister of course which didnt help carter the president thought it was fantastic i must tell you that after our previous help to him with the peace process in ireland last year he had a high opinion of you dillon its now even higher so how did you do it from the river brigadier but id rather not get into details ferguson turned to hannah bemstein do you know chief inspector im afraid i do sir as bad as that is it lets put it this way the background to it is so criminal that if i were still working for special branch at scotland yard id have no other choice but to read dillon his rights and arrest him however under the peculiar circumstances of my employment with you such considerations do not apply good god ferguson shook his head still i knew what i was taking on when i recruited you dillon only myself to blame go about your business the both of you and he opened a file in front of him ai the same time at green rapids detention center kathleen ryan and her uncle walked through the park there were as usual thanks to the wardens liberal visitation policy a large number of visitors paolo salamone walked some little distance behind he had received aphone call from sollazo as his lawyer just after brkfast it had been brief and to the point regarding the matter we discussed the other day and the individual concerned any further information would certainly help your case salamone hadnt known such excitement in a long time there was a real chance now with sollazo and the don on his side that he might get some review of his sentence and anything was worth that which was why he kept an eye out for the kelly girl he knew from talking to her uncle that she mainly worked the night shift at the hospital which was why she was able to visit three sometimes four times a week they didnt seem to be talking much and he saw them stroll toward one of the small rustic shelters beside the lake salamone hurried through a small plantation of trees behind the hut and stood at the back he could hearthem talking quite plainly you seem depressed today girl and why shouldnt i be you in here like a caged animal little i can do about that little anyone can do you know when they transferred you here i was full of hope thats why i saw that fella cassidy you shared a cell with once at ossining and got the forged passports i thought there would be a chance of making a break kathleen said not from here you know why the regime here is so liberal beca use the security is so tight every modern electronic marvel on these walls cameras scrutinizing every move im going to die here kathleen and thats the truth df it time we talked about your future time you moved on and

tuesday morning for another heart scan im on the night shift but ill go in and look out for you ill see you again tomorrow anyway ive got the time in the morning around eleven thats nice they got up and walked away and salamone went back up through the trees as they approached the security gates kathleen said are you still on the same pills no a new one he took a plastic bottle from his shirt pocket there you go she checked it dazane thats a new one on me ill check it out at the hospital she gave the bottle back to him and kissed his cheek ill be seeing you alamone phoned through to sollazos rice using one of the prisoners callboxes the sec retary was dubious mr sollazo was busy but she finally gave in to salamnes persistence and put him through what have you got sollazq asked it better be good i overheard kelly and his niece talking she talked about how shed hoped hed be able to make a break when he transferred from ossining to green rapids some chance nobodys crashed out of here since it opened so why should this interest me she was talking about false passports shed got from some forger called cassidy who used to share a cell with kelly at ossining now that is interesting soilazo said any thing else z not really oh yes hes going to green rapids general hospital on tuesday morning to have a heart scan as i said he suffers from angina by the way she said she was going to see him again in the morning at eleven youve done well paolo keep up the good work just one thing i didnt tell you liam kelly is actually michael ryan once a big activist in irish politics on the protestant side and never take him for granted hes killed more men than he can remember jesus salamone said his niece is kathleen ryan she too has killed in her time these arent ordinary crooks paolo they are revolutionaries and as we know such people are like ild dogs a little touched in the head never take them for granted i wont mr sollazo and youll do what you can for me that goes without saying sollazo put down the phone sat there thinking about it then buzzed his secretary find mori for me he should be somewhere about he went back to the legal brief in front of him smiling slightly as he saw the fatal flaw in the district attorneys case there was a knock at the door and mori entered yes signore he said in sicilian sollazo sat back ive heard from salamone more information on ryan and his niece it seems she got false passports from a forger called cassidy who shared a cell with ryan in singsing find him and bring him to me somebody will know him no problem mori told him ill make a few calls and he went out it was only one and a half hours iater that he parked his limousine outside the small photo and print shop on a bronx side street and entered a black youth was attending a machine that churned out holiday snaps he paused and came to the counter yes sir mr cassidy tell him hes wanted hes in the back ill get him no need kid ill handle it myself mori went behind the counter and opened the door cassidy a small balding man with wire spectacles was working on what to mori looked like a share certificate mori said up to your old tricks cassidy who knew trouble when he saw it stood up what is this he blustere i represent the russo family and don antonios nephew andlawyer mr marco sollazo would appreciate your help in a small matter cassidy went very pale and removed his spectacles with a shaking hand anything can do i thought youd feel like that you do a nice line in false passports and i take it youre the careful kind of guy who keeps records am i right cassidy licked his lips nervously thats right who are we talking about a guy you shared a cell with at ossining liam kelly his niece came to see you some time ago sure cassidy said ive got all the details then stick them in a file and lets go mr sollazo doesnt like to be kept waiting irish passports you say sollazo said to cassidy who stood before his desk sure mr sazo in the names ofdaniel and nancy forbes there was no problem getting a current photo of kelly they have one of those photo machines at the prison theyre always needing pictures for various security tags the cons use up there when was this eighteen months ago theyre current passports of the ffaropean community variety with brown covers kellys supposed to be an artist i thought that was good because he paints in his cell and the girl nurse which is what she is i know sollazo said and this was firstclass work oh sure entry and exit stamps for everywhere from hong kong to the uk i even gave them visas for egypt good work i swear on my life mr sol l azo im sure youre telling the truth sollazo turned to moil if he proves false giovanni you have my permission to break both his legs and arms a pleasure mori didnt even smile cassidy was sweating please mr sollazo im an honest guy sollazo burst out laughing get out of here mori saw him through the door then returned anything else signore yes i want you to go and see salamone it seems ryan is being taken to green rapids general hospital on tuesday morning for a heart scan find out all you can how the system works when they take one of the inmates for that kind of check does the signore mean what i think he means perhaps afterwards check out the hospital i dont need to tell you to be discreet you always thank you signore mori said face impassive and went out and sollazo went back to work salamone wis desperately afraid of mori but then most people were for he was the russo familys most feared enforcer so he received him with some trepidation they walked over the grass toward the lake and mod told him why hehad come salamone eager to please was more than helpful they use a special security ambulance to take guys down to the hospital ive gone myself when theyve had a stretcher case needing a nurse how many guards the driver and a guy riding shotgun beside him usually another two in the back with tl cons it depends how many but i can tell you tuesday morning is light just kelly or ryan or whatever they call him and a guy called bryant whos going to have a keyhole op on his prostate ive seen the schedule fine mori said so where would they take ryan third floor theres a clinic there called general heart surgery so a guard takes him up there or two maybe usually one i mean the guy has a heart condition hes handcuffed of course at all times not while hes having treatment good mori said thats all i need to know you know the old saying from sicily keep the tongue in the mouth or it gets cut out jesus giovanni paolo sounded shocked mean i love my don sure you do mori patted his face and walked away the hospital cap park was full but someone pulled out as mfi arrived so mori took the space which he noted was reserved for the chief of surgery he went in through thenain entrance it was very modem lots of tiling and high technology staff everywhere nurses in uniform doctors in white coats and many people who were presumably visitors he strode confidently through the concourse and took a lift to the fourth floor quite deliberately the corridor he stepped out into was very quiet a door opposite said storeroom then there was an elevator with very wide doors obviously designed to carry stretchers and trolleys next to it a door said staff io rest room mori opened it without hesitation and went in there were washbasins and toilet cubicles and a row of pegs some of them occupied by overalls and white coats one of which had a plastic security card pinned to it in the name of a doctor lynn radiology mori put it on and went out he took the elevator down to the third floor exited and strolled confidently along looking for the clinic salamone had described and there it was general heart surgery he opened the swing door and went in there were two or three patients on the benches a young black nurse at reception she looked up and smiled and mori put his hands in his pockets so that the white coat patted just in case she knew the name on the identity card can i help you doctor im new im afraid radiology ive got to see a patient up here on tuesday morningn inmate from green rapids detention center i was just checking you know getting my bearings a heart patient oh sure mr kelly hes been here on several occasions yes youre in the right place clinic three right down the hall thats where hes treated well thank you mori told her and went down the hall he glanced through the round window in the door of clinic three saw a patient on a trolley a nurse bending over him he passed on to a door marked fire exit opened it and found himself in a quiet corridor the doors opposite were marked freight elevator he called it up and when it arrived punched the basement button when he stepped out he found doors standing wide to an underground car park walked through and found himself in the car park where he had left his limougine he stood there smiling then went and opened the drivers door took off the white coat and threw it in the back then he got behind the wheel when kathleen ryan eniered the pharmacology department of the hospital the young doctor on duty was indian a doctor sieed she wore a sari she knew kathleen and liked her what can i do for you nurse ely uncle is an angina patient i was just talking to him and he told me he was on new pills something im not familiar with dazane doctor sieed nodded a recent addition it has an excellent recorbut the dosage is critical one three times a day yes i noticed that overdose can be a problem three at the same time would actually promote a severe angina attack of a critical nature probably not but it would give the patient a bad shock for a couple of days tell him to he careful thank you kathleen went along to the staff room got her coat and shoulder bag and left by the main entrance as she walked across the car park giovanni mori drove past her in the limousine and turned into the main road chapter ten the don was in an expansive mood when sollazo wefit to see him you look pleased with yourself marco i think i have a solution good but family business first anything for me to sign a couple of property deeds a transfer i have them here sollazo opened his briefcase and took out various papers lets get on with it he produced a pen and did what was necessary good now a couple of my very special vodka martinis the best in the world of course russo went behind the bar and mixed the drinks and sollazo sat on a bar stool the martini was excellent and he savored it with pleasure i the old man toasted him the ryan business tell which sollazo did in finest detail when he was finished the don said you really think mori could manage this on his own absolutely and so simple no one else involved it would require ryans cooperation but of course and hell want his niece with him naturally so how will you persuade him to quote your favorite film ill make him an offer he cant refuse the id man nodded there must he no link between you and ryan no link with the family in the event of success we dont want the police tying us in no problem there when i go to green rapids its to see salamone all perfectly legitimate but the regime there is so ridiculously liberal prisoners walking round the park area with their families or ator heys that its possible to talk to anyone salamone tells me the girl visits her uncle again tomorrow at eleven ill see him then and take the opportunity of speaking to ryan the don sipped his martini thoughtfully tell me salamones expectations of some sort of movement as regards reducing his sentence have you any hopes there none at all but i try to keep his hopes up for x other reasons he knows a great deal about family business too much there is an old sicilian saying better to lop the branch than lose the tree the don nodded gravely and there would be the point that he is the only link between us and this ryan affair hes entirely disposable sollazo said calmly so he has an accident one day we have friends in there happy to oblige good ill let you get on with it then it was a fine bright morning just before eleven when sollazo strolled through the park with salamone youve done well for us the lawyer said the don is pleased great salamone nodded eagerly and hows my case going im working on it paolo these thhags take time at that moment he satm michaelyan and kathleen move down toward the lake and sit down in one of the rustic shelters kathleen was saying dazane that new heart pill youre on you have to be careful to stick to the right dosage sure and i know that one three time a day i checked with doctor sieed if you took three at the same time it would actually promote an angina attack and that would be curtains lets say you wouldnt feel too good for a while at that moment marco sollazo appeared before them elegant in his dark suit and long armani raincoat good morning mr ryan he smiled at kathleen miss ryan ryan went very still youve got the wrong names mister you must have made a mistake i dont think so kathleen said leave off uncle michael she looked at ollazo grimly whats it aboutto start with know all about you michael and kathleen ryan still wanted in ulster for a number of terrorist activities on behalf of the loyalist cause i suppose the british could apply for your extradition if they knew where you were miss ryan damnyou she said what is it you want the gold bullion that went down ten years ago on the irish rose off the coast of county down and please dont say you dont know what im talking about they both sat there staring at him finally ryan said you seem to know a great deal i know everything right then ryan told him then you must know that the irish rose sank in the darkness with a bad sea running we were off course i dont know where it went down yes you do you had a gadget called a master navigator in your pocket a sort of mini computer that perfectly calculated your course and position ryan for once looked amazed but how could you know such a thing only myself knew that and kathleen when i told her someone was standing behind a tree listening when you told her a man you knew as martin keogh it was kathleen who spoke now her face solemn you speak as if he was someone else oh he was mr ryan did you ever meet the ira chief of staff at that time jack barry not facetoface he knew your original plan had been turned down by your army council heard a whisper that you intended to go ahead privately so he ordered his best mah to infiltrate you kathleens face was very pale who was he a man called sean dillon youve heard of him oh yes ryan noddeda legend the man of a thousand faces they used to say he was once an actor foiled the army the ruc for a year he shook his head never got lifted once so he was martin the bastard kathleen said he could have killed you on the road that morning and taken the master navigattr barry was annoyed with him for not doing so he told barry he liked you he smiled at the girl and you fuck him there were hot tears in her eyes i hope he rots in hell actually hes working for a highly secret branch of british intelligence these days god save us ryan laughed out loud and wouldnt that be the martin we knew and loved i know who you are now ryan said youre the mafiaattorney who looks after paolo salamone you work for the russo family does that matter look to business i know everything right down to the fact that you miss ryan are in possession of false irish passports in the names of daniel and nancy forbes i know that youre a nurse at green rapids general hospital you know a lot mister but where is this leading to me arranging the escape of your uncle from the hospital when he goes for his heart scan on tuesday morning there was a total silence and a kind of awe on ryans face dear ood and you actually mean it certainly just a minute kathleen put in and her face was hard what would he have to do in exchange for that disclose the position of the irish rose sollazo said calmly weve done a deal with jack barry i saw him the other day in dublin hes no longer chief of staff but hes willing to cooperate on behalf of his movement a preliminary survey to locate the ship first then my organization willlay on some suitable salvage operation as a front x youre working with the fucking ira katheen said yes on a fiftyfifty basis and they get the fruits of my uncles labors whats in it for him i could say one million pounds but lets be fair ill make it two million jesus son youve got your nerve ryan said you do have an alternative sollazo told him you could sit here for another fifteen years ryans face was pale but to work with barry and the bloody ira kathleen put a hand on his arm weve got to be practical she turned to sollazo im included of course once hes out you join in youll be taken to a safe retreat to start with and leaving the country will be no problem absolutely not well fly to ireland probably in a gulfstream ill be with you so thats it no id like the location of the irish rose the beatings indicated on that master navigator dont tell me the figures arent burned into your brain kathleen put a hand on her uncles arm oh no mister you get that when were safe out of here and in ireland and not before sollazo smiled of course miss ryan i accept your terms now let me explain exactly what i expect to happen t it was raining when the prison ambulance turned into the car park on tuesday morning and pulled into a special parking spot close to the main entrance kathleen ryan sat in her own car watching and saw her uncle and another man get out of the ambulance each handcuffed to a guard another guard and the driver got out and lit cigarettes as the prisoners were led inside she got out of the car picked up the suitcase and walked round to the underground car park doing exactly as she had been told seeking a green panel track that carried the sign henley laundry she found it easily enough giovanni mori sitting behind the wheel smoking a cigarette im kathleen ryan youre mofi thats fight he got out reached back inside and produced the white doctors coat hed stolen as he pulled it on he said so theyve gone up just now sit in the passenger seat i wont be long he reached inside the truck took out another white coat and draped it across his arm youve never met my uncle ive seen his picture he said calmly went to the freight elevator and punched the button for the third floor he paused in the corridor then opened the fire door and entered the hallway of the general heart surgery department he glanced through the round window of the door marked clinic three ryan was lying on a table and a young doctor was busy attaching various wires to him mori walked down the hall and looked through the window of the swing door leading to the reception area there was a duty nurse behind the desk a couple of patients and the uniformed prison guard sitting on the benches reading magazines mori went back to clinic three opened the door and went in the young doctor looked up continuing to fasten the wires hello doctor what can i do for you the leather sap mori took from his pocket was filled with leadshot it swung once and the doctor went down with a groan ryan was already swinging his legs to the floor pulling the wires and connectors from his body mori threw the white coat to him put it on he opened the door leading into the toilet and shower room and hauled the doctor inside closed the door and turned i out we go turn left and throughthe fire door a moment later they were descending in the freight elevator they emerged into the underground car park and crossed to the laundry truck kathleen watching her face pale with excitement mori opened the rear door in you get youll find what clothes you need in there get out of the prison uniform and make it fast we havent got long he took off his white coat tossed it into a nearby trashcan got behind the wheel and drove away passing the prison ambulance at the main entrance the zoi two guards lounging beside it and tumod out into the highway by unfortunate chance it was a good fifteen minutes before a nurse went into clinic three and was surprised to find it unoccupied she went down to reception and spoke to the duty nurse there what happened to doctor jessup and the patient they should still be there treatment takes an hour well they arent ill come and see the prison guard was still reading his magazine when te door swung violently and the two nurses having found the doctors unconscious body in the toilet rushed in at that precise moment the laundry van turned into the crowded car park of a lage supermarket fifteen miles dow the highway and mori pulled in beside a dark sedan this is where we change le told kathleen went round io the rear and opened the door out you get ryan clambered out wearing a brown tweed suit and a raincoat kathleen kissed him impulsively you made it uncle michael mori unlocked the sedan in you get ryan and his niece got in the rear mori slid behind the wheel and put on a chauffeurs cap that perfectly matched his navy blue suit then drove away ryan said where are we going they must have put the alarm out by now tberell be cops everywhere long island but thats a hell of a way from here kathleen said theyll have roadblocks on the highway and at the toll bridges none of which will do them the slightest good trust me and just sit tight about ten minutes later there was the sound of sirens and three patrol cars passed on the other lane of the highway ryan said christ we could be in trouble here mori shrugged keep the faith were nearly a few moments later he took a slip road and then a left turn a signpost said jackson aero club and they came to it a few minutes later there was a car park with a few vehicles a singlerey administration block two hangars and an airstrip and twenty or so single and twinengined airplanes parked there was also a swallow helicopter standing on the edge of the airstrip mori parked the sedan this is it he said and got out he reached for kathleens suitcase ill take that come on lets get moving the pilot a hardlooking young man in black sunglasses started the engine as they approached mori opened the rear door go on in you get lets move it ryan and kathleen scrambled in and mori followed he closed and locked the door then belted up turned to ryan and smiled for the first time long island next stop see what i mean easy when you know how they landed at westhampton airport on long island a limousine witha driver drove straight out to the helicopter to pick them up as they drove away kathleen said do i get time to catch my breath where to now the russo residence at quogue don antonio wants to meet you mori told her does he she said belligerently and he always gets what he wants does he absolutely mori turned and smiled for the second time id remember that if i were you sweetness the word of the escapepread like lightning at green rapids detention center salamone on duty in the prison hospital received the word from a man on laundry detail called chomsky he paused as he was pushing a trolley full of soiled linen out of the ward hey paolo you heard the good word that guy kelly the irish guy what about him escaped when he was down at the general hospital for treatment i got it from grimes up in the wardens office all hell broken out its this joints first escape well all i can say is i wish him luck paolo said he thought about it for the next hail hour until his meal

good didnt we i did good only what i expected so i can look for some sugar you promised youd get me out ive made my bones on this one ive earned it i mean you wouldnt let me down there was urgency in

about it then picked up the phone and dialed a number it was picked up instantly sollazo didnt need to identify himself in the matter of salamone we need a solution get in touch with your man at green rapids and tell him you want a result and i do mean now consider it done sollazo put down the phone got his raincoat and briefcase and left go the great sitting room in russos magnificent house at quogue seemed to stretch to infinity glass sliding doors opening onto a kind of boardwalk platform above the water in the dim light of early evening ryan and kathleen sat at a table by the rail i cant believe this she said i know i keep thinkingill wake up and find its morning and im in my cell sollazo stepped out from the sitting room ah there you are allow me to introduce my uncle don antonio russo the don walked out behind him leaning on his cane a cigar in his mouth he extended a hand mr ryan a pleasure and miss ryan he turned to sol lazo a celebration is in order i think taken care of uncle mori came in with a bottle of champagne in a bucket and glasses on a tray ah the hero of theflour you did well giovanni mori managed to look modegt he opened the champagne and charged the glasses the don said go and get another glass we wont drink without you mori did as he was told when he returned and filled his own glass the don said a toast to you mr ryan and your return to the land of the living and to our joint enterprise the irish rose at green rapids salamone was just finishing his nursing shift at the prison hospital he went into the mens room to wash his face and hands and one of the porters followed him in when he looked up he saw it was chomsky who leaned against the wall and lit a cigarette you heard anything else on ryant not a word salamone said boy but the joint isreally humming salamone dried his hands andmoved out and chomsky followed what worries me is that they could kill some of our privileges know what i mean i sure do they reached the end of the hallway there was a mirror flowers on a stand in front of it at the side of the elevator salamone pushed the button for the ground floor and then saw chomskys face in the mirror and knew he was in trouble the elevator doors opened and there was no elevator only the shaft and he slewed to one side as the other man rushed him arms stiff and went in headfirst there was a strangled cry and then a thud as he landed six oors down salamone didnt hesitate he went lttraight to the fire exit at the end of the hall opened it and went down the stairs two ata time he didnt go to the ground floor there would already be a fuss there so he stopped on the second and went to the nurses rest room got himgelf some very black coffee and sat there sucking on a cigarette he was in deep shit he knew that and there was only one direction it could be coming from the only one that made sense chomsky had worked for the family on too many occasions for there to be any other explanation there was one other disturbing fact to consider it wouldnt be left here there were other guys like chomsky only too willing to do the russo family a favor ive got to get out of here he said aloud but where i mean what in the hell do i do he got up and paced up and down pausing suddenly an intent look on his face johnsonblake johnson christ if anyone can do anything he could ten minutes later he was ushered into deputy warden cooks office cook sitting behind his desk looked up what is it paolo you told my secretary life or death mr cook i got a dynamite story i want to see an fbi aent called blake johnson you do do you just like that listen mr cook if i stay here im dead you want that cook frowned and he sat back that bad he nodded slower and that important ivs big okay it could even give you a few answers on kelly and how he busted out cook was immediately on the alert you know something only for blake johnson all right wait outside ill check with the fbi it was perhaps half an hour later that he opened his door and called salamone in mr johnson is no longer with the fbi he works with some presidential security unit in washington im going to phone him now and ill let you talk to him thats fine by me blake johnson was fortysix a tall handsome man who wore a suit well his hair was so black that it took ten years off his age a marine in vietnam at nineteen hed emerged with two purple hearts a vietnamese cross of valour and a silver star a law degree had followed at georgia state on the marines afterwards the fbi and with such resounding success that he had been appointed to his present position for a year he had headed what was known at the white house as the basement the presidents private hit squad as some termed it totally separate from the cia or the fbi responsible to the president alono when the phone rang in his office he found cook on the line the deputy warden explained the problem and ended by saying you do know this man oh sure johnson said i lt him away for bank robbery once ill talk to himive him privacy he might find it difficult if he thinks anyone else is listening ten minutes later after speaking to salamone johnson was talking to the deputy warden again first of all to establish my crxlentials i work directly for the president im in charge of his special security and intelligence unit i see cook said suitably impressed i can assure you that what salamone had to tell go me is way beyond any normal criminal matter its no exaggeration to tell you that grave matters of national security are involve good god cook said this is what you do you place salamone in a secure cell under guard i take it you have a helicopter landing pad there of course good ill have a helicopter down to you within a couple of hours the federal marshal who takes him in charge will have a presidential warrant for him that clears you one thing we had a prisoner called kelly escape today cook said while he was undergoing treatment at th local hospital salamone indicated that he might know something about that johnson who had told salamne to keep his mouth shut lied smoothly hell no he was worried you wouldnt get in touch with me so he said what he did to get you interested the bastard cook said his kind usually are but hes of crucial importance to us the president will be more than grateful for your assistance in this matter im only too happy to oblige that goes without saying my thanks on his behall in his office in the white house basement johnson sat back and thought about it then he pressed an oldfashioned buzzer the door opened alio most instantly and a grayhaired woman of fifty alice quarmby his secretary entered a pad in her hand mr johnson make outa general warrant in the name of paolo salamone hes a prisoner at green rapids detention center get it over to the federal marshals office i want him picked up by helicopter as soon as possible they can bring him back to washington and hold him at the hurley street secure unit anything else better start waiting get on that computer and dig up everything there is on an irish terrorist protestant variety called michael ryan also his niece a kathleen ryan couple that with any information about a gold bullion heist in the english lake district in the autumn of nineteen eightyfive she was writing busily sounds intriguing it gets even better check out any information on a ship called the irish rose that sankoff the coast of county down in ulster at the une time he grinned thats it naturally i expect all this yesterday i take your point she went out and johnson sat there going over all of it in his mind his office had direct access to both fbi and cia computers and had friendly links with the british there would surely be some eally solid information on this he needed that before speaking to the president he opened a silver box on his desk sighed and took out a cigarette put it in his mouth and reached for a lighter hed actually stopped a year before and yet whenever his gut feeling told him he was on to something he reached for a smoke ah well just one wouldnt do any harm at the house at quogue they enjoyed an excellent dinner at six oclock roast duck potatoes green salad all washed down with more champagne i havent eaten like this in years ryan said i shouldnt imagine you have the don told him dryly but the best is yet to come he rang a little silver bell and the maid appeared with a chafing dish cannolo sicilys favorite sweet very simple flour eggs cream marveious kathleen said as the maid served them enjoy them later over the coffee we talk business darkness was falling as they sat cn the boardwalk and the maid served offee when she was finished he waved her away what happens now kathleen asked marco will take you to a small beach cottage not far from here youll be safe there mori will keep an eye on you and then macarthur airport is not far away i keep a gulfstream there youll fly to dublin with my nephew and moil he smiled unless the circumstances change there was a certain menace to that smile and kathleen shivered ryan said what are we getting at here your niece told my nephew that he could only have the position of the irish rose the bearings and so forth when you are safe in ireland thats right i require them now an act of faith if you like he smiled again kathleen shook her head and said stubbornly oh no mister you wait until were in ireland then that too must wait he said at least for you signorina he turned to ryan you go she stays here and takes her chances ryan exploded you cant do that i can do anything my friend i learned from my father many years ago to always look for a mans weakness yours is your niece mr ryan he stood up think about it come marco giye them time when they had gone kathleen sai the bastards id like to shoot the lot of them well you cant and we dont have a choice weve got to get out of america as soon as possible i couldnt face going back inside but i also couldnt face leaving you here so youll do it what if they dump us what if you give him the position and that bugger mori shoots us i dont think so im too useful to them for a number of reasons and if they intend to shoot us at some stage they can just as easily do it in ireland zl he smiled bleakly no ill give him what he wants then give him a false position she said youre not thinking straight at some point in time well be in a boat with these bowsers and a diver going down and if the irish rose isnt there then that bastard mori will give us a bullet in the head and over the side ryan shook his head no we must get out of here and safely to ireland you see theres another reason the truth is i havent been strictly honest with you she gazed at him searchingly tell me so he did afterwrds she sat there holding his hand all these years and you never told me i always did say i never trusted anyone in my life not even you well you do now and youre right we must get to ireland oncewere there well think of something she raised her voicedon antnio he appeared with sollazo youve thought it over yes and w agree excellent sollazo took his diary from his breast pocket and a pen don antonio russo smiled i knew you were a practical young woman signorina the moment i clapped eyes on you chapter eleven in the oval office the president sat and listened as blake johnson told him the worst ive seen the man salamone at the hurley street secure unit since he got in mad ive grilled him thoroughly everything he knows hes told me youve read the file i sent up with all the rvant facts as to ryans background as you can see british intelligence had a report on ryans involvement with the track heist it came from the protestant terrorist reid when he was arrested for murdering two soldiers and was trying to do a deal he speaks of ryan and his niece being responsible and a man named martin keogh he it seems was a total mysteryno details available a wild one this ryan the president said and this young woman he shook his head i sometimes despair of human beings he straightened so where are we what happens with these russo people in my opinion well get nowhere in that direction marco sollazo is one of the most celebrated attorneys in manhattan if approached on this matter he would express shock and dismay disavow any suggestion that he even knew ryan the new liberality of institutions like green rapids the way visitors and prisoners are allowed to wander facilitated sollazos ability to contact ryan but its also a situation in which he would be able to deny all contact yes he was at green rapids but only to see salamone and in salamone we have only the word of a convicted felon a bank robber who murdered a policewoman he shok his head the district attorney wouldnt waste five minutes on it and don antonio russo besides his nephew the finest legal brains in new york are on is payroll hes never spent a day in a cell in his entire life but do you believe salamone im afraid so so what do you think is happening i think sollazo and his uncle took ryan to get their hands on the bullion theyll do some sort of a deal obviously lets say fiftyfifty remember that bullion is worth one hundred and fifty million dollars now and ryan is a fanatic totally dedicated to the protestant cause such a vast sum of money devoted to arms for that cause the president shook his head peace right out of the window it is a prospect too bitter to contemplate all my work and the work of mr john major to go for nothing exactly mr president so it seems to me that putting don antonio russo or his nephew in a cell is of secondary significance the only important thing would be to prevent that gold or part of it from falling into loyalist hands quite frankly it would enable them to tool up for a civil war no we cant have that whats your best guess as to the next step theyll take ryan and the girl to ireland then theyll try to locate the ship probably a relatively simple operation at first a boat a diver once located some sort of salvage operation i want thi stopped at all costs the president frowned and then suddenly smiled i think this could be a job for dillon dillon mr president you remember what happenehen i met prime minister john major on the terrace at the house of commons the other week the bogus waiter sean dillon originally the most feared enforcer the ira had now troubleshooter for brigadier charles ferguson your british counterpart blake of course mr president fine so to start with get me the prime minister on the secure line in his study at number ten downing street john major listened when the president had finished he said i totally agree mr president we cant allow this to happen ill empower brigadier ferguson to intervene at once and im sure dlon will play his usual part leave it with me he put the phone down sat there thinking about it then lifted the phone again and spoke to his aide brigadier charles ferguson i want him here at the earliest moment he sat back frowning ireland goddanmit it never went away in spite of everything hed done even to the extent of putting his political career on the line charles ferguson sat quietly a grave expression on his face as the prime minister gave him the fats on the matter when he was finished he said i want this stopped brigadier theres no way i want to see such huge funds going to either of the two sides in ireland weve had enough bloodshed we cant afford a civil war i couldnt agree more prime minister i want dillon on this brigadier john major said all fight i do not approve of his ira and terrorist background which is why i distance myself but there is no doubt of the mans extraordinary capabilities he saved the royal family considerable anxiety over the windsor affair the other year all that nonsense over the nazis then the attack on the peace process by the terrorist group janua he saved the life of senator patrick keogh when he had the courage to address sinn fein and the ira in ireland and beg for peace no i know that dillon is a totally ruthless man but hes what we need for this business i agree prime minister john major looked up at him as ferguson stood they call your people the prime ministers private army so it gives you extraordinary powers use them brigadier use them when hannah bernstein and sean dillon were summoned to fergusons office they found him standing by the window he turned very serious absolutely top priority everything else stops i have direct orders from the prime minister to expedite a current problem to the utmost there is a file there on my desk marked irish rose take it to your office chief inspector read it the both of you then come back hannah bernstein worked her way through the file reading the old news clippgs the details of ryans activities then salamones account of what had happened at green rapids dillon leaned over her shoulder and read it too she said all right we have a very nasty prod activist michael ryan and his vicious little niece kathleen what do we know the gold bullion heist in the lake district the irish rose seen according to the police by a young boy and his dog out fishing at marsh end so we presume the truck went on boardpresume next fact lifebelts and bits from the irish rose wash up on the down coast then we have salamone for ryanread kelly who robs a bank in new york state kills a copper and gets twentyfive years in the sweat of his fever he discloses that hes the only one who knows where the irish rose is the rest we know so ryan and the girl are on the loose aided by the russo family so what we know nothing dillon except that logically all roads lead to ireland girl dear and theres more ive a terrible confession to make lets go in and see the man and ill tell you both at the same time ferguson sat behind the desk hannah bernsteiffacing him dillon lounged by the window hands in his pockets well what do you think ferguson said putting all things together including informers tittletattle and rumors plus information from the swine reid back in nineteen eightyfive one hell of a slick job was pulled by michael ran his niece kathleen and some mystery man called martin keogh that is confirmed in an obscure royal ulster constabulary report of a raid they made on ryans pub in belfast the orange drum some wretched onearmed barman named ivor somebody remembers the girl being saved from gang rape by some catholic youths saved by this keogh this was only a day or two before he saw them for the last time he said they left together in a taxi for the airport and he understood they were going to london zzo thats right brigadier hannah said reid mentioned their contact a protestant organizer called hugh bell who ran a pub in kilburn called the william and mary killed in a road accident was he bollocks too convenient that dillon said he was seen off by reid and his minder a bastard called scully they both stared at him but that isnt in the file how would you know because i was martin keogh dillon said and turned to ferguson fll just help myself to your whiskey brigadier and then ill reveal all ferguson said dear god dillon you never cease to amaze me i had a pat brigadier you knew that when you took me on yes a past is one way of describing it an ira activist for something like twenty years british paratroopers killed my ather brigadier i was trying to make someone pay when youre nineteen you look at things that way and the plo was that for political belief or money a man has to earn a living brigadier dillon smiled id remind you i worked for the israelis but now you work here hannah said dont you feel any duty of disclosure as to your past activities if that means selling out old friends in the ira no i was jack barrys right hand for years then lets say i got disenchanted with the glorious cause and left and dont forget how i came to be here it was either a serb firing squad or an agreement to work for his highness here and dont kid yourself he was willing to leave me to the firing squad dont lets be hypocriticalthe pot calling the kettle black he shrugged how clean are your hands girl dear after working for this office and that hurt damn you dillon ferguson said cut it out youve got work to do go through this thing with a fine tooth comb everything access all intelligence information computers notonly mi and but scotland yard the ruc in ulster and the garda in dublin i want a result so get on with it they went out to hannahs office dillon said still friends she glared at him then suddenly smiled grudgingly ive said it befe youre an absolute bastard dillon but i like you standing in his shirtsleeves with a cup of tea in the computer room dillon watched as hannah scanned the screen then sat back with an angry sigh not a thing on the ruc computer from ulster only ryans previous history and that stops ten years ago well it would wouldnt it hes been in the nick since then nothing special when i tried scotland yard intelligence records and nothing with carters bunch dillon said my eyes are falling out from looking at that damn screen she told him im going to take a break and make some coffee how about you ill make a start on garda intelligence from dublin as she got up he frowned and shook his head ive gone over it again and again the track heist the farm at follys end marsh end the voyage and then the sinking and that early morning in county down michael and kathleen taking the road to dmmdonald and me turning for scotstown what is it she asked im missing something ive gone through my own merfiories and reread all the newspaper clippings and theres something im missing that happens sometimes not to the great dillom he sat at the computer andshe paused in the doorway you could have killed ryan on the road that morning and taken that master navigator you would have had the position of the ship to give barry i know he grinned arent i the complicated onet she went out and he started to tap into garda files at that precise moment the gulfstream was halfway across the atlantic sollazo was up front and appeared to be sleeping mori was on the other side of the aisle from him ryan and kathleen sat on either side of the aisle at the back hed discovered the small bar and had poured himself a large whiskey dublins fair city next stop old ireland he shook his head a long time to be away and its all changed so they tell me nothing but talk of peace bloody nonsense she said put sinn fein in the saddle and theyll drive every protestant in the land into the sea it will be worse than bosnia the fierce one you are and good reason to be as no one knows better than you he reached over and patted her hand just one thing well have to box clever in dublin so hold yofir tongue and dont vex jack barry when you meet him just bide your time till we see a chance to run for it he reached to the bar and got another whiskey miniature money thats what we need well in that respect ive not been honest with you ive saved for years always putting money on one side against that mhd hope that you would break free so i cleared my account jesus girl how much fifty thousand give or take a dollar she picked up her shoulder bag theres a false bottom in here its in there half hundreddollar bills the rest five hundreds his face was pale with excitement god but this is great he sat there thinking about it money buys everything in this life in the old days when i was on army council jobs i used to use that fella zz tony mcguire and his air taxi firm and that was in down just outside ladytown it was the quick way to england if i wanted to avoid security at aldergrove would he still be in business i dont see why not if not him someone else it would be a good way out if we did manage to make a run for it and the hounds hot on our heels what about approaching the army council in belfast i dont know its been ten years kathleen ten long years and everyone strong for peace so they tell me i wonder where it leaves people like reid and scully long gone now with any luck she said so bow do we slip the leash ive had a thought sheooked troubled but im not sure you should risk it christ girl ill try anything tell me when she had finished he sat there thinking about it clever ill say that and maybe it wont be necessary maybe therell be another way who knows he grinned what the hell i think ill have another whiskey it was perhaps three hours later that dillon sitting at the computer screen shouted bingo give the man a cigar hannah rushed in what on earth is it zz the gieat dillon does it again worked my way through all the information the garda have on loyalists and drew a blank not a word on the irish rose beyond the facts we had before i opened my big mouth so then i tried the sinn fein and provo connection he laughed then i thought why not go back to the dinosaurs the hard men from the old days and that brought me tojack barry once chief of staff now retired and peace being so fragile the garda still keep an ee on all the main players and they pay for inside information its an old irish custom what we call informing touts all over the place touts informerswho do it for money thats what weve got herehe gestured to the screen tell me no go and get the brigadier and lets all enjoy it ferguson stood to one side as dillon tapped the keys again hannah sitting beside him he sat back right here it is last week some lout called oleary was in cohans bar which is not far from jack barrys house he said barry came in with a very well dressed man an american because oleary caught a word or two they sat in a booth hada snack lunch and a drink he said they had their heads together the whole time o where does this get us ferguson demanded they left and took to the park barrys house is on the other side oleary drove round there and saw a limousine with a driver parked outside he waited until the american left in the limousine and followed it to dublin airport and then the american left in a private plane a guffstream its flight plan was to macarthur field in long island dillon laughed no prizes for guessing who owns that plane ill get on to johnson straight away ferguson said turned and hurried into his office at his desk blake johnson was working his way through a file when alice quarmby came in with her pad johnson sat back all ght tell me the details on the gulfstream brigadier ferguson got from the garda were easily checked its owned by the russo corporation and is usually based at macarthur airport in long island according to airport records it logged out with two passengers last week marco sollazo and giovanni moil god thats great johnson said were getting somewhere now comes the hard part the same gulfstream left macarthur nine hours ago passengers as before with the addition of two irish citizens a daniel and nancy forbes damn johnson said i must contact fergu son a waste of time if you want to do anything alice told him ive just checked they landed at dublin two hours ago johnson shook his head you know something alice i think its time for another cigarette and get me brigadier ferguson anyway ferguson sat with the phone in his hand and dillon and hannah waited the brigadier nodded thank you superintendent he put down the phone that was costello of garda special branch the gulfstream landed disgorged four passengers refuelled and left anything els yes one bit of luck an airport security officer a retired detective sergeunt in special branch noticed them at the main entrance getting into a large shooting brake he noticed them because jack barry was at the wheel and he recognized him so we know where we are dillon said the russos in cahoots with the provisional ira i wonder how michael ryan likes that not much i suspect hannah bemstein said on the other hand its totally obvious that the russo family got him out and now he has to pay one thing is certain dillon said no point in raiding barrys home or rubbish like that hell have a safe house somewhere they sat there thinking about it and suddenly charles ferguson laughed i know who we need the greatest expert on the ira in existenceliam devlin he opened a drawer in his desk took out a small black book andleafed through it hannah bernstein said liam devlin scholar poet once a professor at trinity college gunman for the ira who probably killed more men than i did living legend of the ira dillon told her ferguson was talking is that you devlin you old rogue in the parlour of his cottage in the village of kilrea outside dublin liam devlin listened as ferguson talked when he w finished devlin laughed jesus but youve got a ton of trouble on this one brigadier its important devlin you must see that oh i do i mean were all big for the cause of peace send dillon and that chief inspector of yours to see me only tell him notto try and shoot me this time ferguson put down the phone hell see you two and believe me if anyone can help its devlin he knows more about the ira than anyone so order the lear jet pack your bags and get moving sir hannah moved to the door and dillon went after her ferguson called and dillon brigadier hed be obliged if you wouldnt try to shoot him this time hannah looked shocked but dillon smiled now do i look like the sort of fella that would do a thing like that brigadier chapter twelve the lear jet lifted off at gatwick and climbed to irty thousand feet dillon sat across the aisle from hannah bemstein devlinliam devlin hannah said i always thought it was just a fairy story the german attempt to kidnap winston churchill true enough november nineteen fortythree a strange one liam he was born in ulster his father was executed by the english during the angloirish war in nineteen twentyone a brilliant scholar he took first honors in english literature at trinity college he carried a gun for the ira during the thirties went to the spanish civil war and served with the international brigade the italians took him prisoner and gave him to german intelligence what was called the abwehr they did what they could with him but the trouble was he was very antifascist what happened after an abortive trip by parachute to liaise with the ira in ireland he managed to get back to germany and spent his time lecturing at berlin university in english then what oh the ultimate commando job a crack force of german paratroopers dropped into norfolk in november nineteen fortythree to kidnap winston churchill devlin went on ahead as a kind of middle man but i thought you said he was antifascist well they paid him wellfunds for the iraand i suspect that if someone on the allied side had asked im to snatch hitler out of berchtesgaden hed have tried that too i see he told me once that the greatest question in life is to ask am i playing the game or is the game playing me he smiled ruefully i know what he means and you tried to kill him and he me i assumed you must have been friends we were he taught me a great deal he shrugged i went through the purity of violence phase the kind of marxist revolutionary whod kill the pope if he thought it would further the cause liam was more oldfashioned he wanted to meet his enemy facetoface like a soldier of the revolution we didnt agree to differ shots were exchanged and we parted both of us the worse for wear and you regret that oh yes the greatest man i ever knew in my life he must be pretty old by now eightyfive next birthday good god she said blankly barry had owned the old farmhouse just outside the village of ballybum fifteen miles north of dublin for years he rented the land to a local farmer a sinn fein sympathizer and used the house itself oy for the occasional weekend since the death of his wife when he unlocked the front door and led the way in there wa a smell of damp kathleen ryan shivered god you could catch your death here the fires laid in the sitting room and in the kitchen stove t light them up ald well be fine in no time he had a carrier bagn his hand and he went into the stoneflagged ldtcben and put the bag on the table fresh bread milk eggs and bacon you could make us a fryup girl you can make your own bloody fryup he smiled the hot one kathleen ryan arent you suit yourself he opened the stove and put a match to it and turned michael ryan was leaning against the wall hands in pockets an intent look on his face sure and youd like to shoot me wouldnt you michael z nothing would suit me better barry laughed and turned to thў girl well at least you could make us a nice cup of tea he went out into tl hall and found solazo hanging up his rainoat mori was in the sitting room putting a match to the log fire it was pleasant enough a few rugs scattered on the flagged floor there was a dining table with six chairs a sofa and large wingbacked chairs on either side of the fire and the ceiling was beamel there was a statue of the virgin mary on the mantelpiece and a picture on the wall i didnt know you were a religious man mr barry that was my wife god rest her mass on most nornings when she could manage it she worried about me mr sollazo all those wild years in the movement he shook his head the hard time i gave her and whereare our friends in the kitchen dont worry the backdoor is locked and ive gothe keys of the brake he raised his voice wheres that tea kteen waiting for te kettle to on the stove was talking quietly to her uncle have you had your pill then just take it slowly and dont upset yourself the last thing we need at this moment in time is you on your back all right girl he said dont fuss z she made the tea and discovering a jar of instant coffee spooned some into two mugs and added hot water it was at that moment that barry called she put everything on a tray and they went through coffee for you two she told sollazo only the instant variety but youll have to make do mori tasted it and made a face disgusting barry laughed you cant have everything in this life son you should try the tea two things the irish do extremely well brew guinness and make tea kathleen poured there you go then barry took one of the cups and sipped his tea and thats grand the cup that cheers ill just finish it in peace and then well get down to business kathleen her uncle and sollazo leaned on the table and watched as barry unfolded a large scale map of the east coast of ireland including both the republic and ulster here we are at ballyburn now up through dundalk into county down and you see drumdonald and scotstown thats the area where you landed now all i need are the bearings for the position of irish rose he looked at ryan what was it again michael pale in the face and with great reluctance ryan told him barry had a ruler and pencil at hand a cinch this as you can see the map is marked in degrees top and bottom he quickly drew two lines one bisecting the other there you are three miles out i make it just off rathlin island did you know that michael it was dark ah well lets have a look at the admiralty chart for the area i got one of those too it was larger in scale and covenxi the down coast the isle of man and the northwest of england he repeated the exercise there you go he threw down the pencil fifteen to twenty fathoms shes lying in between ninety and a hundred and twenty feet solazo nodded no problem barry nodded when your uncle phoned me last night to say you were taking off he told me that as far as the pre hininary dive to establish the ships position was concerned youd do it yourself he said you were an expert scuba diver ive been diving in the caribbean for years the virgins st lucia solazo shrugged moil dives with me we can easily handle a dive like this your uncle asks me to provide the equipment i know the right man friendly to our cause you might say he has a place on a trading estat on the outs kirts of dublin i thought you and i could take a run in this afternoon thats fine mori can babysit our friends here hell need to he armed can you see to that theres an arsenal here if you know where to look for it ill see to it fuck you mister katlileen ryan said and stormed out i i z kilrea college was next to a convent on the outskirts of the village the garden was a joy flowers and bushes of every description the college itself was victorian with gothic gables and leaded windows dillon gave the bell pull a tug and it echoed inside a moment later the door opened and liam devlin stood there so there you are you young bastard he said to dillon in irish as ever was dillon replied in the same language devlin turned to hannah and youll be that old sod fergusons good fight hand the famous chief detective inspector hannah bernstein he looked her over with approval the lucky one he is and always was anyway cead mile falte and thats irish for a hundred thousand welcomes come away in hannah was totally astoshed shed expected an from man of eightyfive instead found someone full of energy and life still with some color in his hair wearing a black silk shirt and armani slacks cut in the latest fashion the eyes were the bluest she had ever seen and he had the same ironic quirk to his mouth as did dillon it was as if they were laughing at a world too absurd to take seriously the sitting room was a delight all very victorian from the fire in the grate and the mahogany furniture to the atkinson grimshaw paintings she was examining them when devlin brought tea from the kitchen on a tray z good god these are the real thing yes i invested wisely a few years back ive always had a thing for old grimshaw love his night scenes whistler once said that to call him the master of the nocturne was false that anything be knew hed learned from grimshaw he poured the tea and hannah said my grandfather has one the thames embankment at night oh a man of taste and discernment what does he do hes a rabbi devlin laughed out loud jesus girl and thats a showstopper if ever i heard one iiannah felt suddenly breathless what an absolutely marvelous marvelous man one of the most extraordinary people shed ever met devlin sat in a chair by the fire so its working for the brits flow is it sean sure and you know i am does that give you a problem mr devlin hannah asked call me liam girl dear no whatever i am im no hypocrite i once worked for ferguson myself he didnt say hannah frowned well he wouldnt he wanted someone to break an american irish lad called martin brosnan out of a french prison on belle island and me being a friend of martins found it difficult to say no he glanced at dillon and he no friend of yours sean told me he thought theyd done for you after you tried to blow up the british war cabinet during the gulf var yes well i w as wearing a nylon and titanium waistcoat and it stopped the bullets dillon said devlin laughed nine lives this one and i taught him everything i know he shook his head and there was an edge to his voice you know something sean youre the dark side of me and you liam are the good side of me dillon said devlin frowned for a moment and then laughed out loud you always did have a way with the words he shook his head still lets get down to business they went through all the information available and dillon once again gave a meticulous account of the robbery and the voyage to down on the irish rose when all this was finished devlin sat there frowning a cigarette irdone hand all right first of all we dont want the garda on this sure they could arrest ryan lold him until the americans asked for extradition they could even hold kathleen and this fella sollazo and his bully boy as accessories but none of that matters the only thing that does is finding the irish rose and making sure that gold cant be used for the wrong purposes so what can we do hannah asked i mean if barry and the provisional ira are in this devlin cut her off i dont think so gerry adams martin mcguinness and sinn fein have a big in z vestment in the peace process sure theres still the problem of persuading the provos to give up their arms but nobody wants trouble at the moment the politics are too finely balanced he shook his head no ill bet you a river the provisional ira army council know nothing about this you mean ban is in this for his own ends hannah asked oh no a true patriot jack my guess is hell play it close to his chest because he knows damn well the army council dont want trouble at this stage of the political game so what do you suggest liamt dillon demanded ill go and see the chief of staff and sound him out i know the dublin pub where he has a bite to eat at lunchtime every day and hell aeg you hannah asked devlin laughed out loud they all see me girl dear im the living legend and that can be very useful but not you and the lad here he turned to dillon a time for peace but there are those who see you as an apostate working for the brits theyd like nothing better than putting a bullet in you and tlaats a fact take the chief inspector to caseys ir the village what the english call good pub grub he smiled at hannah ill see you later the pub on one of the quays on the liffey was called the irish hussar a haunt of irish repub licans and it was already half full when liam devlln went in just after noon colum obrien chief of staff of the provisional ira was sitting in a booth at the far end a pint of guinness at one hand and a savorylooking dish before him he tucked a napkin below his chin devlin said shame on you colum and you tucking into a lancashire hot pot an english dish obrien looked up and smiled with genuine pleasure liam you ould bastard what are you doing here oh i was in town on business and a man has to eat a young woman came over and devlin said ill have the same as your man here andgive him a large bushmills whiskey obrien said only the best for liam devlin the young woman was truly shocked youre liam devlin ive heard of you since i was a child i thought you were dead and that says it all ievlin laughed away with you girl and bring me the bushmills devlin took his time raising polmcs only when they had eaten and were enjoying a pot ofbarrys tea so where are we with the pea ce process he finally asked still roadblocked obrien told him its the bloody british government with their demands that we get rid of all our arms liam thats too much i mean do they imagine the other side arent stockpiling i suppose you see gerry adams and mcguinness regularly whats the good word hope liam thats the good word anybody who thinks gerry and martin dont want this peace to last is crazy but peace with honor and what about the loyalist side of things difficult that they think the british government have sold them out or will do and theres some truth in that but they must face the fact that the day will come when theyll have to take their place in a united ireland that will take change from the catholic side too devlin said anywayhow do the old warhorses see it whats jack barry up to these days not much since he retired and not needed with the peace movement making changes i see him now and then but not often you know his wife died yes i heard that god rest her is he still in abbey road by the park as far as i know i dont know how he fills his out to rass like me devlin got up well ive enjoyed the crack colum we used to say our day will come lets hope it has it was years since hed visited jack barrys house in abbey road but when he drove there and parked the car it all came back and he found the house easily enough he tried the knocker on the front door and waited he had no intention of confronting barry about the irish rose affair just an old friend who happened to be passing but in any event he was disappointed he went round to the small garden at the back and peered through the kitchen window a voice said can i help you and he turned and found a young woman taking wash off the line next door devlin gave her his best smile i was looking for jack barry i saw him getting into the big station wagon early this morning he parks it in the street if it isnt there now hell be away somewhere is it important not tt all an old friend who happened to be in the neighborhood thats all so youve no idea where he might be hes here most of the time a lovely man used to be a schoolteacher then wife died they used to go away to the country at weekends they had a cottage or something like that would you know where im afraid not ah well if he turns up tell him charlie black called devlin lied cheerfully and went back to his car he was smiling as he drove away wondering what shed say if she knew that the nice man next door had once been chief of staff of the provisional ira z the warehousf on thetraiing f statf on the outskirts of dublin was called seahorse supplies the owner was a man named tony bradley middleaged and balding with a distinct beer belly an ira activist in his youth a fiveyear sentence in portlaoise prison fifty miles from dublin had cooled his ardor his sympathy and support were still with the republican cause however he had been a great fundraiser when he came home from the north sea oilfields where he had been a diver and had set up seahorse the warehouse was packed with diving equipment of every kind and bradley stopped at a goods table and took out an order pad great to see you again jack in fact a great honor list time was in the pub at ballyburn when i was spending a weekend at my farmhouse barry said and that was just a happy chance me passing through so what c i do my friend mr sollazo needs some diving equipment you hire as well asell dont you of course bradley tfirned to sollazo just tell me what you need two of everything sollazo iold him masks diving suits one medium one large and with hoods gloves fins weight belts with twelve pounds in each regulators buoyancy control devices and four air tanks oh and a couple of orca diving computers he turned to barry they tell you how deep you are how long youve got when you should come up great bradley said i tell you what jack ill open the freight door and you bring your station wagon in and well load up right here he bustledoff calling an assistant to help him and barry left sollazo there and went and got the station wagon he stood watching as sollazo carf fully checked each item you take a lot of care he said sollazo shrugged i always take care even though ive done two hundred and fifteen dives you wouldnt believe the number of people killed scuba diving each year and usually because of stupidity he smiled you see mr barry we shouldnt be down there in the first place bradley and his man finished stowing the gear and he said pnything else underwater lights sollazo said no problems ive got the very thing he went to a stacktook down two car dboard boxes and brought them over halogenlamps like the royal navy use longlife batteries and a charger included he put them in the station wagon and stood hands on hips frowning something missing and then he smiled i know he darted away and came back with two divers knives in sheaths with leg straps now i think that is it he said barry said just one thing ther used to be an item called a master navigator still is bradley said just been updated it was solazo who said could we see one of course bradley darted off again and was z back in a few moments a black box in his hand he opened it and took out the navigator there you go sollazo examined it the rows of buttons and the readout panel he glanced at barry inquiringly and the irishman said what happens if i insert the bear ings for lets say a wreck at sea well what happens is a triumph of modern technology bradley said theres an instruction book here and its very simple no need sollazo told him ill give you the figures you feed them in and well watch he took out his diary and dictated the position of theirish rose to bradley who punched it in the figures appeared on the readout panel check that theyre correct bradley said sollazo did so perfect good bradley pressed a blue button now its on hold you activate it by pressing the red button you get a slow and monotonous pinging when you reach the actual position the pinging becomes frantic you stop it by pressing the blue button again and that well definitely have barry said send me a bill at abbey road tony and youll get my check ah sure pay me when you return the gear jack bradley stood to one side as they drove away and waved good sollazo said the one thing you havent mentioned so far is a boat its being taken care of i mentioned drumdonald and scotstown as being in the general area of the down coast where ryan his niece and sean dillon landed scotstown is a smal fishing village theres a pub there called the loyalist its not what it seems kevin stringer the landlord is one of our own it was to there that dillon went for sanctuary after landing from the irish rose anyway ive spoken to kevin and hes found us something he thinks could be suitable i think you and i should drive up there tomorrow we can take all the equipment with us if the boat is okay kevin can stow the equipment on board and well come back ill take some semtex and pencit timers by the way in case we have to blast our way into the boat and then return the following day all of us ryan and the and well go otto rathlin island and girl included find the damned boat you think we will i always travel hopefully jack barry said it was late in the afternoon when devlin arrived back at kilrea cottage dillon was sprawled beside the fire eyes closed and hannah was reading a book when devlin entered he looked tired and she got up concerned let me get you a cup of tea that would be grand z he dropped into her chair and dillon sat up any luck well i saw colum obrien the present chief of staff and satisfied myself that as far as he is concerned jack barry is not upto anything as for the rest ive made discreet inquiries of various sources some of whom i have to check back with tomorrow so thats it dillon said for the moment devlin sat up straight as hannah brought tea in girl youre the wonder of the wohd he took the cup when ive had this ill have a bath and then take you for dinner wh en sollazo and barry went into the farmhouse they found mori in the sitting room reading a book he looked up this is great stuff a history of the saints of ireland these guys make mafia look likekindergarten where are they sollazo asked in the kitchen shes cooking i had to go and stand in the garden in the rain while her uncle dug up potatoes with a fork also carrots then she got cucumbers and lettuce and tomatoes from the greenhouse she could be a useful little broad whos killed at least three men to my knowledge barry said exactly sollazo told him sollazo went into the kitchen there was a good smell kathleen standing at the stove checking pans ryan was at the table mixing a salad a woman of many talents i see sollazo said youd better believe it mister she replied seated at his desk the phone in his hand ferguson said ive spoken to dillon our contact devlin has feelers out but no results so far in his office in the basement at the white house blake johnson said too much thope for an early result as you know the president is concerned in this matter do keep me posted brigadier of course i will ferguson put down the phone and sat back come on dillon he said softly give me a result devln as a favored customer at his local pub was given the best booth in the corner of the restaurant he insisted on ordering for all of them so they started with a lentil and potato soup to be followed by irish ham in a whita sauce with new potatoes and boiled cabbage hannah said im sorry liam im jewish youve forgotten ham is out he was immediately contrite would poached salmon be in that i could manage i should tell you as a serving police officer that the emphasis is on poached oh dear he mined to dillon as for you boy forget your ideas about the krug champagne all they do is a house champagne here at twelve quid the bottle z irish champagne hannah said well the name on the label is french dillon raised his hands order it i surrender the meal was delicious the champagne almost acceptable and the conversation the most interesting hannah bernsteinhad heard in years so your granddads a rabbi your father a professor of surgery and you went to cambridgeuniversity devlin said thats a terrible weight to bear and you a peeler how did that come about i wanted to do something worthwhile money wasnt a consideration ive got plenty of that god you on the beat in a blue uniform must have been the rand sight dont be sexist mr devlin liam do i have to teli yon again but a nice jewish girl like you imean didnt your da want you to marry and have babies this nice jewish girl shot dead norah bell dillon said devlin stopped smiling jesus big for the protestant cause that one and i killed the boyfriend ahem dillon said they were in london to knock off the american president hannah looked strained and devlin put a hand on hers it is not on you any of it girl its the world we live in now a bushmills whiskey to put me to sleep and well go home he shouted the order across to the barman turned back with a smile then suddenly frowned ive had a thought and what would that be dillon asked theyve got to go looking for the site of the irish rose thats right somewhere off the down coast we landed in the general area of drumdonald and scotstown im not thinking of that im thinking they have to go looking which means chartering a boat but more than that wouldnt they need diving equipment dillon nodded of course and you they tell me are an expert in that field these days ive doneby share what are you getting at well theyve got to get that equipment from somewhere and dublin isnt exactly saturated with firms in that line of business no it wouldnt be dillon sad what if i told you theres a firm called seahorse supplies on the edge of dublin thats owned by an old ira hand called tony bradley served under jack barry did five years in portlaoise prison now if you were jack barry and you necdcd diving equipment where would you go seahorse supplies hannah bcrnsteio said devlin smiled and raised his glass in a toast exactly which is where well go first thing in the morning everything comes to he who waits chapter thirteen it was eightthirty the following morning when toay bradley turned his land rover into the car park outside the seahorse supplies warehouse the staff didnt clock on until nine but he always liked to get there early there were a number of vehicles parked already to dowith other businesses nearby he walked through them and paused to get out his keys there was a small judas gate in the great sliding doors for easy access he unlocked it and there was a step behind him good man yourself tony bradley turned and found the three of them behind him but it was devlin he recognized immediately dear cod liam devlin and another old friend surely you havent forgotten sean dillon bradley knew fear then of the kind that made his stomach contract this had to be heavy he knew that scan its been a long time he glanced at hannah nervously and whomight you be shes with us thats who she is so in you go dillon told him and pushed him in through the judas gate bradley was very frightened now ive done nothing what is this sit dillon pushed him down on a packing case a question or two then well let you go devlin said you had jack barry here he deliberately made it a statement of fact and it worked thats right bradley said eagerly yesterdaj afternoon buying diving equipment yes he was here with an american a mr sollazo he was the expert hired a load of diving gear i thought it was something to do with the organization with it being jack im afraid not devlin told him jacks been a bit naughty up to no good you might say colum obrien and the army council would not be best pleased my god bradley said and how was i to know that yes youre in bad trouble old son devlin told him so youd better retrieve your position colum obrien doesnt know of your part in this so maybe i can help anything bradley moaned devlin turned to dillon youre the diving expert dillon lit a cigarette and said to bradley tell me what they took bradley hurriedly went through the list as he remembered it i think thats all he paused then added quickly no i was forgetting the master navigator i gave them the new model and a demonstration dillon asked more than that the american gave me some bearings and i punched it in for them those things are like a homing device they take you straight to the place which was where hannah cut in how would i know it was just bloody numbers he was getting upset ive told you all ri know except where they were going when they left devlin said barry lives in abbey toaґ everyone knows that only he isnt there devlin said gently now where else might he be how would i know bradley said wildly dillon produced his walther with the carswell silencer im wondering whether a bullet in your left kneecap might improve your memory for gods sake sean bradley was terrified and then he remembered justa minute the last time i saw jack barry was in a pub in ballybum i was driving down from dundalk and i stopped for a drink and there he was in the corner of the bar z and what happened we had a crack and he told me he had an old farmhouse just outside the village hed intended to walk back but i gave him a lift it was an old place all a bit run down hesaid he didnt use it much since his wife died he wasdesperately searching for more information ad found it there was a sign on tlie gate where i dropped him victoria farm i remember because he made a joke about it being a brit royal family name there was sweat on his face now devlin said there that wasnt too hard was it the troth the whole truth and nothing but the tluth dillon said softly it better be tony boy or ill be back to take care of that left kneecap he mined away and moved to the judas gate hannah at his side she murmured softly you really are a bastar oillon yes well it gets results girl dear and thats what counts devlin smiled and put an arm around bradley cheer up tony it may never happen but if you try and get in touch with barry or speak of this to anyone im afraid dillon will be very annoyed indeed and you know what that means not a word i swear it good man yourself devlin said and left him there dillon and hannah were waiting beside devlins silver toyota saloon the games afoot as sherlock used to say so to ballyburn and you can drive sean im getting old dillon got behind the wheel and devlin held the rear door open for hannah you dont look pleased you didnt like it back there i never do when i see the way he operates yes well he always was the hard man our sean and he went round to the other side and joined her at victoria farm they all had breakfast in the kitchen when it was finished kathleen cleared the table and stacked the plates and strangely enough it was mori who helped her when her uncle barry and sollazo went out she half expected mori to make apass at her was all ready for it instead he filled the sink with hot water and put the dirty dishes in leave them to soak less work that way and whats got into yiu you big lump she demanded he laughed my father owned a restaurant in palermo when i was a kid i worked there all the time in the kitchen later i was a waiter for him then you took to the gun he shrugged and said calmly it paid better when she went into the sittingroom the three of them were looking at the map thats it then bar was saying up to dundalk then across the border no trouble there these days since the peacealks you can drive straight through z and then scostown sollazo said exactly we might make it in a couple of hours two and a half at the most and who is we kathleen asked sollazo and me barry told her you can stay here in mows tender care youve got your bloody cheek yes well im in charge mr sollazo and i will drive up to scotstown with the diving gear kevin stringer at the loyalist thinks he has a suitable boat well check it out if its okay kevin can stow the gear and well return well probably be back here by five he glared at him then looked at her uncle he shrugged all for the best kathleen if everything is on course well all drive up to scotstown in the morning barry said oh do what the hell you like she said and stormed out the toyota coasted down the hill outside ballyburn dillon slowed and there it was the opened fivebarred gate the sign victoria farm and the farmhouse beyond pull up in the layby devlin said ive got some glasses in the glove compartment he rummaged inside and found a pair of zeiss binoculars just let me take a look he stood beside the toyota and focused them on the station wagon in the farmyard and at that moment z the house door opened and they all came out barry sazo mori and the ryans christ devlin said its the whole damn bunch of them jack barry for starters take a look sean dillon took the binoculars focused them and nodded barry michael and sweet kathleen hannah had got out of the toyota and he passed the binoculars to her she took a look the other two are sollazo and his minder giovanni mori she murmured to devlin we had photos of them faxed from blake johnson she stiffened barry and sollazo have got into the station wagon the others are going inside out of here quick devlin said to dillon they scrambled in and dillon drove away quickly and took a side turning he stopped give them a couple of minutes to see if they come this way if not ill reverse and try and catch them up it was hannah a momentjter watching through the rear window who said there they go and with luck to where we all want to be devlin said so after them se an dillon stayed wellback devlin acting as lookout and the amount of traffic on the road gave them plenty of cover drogheda was twenty miles dundalk another twenty and they were just under the hour as they passed through the town the border soon devlin told hannah then we cross over to warrenpoint if its the down coast z as it must be well go through rostrevor and down to kilkeel and take the coast road which would bring us to drumdonald and scotstown the area where we landed after the irish rose went down dillon observed what was the name of the pub you went to in scotstown hannah said the loyalist dillon laughed the wrong name entirely kevin stringer who runs it worked for barry for years he frowned and turned to devlin what do you think that it sounds promising well see now ill take a little nap and you young ones keep alert aii warrenpoint the tiaffic thinned out but there were still vehicles on the road private cars and the occasional truck enough to give cover if dillon stayedwell back it started to rain sweeping in from the moume mountains sweeping down to the sea as the song says devlin commented a rand sight it certainly is hannah said there were two cars and a large farm truck ahead of them ahd the station wagon in front devlin said one thing if we are going to end up in scotstown or some such place we have a problem fishing villages only on this coast a jetty a harbor a few boats strangers stick out like a sore thumb well have to go gently dillon said wait and see the rain increased into a solid downpour and barry at the wheel of the station wagon swore softly the curse of this country you can say that again sollazo said kilkeel coming up theres a grand cafe on the road just before we go through i dont know about you but a cup of tea and a bacon sandwich would go down fine suits me sollazo told him a few moments later they came to the very place and barry mined intothe car park there were several trucks a few cars and he parked beside them there was a filling station and garage with a sign that said patrick murphy son the cafe was at the other end of the car park they ran through the rain and went in dillon pulled the toyota in between two trucks and switched off the engine hannah said ill go and see whats happening i need thg toilet anyway she got out and hurried awalhrough the rain a darling girl devlin said she saved my life once and took a bullet in the doing dillon told him jesus devlin said a nice jewish girl like that i remember what fergnson told me she said once dillon said it was after she shot norah bell the bitch had stabbed me in the back twice she said im not a nice jewish girl at all im a very old testament jewish girl devlin laughed god save us if i wasnt seventy five years of age id fall in love with her seventyfive dillon said its the great liar you are hannah came back and leaned down they look settled i saw barry give the waitress an order look im thinking about what you said liam about us standing out like a sore thumb whenever we get where we re going that might apply to you more than me i mean if it turns out to be scotstown for example this kevin stringer would know you sean even you liam he could recognize me devlin said i was well known in these parts mainly because i was born in thecountry he grimaced sometimes its hell being a living legend hannah said not me im just an english tourist or i could be that garagehas a car hire sign pass me my shoulder bag and ill go and see what i can get if our friends leave before im ready just go ill follow the coast road dmdonald and scotstown way ill find you devlin handed her the bag on your way girl there was a mechanic working on a car in the garage a small man in a tweed suit and cap sitting in a glass office he got up and came out patrick murphy he said and what can i do for you miss ive been touting with some friends but theyre going back to belfast they dropped me here because someone in warrenpoint said you hired cars zz i do indeed how long would it be for two or three days i want to roam the down coast just take time off can you help well its not the fancy stuff i can manage but ive a renault saloon over here if youve nothing against the french nothing at all she followed him across the garage and had a look newly checked and the tank is full he told her wonderful she embellished her story a little when i come back ill be wanting to return to belfast no problem i run a taxi service well take you to warrenpoint you can catch the train now if youll give nke your licence well get on with it how would you be paying by the way she opened her purse took out the licence and checked her cards would american express be all right he smiled well as they say on the television that will do nicely she drove out of the garage as barry and sollazo walked toward the station wagon she pulled in behind the toyota and briefly punched the horn dillon turned raised a hand and gestured her forward she pulled out between the tracks as the station wagon turned into the road and followed it and the toyota came on behind z scotstown was desolate in the rain thirty or forty houses the jetty a dozen or so fishing boats in the harbor all enveloped in a damp clinging mist there was a wood at the top of the hill overlooking the village hannah pulled in at the side of the road looking down and saw the station wagon turn into the car park of the public house the toyota stopped behind her and dillon and devlin got out a long time since i was here dillon said but i was fight though thats the loyalist down there and if kevin stringers still there hes jack barrys man lets take a look at the harbor devlin raised the binoculars not much just fishing boats no wait a minute theres some sort of motor launch anchored out there thirty or fortyfooter painted gray looks like seriousbusiness to me take a look dillon peered through the binoculars you could be right ive got to be hannah took the binoculars from dillon and checked for herself she nodded i agree liam but what this needs is a closer look ill go and play the tourist i could do with a nice cup of tea and a sandwich anyway ill try the loyalist while we starve dillon said thats just your hard luck dillon she told him went to the renault got in and drove away in the back parlour of the loyalist kevin stringer embraced barry jack i cant tell you how great it is to see you again and you kevin this is my associate mr sollazo from new york youve found a boat indeed i have avenger a motor launch a friend of mine up the coast bought for the shark fishing only the sharks went away sollazo laughed out loud that i like how far would you be going stringer asked rathlin island barry said does anyone live therethese days not in years how far only three or four miles good we can take a look fine stringer said but come and have a drink and something to eat so youre doing food these days barry said we all need to make a living jack and times are changing with the peace process tourists flooding back americans like mr sollazo i have seven rooms here in the summer i was full most weeks but come and eat best irish stew in the country there were a few regulars in the bar having a drink barry and sollazo satat the table in the bow window ate rabbit pie and drank guinness on the other side of the bar hannah bernstein did a good nervous act to the barman could i just have sandwiches kevin stringer moved in fast and smiled at his most expansive anything youd like well salad would be fine she said no problem touting are you thats fight and to drink a vodka and tonic would be nice coming up just you sit yourself down there were some newspapers on a stand by the door she took one and sat at a table at the far end of the room from the window barry had his back to her so it was sollazo who noticed very nice he thought it was a strange quirk but hed always liked wonen who wore glasses an hour later sollazo barry and stringer went down to the harbor stringer led the way to the slipway and agreen inflatable with an outboard motor here we go he said sollazo and barry climbed in stringer followed and cast off he started the outboard and they moved away hannahwandering down from the pub watched them go from the hill devlin followed their progress through the binoculars i was right he said with some satisfaction theyre closing on the boat that looked promising he nodded now theyre boarding have a look dillon did watching them board then swung to the jetty and focused on hannah bernstein take care girl dear take care he said softly on board avenger barry and sollazo followed stringer as he showed them around one cabin two bunks the saloon with benches that allow for another two bunks galley toilet and thats it they ended up in the wheelhouse sollazo said it seems as if its seen better days top show isnt everything it looks shabby but the hull is steel and by akerboon penta petrol engine twin screws good for twentyfive knots shes got a depth sounder radar automatic steering everything you need barry turned to sollazo are you happy sounds good to me barry nodded and said to stringer fine kevin well unload the station wagon in your garage you put the stuff on board later well return to dublin well be back before noon tomorrow to put to sea thats fine jack they went to the rail and sollazo dropped into the inflatable stringer said eagerly its important is it jack i mean for the movement the great days back i know what you mean kevin barry said to hell with peace hannah pulled in beside the toyota at the top of the hill and got out they came back from the boat and went to the pub z dillon had the binoculars raised the station wagons just leaving no matter only one road they can go well catch them so if theyre leaving theyll be coming back devlin said and i think i should be here to receive them hannah sai have you got a bag of any description in your car liam as a matter of fact i do devlin opened the boot of the toyota and produced a large holdall empty im afraid that doesnt matter ill book into the loyalist and play the tourist theyll be back and we with them dillon said devlin put his hands on her shoulders take care wed hate to lose you dont worry she raised her shoulder bag im carrying hannah youre the wonder of the world dillon kissed her on both cheeks and then softly on the mouth her eyes widened damn you dillon that was a first and she got into the renault and drove away ten minutes later a delighted kevin stringer was showing hannah a bedroom with a view of the harbor and how long would you be staying he asked two nights possibly three im just touring down from belfast a great city we dont have en suite facilities z but the bathroom and the necessary is just next door wonderful ill see you later dinner at seven if you like and he went out dillon caught up with the station wagon within fifteen minutes and settled back what do you think theyre up to this was just a prelinfinary sortie to check the boat theyve probably dropped off the diving equipment its back to ballybum now theyll return maybe tomorrow with the others and up we come again and what then dillon asked thats up to you and that young woman back there she has the police authority sean scotstown is in ulster and thats part of the united kingdom its up to you and ferguson devlin leaned back maybe a little gunplaywho

wagon they looked as if they were supporting him let me look dillon took the binoculars theyre all getting in barry and kathleen too lets get ready to move he slid behind the wheel and devlin got in on the other side a few moments later the station wagon turned into the road and dillon followed there was a telephone box in the village but it was out of order hannah needed to speak to ferguson had to take a chance she returned to the loyalist and went up to her room there was the usual system where she punched nine to get an outside line and she dialed fergusons direct line atthe ministry of defence it was bad luck that kevin stringer was sitting at his desk in the office doing accounts and was intrigued by the sound of the rather long series of numbers clicking rough he reached for the main switchboard phone and lifted it gently brigadier ferguson chief inspector bernstein a little later stringer heard a voice say ferguson here whats happening chief inspector im staying at the loyalist in cotstown sir on the down coast we followed them up here barry and sollazo they have a boat in the harbor and brought a load of diving gear theyve gone back to barrys place outside dublin thats where the ryans are dillon and devlin are in hot pursuit you expect them to return probably tomorrow im staying on as an english tourist lone female variety well for gods sake watch yourself dont i always she put the phone down in the office stringer sat thinking about it then he rang barrys phone number ztz at ballybum there was no reply he sat there thinking about it some more and finally opened his desk drawer and took out a browning automatic hannah sitting at the dressing able was aware of a slight noise and turned to find the door open stringer standing there thebrowning in his hand chief inspector is it so whats your game lady chapter fourteen the sign at the entrance to the drive said roselea nursing home the station wagon turned in through the gates and dillon in the toyota stopped on the other side of the road what in the hell is going on im not sure devlin said but my ingression is something nobody counted on in the reception area they sat waiting moil sollazo barry and kathleen she was in a bad way and barry had an arm round her dont worry itll be fine the guy who runs this place dr all hassan is a brilliant doctor he tried to make a joke an egyptian

has overdosed she stared at him her face bone white he said urgently could he have overdosed she nodded slowly he took tlff of the pills at four oclock oh my god hassan turned and ran along the corridor kathleen went after him and barry and sollazo followed leaving mori in reception ryan lay twitching on the bed in intensive care while hassan and a male nurse worked on him kathleen barry and sollazo peered in through the window and barry held the girl tight suddenly ryan gave a terrible gurgle and reared up on the bed and then he relaxed all life draining out of him hassan came out im afraid he has gone z kathleen struck out at him he cant have its not possible barr restrained her hold on gift its not your fault but it is she said im a trained nurse im supposed to know these things i choked at my old hospital at green rapids the doctor told me three dazane would give him an angina attack but not more than a couple of bad days it was our way out dont you see youd have to take him to hospital and wed have a chance to get free she broke down entirely barry handed her over to sollazo take her to the station wagon ill handle things here sollazo took her out and tarry turned to

cettificat whatever you say good man yoursell barry said turned and went out dillon and devlin sitting in the toyota watched the station wagon drive away dillon said only the three of them and the girl and no ryan what goes on i know this place devlin told him an ira safe house its run by a damn good surgeon an egyptian named all hassan maybe we should pay him a visit all hassan sitting in his office only a desk light on was aware of the door opening and glanced up to see devlin dillon behind him devlin said hello all remember me liam devlin you took a bullet out of me eighteen years ago oh my god mr devlin hassan said and this is a friend of mine sean dillon whos done as much for the cause as i have mr dillon hassan said uncertainly a few people we know were in earlier propping up a mr ryan between them dillon said they left without him why would that be i think you must be mistaken hassan said desperately dillon produced his walther well this doesnt agree with you so think again which all hassan did and told them al at victoria farm kathleen was in the bedroom still weeping barry sollazo and mori were in the sitting room drinking whiskey when the phone rang stringer said thank god youre there jack somethings come up he started to talk when he was finished barry said hold her tight kevin were on our way well leave now i will jack barry put down the phone and turned to sollazo do you recall a woman in glasses having lunch in the loyalist today sure sollazo said goodlooking lady in an armani trouser suit shes not only a detective chief inspector she also works for brigadier charles ferguson the prime ministers special intelligence expert and guess who his troubleshooter is sean dillon christ sollazo said what do we do we get the hell out of here now dont ask me whats going on because i dont know but we leave now for scotstown and we check irish rose out tomorrow morning barry turned to mori get the girl mori glanced at his boss and sollazo nodded do as he says devlin and dillon sitting in the tcta watched the station wagon leave there you go devlin said hot for scotstown i should imagine ryans unfortunate demise has brought things forward wed better get going then dillon said no rush sean well go to my cottage first after all you know where theyre going at kilrea cottage devlin sat by the fire with a bushmills in his hand dillon bustled in his walther in one hand his spare in the ankle holster in z the other he pulled up his trouser put his foot on a chair and fastened the ankle holster he slipped the other walther in his waistband against the small of his back devlin said i always favored a walther myself sean theres one in the desk drawer get it out dillon did as he was told now put it in your pocket but why dillon said sean lad im too old id only be a hindrance if the bullets start flying so youre on your own now only one thing i can do which is to offer sound advice youve a gun in your pocket in a search barry would find thateasy enough then hed check your back because he knows you favor that position hell find the other waither that should satisfy him give you a chance of getting away with the ankle gun devlin smiled i mean thisis all supposition maybe barry wont have the chance of turning you over but who knows god bless you liam youre the best dillon said give them hell sean liam devlin said now get on with you ill phone ferguson and bring him up to date it was four oclock in the morning and hannah bernstein was sleeping fitfully on the sofa in the small parlour at the back of the loyalist there were security bars on the window and stringer had loked her in she came awake to the sound of a zo vehicle drawing up in the yard she sat up and listened to the sound of voices after a while the door opened and stringer led the way in they were all there bany sollazo mori and kathleen who looked pale and subdued from much weeping stringer took hannahs walther from his pocket and gave it to barry this was in her shoulder bag ban weighed it in his hand then put it in his pocket so chief inspector hannah bemstein and you work for that old dog charlie ferguson if you say so oh but i do careless of you making a telephone call like that with a nosey one like kevin in the office to listen in we all make mistakes you mentioned devlin and scan dillon we can expect them nosing around can wet look mr barry its over cant you see hat american intelligence is on to mr sollazo he and at a white house level thats a lie solazo said they cant be they know everything how do you think brig adler ferguson came into the picture she shook her head theres no way either the white house or downing street will stand by and see that bullion fall into the wrong hands you see mr barry sollazo is in this for greed but not you with those kind of resources the provisional ira could keep going forever if it needed to shoot the bitch kathleen ryan said dully i can take care of it mori said barry shook his head she could still be useful as some kind of hostage he shook his head fancy that old fox liam devlin making a fool of me but why why liam peace mr barry its very fashionable these days hannah told him and most people want it to hell with polite conversation sollazo said what happens now maybe we should get the hell out of here while we can mod said barry shook his head my hunch is that ferguson sent the chief inspector here and dillon on a fishing expedition with devlin supplying the local expertise no garda no ruc not at this stage all they wanted was to know where the irish rose is lying once ferguson knows that then it would be a job for a royal navy salvage team weve had it anyway sollazo said bitterly they know where we are yes but they still dont know where the irish rose is i say we go out at dawn and make the dive anyway dammit man if that gold is reachable we could raise a few bars and be on our way a milliontwo millionfor a mornings work and suddenly sollazo smiled what the hell why not ive been taking chances all my life too late m stop now but what about dillon and this guy devlin liam devlin was the best in the business once but hes eightyfive years of age dillons the hard not to me he isnt mori said well it would make an interesting encounter but no need the chief inspector makes a very satisfactory hostage if dillon and devlin turn up he turned to stringer right kevin an early breakfast and well leave at dawn youll hold the fort here ferguson on his secure line finished talking to blake johnson the american said what happens now that ryan is dead would yon say the location has died with him definitely not otherwise why would they have returned to scotstowa my chief inspector as i told you is there undercover dillon in hot pursuit a man of infinite resource and guile hell sort it out he always does hell find out where that damn boat is and then job for the royal navys salvage section something nice and discreet make it look like an exercise he laughed one thing is certain theres no way our friends can mourn a proper salvage operation on that boat not now the president will he pleased to hear that and so will the prime minister when i tel him in the morning ill keep you up to date on future developments naturally id appreciate that brigadier ferguson sitting by the fire at his flat put the z phone down and went to the drinks cabinet and poured a large whiskey come on dillon he said softly sort the buggers out dillon at that moment was on the hill outside the village the toyota parked in the shelter of the wood he scanned the front of theloyalist with his binoculars then had a look at the avenger at anchor out there in the harbor and where will you be hannah my love still in bed at this time in the morning i shouldnt wonder he said softly dawn was coming up fast now and the morning was gray and grim the damp clinging mist shrouding everything and rain fell relentlessly he lit a cigarette and wondered how he was going to play it and then the front door of theoyalist opened and they all came out jack barry kathleen sollazo and mori with hannah bemstein between them stringer stood in the doorway talking to barry then went inside sweet mother of god dillon said and followed them with his binoculars as they walked down the slipway and got into the green inflatable and cast off the outboard hammered into life and they moved away dillon got into the toyota and started the engine kevin stringer making another pot of tea in the kitchen was aware of a slight creaking as the back door opened he turned and dillon smiled at him dear god its you sean and stringers throat went dry a long time kevin so whats been happening here what do you meant dillon took the waither from his pocket this thing makes hardly a sound and you know me ill put you on sticks so tell me please sean im only a middleman on this i listened in when the woman was on the phone she identified herself as a chief inspector and spoke to a brigadier ferguson mentioned you and liam dew lin so as theysay in bad movies all is revealed michael ryans dead stringer said a heart attack i know that dillon said i know everything so theyre going out to irish rose thats right and the chief inspector jack said shed be a useful hostage if you turned up the ryan girl wanted to kill her so did that bast tard mori is that a fact well we canthave that so lets get down to the jetty fast before they leaxe on the avenger barry was at the wheel the two women sitting on the bench beside him sollazo was on the stern deck with mori and starting to raise the anchor when stringers voice boomed across the water jack dillons here jesus mary and joseph jack barry said and switched off the engine he went out on deck and sollazo and mori joined him at the rail is that him as ever was he raised his voice is it yourself sean and who else dillon called back lets talk ill be over barry turned to mori pull the inflatable in he shook his head the mad has you sound as if you like him sollazo said he was like a son to me the great days we knew together in deny in the old days leading british paratroopers a fine ogddance mori shaded his eyes with a hand he doesnt look much to me barry dropped into the inflatable and looked up on his worst day and your best hed put you away without even thinking about it he cast off and started the outboard dillon lit a cigarette as the inflatable coasted in youre looking good jack the years have been kind kinder still to you you young bastard wheres liam devlin z back in kilrea eightyfive is a little old for gunplay the best of men in his day so here we are dillon said and whats to be done youve had it jack no point to it anymore not quite true sean if we find the wreck which we will and the gold bars waiting he shrugged a hard mornings work could net one million perhaps two not to be sniffed at ah you were always the practical man dillon said is hannah bernstein well oh yes i like that one a lady of parts and then some let her go take me and why should i oh ive been honing my talents since the old days i can fly a plane jack but im also the best damn diver you ever saw i even blew up plo boats in beirut harbor for the israelis you little rascal barry ughed no sean shes too valuable to hand over just yet too useful god help us then ill just have to come along for the ride a nice thought but lets check you out first barry prodded his browning check his pockets kevin stringer did as he was told and found the walther satisfied dillon asked when was i ever barry smiled under his jacket and against his back kevin healways favored that position stringer found the second walther youre fight jack and he handed it over i usually am barry told him you hold the fort kevin he smiled up at dillon in you get scan i think ill put you to work dillon went over the rail first and barry handed the line to moil and followed the two women came out of the wheelhouse dillon said to hannah are you all fight girl dear im fine dillon glanced at moil christ but he looks as if he just learned to walk erect this morning if he gives you any trouble let me know and ill select two items on his person and break them mori erupted but sollazo got in between leave it giovanni he turned to barry have you checked him out a walther in his pocket and another in the back of his pants a good job i remembered that but ive got good news for you sean here is a master diver i mean hes made money out of blowing things up dont you think we should put him to work sollazo smiled why that really makes my morning good then lets have the anchor up kathleen ryan had stood there staring at him and now she moved forward a strange dazed look on her face martin it is you isnt it there was something strange here something not right dillon said gently as ever was kate im sorry about michael i killed him she said i persuaded him to overdose on his pills dr sieed said it would be all right that hed just have an angina attack she ran a hand over her face he died martin and i killed him isnt that the terrible thing it was hannah who put an arm around her come on love lets go down to the cabin and she led her away the engines rumbled into life as barry took avenger out to sea mori said thats all we need a crazy woman dillon said tell me son do you work at being a shite or does it just come naturally and he turned and went and joined barry in the wheelhouse to get the walther from his ankle holster and to kill barry mori and sollazo iseconds was not impossible but it required the righmoment and the fact that hannah came up on deck didnt help dillon smiled out at her as she stood under the deck canopy shielded from the rain he said to barry the great pity we end up dealing with scum jack i know son but one thing hasnt changed anything i get out of this goes to the organization we both served for so many years money for arms times have changed jack we cant be sure z dillon sighed all right youd better fill me in where are we going just off rathlin island and the master navigator will home in on the position barry looked startled is there nothing you dont know weve really been on your case ack thanks to liam anyway how deep will she be well off rathlin island according to admiralty charts anything between ninety and one hundred and twenty feet thats not bad not if you allow for the size of the vessel mind you its how shes lying that matters sollazo joined them how much further half a mile barry said im turning the navigator on now he handed it to sollazo there was a monotonous pinging at regular intervals hell its working sollazo said the closer we get the more urgent the sound and when we reach the final position the pinging becomes continuous lets keep our fingers crossed sollazo gave it back to him and turned to dillon i was going to dive with mori but as youre supposed to be such hot stuff he shrugged youd better come and check the gear my pleasure dillon said and followed him out zo rathlin island loomed out of the mist and barry reduced power as they coasted onward through water which was extraordinarily calm the pinging on the master navigator had increased in urgency and suddenly it changed into a long single highpitcbed shriek thats it barry called get the anchor over mori and sollazo hurried to comply kathleen was at the port rail and for a moment dillon was at hannahs shoulder im carrying he whispered barry found two but devlin the old fox gave me a third ankle holster careful she said not now it could be a blood bath not to worry gil dear id like to go down and take a look at an old friend so to speak the anchor rattled down theavenger stopped dead there was silence then barry cameout of the wheelhouse there you go so lets getn with it sollazo turned to dillon lets get ready ill go first and he went down to the saloon when he came back on deck he was wearing one of the diving suits and a weight belt and buoyancy jacket your turn he said to dillon dillon went down the companionway to the saloon and undressed to his underpants unstrapping the ankle holster there was a cupboard marked emergency flares he ripened it and slipped the walther inside as he reached for the diving suit there was a step on z the companionw and sollazo looked in come on lets get moving dillon dragged on the suit awkwardly and the cowl over his head he pulled on the socks then picked up the other weight belt and fastened it around his waist with the velcro tabs then he reached for the divers knife in the sheath sollazo said leave it youre the last man in the world i want to see with a lethal weapon suit yourself dillon picked up his inflatable then took the other orca computer and went up on deck to where the others waited sheltering from the rain under the deck awning sollazo followed him ive been tinking he said weve got to husband ourselves we can only spend so much time down there you know that even less if its lying at a hundred and twenty ygugo first dillon and see what you find it made sense and dillon smiled my pleasure with a skill born of long practice he lifted the inflatable and tank over his head inserted his arms and strapped the velcro tabs across his chest he sat down to put his fins on and took the halogen lamp mori passed to him looping its cord round his left wrist he leaned over the rail to swill out his mask then pulled it down and turned sitting on the rail he raised a thumb we who are about to die salute you and all that old roman rubbish he said put his mouthpiece in checked that the air was flowing and went over backwards zz he passed under the keel found the anchor line and started down pausing at fifteen feet to equalize the pressure in his ears the water was extraordinarily clear yet strangely dark and he pulled himself down the anchor line checking his orca computer thirty forty then sixty feet and there it was looming out of the gloom tilted to one side quite visible even without the lamp being turned on he was at ninety feet and the ship lay on a smooth sandy bottom that sloped downwards here and there great fronds of seaweed undulated backwards and forwards in the current dillon closed in on the prow and switched on his halogen lamp and there it was clearly visible in pite of being encmsted in barnacles the ships name irish rose and this was special because hed been part of what had happened here he moved towards the stern torn apart bi the force of the explosion and there was the tmcko one side of the ship obviously the explosion had torn it free from the deck clamps and incredibly it had settled upright on all six wheels dillon moved to the rear raised the door clamp and pulled it refused to budge he tried again but got the same result no point in wasting precious time at that depth so he made for the surface he went up the small side ladder to the deck pushed up his mask and spat out his mouthpiece they all stood waiting z for christs sake scan tell us the worst barry pleaded oh its there dillon said and at ninety feet which is useful gives more bottom time and the truck sollazo demanded thats there too it obviously became detached from the deck in the explosion and its standing upright beside the ship marvelous sollazo said only one thing i dont understand when we grabbed the truck we used an electronic device called a howler that screwed up the security system so everything unlocked sot sollazo said i couldnt pen the rear door so the electronics got shook up in the explosion sollazo told him or maybe the door jammed weve got semtex and penil timers go down and blow it yes oh master dillon saidjust get me the necessary barry crouched beside him with a smtex block here you go sean and a threeminute pencil timer czechoslovakias contribution to world culture dillon said can you manage can a fish fly hannah called take care sean dont i always he pulled down his mask sat on the rail and went over he hauled himself down the anchor line again the quickest route made for the truck and floated there working the plastic block of semtex around the door clamp then he broke the timer pencil there was a gentle fizzing and he turned and made for the surface barry reached a hand down to help him up the ladder dillon sat down and the others moved to the rail after a while the sea boiled turning over angrily and a number of dead fish surfaced soon it was still again dillon grinned up at sollazo dont tell me down i go again the truck had moved to one side but was still upright and the roar doors had been blasted apart one hanging on the hinges tt other lying some distahoe away where it had been thrown sand hovered in clouds dillon approached and switched on the halogen light and experienced a lonsideble shock for the truck was empty he hung at the bottom of the ladder took out his mouthpiece and looked up as they all leaned over the rail youre not going to like this one little bit jack dillon said but theres nothing there what do you mean theres nothing there arry demanded i mean the trucks empty it cant be empty barry said you told me z you looked in the back when you knocked it off on that road it was there then yes it was dillon said but it isnt now kathleen ryans face was burning her eyes dark holes someone must have been here before not possible dillon said the door was fast and no sign of blasting mori help me sollazo said and reached for his inflatable and tank youre going down again dillon and im going with you i think youre lying suit yourself dillon told him and went under again starting down the anchor line he hovered beside the wreckage of th stern of the irish rose hanging on to a rail and sollazo drifted down to join im he poised there then swam toward the truck dillon went after him sollazo hung on the edge of the door and peered inside he turned once toglanceat dillon his face clear then turned to the dark interior again dillon came up behind him pulledthe divers knife from sollazos leg sheath reached overand sliced open his air hose bubbles spiraled at once sollazo swung round eyes staring his hands went to his throat and he started to rise dillon grabbed for an ankle and pulled him down the kicking stopped surprisingly quickly and finally he hung there arms outstretched dillon pulled off the mask and sollazo stared right through him straight to eternity the irishman took him by the hand and started up z it was kathleen ryan who saw sollazos body first as he surfaced to starboard would you look at that she said hannah joined her at the rail oh my god barry and mori hurried over the sicilian without hesitation pulled off his jacket and shoes jumped over the rail and swam to sollazo he got an arm around him paused and turned and looked up hes dead dillon had released the body at ten feet and swam under the rail to the port side he surfaced unfastened his inflatable and tank and let them go pulled off his mask and fins and peered cautiously on deck barry kathleen and hannah were at the rail and he could hear mori calling throw me a line dillon hauled himself over the rail and slipped down the companionway to the saloon he got the emergency flares cupboard open found e walther and went back up barry was standing at one side of hannah and kathleen engaged in unfastening a lifebelt as he threw it over dillon said easy does it jack he stood in the entrance to the companionway a supremely menacing figure in the black diving suit the walther in his right hand get over here hannah she did so barry still leaned over the rail glancing back over his shoulder still the eighth wonder of the world arent you scan dont do it jack dillon said gently but barry did half turning browning in hand and dillon shot him twice in the heart barry was hurled against the rail the browning skidding across the deck and he toppled over into the sea dillon ran to the rail walther extended mori stared up at him an arm around sollazo and dillon took deliberate aim and shot him between the eyes there was silence only seagulls calling whirling above them in the mist dillon sat down against the rail jesus but i could do with a cigarette hannah went down on one knee beside him are you all right sean kathleen ryan said her voice strangely dead martin push th walther over this way dillon had put it on the deck beside him he looked up and hannah turned and there she was barrys browning in one hand the look on her face was that of the truly mad not there martin not there in the first place the cunning old bastard my uncle only td me the other day but clever you must agree its there wting for me and ill fly in out of the sea to get it soon now martin soon i know kate i know wouldnt hurt you martin my lovely martin so down you go the both of you i think wed better hannah murmured anything you say kate dillon smiled stood up and kicked the walther across hannah went down the companionway and dillon followed close the door kathleen called he did as he was told was aware of her footsteps on the companionway the key turning in the door it was only two or three minutes later that they heard the outboard motor start up what do we do hannah asked simple dillon told her now that shes gone these things have a forward deck hatch always do ill be back in a minute he went out into the galley and saw the hatch at once above his head stood on a stool unclipped it and pulled himself through a moment later hannah heard him on the companionway and the door opened she followed hn out on deck and they saw the green inflatable disappearing into the mist dillon went into the wheelhouse and switched on the eh gines he turned back toward scotstown here you take the wheel and ill o and change when he returned hannah said shes crazy sean over the edge she always wasa bit that way dillon said something there something really heavy and i never knew what now she thinks she killed her uncle by the way is thatjack barrys raincoat on t he peg there if so i might just find those two walthers he took off me he searched the pockets and turned there you are one for you and one for me ill take the wheel what did she mean that the gold wasnt there in the first place remember i told you i felt there was something wrong when i went through the files and the newspaper clippings yes now i know what it was michael ryan had a replica truck at follys end and benny was to dump it on the coast road to put th police off for a while so it didnt strike me at first but there wasnt a single mention of that truck in any police report or newspaper file now why would that be oh my god hannah said exactly atter the robbery i took off for the irish rose on the motorcycle with kathleen michael followed in the truck only he was late told us the automatic clutch was giving trouble which it wasnt of course not he was late because he called at follys end and switched trucks the bullion never went down with the irish rose because it was never on board its locked away in that hidey hole at the back of the barn atthe farm at follys end isnt that the biggest laugh youve had in years the lake district chapter fifteen kathleen ryan coasted in out of the mist and grounded on the ilipway beside the jetty she didnt bother tying up simply left the inflatable where it was and went up to the quayside and crossed to the loyalist she went round to the yard atthe rear and found barrys station wagon when sltried the door it was locked she stood there thinking about it she had to get out of it had to keep moving so she crossed to the back door kevin stringer sat at the table drinking tea and reading yesterdays newspaper he looked up in surprise what are you doing here jack barrys keys for the station wagon where are they on the sideboard she reached for them and put them in her pocket i need my shoulder bag i left it in the bedroom ill go and fetch it then ill be off she went out and left stringer there very disturbed it was quiet no staff due in for a couple of hours and for some reason he knew fear he heard her coming down the stairs and she came in shed got rid of the reefer coat shed worn on the boat was wearing a long raincoat and her old black beret the bag hung from her left shoulder do you know where ladytown is its on the far side of newcastle on dundmm bay you just follow the coast road how far twenty miles good ill be away then it was noticeable that the american accent had disappeared and now she had reverted to the hard belfast accent of her youth stringer got up and moved to block her way what the hell is going on wheres jack dead martin killed him martir keogh he killed sollazo and the other fella too hes still on the boat with that woman i locked them in the cabin and came back in the inflatable her voice was flat and monotonous and stringer felt strangely lightheaded not keoghdillon have you lost your wits girl they cant all be dead not all three oh yes they are anyway ill be off youre not going anywhere he put his hands on her shoulders her eyes seemed to burn in that pale face and she cried out dont put your hands on me you taig bastard she pulled the browning from her righthand pocket jammed the muzzle against his side and fired he gave a terrible groan and staggered back damn you youve done for me she shot him again and he fell against the table and dropped to the floor good riddance she said if i had my way id shoot the lot of you she put the browning back in her pocket and went out a few moments later she drove away in the station wagon dillon eased the avenger into the side of the jetty and hannah scrambled over with a line he cut the engines went over the rail to join herand tied up right lets get moving he took hannahs hand and they ran across the street in the rain going round the side the yard at the back hannah peered cautiously in through the kitchen window there doesnt seem to be anyone there she said and i see the station wagon has gone all right in we go dillon told her and took out his walther there was the immediate pungent smell o cordite and then of course stringers body hannah dropped to one knee and searched for a pulse she looked up and shook her head hes quite dead she stood she doesnt take prisoners that girl i wonder where shes gone look she gave her uncle those pills to get him away from barry and co to a hospital from where they thought theyd be able to do a runner he died and she blames herself but she is running and on her own now dillon said to the lake district in england where else but how to get there fly to manchester and hire a car a possibility or maybe a private flight several old airstrips on that coast from the second world war you only have to look in pooleys flight guide its a possibility hannah nodded and there was that strange remark she made back there on the boat its there waiting for me and ill fly in out of the sea to get it dillon said shes mad dillon you do realize that did you notice she didnt sound american anymore i know she was talking pure belfast just like the sixteenyearold gift i saved on a dark street ten years ago but never mind that now well go in the office and call ferguson ferguson at his flat in cavendish square had only just awakened and he sat up in bed and listened calmly to what hannah had to say when she finished he said give me your telephone number she did so and he scribbled it down ill call back give me fifteen minutes he put the phone down picked it up and rang his office at the ministry of defence when the duty officer answered he said ferguson here put me on to flight information when the telephone rang in the office at the loyalist hannah answered at once brigadier there is a royal navy airsea rescue base at

girl dear and he opened the door and led the way out kathleen ryan found ladytown with no difficulty and she pulled over in the village square got out and spoke to an old woman who was walking by with a poodle on a lead would you be knowing where theres an airfield near here i would indeed love that would be tony mcguires place and how would i get there about two miles on let me explain and the old woman went into detail it was a sad sort of place obviously run down and neglected the sign on the gate said mcguires air txis and the paint was peeling the tarmacadam of the drive was pitted with holes and she bumped along toward the administration buildings there was a tower and two hangars and no sign of any planes she parked outside what looked like a world war two nissen hut and the door openel and a small wiry man in jeans and an old black leather flying jacket appeared his gray hair was close cropped and there was a watchfulness to him can i help you would you be tony mcguire who wants to know michael ryans niece kathleen mcguire said i havent heard of michael in years i thought he was dead alive and well and waiting for me over in the english lake district and the thing is he told me that if i needed a quick trip over there the man to see was tony mcguire did he indeed oh yes told me hed used you often in the old days he stood there looking at her a slight frown on his face and then he said youd better come in there was a stove in the office the pipes going up through the ceiling a camp bed in one corner a map desk and an office desk cluttered with papers mcguire lit a cigarette so what do you want a quick trip to the lake district and when would you want to go now he stared at her shocked thats a pretty tall order you do have a plane dont you he hesitated then nodded just one at the moment the bank foreclosed on me and took my best plane the conquest in lieu of debts but i do have a cessna so we could go ill show you he led the way out and crossed to one of the hangars and rolled the rusting door back revealing a small twinengined plane how long would it take to get to the lake district in that probably about an hour good ill take it steady on he said first of all it needs refueling and ill have to do that by hand and that takes time he turned and looked up at the sky and the weather stinks id need to wait to see if it would clear he turned to look at her and then we have to decide where were going as close as possible to a place called marsh end its south of ravenglass all right lets go back to the office and ill check in pooleys flight guide that shows every airfield and airstrip in the uk he leafed hrough the book for a while and then paused i remember this place laidale it was an emergency field for the raf in the second world war i landed thereonce about fourteen years ago theres nothing except a load of decaying buildings and an airstrip so we can go well wed need to land at somewhere with customs and security facilities first three thousand dollars she said and we fly there direct she pulled up the false bottom of her shoulder bag and produced several wads of american dollars obviously to a much greater amount and mcguires throat went dry he swallowed hard and managed to speak is this some political thing i know what your uncle and his people get up to t dont want trouble i mean those days are gone five thousand she said and held the money out how long did you say it would take an hour he said hoarsely an hour there and an hour hack id say five thousand dollars was good pay here ill count it out while you go and refuel she sat at the desk took out wads of dollars and started to count mcguire watched fascinated and licked his lips okay ill leave you to it ill refuel the plane he almost ran across the broken tarmacadam of the runway to the hangar and the one image that wouldnt go away was the sight of all those dollar bills coming out of her shoulder bag at the same moment the sea king helicopter landed at whitefire airsea rescue base the rotors stopped and as dillon and han berustein emerged a range rover pulled up fi royal navy lieutenantcommander got out my names murray youll be brigadier fergusons people thats right hannah said hes due to land in ten minutes ill take you along to the mess and you can have a coffe they got in the range rover and he drove away tony mcguire came into the office and found her sitting by the stove you all right he asked she nodded your five thousand dollars are on the table he went and picked them up a bundle in each hand count them if you like she said what the hell i trust you he went and unlocked an oldfashioned safe in the corner and put the money inside can we go now she said i dont see why not he turned and led the way out as they walked across to the hangar she said can we get away with it oh sure mcguire said theres more unrestricted air space out there than people realize and if i approach the ctsast of the lake district at under six hundred feet i wont even show on radar i see they went into the hangar she climbed over the wing and took the seat directly behind the pilots mcguire climbed in and closed the door he fired one engine then the other and turned okay she nodded here we go then he taxied out onto the runway bumping over holes and turned into the wind at the far end there was a slight paus and they moved forward he boosted power and they lifted up into the mist and rain in the officers mess at whitefire dillon and hannah were having a cup of tea when lieutenantcommander murray came in with ferguson here you are brigadier he said ferguson gave him his best smile id appreciate a word with my people commander ten minutes after that well leave in that sea king for the destination ive indicated on the map as you say brigadier murray saluted and withdrew ferguson turned and smiled is that tea i really would appreciate some chief inspector of course sir hannah found a clean cup and poured ferguson said you have been having a ball dillon havent you well its been complicated ill say that ferguson accepted the cup of tea from hannah and your usual kill ratio i see barry sollazo and mod really dillon you constantly remind me of the tailor in the fairy tale by the brothers grimm who boasted of having killed three at one bl only in his case it turned out to be flies on a piece of jam and bread jesus brigadier have i disappointed you again dont be silly dillon what about the girl shes quite mad hannah bernstein said whatever mental state she was in before is one thing but this business of the death of her uncle has put her right over so you think shell turn up at follys end she doesnt have anywhere else to go dillon told him all fight calm down ferguson put his cup on the table lets go and see shall we mary power was feeding the chickens at her back door a black and white sheepdog at her side it was late afternoon darkness tingeing the sky on the distant horizon she finished with the chickens then went in search of benny and found him in the barn sitting at the tackle table cleaning the barrels of a shotgun there you are did you see to the sheep in the north meadow he nodded eagerly i brought them down he said in his slow pedantic way and put them in the paddock youre a good lad benny he reached for an ammunition box took out two cartridges loaded the gun and snapped the barrels up for a moment it pointed at her and she cuffed the side of his head and pushed the shotgun to one side ive told you before nevel point it at anyone guns are bad but the fox might come again benny said slowly last tim he killed twelve chickens well you get the bastard when he comes but dont shoot me she said now come and have your break cup of tea and that nice fruit cake i made he put the shotgun on the table and followed her out the cessna came in from the sea at four hundred feet and banked to starboard a few moments later it dropped in at the end of the runway at laldale and taxied toward the far end mcguire turned into the wind and switched off the engin es kathleen reached for the door handle he said ill get that for you and opened it you first she went out over the wing put a foot on the little passenger ladder and reached the ground and me guire followed her the mountains were shrouded in mist and the rain was a persistent damp drizzle you know where youre going he asked oh yes i can walk youre sure youll be all right its just threeor four miles only i was thinking about all that money in your shoulder bag i mean anything might happen he reached and grabbed it from her he stood there beside the plane scbbling in the bottom of the bag and found the rest of the dollars jesus christ he said bastard kathleen ryan told him youre all bastards and she took out the browning and shot him twice in the heart mcguire bounced against the wing and fell to the ground she picked up the bag slipped the strap over her shoulder turned and walked away at follys end benny was forking hay in the loft of the barn when mary power went in search of him ive done lamb stew do you want dumplings benny nodded eagerly id like that suddenly the air was filled with noise an incredible roaring mary turned in alarm and ran into the yard benny following her and the sea king helicopter descended into the meadow beside the farm the rotors stopped and charles ferguson hannah bernstein and dillon got out dillon ran forward and mary said in amazement martin martin keogh is that you as ever was mary has kathleen been here kathleen ryan she looked bewildered no should she be dillotl turned and shook his head to ferguson who still stood by the helicopter ferguson leaned in and spoke to the pilot then stood back and the sea king rose into the air and banked away ferguson came vard and smiled at mary power who stood outside the barn door benny at her shoulder who are you she demanded whats happening brigadier charles ferguson mrs power is the track still in the barn she went very pale the truck she whispered yes is the truck still in the barn he said patiently it was benny who answered oh yes truck in the barn till uncle michael come back benny show and he turned and ran inside it was raining hard now as kathleen ryan tramped along the eskdale road a strange forlorn figure in her raincoat and beret hands thrust into her pockets she reached the gate with the sign follys end paused then turned in and approached the farmhouse it was almost dark fading fast and there was no light in the house she stood there in the yard remembering this place ten years ago her uncle and martin and she ran a hand over her face was it then or now and then she saw a glimmer of light at the door of the barn mary power and benny sat at the tackle table benny was polishing an old pony saddle mary watching him the door creaked open a small wind lifted straw in the hay bales my looked up and found kathleen standing there so youve come back kathln ryan i had to kathleen told her it was meant to be from the beginning is the truck still here oh yes its always been here your uncle michael changed his mind told benny not to dump the spare truck on the coast road after all he came here after the robbery and exchanged them i know about that he told me he was afraid the crew of irish rose would try to steal the bullion more than that he was afraid he would have problems with the army council in ulster there was a man called reid kathleen shrugged looking very tired he could have caused trouble can i see the truck benny show he cried got up and moved to the back of the barn he tossed bales of hay to one side as if they were nothing then pulled on the false wall swinging it back kathleen went forward turned the locking bar and opened the doors and there was the bullion in its boxes charles ferguson said miss ryan i believe she turned and found ferguson hannah bernstein and dillon standing there she stared at them blankly and then something stirred martin is that you as ever was kate ive come for it martin come for the gold like uncle michael wanted well beat the ira at their own game its over kate haid were into peace now weve got to give it a chance peace she frowned as if having difficulty at taking the idea in at all and then her eyes blazed peace with the taigs she was like an avenging angel and her hand came out of her raincoat pocket holding the browning you saved me martin in the alley with those three bastards remember of course i do but you werent there the other time when i was fifteen and there were four of them it was as if she was choking dirty rotten taig bastards to hell with them for what they did to me and uncle mi chael he hunted them down personally he killed each one himself the gun shook in her hand we have to stand and fight we have to face the catholic scum and only at that moment did dillon realize how truly mad she had become but before he could speak it was benny who interfered he staggered forward looking distressed arms waving no kathleen guns bad mustnt point guns his hands fastened on her shoulders and she screamed get away benny and her fingerfastened convulsively on the trigger of the browning and she shot him benny cried out and fell back and mary power screamed no picked up the shotgun from the tackle table thhmbed back the hammers and fired both barrels kathleen was lifted backwards off her feet into the hay bales the browning flying from her hand dillon ran to her and dropped o one knee she grabbed for his hand maxn is that you her body jerked once then went very still hannah crouched beside him as dillon stayed there holding a hand shes gone sean yes i can see that benny incredibly got to his feet and stood a hand to his side blood oozing between his fingers he looked shocked and dazed hannah examined him quickly and turned straight through his side theres an exit wound hell live ferguson gently took the shotgun from mary power oh god what have i
