the doomed oasis in the baking heat of the persian gulf the arabs whose ancestors roamed the lands are wary of the europeans only the legendary arabist charles whitaker is always welcome in their camps it is he who helps maintain the uneasy peace between hostile neighbours to this barren land comes whitakers illegitimate mate son david raised on the tough cardiff waterfront whose love for the desert and for the tribes that inhabit it becomes as fierce as his fathers but the two men see the lands future in very different ways and neither will tamely submit to the other the confrontation between father and son reaches its explosive climax in the treacherous sands of the doomed oasis hammond innes the doomed oasis to the royal air force and the officers of the trucial oman scouts with my admiration for the work they do in circumstances of difficulty often of great hardship and with my appreciation of their cooperation without which this book could not have been written i would like to express my appreciation of the help i have received from neil innes during the actual writing of the doomed oasis he was minister of external affair to the sultan of muscat at the time i was journeying in arabia not only did he check the final typescript for me but at various stages of the writing i benefited greatly from his knowledge i should perhaps make it clear however that i have ignored his advice on the spelling of two arab names in particular believing that my own spelling of makhmud would be more helpful in conveying the sound of that name than the correct mahmud both the sheikhdom of saraifa and the emirate of hadd are of course entirely imaginary arab states cold voices whisper and say he is crazed with the spell of far arabia they have stolen his wits away walter de la mare the court of first instance call aubrey george grant aubrey george grant the moment had come my mouth felt suddenly dry the court was waiting and i knew the ordeal ahead of me was a long one and at the back of my mind was the knowledge that in telling the truth the whole truth i might convict an innocent man i felt the touch of her hand on mine the quick pressure of her fingers and i rose to my feet the sweat sticking the shirt to my back as i followed the attendant the doors of the courtroom stood open i checked a moments hesitation in the entrance the place was packed the atmosphere tense with expectancy quickly i walked down through the court the setting familiar to me a part of my working life only my role had changed it was the first time i had entered court as a witness i kept my eyes on the judge on the pale london face above the tropical suit he had been specially appointed to try this unusual case and he looked tired after the long flight shrunken almost the suit too large without the scarlet robes he seemed less aweinspiring and the law robbed of some of its majesty counsel too looked ordinary without wig and gown and the courtroom itselfall open shirts or pale loosefitting jackets a scattering of bahrainis in flowing arab robes the code of criminal procedure in this court was based on the indian penal code yet in essence it was the same law and as i moved towards the witness box the judge leaned slightly forward peering at me shortsightedly his hands clasped together once in the box i faced the crowded courtroom no longer a mass of unidentifiable humanity but a sea effaces all lifted to stare in silent expectation waiting for the full story which they now knew i alone could give i had been called as a witness not for the defence but for the prosecution every word i uttered would be taken down and rushed out of bahrain by telephone and radio and thousands of miles away the metal drums of the presses would pour the story out to waiting millions representatives of almost every london newspaper were here and half the worlds press packed so tight in this improvised courtroom that they could hardly breathe and outside in the broiling humid heat were the photographers and the newsreel men and the television recording units and at the airfield across the water on the island of muharraq special planes waited to fly the pictures that would be flashed on the screens of television sets in the homes of countless people here and there in that sea effaces below me were people i recognized people who had taken part in the events i was going to have to describe there was sir philip gorde director of gulfoman oilfields development looking old and battered his heavylidded eyes halfclosed and beside him erkhard very neat and cool colonel george was there and captain berry easily distinguishable smart in their uniform of shortsleeved khaki shirts and wellcreased khaki longs sue had followed me in and it came as something of a shock to me to see that she had seated herself next to that strange halfarab halffrench girl who called herself tessa captain griffiths too his beard neat and pointed a reminder of cardiff and the visit that had started it all raise your right hand i did so and my gaze shifted involuntarily to the prisoner in the dock he was watching me and for a moment our eyes met i thought he smiled but i couldnt be sure i had a sense of surprise almost of shock perhaps it was the tropical suit the neatly brushed hair he looked a different man there was only the arm still in a sling to remind me that this was the man whose singleness of purpose had captured the worlds imagination the book thrust into my hand disrupted my thoughts repeat after me my lips were dry i had turned away from him but i knew he was still watching me i swear by almighty god i swear by almighty god that the evidence i shall give the court that the evidence i shall give the court and as i said it i was wondering how the public at home would react to what i was going to have to tell the court until today they would have had quite a different picture of the prisoner a mental picture culled from garbled versions of his exploits heard over radio and seen on television read in newspapers and periodicals a colourful largerthanlife picture entirely at odds with the neat figure standing alone there in the dock accused of murder shall be the truth shall be the truth they should never have brought the case he was a national hero and whatever the verdict of the court the publics reaction would be a violent one but would they be for him or against him the whole truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth and nothing but the truth your full name please aubrey george grant and then counsel for the crown on his feet and facing me you are a solicitor by profession i believe yes were you called upon to act for the prisoner on his arrest yes when did you cease to act for him as soon as i realized i was being regarded as a material witness for the prosecution you have acted for the prisoner before i think yes when was that just over four years ago the judges voice suddenly interjected how long ago his hand was cupped to his ear four years my lord the prosecution moved a step nearer hands hung in the lapels of his jacket the skin of the face cool as parchment in the humid heat i will ask the witness to take his mind back now to the afternoon of march twentyfirst four years ago on that afternoon you received a telephone call from a mrs thomas of seventeen everdale road cardiff and as a result of that telephone call you went to that address yes perhaps you will now tell the court in your own words what happened ii the whole truth escape to saraifa everdale road was in the grangetown district of cardiff it was one of those terrace streets of grim victorian brick roofs hunched against the wet west wind windowed eyes peering blindly for the view of river and sea that was blocked by other similar houses two streets away and you could look across the taff to the litter of cranes the glimpse of funnels that marked the bute docks it always depressed me this area of cardiff it lacked the squalid colour of tiger bay the bridge across the taff seeming to cut it off from the toughness and sense of purpose that gave a lift to the real dock area the street was deserted except for one car a small black saloon it stood outside number seventeen and as i drew in to the kerb behind it i glanced quickly at the house there was nothing to distinguish it from the others except the number a light was on in one of the downstairs rooms neat lace curtains were looped back from the windows i got out and rang the bell wondering what i was going to find inside trouble of some sort nobody ever called me to this district unless they were in trouble and the voice over the phone it had been a womans voice low and urgent near to panic i glanced at my watch fourthirty the light was already going out of the cloudfilled sky a slight drizzle gave a black shine to the surface of the street across the road a curtain moved hidden eyes watching something to gossip about i knew the black saloon parked at the kerb it was dr harveys but if there was death in the house then the curtains would have been drawn my hand was reaching out to the bellpush again when the latch of the door clicked and voices sounded nothing else i could have done mrs thomas a case for the police you understand i hope and the ambulance will be here any minute now the door was flung open and dr harvey bustled out almost cannoning into me oh its you grant he checked in midflight black bag gripped in his hand no overcoat as usual a young fairhaired very serious man in a perpetual hurry well i suppose youll be able to make some sort of a case out of it in court the boys certainly going to need legal advice there was no love lost between us wed tangled over medical evidence before got to deliver a baby now cant do anything more for that chap and he almost ran out to his car mr grant the woman was staring at me uncertainly i nodded of evans jones evans solicitors you telephoned me a little while back yes of course she held the door open for me a small neatlooking person of between forty and fifty with deepset shadowed eyes her hair was greying swept straight back from the forehead the face dead white against the dark background of the passage will you come in please she shut the door behind me dafydd didnt want me to call you but i thought you wouldnt mind as your firm it is that handles that little allowance for me it was the first i knew we acted for her in any way i thought shed phoned me because im willing in certain circumstances to take a case without a fee whats the trouble mrs thomas i asked her for she was standing motionless as though unwilling to let me go further into the house she hesitated and then almost in a whisper well its dafydd really you see he came back and then oh dear its all so difficult to explain now that she had shut the street door i could see no more than the outline of her face but her voice trembling to a stop told me she was having to fight to keep control of herself she was frightened too i dont know what hell do she whispered and sue not here sue could always manage him when i couldnt sue is your daughter is she i knew it would steady her if i asked questions yes thats right she works at the infirmary but i didnt phone her because shed never get back here in time and david thats your husband no dafydds my son he and sue are twins she understands him somehow i see and hes in some sort of trouble yes and then she added hastily hes not a bad boy not really she drew in her breath quickly as though gathering herself together if i hadnt written to him like i did it wouldnt have happened but id had about all i could stand you see and then he came home and there was a bit of a row and mr thomas he said things you see that he shouldnt have done and suddenly they were hitting out at each other it wasnt dafydds fault hed had a terrible shock poor boy and mr thomas hed had a few beers and then she sucked in her breath again as though gulping for air well then he had this stroke you see and i called dr harvey right away and then i telephoned you because i knew if meant trouble for dafydd it had all come out in a rush as though she couldnt contain it any longer my husband looked so bad you see she added lamely and i didnt know what would happen i just didnt know what to do mr grant not for the best as you might say and then dr harvey came and he said there wasnt much hope for him and he phoned the police so its glad i am that i called you now youll know what to do and what dafydd should say to them hes not a bad boy she repeated in a voice that was suddenly on the defensive just a bit wild you know and she added quickly mr thomas hit me you see there was a family row in other words yes yes you could call it that but i wouldnt like you to think that because mr thomas was a bit of a drinker there was anything wrong between us hes good at heart you know and hes had a stroke you say yes thats right thats what dr harvey called it she seemed to have got a grip of herself come in now wont you mr grant hes lying on the couch in the parlour and dafydds there too i expect youd like a word with him but dont try and rush him please she added in a whisper and i got the impression she was afraid of her son he needs a bit of handling you see and hes had a shock as i say a dreadful shock she pushed open the door and stood back for me to enter this is mr grant dafydd mr grant the lawyer the room was lit from the ceiling a stark glaring light without compromise it showed me a couch with the body of a man lying on it he was in his shirt sleeves the brass gleam of a stud showing where his shirtband had been loosened his eyes were closed and he was breathing with difficulty his rather heavy florid features fallen away so that the bone showed through the flesh the nose had the veined look of a heavy drinker close against the gas fire one elbow on the mantelpiece leaned a youth of about twenty he was rather overdressed in a jacket with a lot of elaborate pockets and tucks and a pair of tightfitting trousers his face was as white as his mothers the same features too except that the nose was more beaky the jaw stronger he didnt shift his position as i entered the room didnt even look up he was staring down at the gas fire and his immobility was oddly disconcerting close by his feet was a litter of broken glass from the smashed front of one of those overpretentious china cupboards the mahogany beading as well as the glass had been broken in the struggle and the bricabrac with which the cabinet had been filled mostly white china souvenirs from seaside towns lay in confusion on the worn carpet a vase too lay where it had fallen from the table by the window it was unbroken and beside it lay a muchthumbed photograph album spilling press cuttings there was something a little macabre about the whole room nothing cleared up after the struggle and the father lying there halfdead on the couch with a blanket tucked round him and the mother and son standing facing each other absolutely still i could feel the tension between them it wasnt hate but it was something just as strong an emotion so violent that the man on the couch myself the state of the room didnt exist for them well now i addressed the boy my tone as matteroffact as i could make it in that sort of atmosphere suppose you tell me what happened but it was like talking to a brick wall he had a sullen withdrawn look ive told you what happened his mother said in a whisper quite so mrs thomas but id like to hear it from your son she looked deathly tired i turned to the boy again youve had a shock i said gently its natural you should be a bit dazed by whats happened but even as i said it i knew the boy wasnt dazed the knuckles of the hand that gripped the mantelpiece were white with pressure and there was a muscle working at the back of the jaw he was holding himself in like a boiler under pressure and i wasnt sure how best to handle him his gaze had shifted now and he was staring at his mother i felt sorry for the woman listen to me young man i said i understand dr harvey has called the police theyll be here any minute now if you want me to act for you then youd better start talking now before they arrive a slight movement of the shoulder that was all the answer he made it wasnt a shrug more a muscular twitch as though he was impatient for me to go mr grant is only trying to help dafydd dammo di what the hell good is a lawyer man now its done and arguing about it wont alter anything his voice trembled and then he turned on me a flash of pale amber eyes and told me to get out the words violent laced with obscenities dafydd but she was frightened she had no control over him all right i said and i moved towards the desk where id left my hat i hope for your sake i added that your fathers condition isnt serious hes not my father the words flashed out from between clenched teeth id have killed him if hed been my father i turned to find his pale eyes fixed on his mother mean that ma i swear ill kill the swine if lean ever find him the words had a violence and a bitterness that appalled me hes not himself his mother murmured he doesnt know what hes saying her hands were plucking at the apron round her middle and her brown doelike eyes were wide with fear she knew hed meant it youd better get control of yourself i said youve done enough damage for one day without threatening more and frightening your mother but now the pressure inside him couldnt contain itself any more you get out of here he said it quietly and because of that his words had force whats happened here is nothing to do with you or anyone else its between my mother and me he spoke through clenched teeth as though he were still trying to keep some control over what he was saying and then suddenly he lashed out wildly all control gone when youre suddenly told youre illegitimate and your sisters illegitimate too you want to know a little more about it dont you you want to talk it over with your mother ask her a few questions find out who and what the hell you really are he flung out an arm pointing dramatically at the album on the floor see that uncle charless scrap book she subscribed to a presscutting agency every story the newspapers published about him its all there pasted in with loving care my own mother clinging to the wornout bed of an old love jesus christ it makes you want to weep and me and sue coming up the wrong side of the bloody blanket and being fooled into calling that poor drunken sot dada he stared at me balefully eight years old i was when i first stole a peek at the contents of that book a relation thats what she said an uncle of mine started me getting interested in arabia it did i thought he was a bloody hero instead hes just a lowdown dirty heel who left my mother flat well what do you say to that eh youre a lawyer maybe you can tell me what i ought to do about it and he glared at me as though i were in some way responsible and then he suddenly moved a quick step forward that brought him facetoface with me now you just get the hell out of here and let me talk to my mother alone see his eyes had a wild look the sort of look id only seen once before on a boys face but that had been in the midst of battle id known how to deal with it then but this kid was different it wasnt only that he looked tough i had a feeling he was tough well im not exactly soft but i dont walk into things with my eyes open but then i glanced at mrs thomas saw how scared she was of him and after that there was nothing for it but to stand my ground not knowing what exactly hed do for i could feel the tension building up inside of him again he was like a spring coiled too tight and then the ring of the ambulance bell sounded down the street and the violence suddenly died out of him it drew up outside the house and a moment later two hospital attendants came in with a stretcher the attention of the three of us was focused then on the man on the couch he murmured as they shifted him an inarticulate sound and mrs thomas fussing over him now spoke his name the tone of her voice had a quality that is only possible between people who have shared their lives together and it seemed to reach him for his eyes flicked briefly open and he murmured her name sarah it came thickly from his twisted lips obscured by the effort of moving halfparalysed muscles sarah im sorry that was all the eyes closed the face became clay again and they took him out mrs thomas followed them sobbing uncontrollably the door swung to of its own accord and the room was still i shouldnt have hit him it wasnt his fault the boy had turned away and his shoulders were moving i realized suddenly that he was crying oh god he sobbed i should have known if id had any sense i should have known you couldnt have known hed have a stroke i told him he turned on me then you dont understand the tears were standing in his eyes he and i we hated each others guts i can see why now but at least he stood by us poor sod and he added viciously he was a damn sight better than my real father if i can ever lay my hands on that bastard he checked there and gave an odd little laugh bastard thats funny isnt it me calling him a bastard he turned away then brushing the back of his hand across his eyes i wish i hadnt hit him he said quietly hell be all right you think so but then he shook his head no hes going to die thats what the doctor said he was the only father sue and i ever knew he added and now ive killed him dont talk nonsense its not as dramatic as that hes had a stroke and anyway youre entitled to defend your mother when a man hits her he looked at me did she say that and then he laughed a little wildly and after a moment he said yes thats right he hit her and he added christ what a bloody mess the door of the ambulance banged in the street outside and he turned to stare out of the window the engine started and it drove off as though its departure had started an entirely new train of thought he swung round on me youre whitakers lawyer arent you the name meant nothing to me but then no doubt mrs thomass allowance had been arranged by evans years ago and it would be handled by my clerk as a matter of routine whitaker is the name of your father is it your natural father thats right my natural father he spoke the word slowly savouring it for the first time and then he said i want his address why why the hell do you think he was back at the window again a blokes got a right to know where his father lives hasnt he maybe i said but im afraid i dont know his address thats a lie he came back to me his eyes searching my face well youve got it on your files havent you you could look it up if hes a client of mine then im not at liberty to disclose not even to his son no not even to his son i hesitated the boys temper would cool and after all hed a right to know where his father was if ive got his address i said then ill write to him if you like and get his permission oh dont give me that crap you know bloody well where he is he caught hold of my arm come on arabia it is somewhere in arabia tell me for christs sake he saw it was no good then and began to plead please i havent much time and i got to know do you hear i got to know there was a desperate urgency in his voice and then the grip on my arm tightened lets have it i thought he was going to hit out at me and my muscles tensed ready for him dafydd mrs thomas was standing in the doorway her hands plucking again at the apron i cant stand any more there was an edge to her voice that seemed to get through to him and he relaxed slowly and stepped back from me ill come for that address he muttered sooner or later ill come to your office and get it out of you he was back at the window again looking out id like to talk to my mother now he stared at me waiting for me to go i hesitated glancing at mrs thomas she was still as stone and her eyes as they stared at her son were wide and scaredlooking i heard the slow intake of her breath ill go and make some tea she said slowly and i knew she wanted to escape into her kitchen youd like a cup of tea wouldnt you now mr grant but before i could reply and give her the excuse she needed her son had crossed over to her please ma his voice was urgent there isnt much time you see and i got to talk to you he was pleading with her a small boy now pleading with his mother and i saw her weaken at once i got my hat from the rolltop desk where id left it its all right mrs thomas i said ill leave you nowthere was a phone on the desk an oldfashioned hookup instrument standing amongst a litter of books on greyhounds and racing form you can always phone my office if you want me she nodded dumbly she was trembling slightly and i could see she was dreading the moment when shed be left alone with him but there was no point in my staying this was something that lay between the two of them alone take my advice i told him when the police arrive be a little more cooperative with them than you have been with me if you want to avoid trouble and stick to your mothers story he didnt say anything the sullen look was back in his face mrs thomas showed me to the door im sorry she said hes upset its not unnatural i was remembering how id felt when i learned that my parents were divorced id heard it first from a boy at school and id called him a liar and half murdered the little swine and then when i discovered it was true id wanted to kill my father and had had to content myself with a letter which for sheer brutality had been inexcusable its a pity you didnt tell him before i always meant to she said but somehow she shrugged a gesture of hopelessness and as i went out to my car i was wishing i could have done more to help her as i turned out of everdale road a squad car passed me there were four of them in it including sergeant mathieson of the cardiff cid it seemed an unnecessarily large force to answer dr harveys call but i didnt go back it was past five already and andrews would be waiting to clear the days business andrews was my clerk he was also secretary switchboard operator office boy poor devil he had come to me with the furniture and the tworoomed dingy office all that remained of my uncles onceprosperous business which he had left to me in a fit of misplaced optimism for though id passed my law exams id never practised thered been the war and then i had drifted to tanganyika and teaplanting a venture which had turned out badly leaving me virtually broke at the time of his death so that the legacy of that miserable place seemed like the smile of fortune know anything about a mrs thomas i asked andrews as he helped me off with my coat he had drawn the curtains and with the coal fire burning brightly in the grate the place looked almost snug despite the dust and the piles of documents and the black deed boxes littering the floor by the open strong room door its a matter of a small allowance she claims we handle for her mrs thomas is it i had seated myself at the desk and he stood over me tall and slightly stooped the skin stretched taut as vellum across the bones of his long face you know mr grant almost half our clients are named thomas it was part of the game that he must always make the simplest thing appear difficult its one of your old clients i said something i have apparently quite unwittingly inherited from the old man from mister evans you mean that too was part of the game and because his position was privileged i had to humour him all right andrews from old mr evans the firelight flickered on the lined hangdog face bent obsequiously over me hed been with my uncle since before he was articled and had stayed with him right through his long illness until he had died two years ago god knows how old he was his scrawny neck covered by a hard stubble stuck up out of the soiled stiff collar like the flesh of a plucked fowl well what about it i said impatiently i inherited so little in the way of business that it rather narrows the field does the name whitaker ring a bell whitaker his adams apple moved convulsively ah yes of course colonel whitaker a little matter of a settlement it used to come to us quarterly from bahrain in the form of a bankers draft which we cashed and forwarded to an address in grangetown i asked him to get the file but of course there wasnt any file however whilst i was signing the letters he managed to dig up some record of the arrangement it was written on the firms notepaper in my uncles sloped writing and went back to before the war in it charles stanley whitaker undertook to pay to sarah davies the sum of twentyfive pounds quarterly for a period of fifteen years or in the event of his death a lump sum from the estate equivalent to the balance always providing that such sum the clue to what it was all about was contained in the final paragraph which read this settlement to be binding on my heirs and assigns and to be accepted by the said sarah davies in full settlement of any claims real or imagined the signature at the bottom was a barely decipherable scrawl and below it sarah davies had signed her name in a clear schoolgirl hand if you ask me mr grant the colonel got this young lady into trouble the dry snigger with which andrews accompanied this appraisal of the situation annoyed me the young lady as you call her is now an unhappy and rather frightened woman of middle age i told him sharply the son according to this is nineteen and hes only just discovered that hes illegitimate theres a twin sister too not a very amusing situation and whitaker was he still in arabia i wondered do you think the man has any idea hes a son and daughter here in cardiff i couldnt say sir have we got his address the bank in bahrain that was the only address we ever had and bahrain was in the persian gulf but it was over three years since the last payment had come through he might be anywhere now back in england retired probably a pity we havent got his address i said i was thinking that the son must take after his father the beaky nose and strong jaw were both physical characteristics that didnt suit his circumstances this is all weve got on whitaker is it andrews nodded then how the devil do you know hes a colonel theres no mention of colonel in this settlement apparently andrews had seen his rank given in some newspaper story something to do with oil concessions i think there was a picture too with some sheikhs in flowing robes and colonel whitaker in the centre dressed in khaki shorts and a military cap how did you know it was the same man well i couldnt be sure but i dont think there could be two of them out in that area he was probably right there ill ask captain griffiths about him a man who spent his life taking his ship in and out of arabian ports should know and he was due in the office at fivethirty is the conveyance on that property of his ready now andrews produced it from the bottom of the pile a bulky package that looked as though it contained enough deeds to cover a twenty thousand acre estate instead of a little cottage on the gower peninsula theres still a map to be inserted in the conveyance otherwise its all there title deeds searches everything i told him to get on to the man who was doing the map right away griffiths wants all the documents before he sails tonight the phone rang it was mrs thomas and i knew by the tone of her voice that something had happened they came just after you left and im so worried mr grant i dont know what to do and now sue has got back and she said to ring you im very sorry to trouble you when you were so kind and came out here all for nothing but you did say to telephone you if i needed any help and so i thought perhaps just tell me whats happened mrs thomas i said well you see theyve taken dafydd away and her voice broke down then im so terribly worried about him mr grant i dont know whats going to happen so determined he is you see once hes got an idea into his head always been like that he has ever since he was little you know nothing would ever make him change his mind once he had made it up never mind about whats in your sons mind what happened when the police arrived they just said he was to go with them to the police station i dont know for questioning was it they didnt say i asked them why they were arresting him but they wouldnt tell me been in trouble he has you know and them behaving as though did sergeant mathieson say he was arresting him no he didnt say that exactly he just said he was to come along with them but its the same thing mr grant isnt it did he charge him no no i dont think so he just said he was to come along and he went he didnt try to resist or anything they just took him and now i dont know what is going to happen to him mrs thomas i said theres something i want to ask you can you tell me where colonel whitaker is now the quick gasp of her breath and then a long pause no no i dont know but somewhere in arabia it will be hes still alive then oh yes youve heard from him again the pause no no i never heard from him never and she added quickly only the allowance very good he was about the allowance she sighed never a penny i took for myself but spent it on dafydd clever he is you know a quick brain and good with his hands i thought perhaps he would become an engineer her quick tongue ran on about the books shed bought him and how shed sent him to night school and i let her talk because it seemed to help her he couldnt understand it when the money ceased it was then he began to run wild you see down in the docks all the time and his heart set on getting to arabia speaks arabic you know she said it with pride and in the same breath added i tried to discourage him but it was no good he had books you see and all those arabs down in the tiger bay district in the blood it is i suppose in the blood and in their stars and that book of cuttings i should never have let him see it and then she added a pity you werent here when they came for him i know it would never have happened if youd been here well dont worry about it any more i said ill phone them and find out what its all about have you heard how your husband is but shed received no word from the hospital well thats good i said theyd have been in touch with you if they were worried about his condition ill phone you if ive any news about your son i put the phone down first thing tomorrow andrews i said get on to the newspapers and see if theyve anything on their files about whitaker what that boy needs right now is a father the sort of father he can look up to i hurried through the rest of the business and as soon as andrews had gone i phoned dr harveys surgery george grant here i said when he came on the line any news of thomas yes he said and its bad im afraid ive just had a call from the matron he died in the ambulance on the way to hospital i see did the police pick that boy up yes it could well mean a charge of manslaughter has anybody thought of notifying mrs thomas that her husband is dead the matron is telephoning her right away about time too i said incredible how soulless an institution can be but in fact it was the boy i was worrying about more than the mother theyve taken david thomas into custody i said good his comment angered me why did you consider it your duty to notify the police did you know the man was going to die i thought it likely and then after a pause he added he was a bookie you know greyhounds mostly heavy drinker heavy smoker immoderate in everything if you get me that type goes quick but i couldnt be certain of course and he added frankly i wouldnt have expected the boy to stay there till the police arrived id have thought hed clear out probably would have done if you hadnt been there i wasnt there i told him id left before they arrived oh well doesnt make any odds hes no good that boy what makes you think that oddly enough he said on a note of asperity i dont hold with boys hitting their fathers far too much licence allowed this new generation hes a street arab that boy dock arab rather he gave a quick awkward laugh its the war of course but that doesnt excuse them entirely i asked him then to tell me what he knew about the boy but he couldnt tell me much the thomases had only been going to him since the start of the national health service and he hadnt set eyes on the boy more than once or twice hed grown up with the dock gangs he said mixing too much with the arabs had been in and out of a number of jobs and had finally been sentenced for his part in the beating up of a rival gang leader i imagine hes only just been released from borstal he said dockside toughs like that are the devil in my parish and thats why you called the police well he killed his father didnt he his voice sounded on the defensive you dont make much allowance for human nature i said no not with boys like that you try stitching a few flickknife wounds and bicycle chain gashes youd soon see it my way all right i said and left it at that he didnt know thomas wasnt the boys father or what had caused the row between them lifes not all as straightforward as you chaps see it in your clinics i said and put the phone down by then it was fivethirty and captain griffiths had arrived he was a small man with a pointed beard and a high cackling laugh and he wore a tweed suit which was a little too large for him this and his scrawny wrinkled skin gave him a shrivelled look but though he was not an impressive figure long years of command had given him the knack of making his displeasure felt you promised me the documents before i sailed man he thrust his beard at me accusingly dont worry i said youll get them when are you sailing ninethirty on the tide ill bring them down myself that seemed to satisfy him and since he showed an inclination to chat i asked him about whitaker colonel charles stanley whitaker i said do you know him by any chance yes indeed the bedouin thats what they call him out there or the bloody bedouin in the case of those that hate his guts and all his arab affectations thats the whites you know the arabs call him al arif the wise one or haji yes i know colonel whitaker you cant trade in and out of the gulf ports without meeting him periodically hes still out there then oh lord yes a man like that would never be happy retiring to a cottage in the gower his small blue eyes creased with silent laughter hes a moslem you know hes been on the haj to mecca and they say he keeps a harem and when it isnt a harem theres talk of boys but there he shook his head its just gossip if i took account of all the gossip i heard on my ship there wouldnt be anyone with a shred of reputation left too much time you see everybodys got too much time and the damned humidity he gave that highpitched cackling laugh but dear me he went on theres a real character for you you dont find men like whitaker back here in britain not any more oneeyed and a patch and a great beak of a nose that makes him look like a bloody bird of prey and youve met him yes indeed ive had him on board my ship too often and often ive had him on board in all his flowing bedouin robes with the silver of his great curved khanjar knife gleaming at his girdle and the black agal of arabia round the kaffyah that covered his head yes and holding court on my own boat deck with the prayer mats out and his bodyguard all round him armed to the teeth a sort of lawrence i suggested well he sounded doubtful he hasnt quite that standing with the political crowd too much of an arab changing his religion like that it made a difference you see but the oil boys all treat him like god of course or used to but for him the gulfoman oilfields development company wouldnt have had a single concession out there and then there was his theory the whitaker theory they called it he believed that the proved oilbearing country that runs down from iraq through kuwait dahran bahrain and qattar would be found to continue swinging southeast along the line of the jebel mountains through buraimi and into the independent sheikhdom of saraifa well theres no knowing whether a mans right about a thing like that except by prospecting and drilling and there was holmes you see hed had the same sort of beeinhisbonnet about bahrain and hed been proved right and whitaker wasnt i prompted for he had paused his mind engrossed in the past no it cost the company a lot of money and nothing but dry wells for their trouble and now things are changing out there he shook his head sadly theres a new type of man coming to the top of these middle east oil companies technical men who understand oil but not the arab whitaker and the world he represents its doomed you know finished you cant lord it in the deserts of arabia not now with the oil flowing and half the world trying to grab a stake in it and hes the manner of a ruling prince you know he might have been descended from the prophet himself the way he behaved at times it was an extraordinary picture that griffiths had drawn for me when he left to go back to his ship i felt that my drab office was the brighter for the colour his musical tongue had brought into it i put some more coal on the fire and settled down to finish the days work it was about half an hour later that i was interrupted by the sound of the street door bell it startled me for i very seldom have a caller after office hours except by appointment and a glance at my diary confirmed that id no appointment for that evening my visitor proved to be a girl and as she stood there in the driving sleet clutching her bicycle she seemed vaguely familiar she had the sort of face that comes together around the nose and mouth a face that was attractive rather than pretty its composition based on the essential of bone formation she smiled a little nervously a flash of white teeth the bright gleam of pale eyes i remember that it was her eyes that attracted me at the time she was just a kid and she was brimming over with health and vitality mr grant im susan thomas can i speak to you a moment please the words came in a quick rush breathless with hurrying of course i held the door open for her come in may i put my bbike inside there was a natural hesitancy in her voice that was oddly attractive i had one stolen a few weeks back she wheeled it in and as i took her through to my office she said i was so afraid youd have left and i didnt know where you lived in the hard glare of my office lighting i was able to see her clearly the beaky nose the strong jaw they were both there recognizable now but in her these facial characteristics were softened to femininity unlike her brother i could see no resemblance to the mother its about your brother i suppose she nodded shaking the sleet from her blonde hair whilst her long quick fingers loosened the old fawn coat she wore i only just got back from the infirmary mothers beside herself i had great difficulty she hesitated a moment of uncertainty as her clear wide eyes stared and she made up her mind about me she shes reached an odd age if you know what i mean this is just too much for her nineteen years old and she knew everything about life all the hard unpleasant facts are you a nurse i asked her training to be she said it with a touch of pride and then youve got to do something about him mr grant find him stop him from trying to kill his from killing somebody else i stared at her appalled what are you talking about i said she was overdramatizing of course youve heard about your i stopped there uncertain what to call him about mr thomas yes she nodded her face as withdrawn as her brothers had been set and white mother told me the hospital phoned her then about half an hour ago he died in the ambulance they said there was no emotion in her voice but then her lip trembled slightly its david im worried about i was just going down to the police station i said it was an accident of course but theres always the chance that the police may view it differently hes got a bad record you know and they never got an together of course she added i knew he wasnt my rather my real father that is your mother told you did she i was thinking that it was odd she should have told her daughter and not her son oh no she said she never told me but its something you know by instinct sort of then why in heavens name didnt your brother know i said oh well boys are so slow you know and its not something you can just blurt out is it mr grant i mean its something you feel deep inside and its sort of secret and then she said what will he do do you think was he serious when he said hed kill him i wasnt there you see but mother is convinced he meant it kill who i said his my father colonel whitaker he swore hed kill him didnt he thats what mother says you were there did he say that well yes i nodded but i didnt take it very seriously it had all come as a bit of a shock to him besides i added theres not much he can do about it at the moment even if he were serious and by the time hes released hell have had a chance to get used to the idea she stared at me you havent heard then heard what davids escaped escaped so that was why she was here the stupid crazy young fool how do you know hes escaped the police just phoned they said hed escaped from a police car and that it was our duty to inform them if he returned to the house thats why i came to see you mothers almost out of her mind you see it isnt only david shes worrying about its this colonel whitaker my ffather i dont understand after the way he treated her but i think shes still in love with him always has been probably and now she doesnt know what to do for the best she came closer to me then touched my arm in a gesture of entreaty please mr grant youve got to do something youve got to help us im scared to death mother will go to the police and tell them what david said thats what she wanted to do right away she said it was her duty but i knew it wasnt that shes just about out of her mind as a result of what davids done already and he does have a bad record you know so i said id come to you and she promised she wouldnt do anything until i got home and she stood back drained her large eyes staring at me expectantly i didnt know what to say there was nothing i could do no point in my going out and searching the city for him a filthy night like this the whole police force would have their work cut out to track him down where was it he escaped somewhere along the cowbridge road they said and your father have you any idea how i can get in touch with him her eyes brightened for a moment oh if you could but then she shook her head ive no idea where he is now mother doesnt know did she show you the book of press cuttings no no of course not it was still lying there on the floor the place was an awful mess and then she said i checked myself because i had the same idea but the last jutting she got was three years ago i dont know whether hes been in the papers since then dad found out or maybe he knew all the time anyway he made her stop them that last cutting was a picture taken in basra but he may have retired by now he was getting on over fifty and if hes retired then hed probably be in england somewhere wouldnt he thats what all these people whove lived all their lives abroad do when they retire do you think perhaps david knows where he is no i said he tried to get the address out of me no point in telling her that he might have the same idea that i had and try to check the newspaper files in any case i told her hell have his work cut out to elude the police i think you can set your mothers mind at rest the police will pick him up and and time will do the rest your mother can see him in prison talk to him in no time at all hell have accepted the situation she thought that over for a moment and then nodded yes that makes sense and then she said do you think thats why he escaped i mean did he really want to kill colonel whitaker do you think his own father at the moment perhaps there was no telling what the boy had in his mind he might simply have been jealous of his mothers affection for an old love but i couldnt tell her that in my opinion it was the shock i said a perfectly natural reaction when hes had time to think it over get used to the idea but why did he escape hes never done that before hes been arrested twice you see but he never tried to escape and when i didnt say anything she gave a little shrug oh well itll all come out in the wash i expect she smiled briefly but the smile didnt extend to her eyes which were sad and suddenly without lustre it was silly of me to come really she started for the door hugging her coat round her i should have known there was nothing you could do its mother im worried about davids in enough trouble she moved her shoulders as though bracing herself i think perhaps ill go and see dr harvey maybe hed give her a sedative something to make her sleep so she doesnt keep going over it in her mind and getting silly ideas in her head she turned and held out her hand goodbye mr grant and thank you i feel a bit better now anyway i took her back through the empty office to the street door and as she wheeled her bicycle out she asked me to telephone her if i had any news during the day you can always get me at the infirmary if its important id rather you didnt phone my mother promise of course i said shortly after shed gone andrews came in with the map by the time i had dealt with the conveyance and finished my other work it was almost seventhirty time enough to call in at the police station on my way down to the docks what the boy needed was to be given some purpose in life i was thinking about this as i pulled on my coat wondering at the chance of birth how some people are born to parents happily married and others my own childhood hadnt been all that happy i shrugged my shoulders life was a battle anyway sex money happiness it was all a struggle like trying to build up this decrepit business it took all the guts all the energy youd got sometimes just to make some sense out of life and when things didnt work out i set the guard carefully in front of the dying fire feeling sorry for the boy sorry for myself i suppose i was tired it had been a frustrating week and now it was friday and the weekend stretching ahead i was feeling the need of a drink there was a pub i went to sometimes in the dock area a rowdy place but virile and full of masculinity and talk of far places a seamans pub that always gave me the illusion of islands just beyond the horizon with a few scotches imagination could soar leaping the tawdry problems of money and piddling lawyers briefs i went out closing the door of my office behind me following the white beam of my torch through the empty outer office with its clumsy mahogany counter and frosted glass panels i had reached the street door and my hand was on the latch when i remembered the package for captain griffiths i had left it propped up on the mantelpiece so that i wouldnt forget it i went back to my office my footsteps sounding hollow on the bare boards hed never forgive me if i let him sail without his dream of the future all set down in the mumbojumbo of legal phraseology a man needed a dream something to aim at you couldnt go through life without a goal for him it was retirement and that little whitewashed cottage looking out over the sweep of rhosilli bay for me it was just a solicitors office with new paint new furniture and clients tumbling over each other for my services my hand reached out for the handle of the door and then suddenly there was the tinkle of glass falling the sound came from beyond the door startlingly loud in the empty stillness i switched off my torch and eased the door open a fraction every nerve in my body tensed and expectant i heard the scrape of the window latch the scrabble of boots on the sill the rustle of the curtains as they were pushed aside a burglar but nobody but a fool would expect to find cash lying around loose in a solicitors office perhaps he was after some particular document but i could think of nothing i was handling at the moment sufficiently important to warrant breaking and entering i heard him stumble against my chair and then i could hear his heavy breathing coming nearer as he crossed the room to the door i guessed hed be making for the light switch and i flung the door wide and at the same time switched on my torch again david thomas stood there checked in the white beam of it his fair hair was plastered down by the rain his face was streaked with blood from a gash on his forehead the left cheek bruised and filthy with mud there was mud on his clothes too black wet patches of it that clung to the sodden cloth his jacket was ripped at the shoulder and one trouser leg was torn so badly that the flesh of his leg showed through the rent he was breathing heavily as though hed been running what the hell are you doing here i said and switched on the light his face was ghastly white his eyes unnaturally wide he looked scared out of his wits well i dont expect theyll think of looking for you in my office i closed the door and walked past him and put the curtain straight then i took the guard from the fire and put some more coal on poking it till a flame showed and all the time i was conscious of him standing there watching me in silence too surprised too scared probably to move i pushed the old armchair reserved for clients close to the hearth all right i said take your jacket off and come and sit by the fire and dry yourself out he did as i told him too startled to have any initiative of his own left now i said just tell me what in gods name made you do such a damnfool thing for a moment i thought he was going to close up on me the way that sort of kid does when things go wrong and people start asking questions the sullen toughboy look had come back into his face take your time i said theres no hurry youve got all evening if you want it i thought id try flattery then not many chaps manage to get away from the police so soon after being taken in charge how did you do it the tight lips relaxed slightly a ghost of a smile luck he said he was shivering and i poked the fire again coaxing it into a blaze theyd got a car to take me to one of their bloody jails said id feel more at home in the nick his tone was a sneer and you made a break for it yeah thats right there was only one of them in the back with me and i made a dive for it when they were driving down the cowbridge road i hit the pavement and just about knocked myself out they nearly had me then but there was a pub i knew and i dived in there and got away out the back and he added i said id see you in your office there was a touch of bravado in the way he said it your sister was here a little while back i told him sue what did she want he was on the defensive immediately wanted me to help you help me he gave a derisive laugh the only way you can help me is by giving me that address thats what i came for your mothers worried sick i told him so what i lost patience with him then cant you get it into your thick head that your actions affect other people stop being so damned irresponsible the police phoned your mother that youd escaped and now shes half out of her mind but he wasnt interested in the heartbreak he was causing other people she should have thought of that before she wrote me that letter he said she was half out of her mind then did sue tell you id two more months to do in a borstal institute no well i had two more months and id have been out and in the clear and then i got this letter threatening shes going to commit suicide your das driving me to it she said and i cant stand it any more and then to come home and find shes been holding out on me all the time kidding me i was that drunken old fools son christ and you talk about being irresponsible it isnt an easy thing for a woman to tell her son shed nineteen years in nineteen years she ought to have been able to screw up her courage instead she drives the old man to fling it in my face he stared at the fire his shoulders hunched his face bitter does sue know he asked at length does she know shes illegitimate yes and what does she feel about it she said shed known for a long time deep down then why the hell didnt she tell me said deep down her mother didnt tell her she just knew he looked sulky then we never kept anything from each other before its not the sort of thing you want to share with anybody else i said too right it isnt he suddenly beat his fist against the arm of the chair christ if id only known before it wouldnt have helped you i told him he thought about that for a moment and then he nodded no i guess youre right and he added i always wondered why the old man hated my guts he leaned suddenly forward picked up the poker and jabbed at the fire guess i hated his guts too he said viciously well hes dead now i said did you know that he nodded and let go of the poker so that it clattered into the grate yep they told me that croaked on the way to hospital blast him his attitude to the mans death shocked me for gods sake i said havent you any compassion for the man who was a father to you he wasnt my father he cried i told you that before he was your father in the eyes of the law i then the law ought to be changed oughtnt it you cant make chalk cheese by a legal declaration he supported you all the time you were growing up i reminded him all right he supported me but he hated me all the same i always knew that when he took a strap to me he enjoyed it he hasnt been able to do that for a long time now but hed other ways of getting at me jeering at me because i read a lot and at my arab friends do you know what hed done whilst id been in borstal i went up to my old room after youd left all my books on arabia every damn one of them hed pulled out and torn to pieces the only books he hadnt destroyed were the technical ones id a lot of them on oil geology seismology geophysics he left me those because he didnt think i cared about them he stared at me now hes dead and im glad glad do you hear his voice had risen and suddenly the tears were welling up into his eyes and he began to cry i didnt mean to kill him he sobbed honest i didnt mean to he broke down completely then sobbing like a child and i went over to him and gripped his shoulder it was an accident i said trying to steady him they dont believe it did they prefer a charge no but they think i killed him i know they do and he burst out i havent a chance with them you certainly havent made it any better by making a break for it like that i was wondering whether i could persuade him to come back with me to the police station and give himself up i hesitated and then walked over to the phone but he was on his feet immediately what you going to do ring the police there was panic in his voice no i said im going to ring your home get your mother down here your sister too what for what goodll that do if your mother makes a statement explaining exactly how it happened its no good he said she wouldnt do it shed rather have me hanged oh dont be childish i said its true he cried she told me so herself after youd gone he followed me to the desk and his voice was intense very serious she thinks im going to kill whitaker if i ever lay my hands on him and she loves him after all these years she still loves the man i dont understand it but thats how it is youd think after the swine had treated her like that after hed left her flat he pulled a bloodstained handkerchief from his pocket and blew his nose when i got back this afternoon the old man was giving her hell i could hear it out in the street he was calling her all sorts of names i suppose he was drunker than usual he had that book of presscuttings in his hand and when i told him to shut his mouth he taunted me with being a bastard said hed had all he could stand of another mans whelps and then he turned on my mother and added and all i can stand of another mans whore after all ive done to cover up for you he said you creep off as soon as im out of the house to mope over your lovers pictures and he flung the book at her thats when i went for him he paused staring at me his eyes overbright that book was full of presscuttings of him pictures some of them ive grown up with that book grown up with the man himself i know him know his way of life everything about him its like i told you he was a sort of god to me i wanted to be like him tough independent an adventurer in far places i tried to get a job as a seaman on ships going out that way from cardiff docks but at first i was too young and then there was the union i even tried to stow away once and now i find hes no more than a rotten dirty little sham whod leave a woman to bear her twins alone i told ma id kill him if i ever laid hands on him remember you were there when i said it i nodded well she believed me shes convinced i really will kill him if i ever catch up with him and you didnt mean what you said is that what youre trying to tell me he walked back to the fire and stood staring at it for a moment then he slumped down in the chair again his body limp dont know he murmured honest i dont know all i do know is that i have to find him and thats why you came here to search my office for his address he nodded i knew youd have it somewhere in your riles well i havent i hesitated but after all the boy had a right to know where his father was will you promise me something will you promise me that if you find him youll remember that hes your father and that blood is something you just cant rub out with violence he looked at me and was silent a long time at length he said i cant promise anything i dont know how id act he was being honest at least but ill try to remember what youve just said and then on a sudden urgent note ive got to find him ive just got to find him please please try to understand the need of that kid it was the thing that had been lacking for him all his life it was his mothers need reflected and enlarged the sins of the fathers why in gods name should a sense of insecurity lead to violence in people and in races all right i said i accept that and i passed on to him what griffiths had told me but then you know the sort of man your father is anyway there it is hes still out there and if you want to contact him i imagine a letter to the gulfoman oilfields development company a letters no good i wrote him already twice he never answered he looked up at me this captain griffiths is his ship the emerald isle she sails regularly to the persian gulf and when i nodded he said that was the ship i tried to stow away on i was fourteen then and a year later i tried to sign on shes in port now is she yes when is she sailing tonight tonight he looked up at me suddenly eager like a dog being offered a walk tonight when what time he had jumped to his feet all the tiredness falling from him for christsake what time i hesitated it was no part of a lawyers job to get involved in a criminal case my duty was plain the sensible thing would be for you to give yourself up to the police he didnt hear me his eyes had fastened on the envelope i had left propped up on the mantelpiece were you taking this down to the ship tonight i nodded and his hand reached out for the envelope clutched at it ill deliver it for you he held it as though it were a talisman his eyes bright with the chance it represented thats all i need the excuse to go on board and they wouldnt catch me this time not till we were at sea he glanced at the window balanced on the balls of his feet as though about to take off the way he had come but then i supposed he realized i should only phone the police will you let me take it his voice was urgent his eyes pleading once on board the emerald isle please sir that sir was a measure of his desperation please he said again its the only hope i got he was probably right at that and if i didnt let him take it what other chance would he ever get in life hed escaped from borstal hed escaped from the police with that sort of record hed be lucky to get away with three years for manslaughter after that hed be casehardened a criminal for life and there was the sister too a nice girl that i sighed im supposed to be a lawyer i reminded him or maybe i was reminding myself not a travel agency for boys whove escaped from the police but youll let me deliver it wont you what the hell can you do when faced with youth in all its shining innocence and eagerness all right i said you can try it if you like but god knows what griffiths will do all i want is the chance to meet up with my father i realized then that his mind had leapfrogged all the obstacles he was already mentally sailing the coast of arabia in search of his father all im giving you i warned him is the excuse to get on board that ship she sails at ninethirty and those documents have got to be delivered into captain griffithss hands understand ill give them to him i promise you know your way about the ship i knew every corner of her once itll come back to me as soon as i get on board well kindly remember that im a solicitor when youre caught as you will be eventually dont implicate me shall we say you walked into my office to get legal advice saw the envelope i had forgotten and took it on the spur of the moment is that understood yes sir ill take you down to bute east dock now i said after that youre on your own i hesitated it wasnt much of a chance i was giving him hed no clothes other than what he stood up in no money probably nothing not even a passport but at least id have done what i could for him what id have hoped somebody would do for a son of mine if hed got himself into a mess like this but then i hadnt a son i hadnt anybody better clean the blood off your face i said and showed him where the wash place was and youll need something to hide your torn clothes i left him in the lavatory and went through the office to the cupboard under the stairs there was an old overcoat that had been there ever since id taken over the place a black hat too he tried them on when hed finished cleaning himself up the coat wasnt too bad a fit and with the sweatband padded with strips from an old conveyance the hat was passable i wondered what my uncle would have said if he knew to what use these sartorial relics of his were being put and because i wanted him to realize how slender his chances were i said if youre caught before the ship sails dont try and bluff it out with captain griffiths tell him the truth and say you want to give yourself up to the police he nodded his face bloodless his pale eyes almost fever bright with the nervous tension that was building up in him the dark coat and the black hat accentuated his pallor accentuated too his beaky nose and the strong jaw in the old lawyers castoff clothes he looked much older than his nineteen years there was a back way out of the office and i took him out by that it was still sleeting and there was nobody in the street where i parked my car we drove in silence down park place and across castle street and then we crossed the railway and were in a maze of little streets that edge the docks i slowed in a dark gap between street lights and told him to climb into the back and lie on the floor with the rug i kept for my dog pulled over him it was fortunate that i took this precaution for the police at the dock entrance had been alerted and there was a constable there who recognized me a fortnight before he had given evidence in a case id defended i told him my business and he let me through i hadnt expected the police to be watching the docks already and my hands were sweating as i drove on across the slippery steel of the railway tracks the emerald isle was at the far end of the bute east dock close to the lock she had completed loading and she had steam up smoke trailing from her single stack the cranes along the quay were still their gaunt steel fingers pointed at the night i stopped in the shadow of one of the sheds the sleet had turned to snow and it was beginning to lie so that the dock looked ghostly white in the ships lights well there you are i said thats the ship he scrambled out from under the rug couldnt you come with me he asked suddenly scared now that the moment had arrived if you were to have a word with captain griffiths i didnt reply to that but simply handed him the package i knew he knew it was out of the question for he didnt ask me again a moment later the rear door opened and i heard him get out i id like to thank you he stammered whatever happens i wont let you down good luck i said thanks and then he was walking across the dock not hesitantly but with a firm purposeful tread i watched him mount the gangway saw him pause and speak to one of the crew an arab and then he disappeared from sight through a door in the bridge deck i lit a cigarette and sat there wondering what would happen now i didnt think hed much of a chance but you never know he was a resourceful kid i finished my cigarette and lit another i was thinking about the constable on the gate i ought to have realized that that would have been one of the first things theyd do following his escape and the man had recognized me i tried to analyse my motives in doing such a crazy thing but i couldnt sort it out the cold crept into the car as i waited and still nothing happened except that the snow thickened and the dock turned dazzling white a tug hooted out in the river a lost owl sound in the winter night it was twenty minutes past nine ten minutes later a whistle sounded from somewhere high up on the emerald isle and two men came quickly out of a hut at the end of the dock they manhandled the gangway ashore and then stood by the warps another whistle and the forard warp went slack fell with a splash into the dock black smoke belched from the funnel and as the stern warp was let go a gap opened up between the ships side and the quay i switched the engine on then turned the heater up and sat there smoking as the emerald isle locked out into the river taff and when her lights had finally disappeared behind the whitened shoulders of the loading sheds i drove back to the solitude of my flat hoping to god id done the right thing the story of what happened to him after that i got partly from captain griffiths on his return and partly from a letter david wrote me when he left me on the dock there and went on board the emerald isle there was no clearcut plan in his mind he knew the layout of course she was the only ship trading regularly out of cardiff to arabian ports and she had exercised a fatal fascination for him since he was old enough to wander in the docks it was the somali steward and not a deck hand who met him at the top of the gangway and on the spur of the moment almost without thinking he inquired whether the passenger accommodation was fully booked the steward told him no there were six cabins and only three were occupied feeling suddenly more confident he asked to see the captain captain griffiths was in his cabin on the port side of the bridge deck housing and when david was shown in he was seated at his desk checking the mates trim figures he took the packet glanced at it and then looked up at david you work for mr grant do you i i run errands for him office boy eh well youre only just in time we sail in quarter of an hour griffiths peered up at him from under his bushy brows whats the matter with your face boy been in a fight no no sir i i had a fall must have been a bad one youre as white as a sheet he bent down pulled open a drawer of his desk and came up with a bottle of whisky ill give you a drink for your pains he gave that highpitched cackling laugh filled the glasses half full and handed one of them to david well young fellow you can wish me luck for its a welsh landowner i am now and he slapped the packet of documents with unconcealed pride theres times you know he confided as he swallowed his drink when i feel like the wandering jew himself doomed to ply from one siltladen port to another right through to eternity this and his hand touched the packet again this may help me to preserve my sanity when the temperatures in the hundreds and the humiditys so thick your lungs feel as though theyre stuffed full of wet cotton wool and will never breathe clean air again when conditions are like that then ill take these documents out and read them through just to convince myself that i really do have a little place on the gower peninsula where rain washes the air clean of dust and heat and the damned godforsaken everlasting flies thats the persian gulf youll be referring to isnt it then maybe youll know where colonel whitaker lives now he hadnt intended to ask that question but the unaccustomed liquor had overlaid his nervousness griffiths glanced up at him quickly funny thing he murmured grant asked me that same question only this afternoon is colonel whitaker one of the firms clients i i dont know sir then what made you ask about him david hesitated but if he were to succeed in stowing away on board there was no harm in telling captain griffiths the truth right now hes my father your father the blue eyes stared good god didnt know the bedouin was married my natural father sir griffiths eyes suddenly crinkled at the corners natural father you say well by god thats a good one and he lay back in his swivel chair pointed his beard at the steel deck above and cackled with laughter and then he stopped suddenly im sorry boy youre sensitive about it i can see have you ever met your father no sir well if you had youd know why i laughed bedouin sons and daughters theres gossip enough about him but never a whisper of a son in wales you see ill tell him next time hes aboard ill say to him casually but david was spared the rest for the bridge communicator buzzed and a voice said tug coming alongside now sir very good mr evans griffiths got to his feet im needed on the bridge he paused in front of david staring up at his face yes i can see the likeness now any messages you want to give him and when david shook his head dumbly he patted him on the arm well ill tell him i saw you when next he comes aboard and now youd better get off the ship quick or youll find yourself in arabia with a deal of explaining to do and he went off cackling with laughter to the bridge above david found himself standing alone outside the captains cabin an alleyway ran athwartships numbered mahogany doors led of fit on either side he listened every nerve taut he could hear voices on the bridge and down below in the saloon but the deck on which he stood seemed utterly deserted treading softly he walked the length of the alleyway to the starbd side as far away from the captains cabin as possible the first door he tried was locked the second opened to a glimpse of heavilylabelled baggage and the startled face of a man lying prone on his bunk with a book a tug blared so close alongside that he jumped cabin number four was empty and he slipped inside and locked the door and after that he stood for a long time quite still and breathing heavily listening to the sounds of the ship waiting tense for the sudden outcry that would inevitably follow the discovery that he had not gone ashore that period of waiting ten minutes at the most seemed the longest he had ever known and then a whistle sounded it was so like the shrill of a police whistle that he reached for the handle of the door instinctively seeking escape in movement but then the engineroom telegraph rang from the bridge overhead and the ship suddenly came to life a gentle throbbing against the soles of his shoes he knelt on the unmade bunk then and cautiously pulled back the curtain that covered the porthole he could see the deck rail and beyond it a flat expanse of water with the snow driving across it and then the water was swirling to the bite of the screws and he knew the ship was moving he took off his hat and coat then and lay down on the bunk under a ships blanket listening with his ears attuned to every sound a gong sounded for the evening meal and there was movement in the next cabin the gush of a tap the bang of a suitcase the shrill of the whistle on the bridge was answered a moment later by the tugs farewell blast on her siren the beat of the engines increased and later after they had slowed to drop the pilot the ship began to roll he slept during the night rolled from side to side of the narrow bunk but when daylight came he lay awake tense and hungry footsteps sounded in the alleyway cabin doors slammed somewhere a loose porthole cover rattled back and forth the hours of daylight seemed endless but nobody came nobody even tried the handle of the cabin door it was as though he didnt exist and perversely he felt deserted lost forgotten in this strange world hed been thrust into by events he had no watch so that hed no idea of the time the sky was grey with a low wrack of cloud no sun the violence of the movement was exhausting and towards nightfall he was sick retching emptily into the washbasin nobody seemed to hear the sound of his misery nobody seemed to care the seas thudding against the bows of the ship made her tremble so that everything rattled and each time she buried her bows the noise of the impact was followed by a long shuddering movement that seemed to run through his tired body as though he were himself being exposed to the onslaught of the gale night followed the day at last and he slept and then it was day again darkness and light succeeding each other he lost count of the days and when the sun came out and the sea subsided he knew he was too weak to hold out alone in that cabin any longer the moment had come to face the future just above his head within easy reach of his left hand was a bell push he lay half a day staring at the yellow bone button imbedded in its wooden orifice before he could summon the courage to press it and when the steward came he told the startled somali to take him to the captain griffiths was seated at his desk so that to davids bemused mind it seemed like that first time hed met him except that now the cabin was full of sunlight and they were off the coast of portugal the somali was explaining excitedly and griffithss small blue eyes were staring up at him the captain silenced the man with a movement of his hand all right ishmail you can leave us now and as the steward turned to go his eyes rolling in his head griffiths added and see you dont talk about this the passengers are not to know that a stowaway has been hiding in their accommodation and when the door closed and they were alone he turned to david now young man perhaps youd explain why the devil you stowed away on my ship david hesitated it was difficult to know where to begin though hed had four days of solitude to think about it he was scared too the little man in the worn blue jacket with the gold braid on the sleeves was more frightening to him than either of the judges who had sentenced him for his future was in his hands well come on man come on the beard waggled impatiently the blue eyes bored into him i would like to think that he remembered my advice then but more probably he was too weak and confused to invent a satisfactory story at any rate he told it straight from the receipt of his mothers hysterical letter and his escape from borstal right through to the tragedy of his return to the house in everdale road and griffiths listened without comment except that halfway through he took pity on davids weakness for he was leaning on the edge of the desk to support himself and told him to pull up a chair and sit down and when finally hewas asked to account for his possession of the documents that had been his excuse for boarding the ship he stuck to the explanation wed agreed but griffiths was much too sharp for him so you took the packet from mr grants office and decided to deliver it yourself yes sir you say you found the door of mr grants office open that means hed only gone out for a moment when he came back and found the packet gone the natural thing would be for him to come down to the ship and give me some explanation youre lying you see there was nothing he could do then but tell captain griffiths the truth and the blue eyes staring into his began to crease at the corners by the time he had finished griffiths was leaning back in the swivel chair and roaring with laughter his mouth so wide open that david could see the movement of his uvula in the red hollow of his gullet well ill be damned griffiths said wiping his eyes and grant an accessory and then he started in on a crossexamination that seemed to go on and on finally he got up and stood for a long time staring out of the porthole at the sunlight dancing on the waves made by the ships passage through the water whilst david sat there numbed and hopeless well i believe you griffiths said still staring out to the sea you could never have made all that up there was a long silence you got grant to help you and how you did that i dont know considering hed never met your father he was risking his reputation everything youve no passport of course that means you cant land in the normal way and youve never had word from your father which means he doesnt care to acknowledge your existence right and when david didnt say anything griffiths swung round from the porthole his beard thrust aggressively forward and you stow away on my ship expecting me to get you into arabia how the devil do you think im going to do that eh i dont know sir perhaps grant suggested something but david shook his head unhappily and griffiths snapped a lawyer he should have had more sense and he stumped across the cabin and stood peering down at davids face is your father going to acknowledge you now do you think how old are you nineteen and do you think colonel whitakers going to be pleased to have a bastard he sired nineteen twenty years ago suddenly turn up with no passport nothing and a jailbird at that david got to his feet then im sorry captain griffiths he said stiffly i didnt realize the words didnt come easily and his mouth felt dry and caked ive always dreamed of this you see of getting out to arabia i suppose its in my bastard blood he said it with bitterness for he was convinced now that the world was against him as it always had been as it always would be ill work my passage he added wearily and when we get to aden you can hand me over to the authorities griffiths nodded thats the first sensible suggestion youve made and its exactly what i ought to do he had turned away and stood for a moment lost in thought your father did me a good turn once i owe him something for that but the question is would i be doing him a good turn he gave a quick shrug and subsided into his chair chuckling to himself it has its humorous side you know and david watched fascinated and with a sudden feeling of intense excitement as griffithss hand reached out to the bridge communicator mr evans come down to my cabin for a moment will you and then looking at david well now for the sake of mr grant whom i wouldnt have suspected of such lawlessness and for the sake of your i father whos going to get the shock of his life im going to sign you on as a deck hand but understand this he added any trouble at aden and i hand you over to the authorities david was too relieved too dazed to speak the mate came in and griffiths said stowaway for you mr evans have the galley give him some food and then put him to work im signing him on and see the passengers at any rate dont know how he came aboard his name is whitaker david caught the glint of humour in the blue eyes thank you sir he mumbled but as he turned away all he could think about was that name spoken aloud for the first time whitaker somehow it seemed to fit as though it had always belonged to him it was a symbol too a declaration that the past was gone the future ahead all down the mediterranean and through the suez canal the life of the ship the suns increasing warmth the sight of places all dreamed about and now suddenly come to life absorbed him completely each day bringing the promise of arabia twentyfour steaming hours nearer but when they entered the red sea with the water flat like a mirror and the desert hills of the hejaz shimmering to port he knew they were getting close to aden and at aden the police might be waiting for him it was night when the anchor was let go off steamer point and as he stood on the foredeck directing a stream of water on to the hawsehole he could see the lights of crater and the black shape of the volcanic hills behind towering against the stars his first arabian port it touched his nostrils with a breath of sunhot oil waste but instead of excitement all he felt was fear customs and immigration came aboard he stood by the rail in the shadow of one of the boats and watched them climb the side from a launch his work was done and hed nothing to think about now but the possibility of arrest a subdued murmur came to him from the town strange arab cries drifting across the water another launch glided to the ships side the agent this time and later two of the passengers were climbing down into it followed by their baggage the officials were leaving too and he watched the launches curve away from the ship two ghostly arrowtips puttering into the night he breathed gently again savouring the warm strangescented air and then the steward called his name captain want you in cabin slowly he went forard to the bridge deck housing captain griffiths was seated in the leather armchair his face a little flushed his eyes bright a tumbler of whisky at his elbow well young fellow it appears that youre in the clear nobody is in the least bit interested in you here and he added doubtless you have mr grant to thank for that im sorry i cant send him a message the man must be half out of his mind considering the chance he took ill write to him as soon as i can david murmured the captain nodded time enough for that when youre safely ashore but its only fair to tell you that if i fail to contact your father then youll complete the voyage and be paid off at cardiff and having delivered this warning he went on ill be going ashore in the morning and ill cable colonel whitaker care of godco thats the gulfoman oilfields development company it may reach him it may not depends where your father is you see hes not an easy man to contact meantime i am instructing mr evans to give you work that will keep you out of sight of the passengers we have two oil men with us on the voyage up the coast also an official from the prpgs office thats the political resident persian gulf see to it that you keep out of their way if you do get ashore then i dont want anybody saying afterwards that they saw you on board my ship and with that david found himself dismissed he saw captain griffiths go ashore next morning in the agents launch all day they were working cargo the winches clattering as they unloaded no hold into the lighter dhows alongside and filled it again with a fresh cargo in the evening four passengers came aboard all white and a dhowload of arabs bound for mukalla who strewed themselves and their belongings about the deck and then the anchor was hauled up and they shifted to the bunkering wharf the emerald isle sailed at midnight steaming eastnortheast along the southern coast of arabia the coast of myrrh and frankincense of mocha coffee and shebas queen it was a voyage to thrill the heart of any youngster but david saw little of it for he was confined to the bowels of the ship chipping and painting and all he saw of mukalla that gateway to the hadhramaut was a glimpse through a scuttle a huddle of terraced arab houses so white in the sunlight that it looked like an ivory chess set laid out at the root of the arid mountains only at night was he allowed on deck and he spent hours motionless in the bows of the ship drinking in the beauty and the mystery of the arabian sea for the water was alive with phosphorescence from his vantage point he could look down at the bow wave at the water rushing away from the ship in two great swathes is bright as moonlight and ahead in the inky blackness of the sea great whorls of light like nebulae were shattered into a thousand phosphorescent fragments as the ships massage broke up the shoals of fish and like outriders the sharks flashed torpedotracks of light as they ploughed their voracious way through the depths and every now and then a tanker passed them decks almost awash with oil from kuwait bahrain and dahran they passed inside the kuria muria islands at night and to get a better view of them he ignored his orders and crept up to the boat deck he was standing there close beside one of the boats when the door of the passenger accommodation opened and two figures emerged momentarily outlined against the yellow light they came aft two voices talking earnestly as he shrank into the shadow of the boat bending down as though to adjust the falls the last time i was at the bahrain office but even in abu dhabi weve heard rumours the accent was north country well thats the situation thought id warn you wouldnt like you to back the wrong horse and find yourself out on your ear just because you didnt know what was going on aye well thanks but the great gorde it takes a bit of getting used to you must admit hes been the company out here for so long i wouldnt know about that old man im new out here and as far as im concerned erkhard is the man the voices were no more than a whisper in the night the two oilmen were leaning over the rail at the other end of the boat and david was just going to creep away when he heard the name of his father mentioned is it true colonel whitakers the cause of the trouble thats the rumour he froze into immobility listening fascinated as the other man gave a short laugh well yes in a way the bloody bedouins got too big for his boots and that theory of his a lot of damned nonsense hes not thinking of the company only of his arab friends oh i dont know the company owes him a lot concessions yes and a string of dry wells the mans a dangerous amateur im warning you entwhistle you talk like that when erkhard visits you at abu dhabi and youll be out so damn quick its gorde i deal with okay but you can take my word for it that itll be erkhard who does the next tour of inspection of the development sites and unless youve got something to show him the voices faded as the two men moved away walking slowly and in step back towards the deck housing david moved quickly slipping down the ladder to the main deck back to his position in the bows he wanted to be alone for that brief overheard conversation had given him a strange glimpse of the world on which he had set his heart the ship stopped at nasira island with stores for the raf and then on again rounding ras al hadd at night and ploughing northwest into the gulf of oman on the afternoon of the seventh day out from aden she anchored at muscat in a cove so narrow and rocky that david could scarcely believe his eyes it might have been the pembrokeshire coast of wales except that it was a white sundrenched arab town that stood close by the waters edge at the head of the inlet on the other side the rocks bore the name of visiting ships with dates going back to the s all painted in foothigh letters long doubleended boats of palm wood their broad planks sewn together with thongs swarmed round the ship paddled by arabs whose faces shone black in the sun they were there twentyfour hours and in the night david thought more than once of diving over the side the shore was so near but once ashore what hope had he there was nowhere for him to go in a halting conversation with one of the crew a coast arab from a fishing village to the north called khor al fakhan he learned that muscat was backed by volcanic mountains of indescribable brutality they were almost fifty miles deep with every route through guarded by watch towers and beyond the mountains was the desert of the rub al khali the empty quarter he knew it was hopeless and so he stayed on board and the next afternoon they sailed he was having his evening meal when he was told to report to the bridge captain griffiths was there seated on his wooden stool staring out over the bows to the starlit sea ahead the only other man on the bridge was the arab helmsman standing immobile his eyes fixed on the lit compass card in its binnacles only his hands moving as he made small adjustments to the wheel ah there you are griffiths had turned his head when i went ashore at muscat last night there was a slave from saraifa waiting for me with a message from your father youll doubtless be relieved to know that hes willing to take you off my hands and as david mumbled his thanks the lips smiled behind the beard i may say im just as relieved as you are and he added brusquely theres an arab sambuq waiting now off ras alkhaima to pick you up tonight we shall pass through the straits of hormuz into the persian gulf with luck we should sight the sambuq about an hour after dawn now you speak arabic im told a little david admitted but its not easy to make myself understood its the different dialects i think well do you think you can pass yourself off as an arab and without waiting for a reply griffiths added its the passengers you see theyll talk if they see a white member of my crew being put aboard a dhow a few words of briefing and then the captains hand gripped his arm good luck now man and a word of advice before you go tread warily its no ordinary man youve got for a father indeed it isnt hes the devil of a temper when hes roused so go easy and watch your step and with that he dismissed him and turned again in his seat to stare through the glass at the lights of a ship coming up over the dark horizon david left the bridge dazed and almost reluctant for now the future was upon him unknown a little frightening at dawn he would leave the ship and the companionship of the men hed lived with for the past few weeks and that last link with the home hed known all his life would steam away leaving him alone in a strange country amongst strange people it surprised him that he felt no excitement no exhilaration only loneliness and a sense of desolation he didnt know it then but it was in this moment that he said goodbye to his boyhood the mate found him sitting on his bunk staring vacantly into space here you are whitaker and he tossed a bundle of clothing down beside him ali mahommed sold them to me kaffyah agal robe sandals the lot even to an old brass khanjar knife three pounds ten and ive deducted it from your pay he placed some east african notes and some silver on top of the clothes the old man told you what to do did he okay so long as you greet the naukhuda with a salaam alaikum and a few more words of arabic and get along to the paintshop and put some stain on your face and hands your face is about as pink as a white babys bottom dressing up as an arab for the first time in his life helped to pass the time but still the long hours of the night stretched ahead he lay awake a long time thinking about what the morrow would bring and about the man he hadnt known was his father till that tragic day and then suddenly it was light and almost immediately it seemed one of the arab crew came down to tell him the sambuq had been sighted he listened then waiting tense and expectant and then the pulse of the engines slowed and finally died away this was it the moment of irrevocable departure his hand touched the brass hilt of the great curved flatbladed knife at his girdle he checked the kaffyah made certain that the black agal was in its place circling his head he went quickly up to the after welldeck and waited in the shelter of the main deck ladder the rope ladder was over the side opposite no hatch one of the crew waiting there to help him over the faint chug of a diesel sounded in the still morning air coming slowly nearer he heard the bump of the dhow as it came alongside the guttural cry of arab voices and then the man by the ladder was beckoning him he went out quickly with his head down hidden by his kaffyah a darkskinned hand caught his arm steadied him as he went over the bulwarks glancing quickly up he caught a glimpse of the captain leaning with his elbows on the rail of the bridge wing and below on the boat deck a short tubby man in a pale dressinggown standing watching and after that he could see nothing but the ships rusty side hands reached up caught him as he jumped to the worn wood deck of the dhow he called out a greeting in arabic as he had been told and at the same moment he heard the distant clang of the engineroom telegraph the beat of the emerald isles engines increased and the hull plates began to slide past a gap opening between himself and the ship he turned away to hide his face and found himself on a longprowed craft built of battered wood worn smooth by the years and bleached almost white by the torrid heat of the persian gulf a single patched sail curved above it like the dirty wing of a goose hanging dead in the airless morning the sea around was still as a mirror and white like molten glass and then the swirl of the ships screws shattered it there were three men on the sambuq and only the naukhuda or captain wore a turban as well as a loin cloth he was an old man with a wisp of grey moustache and a few grey hairs on his chin which he stroked constantly the crew was composed of a smoothfaced boy with a withered arm and a big barrelchested man black as a negro with a satin skin that rippled with every movement the naukhuda took his hand in his and held it for a long time whilst the other two crowded close staring at his face feeling his clothes six brown eyes gazing at him full of curiosity a flood of questions the old man using the deferential sahib legacy of india whenever he said anything all three listened respectfully but it was no good he couldnt seem to make himself understood at length he gave it up and judging that it would be safe now to turn his head to take a last look at the emerald isle he was appalled to find that she had vanished utterly swallowed in the humid haze of the days beginning for a time he could still hear the beat of her engines but finally even that was gone and he was alone with his three arabs in a flat calm sea that had an oily shimmer to its hard unbroken surface he felt abandoned then more alone than hed ever been in his life before but it was a mood that didnt last for in less than an hour the haze thinned and away to port the vague outline of a mass of mountains emerged a few minutes later and the sky was clear a blue bowl reflected in the sea and the mountains stood out magnificent tumbling down from the sky in sheer red cliffs to disappear in a mirage effect at the waters edge ahead a long dhow stood with limp sail suspended in the air and beyond it the world seemed to vanish no mountains nothing only the endless sky for the first time he understood why men talked of the desert as a sea twice the sambuqs aged engine petered out each time it was the boy who got it going the naukhuda sat dreamily at the helm steering with the toes of his right foot curled round the smooth wood of the rudder bar a charcoal fire had been burning on the low poop ever since hed come on board and the big cooking pot above it eventually produced a mess of rice and mutton which they ate in their fingers a small wind stirred the surface of the sea increased until it filled the sail and the engine was switched off in the sudden quiet the sound of the water sliding past the hull seemed almost loud the mainsheet was eased out and the sambuq took wing ras alkhaima the naukhuda pointed across the port bow at the very foot of the mountains and low on the horizon he made out the duncoloured shape of houses the tufts of palms and shortly after that the coast ahead showed up low and flat a shimmering line of dunes the sun was barely halfway up the sky when they closed that dune coast a line of camels marched sedately along the sand of the foreshore and close under the low cliffs a landrover stood parked a lone figure in arab clothes standing beside it he thought then that this was his father and braced himself for that first meeting wondering what he would be like but when the naukhuda paddled him ashore in the sambuqs dugout it was an arab who waded into the shallow water to meet them again the difficulty of trying to make himself understood the arabs name was yousif and he spoke a little english collonell sahib not here you come saraifa now the word saraifa was shouted at him several times as though he were deaf how far is saraifa the man stared at him as though he were mad he was a very dirtylooking individual his greasy turban trailing one end over his shoulders a torn and very filthy european jacket worn over his arab robes his dark face was smudged with oil this and the little black moustache below the curved nose gave him a sinister appearance david tried again saraifa ten miles twenty he held up his fingers saraifa no far in machine of collonell sahib the gaptoothed smile was clearly meant to placate me driver to collonell sahib drive very quick that seemed to exhaust his fund of english for he turned to the naukhuda and launched into a guttural flood of conversation at length the naukhuda stepped forward kissed his hand and touched it to his heart with a little bow david gave him one of the notes the mate had handed him and found his hand held in the others horny palm whilst the old man made him a long farewell speech then at last he was in the landrover and they were roaring along the sand of the foreshore the driver bent over the wheel like a rider urging on his horse with the stray end of his filthy turban streaming out behind him a mile or two further on they left the seas edge by a camel track that climbed the shallow cliffs looking back david got a last glimpse of the dhow that had brought him to the arabian shore and then they were bouncing past the bedouin caravan he had seen moving along the sands the camels stared with supercilious gaze padding effortlessly through the sand under their mountainous loads the men wild and bearded raised their hands unsmilingly in desert salutation the silver mountings of their oldfashioned guns winked in the hot sun and david caught the wicked gleam of khanjar knives and the brass of cartridge belts he was seeing for the first time the desert world that was to be his home enquiries of an executor the account of his actual arrival in arabia was contained in the letter he dispatched to me almost immediately after he had reached saraifa for that reason i suppose it told me little about the actual meeting between himself and his father scribbled in pencil on scraps of paper it had been written mostly on board the emerald isle except for the final page it had been completed at a waterhole somewhere in the desert where he and yousif had spent the night the final page was nothing more than a hastilywritten postscript saraifa at last but i arrived at a bad time my father was with the sheikh and an oil director and his pilot and he leaves with them in the morning for bahrain he seemed angry at first but its all right now i think the sheikhs son khalid is to look after me whilst he is away and i am to go on a hunting expedition with him to get to know desert ways my father is a great man here with a bodyguard and a mud fort or palace where i am writing now he has only one eye and a black patch over the other which makes him a bit terrifying at first and everybody seems afraid of him men keep coming into this room for one reason and another but really to stare at me it is all very strange but exciting thank you again david at the end of the year he sent me a christmas card it was a gulfoman oilfields development company card and was postmarked basra he was at an oil school studying geology and seemed happy that was the last i heard of him until i received the news three years later that he was missing in the rub al khali desert the empty quarter by then i was involved in his fathers affairs it was a strange business and one that was causing me considerable concern though at the outset it had seemed straightforward enough in fact i wasnt in the least surprised when he asked me to act for him a lawyers business is a very personal one and tends to grow through personal contact what my son has told me about you and the fact that your firm acted for me for many years in the matter of the settlement to his mother leads me to place complete confidence in your discretion and in your ability to use your own initiative when required he wanted to consolidate his financial affairs he said and he sent me power of attorney and gave me authority to collect all monies meet any accounts that became due and generally manage his business interests there was nothing particularly unusual about this except that i was on no account to attempt to communicate with him in any way once the arrangement was working my correspondence with him lasted over several months his letters were all handwritten and the only address he gave was his bank in bahrain shortly after it was all agreed money began to flow in from all over the middle east from arab merchants and bankers from traders from a firm of stockbrokers in cairo and a large sum from the cashier of the london office of the gulfoman oilfields development company this went on for about a year some of it was in kind pearls from a dealer in bahrain even a box full of maria theresa dollars and another full of silver presumably gifts from the local sheikhs finally the flow had dried up and presuming that the operation was against his retirement i invested the money for him mostly in local industry of which i had personal knowledge the market of course was a restricted one but it never occurred to me that he would almost immediately want large sums in cash and then in may of the following year accounts began to come through for settlement for stores equipment vehicles the largest single item almost ј for a secondhand seismological truck complete with geophones and all the necessary equipment for a geophysical survey and there had been a shipping agents account for freighting it down from basra to muscat on the emerald isle it was clear that he was embarking on a programme of oil exploration on his own expecting it to be financed by the nominee account and it worried me for id no means of knowing where it was going to end i ignored my instructions then and wrote him several times care of his bank but received no reply and in the new year i received another batch of accounts this time for fuel and stores and drilling pipe i was by then thoroughly alarmed about the whole situation he obviously didnt realize that there were restrictions on bank lending in force and i was reluctant to sell securities on a weak market i was able to meet the immediate accounts but i had to know what his future plans were on march i received an account for the hire of a complete drilling rig i phoned an oilman i knew in milford haven and he gave me figures for the probable cost of drilling even with a hired rig that staggered me i wrote to whitaker then stating that unless he sent me a statement of his plans and the probable cost by return i should have no alternative but to fly out at his expense to discuss the whole situation that was the position on the morning of march when i came into the office and found an airmail letter with a bahrain stamp amongst my post i thought it was the reply i was expecting but when i opened it i found it was from susan thomas apparently she was now working as a nurse at a hospital in dubai she enclosed a copy of a cable she had received from the offices of the gulfoman oilfields development company in bahrain i read it through twice before my mind was able to take in and accept what the words meant so great was my sense of shock nurse susan thomas the hospital dubai from godco march regret inform you your brother david whitaker missing desert rub al khali since february twentyeight stop truck now discovered abandoned some fifty miles west north west of saraifa oasis stop extensive ground search with air cooperation raf in difficult dune country has revealed no trace also unreported nomad tribesmen stop now reluctantly called off must be presumed dead stop company offers deepest sympathy you and your mother erkhard presumed dead it was hard to believe dealing as i had been for the last two years with his fathers affairs i had often thought about him wondered how he was getting on what he was doing i had even thought of writing to him to ask about his fathers plans and now this my own sense of disbelief was echoed by susans letter a purely intuitive reaction we were twins as you know yet all this time whilst they have been searching i knew nothing felt nothing if david is dead then surely i would have known and then a little further on in the letter early last month he came to see me very late at night he was in some sort of trouble but what it was he wouldnt say he seemed withdrawn and he had a rather wild look i felt he was in danger but i still cannot believe he is dead and then the words he told me then that if anything were to happen to him i was to write to you at once in the final paragraph she apologized for being a nuisance and added but please please contact the london office of the company and try to persuade them to have the search resumed the letter was signed simply susan as though i were an old friend i was due in court at oclock and still had the rest of my post to go through i put the letter aside and didnt get back to it until late that afternoon when i rang the london office of the gulfoman oilfields development company but of course they knew nothing a thin cultured voice informed me that all local administration was dealt with by the bahrain office the cable is signed erkhard you say then i think you may take it that everything possible has already been done and the facts are as stated mr erkhard is our general manager out there and in charge of all developments however he took my name and address and promised to pass on my observations to bahrain i cleared my desk and then got my car and drove down to grangetown to break the news to mrs thomas not a very pleasant task but one that i couldnt very well avoid since susan had written this is something i cannot bring myself to do in a letter it would be so much kinder if you would do it more personal and you can explain the circumstances better tell her i will write later mrs thomas had aged of course but more so than i would have expected her hair was completely grey now no longer drawn back tightly from her forehead but hanging untidily in wisps the dress she wore was none too clean and the eyes looked almost furtive as they flickered from one thing to another never at rest and never looking directly at me at the same time the lines of strain had gone her face seemed to have filled out become smoother she invited me into the parlour where the couch was still in the same place the rolltop desk still littered with books on racing form she was nervous and she was talking all the time as we stood there almost in the same positions like actors cued to their places talking about david about sue about her life and how lonely it was now but dafydd is a great comfort to me he was never much of a letter writer but since he went to arabia her eyes flicked to my face is it about dafydd youve come mr grant but then they had fled to another part of the room and she was saying im expecting a letter from him soon he doesnt write regularly of course hes in such strange places but such a picture he gives me i can almost see it you know the bedouin men and the camels and the heat like a dream it is and me twenty again and waiting for letters she gave a little hurried laugh almost a titter i get confused sometimes over two years it is now since sue went out there ive been alone ever since you see and the mind plays tricks when did you last hear from david i asked her oh recently quite recently and ill have another letter from him soon any day now i expect and then sheering away from the subject she said youve never seen his room have you all his books id like you to see his room and without waiting for a reply she bustled out of the room as though anxious to escape from me ive kept it just as it was you know she led me up the illlit stairs to a little room at the end of a short landing the place smelt musty and had the chill of long abandonment a flickknife lay on the painted top of a chest of drawers like a warriors trophy from some forgotten war and above the bed was a shelf of books he was a great one for reading she said anything about arabia i did my best to get him interested in other things but there i knew hed go there sooner or later it was in the blood as you might say there were about fifty books there most of them books on arabia including expensive volumes like doughtys arabia deserta all damaged but stuck together with loving care it was a strange glimpse of a young mans yearning i believe colonel whitaker once wrote a book about arabia i said i tried to get a copy but it was out of print she nodded its a long time since anybody could get a copy it wasnt very successful you see but there is one here somewhere she leaned her weight against the bed and ran a workcoarsened finger along the bookshelf and then she took down a book and handed it to me the title was wanderings by camel through the empty quarter signed it is you see she said proudly he gave it to me before he left and she added wistfully it was the only present he ever gave me the book of course brought back memories to her she smiled at me shyly almost coyly you know it was whilst he was home writing that and getting it published that i came to know him i was in service then at llanfihangel hall that was his familys place she hesitated i suppose he was bored really the coy little smile had spread to her eyes so that her whole face was strangely transfigured but we enjoyed ourselves she said it with a happy little sigh and then she added ah well you only live once mr grant thats what i tell myself whenever im feeling lonely youve had your fun sarah i say youve had your fun and youve paid the price are you married mr grant no and no illegitimate children she gave a queer laugh as i shook my head well there you are people like you miss a great deal in life and she added with surprising perception you shouldnt always live at secondhand you know rummaging about in other peoples lives we do our best to help i murmured uncomfortably and then i asked her if i could borrow whitakers book for a few days i thought it might help me to understand the sort of man he was she looked at me in surprise no she said quickly her eyes darting to the book no i dont think id like anyone to borrow that and she took it from me and put it quickly back in its place ill make you some tea if you like she said as she took me back down the stairs at the bottom under the light there was a faded photograph of a pretty girl in a highnecked frock that was taken just about the time i met the major she said as she saw me looking at it he was a major then you see from the kaisers war you didnt recognize it as me i suppose she smiled i was considered very pretty then you know though i didnt look so pretty when hed finished with me and i was bearing twins more like a balloon you know now wont you stay and have a cup of tea mr grant and you can tell me how you managed to get dafydd out to his father i should have thanked you for doing that shouldnt i but at the time i thought it might she hesitated you see ive always been afraid of what would happen when they met and then dafydd started to go wrong all those arab friends of his we had reached the parlour again and she said i shall never forget that afternoon mr thomas lying there on the couch and dafydd she pointed towards the spot where he had stood and dafydd standing there and swearing hed kill his own da but there she gave me a weak uneasy smile theyre together now and nothing has happened has it it was silly of me to take a young boy so seriously and she added almost violently but it scared me at the time it scared me silly you say theyre together now oh yes in a place called saraifa thats an oasis what was the date of that last letter you had i i dont remember her mouth was suddenly trembling it was quite recent mr grant could i see it please she hesitated her eyes wandering round the room and then finally she went to the rolltop desk and took a single sheet of paper from the top of a neat little pile of similar sheets august it was she said almost in a whisper august the twentythird seven months ago and you havent heard from him since she shook her head her hand trembling as she stared down at the letter and he was at saraifa does he say what he was doing there hed been on a gazelle hunt with sheikh makhmud and his son what sort of work i mean no he doesnt mention work but it would be something to do with oil hes a geologist you see and works for one of the oil companies she was reading the letter to herself again her lips forming the words which i was certain she knew by heart he writes beautiful letters you know all about the country and the people he meets he writes so i can almost imagine im out there with him she put the letter back on the pile that was my dream once that id go out there to live she stood there smiling to herself and staring out at the dingy street just a dream she repeated but with the books and the maps i can see it all from his letters im a welsh woman you see i have the gift of imagination and then with a sudden edge of bitterness to her voice you need imagination sometimes in a hole like this how could i tell her the boy was dead have you heard from his father at all she shook her head no ive never heard from the major not once in all these years there was a catch in her voice and she moved quickly away towards the door ill make you some tea please dont bother i said i have to go now but she was between me and the door her hands fumbling at her dress her eyes searching my face she had finally screwed herself up to the pitch of facing the implication of my visit whats happened mr grant she asked whats happened between them as soon as i saw you standing there on the doorstep nothing has happened between them according to my information but she didnt let me finish wasnt even listening i knew they should never have met she cried theyre alike you see theyve the same nature obstinate very obstinate she was almost sobbing for breath i knew what it would mean its in their stars theyre both sagittarius you see and he was such a fine man when i knew him such a fine man and lusty so full of fire and vitality she was wringing her hands and a sound came from her lips like the sound of keening known it i have always oh god she whispered and then staring straight at me how did it happen do you know how it happened there was nothing for it then but to let her know the facts such as they were and because it was easier i handed her the copy of the cable her daughter had sent me she read it through slowly her eyes widening as the shock of it went home until they became fixed almost vacant dafydd she murmured his name hes reported missing thats all i said trying to comfort her to offer her some hope but she didnt seem to take that in dead she whispered and then she repeated his name dafydd and her tone was one of shocked surprise i never thought it would be dafydd thats not right at all the fixed stare was almost trancelike it was never dafydd that was going to die and a shiver ran through her ill write to your daughter no doubt shell let you have any further information direct she didnt say anything and her eyes still had that fixed trancelike look as i took the copy of the cable from her nerveless hand her behaviour was so odd i didnt like to leave it with her dont worry too much theres still a chance no the word seemed to explode out of her mouth no better it is like this god rest his poor soul appalled i hurried past her out into the fresh evening air the stars what a thing to be believing in at a time like this poor woman but as i drove away it was the father i was thinking about a sense of uneasiness growing in my mind fostered by the violence of her strange reaction going back to that house to that poor woman driven half out of her senses by an old love she couldnt discard it was all suddenly fresh in my memory her fears and the way hed sworn to kill his father what had happened between those two in the intervening years or was this just an accident one of those things that can happen to any young man prospecting out there in the remote deserts of arabia back at the office i got out the whitaker file and read that postscript to davids letter again but there was nothing in it to give me a clue as to how his father had reacted the words might have been written by any youngster plunged into new and strange surroundings except that he had described his father as though he were looking at him with the eyes of a complete stranger but then that was what he was right at the bottom of the file was the dossier andrews had produced from presscuttings in the library of the welsh edition of a popular daily and i read it through again charles stanley whitaker born llanfihangel hall near usk joined the cavalry as a trooper in served with allenby in the offensive against the turks and rose to the rank of major after the war he stayed on in the middle east policeman trader dhowowner he adopted the moslem religion made the pilgrimage to mecca has lived with the bedouin his book on his crossing of the rub al khali desert was published in by then he had already become something of a legend following publication of his book he went back to the middle east and after three years with gulfoman oilfields development he joined wavells staff on the outbreak of war with the rank of colonel awarded the vc for gallantry wounded twice served with wingate and later with wilson was still a colonel at the end of the war he then rejoined gulfoman oilfields development as political representative there was a picture pinned to the dossier which showed him in arab dress standing beside a landrover on a desert airstrip the black patch over the right eye was plainly visible so too was the prominent beaklike nose he was slightly stooped as though conscious of his height he was a head taller than the other two men in the picture this and the beard and the black patch over the eye gave him a very formidable appearance and though the picture wasnt a very clear one looking at it again i couldnt help feeling that he was a man capable of anything and i could appreciate the impression he had made on a welsh servant girl all those years ago he would have been thirtysix then a good deal younger and i suppose he had taken her the way he would have taken a slave girl in a bedouin encampment but for her it had been something different an experience so out of the ordinary that she had thought of nothing else for the last twentyfive years i wondered whether she still possessed that album full of presscuttings i would like to have looked through it and also through the letters from her son but i couldnt face the thought of going back to the house i returned the file to its place and wrote to susan advising her to make the journey to bahrain and see erkhard nothing can be done it appears at this end i told her erkhard seems to be the only man who has the authority to order the search to be resumed two days later the news of davids death was in the times a rather guarded account it seemed to me it was clearly based on a company handout but it did include a brief description by one of the raf pilots who had flown the search flightlieutenant hill described the truck as similar to those used by oil companies for seismological work though no company markings showed on either bonnet or sides it was halfway up the side of a big sand dune as though it had stalled or bogged down in an effort to surmount this obstacle it was hardly surprising he said that he had flown several times over the area without seeing it high winds the local shamal had piled the sand up on one side of it he had only sighted the truck because the sun was low and it was casting a shadow it was less a news story than a short article and most of it was about colonel whitaker that strange halfarab figure so prominent in the search for gulf oil during the past twenty years it was from our own correspondent and i had a vague sense as i read it that there was something behind the piece something that he was not in a position to reveal but that was nevertheless there for those who could read between the lines such phrases as the fascination of this man who has maintained his theory about oil in the face of persistent failure and whether he is another holmes or not whether the oil company he served for so long will live to regret his departure only time will tell finally there was this it appears there is some foundation for the rumour that his son though employed by godco was on loan to him for some private purpose presumably connected with prospecting for oil the suggestion that david have been on loan to his father at the time of his disappearance did nothing to allay the uneasiness that had resulted from my visit to mrs thomas and then the following morning captain griffiths walked into my office and i knew for certain that there was something more to the boys death than the company had so far revealed griffiths had docked at first light and was still in uniform having come straight from his ship i promised to deliver this personally into your hands he put a fat envelope down on the desk in front of me personally you understand he wouldnt risk it through the post whos it from i asked but the address was handwritten the writing familiar i knew it was from david before he answered my question young whitaker he said and sat himself down in the chair opposite my desk i was too startled to say anything for a moment for the boy had been alive when hed handed this to griffiths i picked it up staring at the address as though that would give me some clue as to what was inside when did he give you this well now he frowned it was sharjah and we were anchored about a mile off yes but what was the date its the date im trying to remember man his little beard bristled without my log i cant be sure but we left basra on january twentythird and we called at kuwait bahrain doha abu dhabi and dubai before we anchored off sharjah it would be about the middle of the first week in february and david had been reported missing on february griffiths must have been one of the last people he saw before he went out into the desert perhaps one of the last of his own race to see him alive still the same offices i see griffiths had pulled his pipe out and was busy filling it he didnt know the boy was dead the trouble is the clients dont pay their bills i said and slit the packet open the old rogue had never settled my account though hed admitted that whitaker had made him a present of fifty quid for getting the boy out to arabia inside was a handwritten letter folded around another envelope that had godco bahrain printed on the flap across the front of it he had typed david whitaker to be opened only in the event of my death those words they came as a shock i stared at them wondering how he could possibly have known he was going to die or was it just a coincidence whats the matter griffiths asked whats he been up to i suppose he thought he was in some sort of legal trouble you havent seen the times then of course not i only got in this morning why david whitaker is dead i said and i told him about the truck theyd found abandoned and the description of it given in the times you must have been one of the last people to see him alive i see his acceptance of it might have surprised me except that my mind was still on that envelope its almost uncanny i murmured what is your coming here with this i turned the envelope round so that he could see what was typed across it he must have had some sort of a premonition griffiths nodded his head slowly that explains it and he added may his soul rest in peace the poor devil he said it quietly with reverence as though he were on the deck of his ship and consigning the boys body to the deep explains what i asked him the circumstances he hesitated very strange they were and then he looked at me his gaze very direct i dont think you quite understand mr grant that boy risked his life on a filthy night with a shamal blowing to get that packet to me without anyone knowing risked his life i was reading through the covering letter only half listening to him yes indeed for he came off in one of those fishermans dugouts and just an arab boy with him it was a damned foolhardy thing to do there was a wicked sea running he needed a lawyer he said somebody he could trust why did he say why he needed a lawyer no griffiths shook his head no he didnt say why and its something ive been asking myself ever since i put that envelope away in the ships safe what would a young geophysicist want with a lawyer out there in the middle of arabia i finished reading the letter and then i put it down on the desk griffiths was lighting his pipe his head cocked on one side well hes dead now you say he was eyeing the unopened envelope the way a thrush eyes a worm perhaps youd tell me just what happened i suggested well he hesitated his eyes still on the envelope it was night you see we had finished unloading and the deck lights had been switched off about an hour when one of my arab crew reports a dugout alongside and a white man in it called thomas asking for me well i couldnt recall his name how should i i have so many passengers they come and go along the coast oilmen locust control levy officers air force personnel government officials how should i remember his name even if he was another welshman it was four years since hed used it anyway and then he came stumbling into my cabin and i recognized him at once of course i thought he was going to stop there but after a moments silence he went on only the previous voyage id had him on board as a passenger from bahrain down to dubai hed changed a great deal in those six months all the vitality of youth seemed to have been whipped out of him his skin burned almost black by the sun and the hard angular bones of the face showing through but it was the eyes man they werent the eyes of a youngster any more they were the eyes of a man whod looked the world in the face and been badly frightened by it who was he afraid of i was thinking of the father then i didnt say he was afraid of anybody did he talk to you at all about himself oh yes indeed he was talking all the time to be honest mr grant i thought he might be going round the bend some of them do that you know the heat and the sand and its lonely work yes but what did he say nothing very much nothing that i can remember that is he was talking very fast you see the words tumbling over themselves about his job and where hed been and where had he been had he been to saraifa but griffiths shook his head i cant remember he said i dont think he mentioned saraifa it was talk for the sake of talking you know for the sake of hearing the sound of his own voice and having somebody listen to it hed been in some wild places i think and mostly on his own with nobody with him but arabs i asked about the packet then did he talk about that at all no he sat at my desk and wrote that covering letter and when hed finished it he borrowed an envelope from me sealed the whole thing up and asked me to put it in my safe and deliver it to you personally the moment i docked didnt you ask him why it was so urgent of course i did i was damned curious about the whole thing but his manner was so odd he didnt say anything about it being political dynamite then political dynamite griffithss bushy eyebrows lifted no he didnt say anything like that a wary look had come into his eyes is that what he says in that letter i nodded wheres colonel whitaker now can you tell me that but he didnt know for certain probably in saraifa he said why his tone was suddenly cautious as though he were a witness under crossexamination and since i had no intention of telling him the reason for my interest in whitaker i asked him about the previous voyage when hed had david on board as a passenger was he going to join his father do you know but he couldnt even tell me that all he said was that he was going down into the rub al khali he took out his watch and glanced at it it was a hell of a time to be going down into the empty quarter he added as though glad to escape into generalities that time of the year the sand is hot enough to burn the tyres off a truck and the soles off your boots it was summer he nodded early july it would have been and that was the month id received the shipping agents account did you have a seismological truck on board yes he stared at me curiously surprised that i should know about it it was deck cargo and we shipped it down to muscat i remember that because we had a devil of a job getting it ashore had to lash four of the local boats together and bridge them with planks you dont think it could be the same truck the one that was found abandoned but of course he couldnt tell me that did you know he was on loan to his father did he say anything about that he shook his head and got to his feet did he talk about his father at all no he didnt mention him he said it flatly as though to discourage any further questions i must be going now mr grant just docked a lot of things to see to you know i was reluctant to let him go one more question captain griffiths i was standing facing him then you said once that you heard all the gossip out there have you heard any rumours about saraifa rumours that colonel whitaker is prospecting for oil there he started to say something but then he seemed to think better of it and shook his head a man like that you never know whats true and what isnt and saraifa is a long way from the coast a trouble spot too he glanced uneasily at his watch again i read him the times correspondents report the paragraph about david being on loan to his father but all he said was the whitaker theory it crops up whenever anybody writes about that man and then he was moving towards the door well ive done what i promised and thats that he held out his hand sad about david whitaker very sad good boy lots of character he shook my hand briefly cast a quick glance at the envelope still lying unopened on my desk and then went to the door his last words to me as i saw him out were its a tricky business oil lot of money involved politics too and if he was operating anywhere near the haddsaraifa border well youd understand if youd ever been out there he said it in a fatherly way as though he were giving me some sound advice i was reluctant to let him go that little welsh sea captain was stuffed full of all the gossip of the gulf if i could only have wrung it out of him but i dont think he wanted to talk and anyway i was anxious to find out what that envelope contained the covering letter had given me no real indication you helped me once long ago now im asking you to help me again he mentioned the envelope then and asked me to put it in a safe place and only open it in the event of his death you re the only man i feel i can trust with a thing like this and he added i should warn you that its political dynamite and if anybody knew it was in your possession it might lead to trouble he concluded with apologies for bothering me with his affairs and then these words thank you again for helping me to a life that has suited me and that i have enjoyed it was signed yours gratefully david i read it through again standing at my desk and there was no escaping the significance of those final words for some reason he had believed he was going to die had he been ill suffering from some terrible disease but that didnt fit griffithss description of him nervous wrought up even frightened yes but not ill and why the secrecy anyway i picked up the envelope and slit it open inside was a typewritten letter his will and two envelopes one addressed to sir philip gorde at the london office of godco the other marked location and sketch map location of what but it wasnt difficult to guess for what else but the discovery of oil could be described as political dynamite in the deserts of arabia the letter didnt say so in so many words but it made it pretty clear and because it gives some indication of his frame of mind and also because it formed the basis of my subsequent actions i give it here in full it was dated december of the previous year and above the date he had typed somewhere in the sheikhdom of saraifa dear mr grant the time has come to put my affairs into the hands of somebody i know and can trust i am working here on an old survey it was carried out a long time ago and the man who did it is dead now if my own results confirm his report and i shall know very shortly i shall try and catch captain griffiths at sharjah when the emerald isle stops there about the end of next month i cannot explain to you why it is necessary all i can say is that this is a forbidden zone and that i am working against time and without authority everything is against me almost like it was when i came to you last ive always been a bit of a rebel at heart but outside of the pack youre on your own and whatever happens to me im determined that saraifa shall have the benefit of my efforts the oasis fights a losing battle with the desert without money it is doomed and i spent six of the happiest months of my life there when you read this i shall be dead please then take the following action contact sir philip gorde who is on the board of directors of godco and give him the envelope i have addressed to him it contains a document which is correctlyphrased and is a copy of other concession agreements it will also contain my survey report but without the locations the locations will be contained in a separate envelope together with additional copies of my survey report this envelope is only to be handed over after sir philip gorde has signed the concession agreement and legally bound the company to your satisfaction to drill four test wells at the locations indicated in the event that sir philip gorde refuses to sign then you will please take whatever action you think best in the interests of saraifa khalid the sheikhs son knows what i am doing and you will find he fully understands what is at stake so far as the oasis is concerned it is essential that somehow you get the concession taken up saraifa needs oil desperately and if you succeed you will not find khalid lacking in appreciation or sheikh makhmud for that matter you may of course make what use you can of the circumstances of my death my parentage and my past to achieve publicity and so attract the interest of other oil companies enclosed also is my will i have appointed you my executor and after making the necessary arrangements with my bank in bahrain you will please draw on the account for fees and expenses please understand that i would not again involve you in my affairs if i were not desperate in the event of my death i have instructed my sister to contact you immediately david whitaker it was an unusual communication for a solicitor to receive most unusual and reading it through again i was struck by the fact that he made no mention of his father in the whole of that document there wasnt one reference to colonel whitaker everything is against me there were other phrases too i was greatly disturbed about the whole thing particularly as i knew that whitaker was engaged in an operation that must run counter to the interests of the company he had served and which david was serving at the time of his death however there was no point in speculating his instructions were clear and i picked up the phone and rang the london office of godco and whilst i was waiting for the call to come through i had a look at the will he had typed it himself but it was a perfectly legal document even though the witnesses to his signature were two arabs it appointed me executor and his sister susan sole legatee with instructions to take care of their mother again no reference to his father this and the letter and the fact that he had made such careful provision against the possibility of death gave a strange quality of isolation to his activities as though he were operating alone in a hostile world i think it was then that i seriously began to consider the possibility that his disappearance was no accident my call to godco came through and i was put on to the same thin cultured voice no sir philip was not available would not be for some time he was on a tour of the companys middle east properties and not expected back for at least a month i could contact him through the bahrain office if the matter were important i put the phone down and sat there for a long time considering but i dont think there was ever any real doubt in my mind i hadnt heard from whitaker and quite apart from his sons death the necessity for a meeting with him was urgent it was just that the persian gulf was a long way away and i had got out of the habit of travelling fortunately i now had an arrangement with another firm of solicitors which enabled me to get away when necessary and in the end i put a call through to a local travel agency boac flights direct to bahrain were weekly leaving on thursdays at hours and arriving hours friday that just gave me time to make all my arrangements get visas and clear my desk of the more urgent matters i told them to book me out on the next flight locked the contents of the envelope in the safe and went out for a drink i needed to think for i was beginning to realize what it was hed landed on my desk political dynamite if he was a good geophysicist then what id locked away in my safe might well be the location of a new oilfield three days later i flew out of london airport in a storm of rain and wind march going out like a lion but at rome it was hot and all down the mediterranean we had bright sunshine and i sat in my seat with an empty feeling inside me for the day before id left cardiff a man had come to see me a tiredlooking hardfaced man with a skin like leather whod refused to give andrews his name or state his business even when he was alone with me in my office he went about it in such a tortuous way that it only gradually dawned on me what he was after it was cleverly done a hint here a hint there and the abyss gradually opening up at my feet he knew david had boarded the emerald isle off sharjah knew too that griffiths had delivered that packet to me hed been down to see him at his cottage in the gower hed been to the police too had talked with sergeant mathieson and had checked the files he knew the boys real name his whole background everything and what he wanted from me was that packet he smiled when i told him i couldnt discuss my clients affairs professional etiquette your profession etiquette mr grant is somewhat elastic if you follow me it was a catandmouse game for he knew id helped the boy to get out of the country there are several charges outstanding and a warrant the boy is dead i reminded him but it made no difference he had his instructions he said these were to take possession of the packet you can hand it to me or forward it to the company one or the other i asked him what authority he had for making such an outrageous proposal but all hed say was that it was in the countrys interests one knows of course that there are men like that employed by government and by large companies but one doesnt expect to come across them they belong to a halfworld that lies outside the experience of ordinary citizens in your own interests i suggest you hand it to me nobody need know anything then it was blackmail and by then i was sweating for i was beginning to realize what i was up against politics and oil the middle east the scope of a provincial lawyer doesnt cover that sort of world i just hadnt the right sort of pull the contacts the friends in high places you can go to the devil i told him he got to his feet then i had hoped for your cooperation and he added think it over mr grant the police have an interest in this and if they begin an investigation it could be very unpleasant for you a man in your position a lawyer he left it at that and picked up his hat i wondered then whether he knew i was leaving for bahrain in two days time the foreign office had my passport they could still refuse to grant me the necessary visas all right i said ill think it over and the next day in london i found i had been granted a visa for bahrain but not for either dubai or saraifa a note pinned to my passport stated that for any further visas you should apply to the office of the political resident persian gulf in bahrain darkness fell the port light showing red i woke to the touch of the air hostesss hand on my shoulder and the sighing sound of the flaps going down the silver of a new moon had risen reflecting with the stars in the still surface of the sea coming up to meet us a steel mirror suddenly patterned with the arrowheads of fish traps as we skimmed the shallows a moment later we touched down in bahrain and at threethirty in the morning the air was still heavy with the days heat it came at us as soon as the door was opened suffocating in its humidity the squat whitefronted coral houses of muharraq were without life as the airport bus drove us across the long causeway to the main island and the town of manama a solitary dhow was putting to sea the curve of its sail a thing of ghostly beauty against the blackness of the water all the others lay dormant in the mud or barepoled against the coral hards with sails furled only the boac hotel showed any sign of life at that hour it was down an empty side street the airlines bluebird insignia standing out against the drab of concrete lights were burning against our coming i was given a room with a balcony that was full of the sounds of a latenight party laughter and the clink of glasses there was a lot of coming and going in the passage outside and i went to sleep to the sound of a girls voice harsh and loud and slightly drunk sunlight woke me four hours later the hard sunlight of a hot country an arab boy brought me tea and i drank it lying naked on the bed a stale feeling at the back of the eyeballs and my body hot and without energy getting up shaving having breakfast it was all an effort and this was only april i wondered what it must be like in midsummer when i enquired at the desk for the offices of the gulfoman oilfields development company i was told that they were several miles out of town on the awali road a fat man in a tropical suit of powder blue was asking about a taxi hed booked for awali he was an italian who had joined the flight at rome and i asked him whether he would give me a lift si si signore of course his name was ruffini and he was a journalist you are in oil he asked as we drove past the customs quay crowded with dhows and when i said no he looked surprised but you ave an appointment at godco no a matter of an estate i told him a client of mine has died so he sighed a lawyers business always to concern itself with death is depressing for you no he offered me an american cigarette who do you see at this company is none of my business he added quickly seeing my hesitation but though i am never in bahrain before i ave contacts introductions you say if i can elp you he left it at that reaching into his breast pocket for a pair of dark glasses and because he was being helpful i told him who it was id come to see you know anything about this sir philip gorde he asked hes a director of the company in london but not the most important man out here i think and he leaned forward and asked the driver a pockmarked bahraini with a lot of gold teeth who is the big man at godco is meester erkhard ruffini nodded alexander erkhard bene that is also my information many years the driver added turning to face us many years it is sir gorde not now the car touched the road verge sending up a cloud of dust ten years now i have taxi and am driving down the awali road sir with men from bapco godco aramco i speak not well eenglish but understand plenty get me i look after the boys good very bloody good they all friends of mahommed ali that my name sir he was looking over his shoulder again you want something you find my car outside boac hotel when did mr erkhard come out to bahrain i asked five six years ago sir before i get this buick and sir philip gorde was the big man then thats right sir he is here before awali before i am born a friend of the ruler of all arabs very great man sir gorde but then he is sick and this mr erkhard he come to bahrain everything different then not friend of ruler not friend to arabs and he spat out of the open window here is godco office now we turned left with a screech of tyres the dusty date gardens were left behind and a white building stood at the end of a treelined road beyond it lay the sea a blue line shimmering on the horizon ecco ruffini gripped my arm pointing away to the right to a litter of small mounds tumuli e molto interessante there is a danish man who dig in those tumuli the oldest burial ground in arabia peraps the brakes slammed on and the car stopped with a jerk i got out i will see you at the otel peraps we ave a drink together eh i thanked him for the lift and he waved a pudgy hand ciao the taxi swung away and i went in through the double glass doors it was like walking into a refrigerator for the place was airconditioned to the temperature of a london office glass and tiled walls steel furniture and the girl at the reception desk cool and immaculate but when i asked for sir philip gorde she frowned i dont think sir philip is back yet have you an appointment no i said but ive flown out from england specially to see him she asked me my name and then got on the phone a whitefaced electric clock ticked the seconds away on the wall above her head finally she shook her head im sorry its as i thought sir philip is still in abu dhabi when willhe be back i asked abu dhabi was the first of the trucial sheikhdoms and at least a hundred and fifty miles from bahrain she started talking on the phone again and i lit a cigarette and waited at length she said could you tell me the nature of your business with sir philip please if hes in abu dhabi i said theres not much point is there she cupped her hand over the mouthpiece if its urgent then i think theyd contact him for you i told them youd come out from england specially i hesitated but there was no point in concealing what id come about it concerns david whitaker i said im a lawyer david whitaker she repeated it automatically and then the name suddenly registered and her eyes widened yes she said quickly of course ill see what i can do i leaned on the desk and waited watching her as she talked into the phone there was a long pause while she just stood there holding it and occasionally glancing at me with an expression of curiosity she couldnt conceal and then i heard her say yes of course sir ill send him up right away she put the phone down and came back to the desk mr erkhard will see you himself she said it on a note of surprise if youll go up to the first floor his secretary will be waiting for you i thanked her and went up the stairs erkhards secretary proved to be a man neat and immaculate with a copybook smile of greeting mr grant will you come this way please he took me along a cool corridor and into an office that looked out across the tumuli mr erkhards very busy and youve come unexpectedly without an appointment if youd keep it as short as possible i didnt ask to see mr erkhard i said and that seemed to upset him no no of course i understand he paused at the communicating door on the far side a discreet little pause that gave emphasis and importance to the moment then he opened the door mr grant sir the room was dovegrey the furniture black steel the big window looking out across the tumuli was a single sheet of flawless glass fitted with plastic venetian blinds the desk at which erkhard was seated filled most of the far side of the room and all the wall behind him was taken up with a relief map of arabia dotted with flags he didnt rise to greet me but simply waved me to the chair opposite his desk youre a lawyer i understand i nodded and sat down and youre out here on account of young whitakers death im his executor ah yes there was a peculiar softness about his manner a smoothness almost it was something to do with the roundness of his face and the way the lips were moulded into the suggestion of a smile he was sitting perfectly still watching me waiting i felt it was disconcerting and i found him a difficult man to place probably because he wasnt a type i had met before in a weaker man that halfsmile might have appeared ingratiating but there was nothing weak about erkhard and the eyes were cold as they stared at me unblinkingly have you see the young mans family there was an accent but so slight it was barely noticeable the mother i told him i havent seen the sister yet shes out here in dubai a nurse i nodded you cabled her the news she sent me a copy yes a very unfortunate business its not often we have a casualty there was a long pause and then he said why are you here mr grant are you hoping to persuade us to resume the search i had a message something to that effect from london office and he added i assure you it would be quite useless perhaps if i had a full account of the circumstances i suggested of course there is a report of the search ill see that youre given a copy before you leave another long pause you were asking for sir philip gorde i understand why and when i didnt answer he added i signed that cable to nurse thomas and youve been in touch with london you knew perfectly well that i gave the order for the search to be abandoned he stared at me perhaps you would care to explain theres nothing to explain i said it happens that i have to see sir philip on a private matter connected with whitaker yes he got suddenly to his feet im the general manager in arabia mr grant whitaker was employed by me his death is my responsibility not sir philip gordes i appreciate that then your correct approach was surely to ask for an interview with me it seemed to worry him and i wondered why he was staring down at me waiting for an answer finally he turned away and stood looking out of the window at the brown driedup landscape his light tropical suit was obviously tailored in london and the silk shirt was monogrammed with his initials sir philip is in abu dhabi he said it quietly as though he were speaking to himself tomorrow or perhaps the day after he will be going on to sharjah thats another of the trucial sheikhdoms further to the east he will not be back here for at least a week perhaps a fortnight he turned then and looked directly at me again how do you propose to contact him have you thought of that i only got in this morning i said have you visas for the trucial sheikhdoms no i have to apply to the political residents office mr grant he was smiling again i dont think you understand it isnt easy to get visas for the trucial oman the prpg is very naturally extremely reluctant he gave a little shrug this is arabia you know not europe the political situation is far from stable and there is a great deal at stake enormous sums of capital have been sunk in this area he paused there to give me time to consider of course we could help you not only in the matter of your application for a visa but in transport too we have flights going east along the coast to our various development projects in fact i think there is one going to abu dhabi tomorrow but he added in order to help you we should have to know the exact purpose of your visit he was taking a lot of trouble over this im sorry i said beyond saying that my business with sir philip concerns the estate a matter of a signature i cannot disclose you have a document for him to sign he sounded puzzled and when i refused to be drawn he gave a little shrug and returned to his desk since it is a private matter and not the concern of the company im afraid i cant help you mr grant ill send gorde a personal note of course to tell him youre here a fractional hesitation and then with that little smile that never remotely touched his eyes and if youd care to communicate with him direct then ive no doubt we could arrange for a letter to be delivered to him by tomorrows plane his hand reached out to the onyx bellpush on the desk i one moment i said i wasnt sure how to handle it but i knew that once i was out of that office the opportunity to question him would be gone for ever i wonder perhaps you would be good enough to clear up one or two points for me i said it tentatively whilst im here i added there was a momentary hesitation whilst his hand still hovered on the bellpush im a little puzzled about certain aspects of the boys death i murmured the hand moved back from the bellpush reluctantly and then he smiled and leaned back in his chair of course you say he was employed by you at the time of his death he was employed by the company yes i hesitated the devil of it was i didnt know what i was after something but what the map towering behind him caught my eye could you show me exactly where it was his truck was found he got up at once almost with relief i felt the position he indicated was well to the southwest of buraimi oasis a position where three dotted lines met peering over his shoulder i saw that these marked the boundaries of saudi arabia the sheikhdom of saraifa and the emirate of hadd his finger rested on a point inside the saudi arabian border the whole area was shaded with little dots the sands of the rub al khali he explained dune country its called the empty quarter youve no concessions in saudi arabia have you no then what was he doing there thats something we should like to know mr grant he was there without your authority then of course his nod was very emphatic if he was carrying out a survey then presumably he had a survey crew what happened to them he hesitated and the quick glance he gave me suggested that this was something he didnt want to go into but in the end he said he had an arab crew they were picked up by askari of the emir of hadd however the men have been interviewed it appears they became nervous hardly surprising in that area anyway they downed tools took the landrover and left whitaker there on his own in saudi arabia no no where then he glanced at me quickly again his eyes narrowing they wouldnt say at least they couldnt give the exact location was it somewhere on the hadd border i asked remembering what griffiths had said he ignored that doubtless they could have led us to the place but the emir refused to allow them outside the wadi hadd alakhbar he gave a little shrug the emir is very difficult and he added but of course this is hardly a matter that concerns you on the contrary i said sharply its important that i know exactly where the boy was supposed to be operating at the time of his death until i know that but he shook his head best leave it at that mr grant because of the political aspect i was convinced now that the locations in my briefcase would show that david had been operating somewhere along the haddsaraifa border politics come into it yes they always do in arabia and particularly where oil is concerned he nodded agreement and i asked him then whether he thought there was oil in that area he looked at me very tightlipped and said weve no reason to imagine so then whats the political problem he hesitated and then halfturned to the map again those borders he said theyre all three in dispute particularly the border between hadd and saraifa would you describe that as political dynamite his eyes narrowed and i pushed it further if oil were discovered there yes he said and turned back to his desk i think mr grant we are getting a long way from the purpose of your visit i dont think so he wanted to terminate the interview equally i wanted to continue it did david whitaker submit a survey report to you at any time during say the two months before his death no i stared at him wondering whether that was the truth and then i decided to play the thing id been holding in reserve suppose i told you that i have in my possession the location he was working on at the time of his death he affected disbelief but it lacked something the quickness of spontaneity the sharpness of genuine surprise and suddenly my mind clicked four days ago i murmured in my office in cardiff i was visited by a gentleman who attempted by threats to get those locations from me he didnt say anything and i let the silence drag out he didnt get them of course i said quietly i was staring at him but he kept his eyes on the desk i dont think this concerns me the silence had forced it out of him his hand reached for the bellpush i waited and he hesitated curiosity had won he turned to me and said harshly david whitaker was employed by us we should know the locations he was surveying we have a right have you i asked yes and ill add this i find it very difficult to understand why you should have been given this information whilst the company has been left in the dark he was facing me and after what seemed a long time his eyes fell away to the desk again he was puzzled a little frightened too i thought hed every reason to be both david whitaker knew he was going to die i said it slowly and with emphasis and before he had time to recover from the shock of what id said i shifted my ground does colonel whitaker know his sons dead i really cannot say he was still considering the implication of what id told him and i was convinced it was something he hadnt known before we regarded the sister as the most suitable person to inform and he added the boy was illegitimate you know it was a mistake for it confirmed something i had come to suspect that davids background was known to the company but he didnt seem conscious of it nor did he seem conscious of the drift of my questions i think you will agree when youve read the report of the search that everything possible was done but they didnt find his body no and if you knew the sort of country it is there that wouldnt surprise you he seemed anxious to reassure me on this point its a big dune country and the sand is moving all the time it obliterates everything even his truck was halfburied when they located it it was a seismological truck i believe he nodded one of yours he didnt answer immediately and there was a sudden stillness in the room and when he spoke he chose his words carefully ive already told you he was employed by the company at the time of his death oil company trucks are usually marked with the name of the company arent they what are you implying there were no markings on this particular truck how do you know there was a report of the search in the times oh so youve seen that he hesitated not every truck you know is marked with the companys name that doesnt answer my question i said was that truck a company truck or not i thought he was going to evade the question but then he said no no it wasnt one of our trucks whose truck was it then but hed had enough im not prepared to discuss the companys affairs the truck has no bearing on the boys death i think it has i said as his hand reached for the bellpush again and i added one final question can you tell me where ill find colonel whitaker whitaker i thought it was gorde youd come to see whitaker too i told him david may have been employed by you but he was on loan to his father at the time of his death quite untrue the times is in error and he pressed the bell the interview was at an end as though he had been waiting for his cue the secretary came in immediately see that mr grant has a copy of the report on the whitaker search will you firweather he can take it away with him erkhard turned to me have you a taxi waiting and when i shook my head he told his secretary to arrange for a company car to drive me back to manama you havent told me where ill find colonel whitaker i said as i got to my feet he couldnt very well refuse to answer me in front of his secretary in saraifa i imagine and he added but if youre thinking of going there i should remind you that you will not be granted a visa did that mean hed use his influence to prevent me getting one i hesitated glancing up at the map the flags had names on them and because it might be the only opportunity id have i went across to it and had a close look at them there were only two anywhere near the saraifahadd border and the names on them were ogden and entwhistle that map is confidential mr grant it was the secretary at my side now and quite agitated you neednt worry i said i know nothing about oil so it doesnt tell me anything who did the ground search i asked erkhard entwhistle he answered without looking up ill give you that report now the secretary said erkhard didnt look up as i left determined to give me no excuse for further questions in the outer office i asked if i could write a note to sir philip gorde the secretary gave me a sheet of company notepaper and i wrote it at his desk with him more or less standing over me i marked the envelope personal but i was careful to say nothing in it that erkhard didnt know already the secretary promised to see that it went out by the next plane if there is a reply ill send it down to your hotel he gave me a duplicated copy of the report of the search and showed me out i read that report in the car driving back to manama it told me very little that i didnt already know the truck had been discovered by nomads of the rashid tribe who had passed the news on to some harasis going down to the gulf of masira the naukhuda of a dhow had brought the news across to masira island and the raf station there had radioed it on to raf hq aden a valetta landing at masira on the milkrun up from kormaksar had begun the aerial search on march and the abandoned truck had been located after a threeday search erkhard had then ordered entwhistle who was operating about seventy miles away to break off his seismological survey work and proceed at speed to the area due to a broken spring entwhistle had not reached the abandoned truck until three days later he had then carried out a systematic search but had found no trace of david and the few nomads he encountered knew nothing about him after four days lack of supplies had forced him to retire meantime the valetta supported by a plane chartered by godco had carried out an intensive air search but the rough going had put entwhistles radio out of action and it was not until he joined up with ogdens outfit on march that he was able to report his failure to find even the body it was obvious that no blame attached to the company as erkhard had said everything possible had been done i put the report away in my briefcase the only man who could tell me anything more was entwhistle and remembering the position of his flag on erkhards operations map i knew there wasnt much chance of my having a talk with him we were approaching the town now the twin minarets of the suq alkhamis mosque standing slender against the sky and i told the driver to take me to the political residents office the prpg sir he slowed the car is not in manama is out at jufair by the naval base he hesitated he was a very superiorlooking bahraini you wish me to drive you there please he turned right and we reached the jufair road by the national cinema have you a pass sir everybody need a pass to enter jufair naval base but the native sentry on the gate knew the car and he let us through without question we were close to the sea then with a frigate lying white as a swan on the oilycalm water the road curved amongst the trees the government blocks standing discreetly back in semblance of a country estate it was all manifestly english and so too was the passport control office with its forms purpose of visit what did i put for that i handed my passport to the clerk together with my application for visas abu dhabi dubai sharjah and saraifa thats quite a tour he shook his head doubtfully turning over the pages of my passport the first three theyre trucial sheikhdoms they may be possible but saraifa thats quite out of the question isnt that for the ruler to decide i asked i understand its an independent sheikhdom the suggestion seemed to strike him as a novel one we decide who goes to saraifa he said stiffly and he added if youll come back later this afternoon i want to leave for abu dhabi tomorrow this afternoon he sounded doubtful well perhaps i drove to the bo ac office then only to discover that if i wanted to fly to abu dhabi i should have to charter a plane gulf airways ran a service to sharjah but not to abu dhabi it was my first experience of the difficulties of communication in the country back at the hotel in time for lunch i was hailed by ruffini sitting alone like a pale blue toad in front of a tall glass you like a beer he had seen one of the chief executives of bapco the bahrain petroleum company out at the oil town of awali and then had an interview with erkhard this afternoon i go to jufair but i do not think they tell me anything he leaned towards me across the table you puzzle me signer grant he said a lawyer always with your briefcase you say you are not interested in oil yet your business is with two of the most important oilmen in the gulf the boy brought my drink salute ruffini raised his glass that girl at the reception desk she is new to godco and she talk this morning when you ask for sir philip gorde and he is not there erkhard immediately sees you imself why his eyes were fixed on my face full of curiosity why are you so important what is in that briefcase of yours signore he shook his head and gave a mock sigh you will not tell me of course not yet his face creased in a smile and he gulped down the rest of his drink lets go and eat over lunch he told me why he was in bahrain he worked for a newspaper group in milan and hed had a tipoff from one of italys leading oilmen i think he is right he said there is trouble but where he had been up since six talking in the bazaars to indians chiefly a squadron of brengun carriers of the raf regiment was rumoured to have been sent to sharjah and two raf reconnaissance planes had been fitted with longrange tanks there was talk too of additional transport allocated to the trucial oman scouts and the goc persian gulf was known to be on a tour of inspection if there is trouble ere he said then it mean only one thing oil and suddenly without warning he said what about this david whitaker eh he smiled at me now you are surprised but that little girl knew him and you told her your business is about this boy who is missing he stared at me but you dont want to talk about it eh theres nothing to talk about i said im his executor thats all an you ave to see sir philip gorde who is four years ago one of the most important men in the gulf but not any more who is also the lifelong friend of colonel whitaker the boys father an you ave nothing to tell me eh he shook his head sadly peraps you do not know it my friend but i think maybe you are sitting on the story i want he stared at me a moment and then very seriously you will think i am being very stupid now but walk with care i like you i like men who ave a sense of duty that is why i am warning you you sound very serious i wanted to laugh it off but he said i am very serious oil is big money and in a country like this it is also political dynamite probably he misread the shock his choice of words gave me for he added quickly you dont believe that eh well i will take a bet with you you will not get to abu dhabi or to sharjah saraifa is closed anyway you will in fact not be allowed out of bahrain and you will be got out of ere somehow before sir philip gorde returns have you got your visas yet i have to go back to jufair this afternoon okay he said you can come with me but you will not get any visa he was right there they were very apologetic about it down at jufair but the only man who could deal with my application had unfortunately been called away on urgent business perhaps if i came back tomorrow there was no point in arguing the brick wall of officialdom cant be battered down unless you have the right contacts and id no contacts at all i went for a walk along the naval jetty there was a wind blowing off the anchorage but it was a hot wind and did nothing to refresh me half an hour later ruffini joined me do you get your visas he gave me a wicked smile he knew i hadnt got them did you get the lowdown on the political situation i asked him he gave a fat chuckle and shook his head the same thing nobody is saying anything what is more he added you and me we are in the same boat no visas for ruffini also he is to stay ere and mind his bloody business he hoisted himself on to the sea wall officials can be very stupid if i have to stay on in bahrain and write my story from ere then i have to guess at what goes on and maybe i guess wrong he was staring out across the anchorage his eyes screwed up against the dazzle of the water that gunboat for instance he nodded towards the frigate which was slowly fetching up to her anchor the clatter of her winch coming to us very clear across the water an exercise they tell me routine maybe that is all it is and they are speaking the truth but ow do i know we stayed and watched her steam out of the anchorage and then ruffini heaved himself down off the wall do you ever ear of the emir of hadd he asked as we walked back to the taxi the emir abdulzaid bin sultan well no matter he wiped the perspiration from his face but try shooting that name at the political people ere and see ow their faces go blank i tell you he added this country is worse than a sicilian village full of old vendettas and not a clear boundary anywhere to mark the finish of one sheikhs piece of sand and the beginning of the next he took me back to the hotel and i lay and sweated on my bed till dinner time wondering how i was to contact gorde and thinking about ruffini was there really trouble brewing but it all seemed remote as remote as colonel whitaker out there in saraifa and utterly inaccessible and next day after a full mornings work i was no nearer either of my objectives i rang the passport office but nothing had been decided and when i checked on transportation i found that even if i were willing to charter a plane there was none available with sufficient range to fly direct to saraifa and in any case flights there were prohibited i went to the bank then and settled davids affairs as far as i was able it was the same bank that his father dealt with and the manager was helpful he confirmed that colonel whitaker was living in saraifa this contrary to his very strict instructions but he could tell me little else and i went back to the hotel and had a drink with two raf officers and a civilian pilot a canadian named otto smith after lunch we all went down to the sailing club for a bathe half the english colony was there for it was saturday and amongst them was the girl from the godco reception desk sprawled halfnaked on the cement of the old seaplane jetty so youre off to sharjah mr grant and when i told her i was having visa trouble she smiled and said i think youll find its all right how do you know oh i know everything she laughed no i happened to see your name on the flight list for tomorrows plane she was perfectly right when i got back to the hotel that evening i found my passport waiting for me stamped with visas for sharjah and dubai there was also a message signed by erkhards secretary informing me that owing to the companys desire to help you in every possible way free passage was being granted to me in a company plane leaving for sharjah at hours the following morning sunday the message added that accommodation would be available at the fort and it was not anticipated that i should have to wait long before sir philip arrived from abu dhabi there was no doubt in my mind that erkhard had intervened to get me the necessary visas but why the day before he had made it clear that he didnt intend to help me and after the way i had crossexamined him i hadnt expected it and yet here he was giving me a free ride on a company plane i sat on my bed and smoked a cigarette whilst the hot evening breeze blew in through the open window and the only conclusion i came to was that they had sent my note to gorde and he had given the necessary instructions whatever the reasons it was a great relief to me and i got up and started to pack i had just closed the larger of my two suitcases when there was a knock at the door it was one of the houseboys to say there was a young arab asking for me at the desk it is a boy from the bazaar sir from the almenza club and he grinned at me i had a wash and then dressed the boy was still there when i got down quarter of an hour later he was little more than an urchin and none too clean and when he realized i didnt speak arabic he seized hold of my wrist pulling at me and hissing the words almenza and girlwant girlwant seemed to be the sum total of his english and i told him to go to hell he understood that for he grinned and shook his head girlspik spik sahib i got hold of the houseboy and then he said the boy had been sent by one of the girls at the almenza club she wishes to speak with you sir this time he didnt grin and he added with a puzzled frown it is a personal request this boy is from the house where she lives i didnt like it tell him no i said and i went over to an empty table and ordered a beer it took two houseboys and a lot of argument to get rid of the boy i drank my beer and then went in to dinner a solitary dreary meal i had just finished when the waiter came to tell me a taxidriver was waiting outside for me it was mahommed ah there is a boy in my taxi he said is wishing you to go to the almenza to meet a girl ive already told him im not interested you should go sir she as something to tell you i hesitated but after all the man was a taxidriver attached to the hotel youll drive me there will you okay sir it wasnt far to the bazaar area and we finished up in a side street that was barely wide enough for the car the almenza was sandwiched between a cobblers shop and a narrow alley the door guarded by a turbanned sudanese i told the driver to wait and the boy took me by the hand and hurried me down the alley and through the black gap of a doorway into a dark passage he left me there and a moment later footsteps sounded highheeled and sharp and then a girls voice low with a peculiarly resonant quality almost husky monsieur she took my hand her fingers hard not caressing through ere pleez a door was pushed open and there were soft lights and the faint beat of western music a jive record playing somewhere in the building a beaded curtain rattled back and we were in a little room no bigger than a cell the floor was bare earth with a rug and a few cushions a naked light bulb dangling from the ceiling showed me my companion i dont know quite how to describe that girl she certainly wasnt beautiful though i suppose that is a matter of taste for she was obviously arab arab mixed with something else european i thought with a touch of the real african she stood very straight with a lithe almost animal grace she was the sort of girl you could picture at the well drawing water and striding across the sand with a pitcher on her head she was that and she was the other sort too the husky voice dropped a shade it would be totally erotic a vicious invitation no point in dramatizing she was just a middle eastern tart but id never met one before and it made an impression we sat crosslegged on the cushions facing each other she wore a queer sort of dress and i had a feeling that at the touch of a secret button shed come gliding out of it like a butterfly out of a chrysalis her hands were pressed tight together and she leaned forward her eyes her lips devoid of invitation hard almost and urgent you know why i ask you to come ere i shook my head you do not guess there was the ghost of a smile on her halfopen lips but when i said no she snapped them shut if you are not the man she blazed if you ave come ere because it is the sort of place at that moment she didnt look at all nice all right she said biting on her teeth you tell me now is it because of david you come to bahrain or not david i stared at her beginning to understand did david come here then of course he was an oilman and this place is for oilmen they ave the same devil in them as other men where the sun is ot but david was nice a vair nice boy she smiled then and the hardness went out of her face leaving it for a moment like a picture of madonnawithchild despite the slightly flattened nose the thickened lips it was a queer face changeable as a childs how did you know i was here on account of david whitaker i asked her it is david whitaker youre talking about she nodded one of them from the godco office is ere las night he tol me about you she didnt say anything after that but sat staring at me with her big dark eyes as though trying to make up her mind about me you like some coffee she asked at length please i needed time and i think shed guessed that she was gone only a few moments but it gave me a chance to collect myself and to realize that she was perhaps the one person in bahrain who could tell me what sort of a man david had become in the four years since id seen him she put the coffee down between us two small cups black and sweet i gave her a cigarette and sat smoking and drinking my coffee waiting for her to start talking i had that much sense if id rushed her shed have closed up on me have you seen his sister she asked finally not yet it wasnt the question id expected but you ave card from her no does she think he is dead i sat there quite still staring at her what else could she think i said quietly and you do you think he is dead i hesitated wondering what it was leading up to his truck was found abandoned in the desert there was a ground and air search i left it at that i ask you whether you think he is dead what else am i supposed to think i dont knowshe shook her head i jus don know he is not the sort of boy to die he believes too much want too much of life what for instance she shook her head slowly i don know what he want is a vair strange boy david he have moods sometimes he sit for hours without saying nothing without moving even at such times he have a great sense ofof tranquillite you understand i have know him sit all night crosslegged and in silence without moving almost a muscle at other times he talk and the words pour out of him and his eyes shine like there is a fever in him what did he talk about she shrugged her shoulders so many words i don understand half of what he say about the desert mostly and the bedou water too he loved water much more than oil i think and the falajes he often talk about the falajes and about saraifa how the desert is moving into the oasis i asked her what the word falaj meant but she couldnt explain it is something to do with water tunnels i think under the ground because he say it is vair hot there like in a turkish bath an there are fishes and when you look up you can see the stars she frowned i dont know what it is but he say once it is like the windtowers at dubai something brought from persia but i have never seen the windtowers at dubai she added and this was in saraifa i asked out saraifa with david it is always saraifa he has a a folie for that place she said it almost sadly and she added he wish to prove something there but what i do not know imself peraps for a while she sat quite still and silent and then she said very softly he was a man with a dream she looked up at me suddenly and dreams don die do they or are mens dreams like the seed in a place like this all barren i didnt know what to answer you loved him did you i asked gently loved she shrugged you want everything black and white what is love between man and woman and in a place like this her shoulders moved again slight and impatient peraps but sometimes he could be cruel he had a vein of cruelty in him like the arabs at other times she smiled he showed me a glimpse of what life could be and when he talked about his dreams then he is near to god you see she added her voice suddenly tense he is important to me the most important thing in my whole life that is why i cannot believe he is dead i asked her when she had last seen him and she laughed in my face you don see a man when he is lying in your arms you feel feel if you are a woman she stared at me and then she giggled like a girl you look so shocked have you never been with a woman like me before but no of course you are english i forget you see i am algerienne from afrique nord all my life i am accustomed to frenchmen and arabs she spat the word arabs out as though she hated them i should have been still in algerie but when the indochina war is on they send us out to saigon a whole planefull of women like me we come down at sharjah because of engine trouble and we are there in the fort for two weeks there i met a merchant from bahrain so i don go to saigon but come ere to bahrain and later i am put into the almenza club as hostess that is ow i come to meet david yes but when did you last see him i asked again in july of las year and it was not ere but at the place where i live that was just before he sailed for dubai oui her eyes were searching my face he was how you say she hesitated searching for a word but then she shrugged vair sad i think he say that there is only one man in the ole world that e can really trust and that this friend is in england didnt he trust his father i asked le colonel she moved her shoulders an expressive shrug that seemed to indicate doubt when i see him that las time he trust nobody out here only this friend in england you are from england and yesterday you are at the companys offices enquiring about david she leaned forward so that the deep line between her full breasts was a black shadow tell me now are you this friend didnt he tell you his friends name no he don say his name or if he do i ave forgot well im his lawyer does that help a man of business yes his executor in fact that means that i carry out his instructions when he is dead and now you carry them out that is why you are ere in bahrain yes are you never his friend before once i said four years ago and i told her how id helped him to get away in the emerald isle evidently she knew this story for she nodded her head several times and her eyes were bright with the memory of his telling of it yes she said when i had finished now i know you are the man and then she leaned forward and gripped hold of my hand where you go now after bahrain she asked you go to find him yes and she added you will give him a message pleez it is important i stared at her her dark face was so intense her belief in his immunity from death so tragic pleez her voice was urgent pleading it is vair important hes dead i reminded her gently she dropped my hand as though she had hold of a snake his truck is found abandoned in the desert that is all she glared at me as though challenging me to destroy her belief that is all you ear me pleez she touched my hand again a gesture of supplication find im for me monsieur there is trouble coming in the desert and he is in danger warn him pleez there was no point in telling her again that he was dead what sort of trouble i asked she shrugged war fighting what other trouble do men make and when i asked her where the fighting was going to break out she said in saraifa i think that is the rumour in the bazaar and that boy who bring you ere akhmed he is the son of a famous pearldiver he knows the naukhudas of all the dhows and there is talk of sambuqs with arms coming across the sea from persia i don know whether it is true or not but that is the talk and ere in bahrain we hear all the talk that is why i ask to see you to tell you that you must warn him he is in great danger because of is father whats colonel whitaker got to do with it i asked he is drilling an oil well in saraifa oh she said angrily the greed of you men money money money you think of nothing else and you must cut each others throats to get more and more but with david it is different he don want money he want something i don know i don know what he want but not money he don care about money it was extraordinary this girl telling me what colonel whitaker was doing confirming what i had already guessed how do you know colonel whitaker is drilling for oil i asked how i tell you this place is for oilmen they ave their intelligence and because they are omesick and half dead with ennui they talk she gave a little laugh there is so much talk in this ouse that i can almost tell you what each oilman eat for breakfast from doha right down the gulf to ras alkhaima i sat for a moment thinking about the rumours shed heard remembering what ruffini had said out there on the jufair jetty you will tell him what i say you will warn him of course what else could i say do you go to saraifa if you go there pleez you should talk with khalid he is the sheikhs eldest son he and david hunted together when he is first in the desert they are like brothers he always say i gave a little shrug how would khalid know how would anybody know what had happened the boy was dead ill see his father i said if i can non non there was urgency a sense almost of fear in her voice i stared at her hard why not but if she knew anything she wasnt saying and because i didnt like the way my thoughts were running i asked her where david had been going that last time she had seen him to dubhai she answered by ship the emerald isle she nodded and after that after dubhai again that slight impatient movement of the shoulders he don say he don tell me where he go was it safaira perhaps i don know theres some suggestion that he was on loan to his father that he was doing a survey for colonel non non again the urgency the leap of something stark in the wide dark eyes cest impossible she shook her head emphatically why is it impossible because she shook her head again he cannot go to work with him i know that now and she added under her breath que le bon dieu le protege i felt i had to know the reason but when i pressed her for it she shied away from the subject i must go now she got to her feet in one easy balanced motion it was as though my questions had started an ugly train of thought as though to admit that hed gone to saraifa to join his father was to admit the fact of his death and as i stood up i was remembering again the nagging suspicion that had been in my mind that day griffiths had come to see me in cardiff au revoir she held out her hand and i was conscious again of the steel grip of those thin fingers you are his friend i know that now and when you find him you will warn him i nodded not saying anything and you can give him my love also she said with a sudden flash of gaiety and then serious again the boy akhmed will be waiting each morning for you at the otel i have arranged it he knows many people and he can help you if you wish and remember please she added this is an island very close to the great deserts of arabia much closer than algerie is to the sahara and the desert is arab your eenglish officials and the oilmen they know only what appen on the surface they can see the bees swarm but they do not know when the old queen die you understand and with that she pulled back the bead curtain and i was out in the passage again where the dance music sounded faintly she took me as far as the alleyway where the boy was waiting and then with a final touch of those fingers a flash of white teeth she was gone it was only after i was back in the car that i realized i didnt know her name i got it from the boy tessa a very european name for a girl of her mixed parentage later i learned that it was a shortened form of tebessa the town on the algeriantunisian border where she had been born i lay awake a long time that night wondering about david about what had really happened three women his mother his sister and now this girl tessa all convinced he was alive and the picture she had sketched of him the warning of trouble brewing i went to sleep with the unpleasant feeling that i was being caught up in the march of events and in the morning mahommed ali drove me to the airport the empty quarter we took off shortly after ten skimming low over sand flats that ran out into the shallows where fish stakes stood in broad arrows the white coral buildings of muharraq vanished behind us and after that the waters of the gulf stretched away on either side a flat sea mirror shimmering in the heat and the colours were all pastel shades the plane was piloted by the canadian i had swum with the previous day otto smith he had joined me on the apron just before takeoff and realizing that id never seen what he called this godforsaken country before he had offered to make it a lowlevel flight we flew in fact at less than a thousand feet a whitewinged dhow swam like a childs toy on the sheet steel surface below and where the water shallowed to islands banked with sand it was translucent green the sand banks sugar white we crossed the qattar peninsula a glimpse of an oil camp the airstrip marked out with oil drums the camp a wheel of concentric buildings and the rig a single lonely tower a sheikhs palace standing on an empty beach square like a military fort the mud of its walls barely discernible against desert sand the palm frond shacks of a barasti fishing village and then the sea again until the white of gypsum appeared on the starboard side and miniature buttes of sand standing out of the water marked the mainland coast of arabia the plane was full of equipment and stores bound for an oil camp along the coast towards ras alkhaima beyond sharjah there were only three passengers besides myself an officer of the trucial oman scouts and two oilmen who were straight out from england and could tell me nothing i sat in silence in a mood of strange elation for the sight of the desert so close below the plane gave me the illusion at least that saraifa was within my reach we followed the coast all the way shallow sand dunes replaced the glare of gypsum flats the coast became dotted with palms and here and there a pattern of nets spread out on the shore to dry marked a fishing village about an hour and a half out otto smith called me forard to look at dubai the venice of arabia he shouted to me above the roar of the engines a broad estuary doglegged through the sandbanks dwindling amongst the towns buildings which crowded down to the waterfront capped by innumerable towers slender like campanili the wind towers that tessa had talked of a simple system of airconditioning brought from persia by the pirates and smugglers of the past ten minutes later we reached sharjah another estuary but smaller and with a sand bar across the entrance and the mud town crumbling to ruin we came in low over a camel train headed south into the desert the glint of silver on guns the flash of white teeth in dark faces and a woman black like a crow with a black mask covering her face riding the last camel watch towers stood lone sentinels against the dunes and far away to the east and southeast the mountains of the jebel were a hazy dustred wall we came to rest close by the white glare of the fort and behind it lay the camp of the trucial oman scouts sharjah fort was like any desert fort only now it was an airlines transit hotel two rusty iron cannon lay in the sand on either side of the arched entrance and all the interior was an open rectangular space with rooms built against the walls otto took me to the lounge and bought me a beer the room was large the walls enlivened with maps and coloured posters the tiled floor gritty with blown sand how long are you going to stay here he asked me and when i said i was waiting for gorde he looked surprised well youre going to have a darn long wait he said how do you mean didnt they tell you he sent a radio message through yesterday to say hed changed his plans hes being flown back to bahrain tomorrow so that was it that was why erkhard had changed his mind a free ride in a company plane and id be in sharjah by the time gorde got back to bahrain thank god you told me in time i said in time oh you mean you want to ride back with me he shook his head sorry fellow i got a full load from ras alkhaima and not to bahrain either to one of the offshore islands and he added its too bad they should have told you i sat staring at my beer momentarily at a loss is there any way i can get to abu dhabi from here today he shook his head anyway you havent a visa have you that was no good then whens the next flight back to bahrain do you know civil oh therell be one through in a day or two the manager will have the flight schedules i asked him then who would be flying gorde back to bahrain but he didnt know might be bill adams might be me he took a long pull at his beer probably me i guess he likes to have me fly him reminds him of the old days when he was boss out here and we flew everywhere together and he began telling me about an old walrus theyd flown in the early days just before the war one of those pushprop amphibians boy we had fun with that old kite and gorde didnt give a damn hed let me slam it down any old place could you give him a message i asked for i was quite certain now that the note id left with erkhards secretary would never be delivered sure what is it i hesitated perhaps id better write it okay you write it then whoever picks him up tomorrow can give it to him his freckled face crinkled in a grin you mightve been waiting here for weeks not that there arent worse places than sharjah to be marooned in this time of year the bathing is wizard know what i think i think that in a few years time this coast will be one of the worlds great winter playgrounds i finished my note whilst he was extolling the tourist attractions of the persian gulf and then he began talking about the strange places he had landed in have you ever been to saraifa oasis i asked him saraifa sure i have we had a concession there once i asked him how far it was to saraifa and he said something over two hundred miles a long way across the desert but less than two hours flying by plane has it got an airfield sure you dont think i walked do you but that was four years ago he added im told the sand has moved in since then funny thing he glanced at me quickly youre out here on account of young whitaker his lawyer that right i nodded well that last time i flew gorde in to saraifa it was the day david whitaker arrived there it was about the last thing gorde did before he handed over to erkhard and went home on sick leave we flew in to saraifa to break it to the sheikh makhmud that the company wasnt going to renew the concession they were arguing about it all evening with that oneeyed devil haj whitaker sitting there like an arab and swearing by the koran that hed get even with erkhard has anybody mentioned the whitaker theory to you i nodded oh well youll know what it meant to the old bedouin then saraifa was his baby hed negotiated the concession and if it hadnt been for erkhard they might have been drilling there now but erkhard was the new broom and if whitaker could have got at him that night i swear hed have killed him with his bare hands it was as elemental as that now of course he added its a different story erkhards under pressure and haj whitaker his navigator called him from the doorway okay eddie be right with you he swallowed the rest of his beer and got to his feet you were saying you were there in saraifa when david whitaker arrived i said oh yes well i was just there thats all he was dressed in bedouin clothes he was very young and he looked scared stiff couldnt blame the poor kid hed never been in arabia before never met his father before and that blackhearted bastard just stared at him as though he wished the floor would open up and swallow him he even introduced the boy to us as david thomas it seemed like he didnt want to acknowledge him as his own son which wasnt very clever of him for the boy had the same cast of features the nose the jaw the heavy eyebrows well i must go now he held out his hand for the envelope dont worry ill see gorde gets it and ill come and rescue you sometime during the week if you havent flown out by gulf airways a wave of the hand and he was gone out through the screen door i was alone then with the posters and the lazy circling flies and the old magazines it was siesta time and after the departure of the plane the fort went back to sleep i was allotted a room and after id had a shower i went up on to the terrace that ran like a broad firing step round the inside of the walls and sat there in a pair of shorts and sunglasses staring at the shimmering line of the mountains down there to the south where the high volcanic peaks disappeared below the sand horizon lay saraifa two hundred odd miles otto had said i remembered griffithss description of conditions in summer hot enough to burn the tyres off a truck and the soles off your boots the heat came up at me with a furnace fierceness and the flat expanse of the airfield lay in miragepools of water but if id been manoeuvred clear of gorde and whitaker was inaccessible there was at least one person available to me here and as the sun sank and the breeze came up damp off the sea i dressed and made enquiries about getting to dubai a lieutenant of the trucial oman scouts who was in the lounge having a drink offered to take me in after the evening meal it was just over twelve miles to dubai out past the sheikhs palace with its string of fairy lights and the hum of its generator and along a winding road beaten out of the sabkhat the road was as black and hard as macadam and all to the right of us were salt flats running out into the sea a thin baked crust treacherously overlaying a slough of mud that was as lifeless as the surface of the moon to the left the desert sand was humped like the waves of a petrified sea and far in the distance the mountains of the jebel purple and remote stood sharpetched on the earths rim as we drove through this empty world i asked the lieutenant whether his outfit was expecting trouble in the interior he laughed were always ready for trouble thats what were for and when i mentioned the rumours circulating in the bazaars of bahrain he said oh you dont want to worry about them bahrains always buzzing with rumours he had a soldiers contempt for civilians and i think he thought i was scared the hospital was a mile or two outside dubai a solitary building sprawled over a sand hill the last glow of the sun had gone the sky fading to darkness and the building stood black against the sand night was falling fast give doc logan my salaams and tell him ill come over tomorrow and help him drink his scotch my lieutenant said and roared off in his landrover towards the distant windtowers of dubai the hospital was a ramshackle building part mud part wood a strange place to meet a girl i hadnt seen for four years she came to the little waitingroom dressed in apron and cap and at the sight of me she stopped and stared in surprise for nobody had bothered to enquire my name mr grant i i cant believe it she came forward and shook my hand well youre not the only one i said i can hardly believe it myself her hand was smooth and dry and firm her face looked thinner and the fat of youth had been worked out of her body her blonde hair was bleached almost white by the sun her skin tanned she looked fit and the shine of youth was still in her eyes it was a strange meeting and for me and i think also for her it brought a feeling of relief for there was that bond between us and from that moment neither of us could feel entirely alone any more it was also to have the effect of making me determined somehow to get to saraifa we cant talk here she said ill be bback in a minute still that slight attractive hesitation in her speech when she returned she had removed her cap and apron and wore a light coat we left the hospital and strolled north whilst the sand turned from brown to silver and the stars came out i held her arm because i felt her need and mine for the touch of companionship and the wind was warm on my face she had received my letter but she hadnt been to bahrain hadnt even written to erkhard what was the use she seemed at first to have accepted the fact of her brothers death and she was quite willing to talk about him and as she talked the picture that emerged was of a man i had only just begun to guess at she had come to dubai two years ago not so much to be near him she had had the sense to realize that she would very rarely see him but because of his fascination for arabia which he had somehow managed to convey to her i was here almost three months before i saw him and then he came without warning he was straight out of the desert from a survey down by the liwa oasis and i didnt recognize him at first he was dressed as an arab you see but it wasnt that she added and he hadnt changed not really she paused there as though collecting the details of that meeting from the recesses of her memory i cant explain it she said finally he was just different thats all he had become a man and there was a remoteness about him do you read the bible mr grant those descriptions of the prophets there was something of that about him he always had enthusiasm a sort of inner fire but now it seemed to have depth and purpose she had only seen him four times in the two years she had been out there but each time her reaction had been the same it was as though he had become dedicated dedicated to what i asked but she couldnt tell me not in so many words to a way of life she said and went on to talk about the influence his father had had on him the relationship hadnt been at all easy at first they started off on the wrong foot you see when david arrived at saraifa sir philip gorde was there with his pilot the driver should have taken david to his fathers house instead he was brought straight to sheikh makhmuds palace it meant of course that his arrival was immediately known to two europeans it complicated the whole thing particularly as david was virtually smuggled into arabia his father thought it due to wilful disobedience and he was furious she smiled at me i think they hated each other at first they were too much alike you see i asked her whether shed met colonel whitaker and she noddedonce just over a year ago hed come to the hospital to see her it was just curiosity she said theres no feeling between us not like there is between him and david davids got much more of his father in him than i have and anyway she added after being so long in arabia he has the native attitude to girls necessary for the procreation of the race but useless otherwise being a nurse i know theyll go to any lengths to get a sick boy to the hospital but a girl child she can die or not just as she pleases i asked her then what impression she had got of her father and she gave a slight shrug theres no love lost between us if thats what you mean yes but whats he like and i explained that i was looking after his financial affairs and had come out partly in the hope of meeting him she didnt answer for a moment as though she had to think about it its odd she said at length hes my own father i know that i think we could both feel that in our bones but it meant nothing she hesitated finally she said my only impression is one of hardness almost of cruelty its the desert i think the desert and the moslem faith and the arabs hes lived with so long hes a little terrifying tall oneeyed imperious hes like an arab but the sheikhs ive met are much softer gentler men more guileful he has a strange quality of command the sort of quality i imagine some of our kings once had when they believed implicitly in the divine right you could never be easy in his company his whole personality it radiates she paused at a loss for words i cant explain it but he frightens me what about david i asked did he feel the same way at first later he came under his spell so that he looked upon him as something akin to god he had been she said under the spell of his father when he had first come to see her he had had six months at saraifa living the life of an arab and a year at an oil school learning to become a geophysicist he had come to her straight from his first experience of field work and was then going on leave to saraifa he talked a lot about saraifa about the way the desert was moving in on the oasis slowly obliterating the date gardens he could be very emotional about it she smiled gently he was like a woman at times the way he wanted to defend saraifa defend it i thought for a moment she was referring to the rumours of trouble from the rub al khali she said from the sand he dreamed of taking a seismological outfit there and proving his fathers theory oil he said was the only hope if he could prove there was oil there then the concession would he renewed and there would be money to rebuild the falajes that word again i asked her what it meant but all she said was its some system for bringing water to saraifa and it has largely been destroyed she sighed and sat down on the sand her hands clasped about her knees i gave her a cigarette and she sat there smoking remembering i suppose the last time they had been together did he ever take a seismological truck into saraifa i asked her she looked at me quickly her eyes big and round in the starlight i think she had forgotten for the moment that i was there i dont know she said and after a long silence she added softly i know so little about him really i dont know what he was doing or why he was so depressed and the truck abandoned like that i know so little and then she looked at me again and said with great emphasis but i know he was a man a real man and also that he would endeavour to the limit for something he believed in saraifa she nodded perhaps for saraifa because of his father she didnt answer for a while at length she said no not because of his father what then the people his friend khalid the sand killing the place i dont know the sand probably that was something physical he was always fascinated by physical things he liked action but he was a dreamer too she nodded yes he was a dreamer too he was always a rebel in the world he knew when we were kids hed escape into a world of his own a mmental world you see it was always much larger than life hed invent games just for the two of us and then later well the gang life attracted him for the same reason it was a form of escape and you think his fathers world saraifa was an escape she shrugged escape or reality what does it matter it was real to him i remember the second time he came to see me he took me to dinner at the fort at sharjah and he was full of plans bubbling over with them he was going to take over from a man called entwhistle who was sick and after that he was going on a months leave to saraifa a busmans holiday he was going to run a survey for his father he was so full of it she said a little sadly and so bloody optimistic she added almost savagely where exactly in saraifa was he going to try for oil i dont know what does it matter was this in july of last year she nodded a glance of surprise he had his own ideas something hed unearthed in some old geological report i couldnt follow it all when hes excited he talks nineteentothedozen and im never certain what is fact and what hes made up he seemed to think he could do in a month what godco had failed to do the whole time theyd had the concession he was always like that he could build a whole kingdom in five minutes in his mind she gave a little laugh once you know he ran a tramp shipping line out of cardiff it got so big that every ship that came into the docks belonged to him that was the first time he got into trouble he beat up a night watchman for telling him to get off the bridge of an old laidup victory ship she sighed that was the sort of boy he was and after hed been to saraifa i asked did he come and see you no he flew straight back to bahrain i didnt see him until december she didnt seem to want to talk about it for i had to drag it out of her yes he had been going to saraifa again she i admitted it reluctantly hed been loaned to his father are you sure i asked i cant be sure about anything but thats what i understood so the times correspondent had been right and i remembered how erkhard had skated round the question it was all so strange she muttered i thought it was what hed been wanting all along instead he seemed i dont know how to put it almost appalled at the prospect he was in a most extraordinary state of nervous tension had he seen erkhard i asked was it erkhard who had loaned him to his father i dont know he wouldnt talk about it he just came to tell me where he was going and what he was doing he didnt stay long in fact she added it was a rather awkward meeting and i had the feeling hed only come because hed felt it was his duty but i was barely listening to her my mind on erkhard and this extraordinary arrangement if it was true then it could only mean one thing that erkhard and whitaker had some sort of an arrangement an improbable combination if otto was to be believed and this was in december she nodded you said youd seen him four times i said when was the fourth the fourth she stared at me and her face looked very pale it was in february she couldnt remember the date but it was early in february i knew then that hed come to her after he had boarded the emerald isle probably that same night because she said she was called out well after midnight by an arab boy and had found him sitting alone on the sand somewhere near here she said looking about her did he talk about his father no she said though she hesitated i think theyd had a row i cant be sure it wasnt anything he said and she added he wasnt very communicative you see i asked her how hed behaved was he scared at all did he behave as though he was in fear of his life she looked at me quickly her eyes searching my face no she said slowly no i dont think he was scared more she shook her head i cant explain he just behaved strangely thats allvery strangely in fact most of the time hed been with her hed sat in absolute silence david could do that as a kid i got used to those silences but i dont know this seemed deeper somehow as though but she couldnt put it into words he didnt talk much she reiterated there was a moon and i remember his eyes riveted on my face it was as though he couldnt look at me enough i felt it was as though he wanted to capture an impression take a sort of mental picture with him it was a very strange uncomfortable feeling and he looked so like his father in the arab clothes he was wearing did he tell you what he was doing no he wouldnt tell me anything but i had the feeling that it was dangerous he was terribly thin nothing but skin and bone and his eyes staring at me looked enormous and very pale in the moonlight when he left he kissed me not with warmth but as though he were kissing a priestess who held the key to the future in her hands and just before he left me he said a strange thing he said whatever you hear of me sue dont believe it and he added that if anything happened to him i was to write to you and then he left me walking quickly across the sand without looking back we were sitting on a little rise and the sand fell away from us sloping gently to a barasti settlement the dark shapes of the palmfrond huts barely visible for the moon was new and only just risen nothing stirred and the only sound was the bleat of a goat i cant believe hes dead she said i wont believe it and because it was what she wanted to believe i told her about the girl in bahrain and about her mothers reaction yes she said mum did everything she could to discourage his interest in arabia but too late when we were small she shared her thoughts with us and her thoughts were of the man she called our uncle charles that album of presscuttings they were almost the first pictures i ever remember looking at and now here we are the two of us in arabia and your father i asked did he talk to you about saraifa to me she smiled and shook her head im only a girl he wouldnt talk to me about what he was doing you say david was loaned to him by godco i prompted she nodded and when i pressed her for the reason she said almost sharply oh his father is doing what hes always done out here dabbling in oil and then almost gently its rather sad really one by one the concessions he negotiated for godco have been abandoned he was once a great figure out here a sort of lawrence she had pity for him even if she had no love and now i asked now she shook her head i dont know david wouldnt talk about him not that last time but there are all these rumours he had this theory you know some say its crazy but ive met others who believed he was right i asked her whether shed met entwhistle i thought perhaps he might have been to see her but she shook her head what about these rumours i said theyre just rumours she shrugged i dont know whether theyre true or not nobody ive met has ever been to saraifa with the border in dispute nobody is allowed to go there its just well the desert is like the sea used to be you know exaggerated stories are passed on by word of mouth i pressed her then to tell me what the stories were and she said hes supposed to be drilling on his own account with an old brokendown rig operated entirely by bedouin the oil boys ive talked to all say thats nonsense that uneducated desert arabs couldnt possibly operate an oil rig but i dont know though im scared of him and have no feeling for him i know hes a remarkable man and youve only got to talk to the officers here to realize that the bedouin are very quick to pick up a working knowledge of machinery she threw the stub of her cigarette away and got to her feet i wish to god i knew what had happened her voice trembled she was very near to tears there was a lot more i suppose she could have told me about him but i didnt press her i thought there was plenty of time and that id see her again for her sake i steered the talk to other things we passed a watch tower standing like a lonely border keep and she told me they were still manned the guard climbing in through the hole halfway up the towers side every night and pulling the ladder up after him it looks so peaceful here i said she laughed it is on the surface but who knows what is going on underneath certainly not our people some of these young english boys who are sent out here to advise she shook her head sometimes i wonder what must the sheikhs think this desert way of life it goes right back to hagar and ishmael racially and culturally hardly changed they know human nature the way these youngsters out from england will never know it theyre full of guile and intrigue the pax britannica even the oil is just an incident in time its only a few years back you know that the sheikh of dubai fell upon an abu dhabi raiding force killing over fifty of them it wasnt very far from here back at the hospital she asked me whether i had arranged transport to get me back to sharjah i can walk i said but she wouldnt hear of it youd lose your way in the dark youd either wander into the desert or else into the sabkhat step through the crust of that and nobody would ever see you again she insisted that i stayed at the hospital they had a small guest room and i spent the night there and in the morning she arranged a lift for me in a tos truck going back to sharjah she looked cool and very matteroffact as she said goodbye to me come and see me again before you leave and if you have any news she left it at that and i sat and watched her from the back of the truck as we drove away a solitary figure in white standing motionless outside the hospital she hadnt moved when i lost sight of her behind a shoulder of sand it was that lack of movement i became suddenly instinctively aware of a loneliness that matched my own and my heart went out to her and as the truck roared along the packed mud surface of the sharjah track it wasnt of the girl who had walked with me in the moonlight on my first night on the edge of the arabian desert that i was thinking but of that other girl the girl who had come to my shabby office in cardiff to plead for help for her brother she was a woman now and though she might not like her father i felt he had given her something of himself that made her like him an unusual person she had courage loyalty and a strange aura of calm an acceptance of life as it was they were qualities both restful and disturbing and remembering every detail of that walk in the sands the watch tower and her perceptive comments on the desert world i knew i didnt want to lose her knew that somehow i must discover what had happened to david and set her mind at rest i was half in love with her i knew that before ever the truck reached sharjah and all that morning i walked filled with a restlessness that was the restlessness of frustration but you could walk for a day and still have no sense of progress in the merciless emptiness of the sea of sand that stretched away to the south i had my lunch in the company of a german commercial traveller and two american tourists staying the night on their way to india the german could talk of nothing but the fact that his product had been copied in karachi and was on sale in almost the identical wrapping in the bazaars of dubai the americans were from detroit plaintive and unable to see any attraction in the untamed beauty of the desert faintly disturbed by the condition of the arabs nostalgic for a hotel that would give them the builtin sense of security of a statler the sound of aircraft coming in low interrupted the desultory conversation ten minutes later the screen door was flung open and otto came in with his navigator hi he waved his hand and came over to me fairy godfather thats me anything you want otto produces it the old mans in the managers office right now gorde he nodded but watch out hes hopping mad about something thanks i said and went across to my room and got my briefcase the managers office was by the arched entrance and seated opposite him in one of the big leather armchairs was a much older man with a yellowish face that was shrivelled like a nut he had a tall glass in his hand and on the floor at his side lay a rubberferruled stick small bloodshot eyes stared at me over deep pouches as i introduced myself he didnt say anything but just sat there summing me up i was conscious at once that this was a very different man to erkhard he looked as though he belonged in the desert a man who had had all the red blood baked out of him by the heat he wore an old pair of desert boots khaki trousers and a freshlylaundered cream shirt with a silk square knotted round his throat like a sweat rag a battered brown trilby the band stained black by the perspiration of years was tipped to the back of his grizzled head you got my message i said he nodded yes i got your message but that wasnt what brought me his voice was dry rasping the words staccato as though life were too short for conversation should be in bahrain now he gave the manager a brusque nod of dismissal and when we were alone he said theres a newspaper on the desk there thats why im here read it ive marked the passage it was the airmail edition of a leading london daily the marked passage was on the foreign news page it was headed new oil discovery in arabia desert death of exborstal boy starts rumours it was written by a special correspondent and besides giving a full and graphic account of david whitakers disappearance and the search that had followed it included his background everything was there everything that i knew about the boy myself his escape from the police in cardiff the fact that he was colonel whitakers son even the details of how hed been smuggled into arabia on a native dhow the story ran to almost a column with a doublecolumn head and about the only thing it didnt give was the location hed been surveying immediately prior to his death well gorde rasped are you responsible for that no then who is that was what i was wondering whoever had written it had access to all the information that i had i dont know i said youre david whitakers solicitor his executor in fact otto tells me yes and just over two days ago you were in london nevertheless im not responsible for it a young kid just out of oil school and operating in an area hed no business in a criminal to boot he glared at me his fingers drumming at the leather arm of the chair the political resident had that paper specially flown down to me at abu dhabi the foreign office has teleprinted him that half the london press have taken the story up hes furious the facts are correct i said the facts but he was thinking of the boys background you know where his truck was found abandoned inside the borders of saudi arabia he almost snarled a story like that it could spark off another buraimi only worse much worse he paused then staring at me curiously your note said you wanted to see me you said it was urgent something about this boy a communication i didnt answer at once for id read through to the end of the newspaper story to the editorial footnote that had been added at the bottom the london office of the gulfoman oilfields development company issued a statement yesterday denying that there was any truth in rumours that the company had made an important new oil strike asked whether david whitaker had made a confidential report prior to his death an official of the company stated categorically that nothing was known in london about any such report despite the companys denials godco shares went ahead yesterday in active dealings on the london stock exchange well suppose theres something in it suppose pigs had wings he snarled well come on man what was it you wanted to see me about for answer i openedmy briefcase and handed over the envelope david had addressed to him have you seen colonel whitaker since youve been out here i asked whats that got to do with it he was staring down at the envelope arid when i started to explain he cut me short oh ive heard the talk if thats what you mean but its nothing to do with the company if charles whitaker likes to waste his money trying to prove a theory he grunted its just damned awkward thats all the boys death makes a colourful story and coming on top of his fathers activities he gave a little shrug and slit open the flap of the envelope with his finger erkhard was trying to keep it quiet and rightly saraifa is a troublespot always has been and the political chaps are touchy about it that doesnt explain why he should try to prevent me seeing you he had taken out a letter and two wads of foolscap whats that what are you talking about he reached into his pocket for his glasses i told him then how id been given facilities for sharjah as soon as it was known that he had changed his plans and was flying back to bahrain what are you suggesting he demanded that erkhard didnt intend us to meet nonsense what difference could it make to him he put on his glasses and after that he didnt talk as he read steadily through the contents finally he said do you know what this is mr grant he tapped one of the foolscap sheets do you know what hes trying to get me to do sign some sort of undertaking but i dont know exactly undertaking he rasped if i sign this he waved the sheet of paper at me it would commit the company to drilling four test wells at locations to be supplied by you he took his glasses off and stared at me is that right you hold the locations yes i said theyre in a separate envelope if you sign that document then im instructed to hand it across to you but not otherwise no and youve got it with you i nodded its here in my briefcase and if i dont sign what do you do then in that case i imagine my actions wouldnt concern you no he laughed and then he was looking down at the document again i see here that you will be acting as agent for sheikh makhmud and his son khalid in this matter have you ever met sheikh makhmud i shook my head and you know nothing about the middle east he was staring at me and his eyes had the suggestion of a twinkle it has its humorous side you know the boy must have thought you a most remarkable lawyer he went back to the document again further it commits the company to the payment of an advance of a hundred thousand pounds in respect of oil royalties of fifty per cent provided always that sheikh makhmud and his son agree to grant to the company the sole concession from date of signature to the year two thousand well he said theres your undertaking the boy must have had a touch of the sun when he typed that and he tossed it across to me read it yourself and tell me what you think of it as a lawyer i glanced through it quickly wondering what he expected me to see in it it looks perfectly legal i said exactly thats what makes it so damned odd hed taken the trouble to look up all the legal jargon for that sort of a document he leaned suddenly forward he couldnt have got that in the desert could he it means he looked it up before ever he went out there before hed even run his survey what are you suggesting that his reports a phoney im not a fool grant that boys been got at and i can guess whos got at him here take a look at the survey report he thrust it at me he used his own typewriter for that the others different probably an office machine he typed that document and then went out into the desert david lost his life as a result of that survey i reminded him did he how do you know what caused his death he glared at me you dont and nor do i nobody knows or even whats happened to him has anyone mentioned the whitaker theory to you i know about it i said is that why you think hes been got at he nodded way back in the thirties charles whitaker began claiming that wed find the oilfields continuing down from the gulf here between the sand seas of the empty quarter and the coastal mountain ranges to the east it seemed a possibility and remembering how holmess theory had finally been proved right in bahrain i took a chance on it and moved some of my development teams in from the coast it was an expensive business and buraimi was about the limit from the practical point of view i was operating partly in the sharjah sheikhdom and partly in muscat territory and after id burned my fingers even the big companies like shell and aramco wouldnt look at his theory that was a long time ago now i said yes before the war what about saraifa did you do any development work there no it was too far from the coast i sent a geological party in but the initial reports werent very encouraging and then the war came and the chap in charge of the survey was killed we didnt try again though charles was always pressing us to do so he had a political appointment for a short time after the end of the war but when he rejoined the company in he was still just as convinced that hed be proved right in the end he shook his head poor fellow it had become an obsession saraifa in particular he wanted us to try again there the wartime development of desert transport made it a practical proposition but the political situation between saraifa and hadd was worsening and anyway id lost faith in his theory by then he stared at the foolscap sheets in my hand if that survey report had been turned in by one of our most experienced geophysicists i wouldnt touch it because of the political factor no not just because of the political factor what then he hesitated because it doesnt fit in with the reasons im out in the gulf area he stared at me then his eyes narrowed above the tired pouches of flesh the fact is he said the companys been spending too much money out here and getting too little in return nobody is supposed to know this yet not even erkhard though i think hes guessed my instructions are to carry out a thorough investigation of all our development projects in the gulf with a view to cutting down our commitments it amounts to a reassessment of the value of each project and those that show no real promise of yielding results are to be abandoned so you see he gave a little shrug his hands spread out this is hardly the moment for me or anybody else to involve the company in new commitments i see there was really nothing more to be said and i folded the papers and put them in my briefcase its a funny thing he was leaning back in his chair his eyes halfclosed chuckling to himself the company did this once before they sent alex erkhard out and because i was sick and hadnt the energy to fight him he got my job and now four years later im back with the same powers he had and the knowledge that hes made more mistakes than i did and lost the company a lot of friends again that dry rasping chuckle and then his eyelids flicked back what ive told you is in the strictest confidence you understand youve been put to a lot of trouble to contact me i thought it only fair to explain the situation to you if its any satisfaction to you id add that a report like that isnt conclusive seismology never is its simply an indication the only way to be sure youre sitting on an oilfield is to drill down and find out and suppose whitakers doing just that hmm to know the answer to that wed have to know the locations the boy was surveying and where his fathers drilling he stared at me well there it is youve got your instructions i nodded there was no point in continuing the discussion youre going back to bahrain i take it sir philip bahrain oh youd like a lift in my plane is that it i nodded please he seemed to hesitate but then he said all right he picked up his drink you know my pilot otto smith perhaps youd be good enough to get him for me he tapped his leg cant move about like i used to ill get him i said and i went out and left him there leaning back in the chair with his eyes halfclosed as though exhausted i had some difficulty in finding otto but eventually i ran him to earth in the showers sitting naked smoking a cigarette and gossiping with the navigator i waited whilst he dressed and then went back with him to the managers office gorde was in the same position but now he had my briefcase open on his lap and he was peering down at a sheet of paper he held in his hand i cant remember what i said to him i was too angry i think i called him some pretty unpleasant names but all he said was what did you expect me to do his tone was mild almost he seemed amused if id asked you to let me see the locations youd have refused quite rightly and he added i just wanted to check them against the position where his truck was found but youve no right of course id no right he said but yelling at me and getting yourself into a muck sweat wont alter the fact that i now have them do you know where they are he asked peering up at me no i said i havent had an opportunity on the saraifahadd border right bang on the bloody border he glared at me i suppose youll tell me you didnt know that the border was in dispute the way he said it implied that id tried to put something over on him angrily i told him that i didnt have the advantage of his lack of scruples i kept strictly to my instructions and refrained from opening the envelope until id seen you all right he said well talk about it in a moment he levered himself round in his chair is the plane refuelled yet otto i dont know sir ill check if you like are you wanting to leave right away yes right away but first i want you to check that your tanks are full a personal check please youve got to have enough fuel on board to fly to the saraifa border and back im afraid we have to have authority to fly to saraifa sir philip since when otto hesitated i dont know exactly since the trouble there i guess it was just after you left a border clash between saraifa and hadd they had to send the trucial oman scouts in and since then nobody has been allowed to go to saraifa gorde gave a little sigh lets not argue about it otto i intend to have a quick look at these locations now then how do we go about it without some little clerk reporting my movements to the prpg eh otto thought for a moment i think the best thing would be to say were doing a recce of certain areas taking a look at a seismological outfit weve got operating at the foot of the jebel possibly landing at ras alkhaima if weve time otherwise returning here if we make it vague like that i guess itll be all right that is so long as you dont want to land at saraifa i dont know what i want to do gorde grumbled havent had time to think about it yet he poked around in my briefcase until he found a sheet of plain paper communications here still functions for civilian messages doesnt it and when the other nodded he pulled a gold pencil from his pocket and began to write i watched him as he signed his name and read it through i was more curious than angry now hed taken matters out of my hands and for the moment my only concern was to get on this flight have communications send that off right away he held out the message then check your fuel oh and otto he added as the pilot was leaving well be flying on to bahrain tonight the door closed and he turned to me i suppose you think i owe you an apology hm he handed me back my briefcase well maybe i do but i spent a lot of my time in saraifa and anyway im an oilman weve no builtin moral code like you boys when it comes to things like locations he folded the foolscap sheet and put it back in its envelope and sat there tapping it against his thumbnail lost in thought its just possible i suppose he said it softly speaking to himself that colonel whitakers drilling one of these locations but he shook his head in that area he wouldnt be such a fool silence again and the rhythmic tapping of that envelope however the small bloodshot eyes peered at me curiously and then he began to chuckle a provincial lawyer and its just possible you might have got hold of the thing the company has been searching the gulf for during almost thirty years the rasp of that chuckle seemed to threaten to choke him you and charles whitaker god almighty he gasped and that boy hed never have dared operate on that border on his own you think they were together then how the hell do i know he handed me the envelope i dont know where charles is drilling any more than you do im not even certain he is drilling its just rumours he reached for his stick and dragged himself to his feet but i mean to find out he said if charles is drilling on these locations he let it go at that and since he seemed to take it for granted that i was going with him i stuffed the envelope into my pocket picked up my briefcase and followed him to the door as he pulled it open he said to me over his shoulder prove whitakers theory correct and on that border and youll be in politics so deep my friend that youll wish youd never been born but i cant believe it he added limping out into the bright sunshine tigheaded proud revengeful he still couldnt be such a bloody fool and he stumped off across the courtyard shaking his head and muttering to himself we took off ten minutes later and by then id had an opportunity to glance at the contents of that envelope there were several foolscap sheets headed report of surveys carried out on saraifa territory and it was subheaded basis on which an immediate programme of test drilling is recommended at points a b c d pinned to it were four sheets of graph paper covered with figures and diagrams there was also a sketch map giving his survey points a whole series of them each with the position pinpointed in latitude and longitude a number of arab names were given but none that i could recall from my brief examination of the map in erkhards office points a b c d were marked in red ink they were very close to each other in a little huddle at the eastern end of the line of his survey there was no covering letter just the report and the sketch map i read the report through carefully as we flew south into the desert it was typewritten highly technical quite beyond my comprehension for this reason i do not intend to give the details but there were several references to the whitaker theory and right at the beginning there was a paragraph that read it should not be imagined that i stumbled on this by accident if anything comes of it the credit must go to henry fan he surveyed the area in the very early days of the war the saraifa concession was fairly new then and fans outfit was the only survey team in the area moreover he made his report at a time of crisis in the middle east it was pigeonholed away in the companys headquarters and shortly afterwards he died fighting in abyssinia i was fortunate enough to come upon this report when searching old surveys for anything that had a bearing on saraifa i leaned back in my seat thinking about the war and how that old report had got lost in the files colonel whitaker had fought in eritrea the same area i wondered whether he and farr had ever met i was thinking about that when gorde leaned across to me well he said what are you going to do about that report when you get back to bahrain he was smiling tightlipped the boys like his father he grunted a dreamer the same dream too the dreams of youth sometimes come true i said i was remembering how sue had talked of him his eyes clouded and he looked away from me staring out of his window towards the mountains ah yes the dreams of youth he gave a little sigh but the boys dead and charles isnt a young man any more and what about farr i asked he shrugged hes dead too you dont think they could be right the whitaker theory he gave a snort charles had a nose for oil a sort of instinct for it like holmes but he didnt know a damn thing about geology that nose of his cost the company a lot of money we struck oil but never in large enough quantities i should know he almost snarled i backed him and it cost me my job out here and i loved it he added quietly i love this country look at it he leaned across pointing to the desert that lay below the wingtip a corrugated dune sea stretching to the mountains that lay all along the horizon clean and hard and cruel i had twenty years of it i know it better than i know my own country and it calls to me the way the sea calls to a sailor and im stuck in a damned office in london i havent been out here for almost four years and he relapsed into silence staring out of his window but a moment later he touched my arm and pointed downwards a great sweep of dunes thrust eastwards narrowing like a finger till the tip of the yellow sand touched the red rock wall of the mountains right below us a black line wound like a thread across the dunes a camel caravan going south and leaving a faded snaillike smudge behind it in the sand the ramlah anej he said in my ear were crossing the eastern edge of the rub al khali and ft he added with a sort of boyish delight im one of the very few men whove crossed the empty quarter by camel charles and i did it together we said we were looking for oil but that was just an excuse he was smiling and his eyes were alight with the memory of it so that through age and illness i got a glimpse of the young man hed once been after that he fell silent and left me alone with my thoughts as the aircraft roared steadily south the mountains always away to the left always marching with us a moonmad landscape of volcanic peaks sometimes near sometimes receding to the lip of the earths surface and below us the sun marked the desert floor with the imprint of our plane a minute shadow dogging our course it was just after four when the navigator came aft and woke gorde who had fallen asleep with the curtain drawn across his window and his battered hat tipped to shade his eyes jebel alakhbar coming up now sir otto wants to know whether youd like to fly over hadd or make a detour may as well have a look at the emirs hideout gorde murmured rubbing the sleep out of his eyes long time since i last saw it he got to his feet and motioned me to follow him the view from the flight deck was a blinding glare made bearable only by the green shade above the pilots head all away to the right of us was sand as far as the eye could strain a petrified sea corrugated by the action of the wind but from the left mountains were closing in bare black lavaash mountains marked by patches of a livid chemical green they swept round ahead of us in a long curve terminating abruptly at the sand seas edge in a bold headland topped by a pinnacle of bare rock jebel alakhbar gorde said nodding towards it over the pilots head theres an old stone fort on the top of it and the town of hadd is right underneath remarkable place theres a saying amongst the arabs of this part who holds alakhbar holds hadd youll see in a minute otto was pushing the control column forward and as we lost height the headland began to come up fast see the fort gordes hand gripped my arm i got a gazelle there once the emir invited us hunting and a saluki bitch named adilla cornered it for me right under the walls there my first visit to saraifa he added the time we signed the original concession i could see the fort clearly now a biggish place crumbling into ruin with an outer ring of mud and rock walls and in the centre a single watch tower perched high on a pinnacle of rock we skimmed it with about a hundred feet to spare and on the farther side the hill dropped sheer to a valley shaped like a crescent moon and halfringed with mountains the valley floor was flat a patchwork quilt of cultivation date palms grey with dust stood thick as indian corn in mudwalled enclosures and there were fields of millet green with new growth in the further reaches of the valley where cultivation dwindled into grey volcanic ash a solitary sanddevil swirled a spiral of dust high into the air hadd gorde stabbed downwards with his thumb and peering over his shoulder i caught a glimpse of a mud town that seemed built into the rock below the fort right below us a melee of men and goats and camels stood transfixed beside a well mud walls towered above them and looking back i saw the town of hadd climbing into its rocky cleft with a great fortified palace built on many levels facing towards the desert a green flag fluttered from a flagpole always reminds me of the hadhramaut gorde shouted in my ear they build like that in the wadi duan wellsited isnt it he might have been a soldier his interest was so professional otto halfturned in his seat im setting course now for the position given in the search report that okay and when gorde nodded he banked the plane so that i had a last glimpse of the wadi hadd alakhbar a little oasis of green set against a nightmare backdrop of volcanic rock and then it was gone and the arid lifeless desert stretched out ahead of us gorde produced the slip of paper hed used for making notes and handed it to the navigator those are the fixes for the saraifahadd border locations plot them now well be flying over them as soon as weve had a look at the spot where he abandoned his truck we flew on in silence then and gradually the gravel plain gave place to sand the dunes getting higher their shadows longer until they were towering crescentshaped downlands stretching into infinity the navigator passed otto an alteration of course and the shadow of the plane came ahead of us growing imperceptibly bigger as we lost height have we crossed the border the navigator nodded just crossing it now gordes hand gripped my elbow thats the trouble with this damned country he said the borders are nothing but map references nobody cared so long as it was just a waste of desert sand but you try explaining map references to an arab sheikh once hes dazzled by the prospect of oil the navigator leaned across and made a circling movement with his hand otto tipped the plane over on the port wingtip and we searched the glaring dunes below us we circled like that slowly for several minutes ana then suddenly we straightened out swooping down towards the humped back of a dune and there halfway up it was the truck almost obliterated by sand i never saw such a desperately lonelylooking object in my life a piece of dead machinery lying there like a wrecked boat in the midst of an ocean of sand we slid down on to it like a hawk stooping to its prey it was a big closedin truck old and battered looking and patched with rust there were no markings on it and as it rushed away beneath us gorde echoed my own thoughts what was the fool doing driving that truck alone into these dunes he demanded do you know he was glaring at me and when i shook my head he grunted as though he didnt believe me a good twenty miles west of the survey locations he growled he must have had some reason otto banked steeply so that the truck was there just beyond the port wing for us to stare at but looking at it couldnt explain its presence on the slope of that dune and in the end gorde gave instructions for us to proceed to the locations david had surveyed and motioned me to follow him back into the relative quiet of the passenger cabin well he said dropping into his seat what do you make of it eh but i could see he didnt expect an answer he was slumped in his seat an old man lost in thought doesnt make sense does it he grumbled the boy dead somewhere down there below us and his father not caring a damn and busy drilling a well he turned to me how did they get on those two do you know what were their relations just prior to the boys death and when i didnt say anything he snapped come on man you must know something youve come all the way out from england you wouldnt have done that unless you knew a little more than youve told me he stared at me angrily have you seen his sister i nodded well what does she say about it he must have talked to her shed like to think hes still alive what in this country and the truck lying there on that dune for almost two months shes never been into the desert no of course not he asked me again what she had said about him and whilst i was telling him the desert below gradually changed the dunes altering shape until they were long ridges like waves with gravel flats in the troughs i was just telling him about the last visit david had made to his sister when the plane gave a lurch the port wing tipped down and over gordes shoulder i caught a glimpse of tyre marks running straight like the line of a railway along the length of a flat stretch between two dunes a pile of rusted tins the black trace of a fire the remains of a dug latrine they were there for an instant and then the plane straightened up and we flew on following the tyre marks that had scored a straight line wherever the sand was soft gorde got up then and i followed him forward indications of another camp came up at us swept by beneath the plane we were flying very low the line of the dunes on either side closing us in and then straight ahead the black shadow of a truck it was stationary and we came up on it fast belly to the gravel flat roaring over it so close that i could read the black lettering on its side godco and could see the drill at its rear turning it was the same sort of truck as the one we had seen abandoned a short while back and as we turned and came down on it again a figure in khaki shorts and an australian bush hat waved to us there were arabs moving about by the drill and close by the truck was a landrover with godco painted across its bonnet gorde swung round on me what the devils a seismological truck doing here did you know it was here of course not for one wild moment i thought those three women might be right and i almost tore the glasses from gordes hand but the khaki figure was broad and thickset the round brickred face covered with ginger hair gorde tapped otto on the shoulder can you land here he demanded i want to talk to that man who is it do you know looks like jack entwhistle otto answered and he swung the plane over again circling back with the wingtip almost scraping the top of the dunes he was flying with his eyes glued to his side window searching the ground looks okay he said no big stones no wadis that i can see i guess i can get down dont know how it will be taking off again gorde didnt even hesitate then put her down he said his face had gone a sickly yellow he was furious hold tight then the plane banked again came in level over the flat gravel pan and i felt the drag as the flaps and undercarriage went down he flew about half a mile with the ground so close that we might have been in a car then he gave her full throttle lifted her up and round in a turn that left my stomach behind me we came back on to the line of the gravel slow and dropping this time with the truck standing bang in our path the wheels touched bounced once on a rough patch and next time we stayed down bumping heavily over the rough surface stones rattling against the outside of the fuselage until the brakes came on and we slowed to a halt we were about three hundred yards from the truck and the man who had waved to us was already in the landrover coming towards us by the time the navigator had got the fuselage door open the landrover was drawing up alongside the air that came in through the open door was hot with the glare of sun on sand there was no wind and the heat seemed trapped between the dunes gorde moved awkwardly down the fuselage supporting himself with his hands on the backs of the seats he looked tired and old and very grim as he faced the man who came in from the desert entwhistle isnt it thats raight sir philip the man was north country square and stocky the eyes grey in the red dustfilmed face he looked pleased its grand to see you out here again sir how are you he wiped his hand on the seat of his shorts and held it out gorde ignored the hand ignored the warmth and friendliness of the others tone who gave you orders to run a survey here entwhistle hesitated dropped his hand he looked momentarily offbalance uncertain of himself was it erkhard no sir to be honest sir philip nobody gave me orders then what the hell are you doing here youre a hundred miles from your survey area aye i know that he ran his hand a little nervously over his face it isnt easy to explain you see he hesitated i was the chap who carried out the ground search for david whitaker you know about that do you gorde nodded go on he said his voice flat and make it short i havent any time to waste but entwhistle wasnt the sort of man to be browbeaten if it comes to that sir philip i dont have any time to waste myself i want to run this survey and get the hell out of here as fast as i can his tone was obstinate this isnt what youd call a healthy place i got here two days ago and we hadnt been camped twentyfour hours before we had a visit from a bunch of bedou they didnt behave like nomads more like the emirs men though were still in saraifa here the saraifa concession was abandoned four years ago gorde said sharply youve no right here none whatever im well aware of that sir philip then why are you here entwhistle hesitated rubbing gently at a desert sore that showed red and ugly beneath the sweat stain of his right armpit you never met david whitaker did you sir whats that got to do with it oh well he hesitated and then unable apparently to put it into words he sought refuge in facts i couldnt exactly say it in my report of the search it would have put the company on the spot if you see what i mean but there was something fishy about that truck there on a sand dune across the border into saudi there was nought wrong with it mechanically you know it was just out of fuel as though hed driven it straight into the empty quarter until hed no more petrol and if youd known david again the hesitation and then a quick shrug he knew the desert knew it a damn sight better than ill ever know it what was he doing there thats what id like to know if hed been scared out of here by the emirs men why didnt he head for saraifa come to the point gorde said impatiently i want to know why youre here aye well i went over every inch of that truck i thought if thered been foul play or anything like that hed have left some clue something that a chap like myself a fellow geophysicist would understand the only thing i found was an old attache case full of correspondence and copies of survey reports one of those reports concerned this area i dont seem to remember reading that in the account you sent to erkhard no you thought youd keep it to yourself eh thought youd check on his findings on the quiet entwhistle scratched uncomfortably at the sore he was on loan to his father you see it didnt concern the company exactly and he seemed so sure hed it never occurred to you i suppose that theres a political factor entwhistles grey eyes stared at gorde without flinching david whitaker was a good bloke i dont know whether he sent a copy of that survey report to the bahrain office or not and i dont care nobody had done anything about it not even his father he was out on his own and he thought he was on to something i spent the better part of a week searching the desert for his body and it seemed to me if i couldnt give him a headstone i might at least see if he was right and we could name an oilfield after him maybe it sounds a little crazy to you sir philip he added almost belligerently but i just felt it was up to me to do something i dont like to see a good chaps life thrown away for nothing and if erkhard kicks me off the companys payroll as a result i shant cry my eyes out gorde didnt say anything for a moment he seemed lost in thought how far have you got with the check he asked at length there are four locations given as probable anticlines in the report ive done a check on the most southeasterly location d he called it now ive just begun drilling the first shothole on location c if you care to come to the truck i can show you david whitakers report or has mr erkhard already shown it to you no he hasnt nevertheless gorde added ive seen a copy grant here was kind enough to show it to me this on a note of irony and he introduced me then a lawyer like you he wants to know what young whitaker was doing across the border into saudi he turned to me i dont suppose youve ever seen a seismological truck have you and when i shook my head he said well if you want to see the sort of work david whitaker was engaged on im sure entwhistle would show you over his vehicle he turned back to entwhistle no point in stopping you in the middle of drilling a shothole you can finish the check on your location c then youre to pull out understand yes sir relief and something akin to affection showed for an instant in entwhistles face results to be sent direct to me and now take grant to your truck and show him how it works meanwhile ill write a letter for you to sheikh makhmud just in case i dont doubt he knows youre here he stood back from the door ten minutes he said to me all right and then i want to find charles whitakers rig find out why he isnt drilling here if his son was so damn sure i nodded i didnt even hesitate i was being given the opportunity of ten minutes alone with entwhistle i jumped out of the plane and it was like jumping into the full glare of an openhearth furnace entwhistle remained a moment talking to gorde and when he joined me in the landrover he glanced at me curiously so that i wondered what gorde had told him about me stones rattled against the rusted mudguards as we batted over the gravel towards the truck which seemed to be standing in a pool of water the mirage only lifted when we were within a hundred yards of it i was more interested in entwhistle than in the mechanics of his seismological equipment and as soon as we were in the shade of the trucks interior i asked him what he thought had happened to david i suppose theres no chance that hes still alive it didnt seem to surprise him that id made the suggestion did you see my personal report to erkhard or was it some sort of a composite thing rehashed by the bahrain office he asked it was a general report i told him aye i thought so theyll be letting the dust collect on mine in some pigeonhole cant blame them i made it pretty plain what i thought he hesitated rubbing his hand across the ginger stubble on his chin a rum do and no mistake there was that truck halfburied in sand and about forty miles from the nearest waterhole and nothing wrong with the damned thing but lack of petrol even the spare jerrycans were empty what are you suggesting i asked he hesitated i dont rightly know he muttered eyeing me cautiously but i know this he added with sudden violence a chap like david doesnt drive into waterless desert with empty fuel cans and to run out of juice just there except for the centre of the empty quarter he couldnt have picked a spot that was much farther from water he stared at me and i think we were both thinking the same thing for he said id like to know what his father thinks about it in fact when ive finished here i intend to drive over to saraifa and see if the old bedou knows he stopped and cocked his head on one side listening faint through the noise of the drill came the distant sound of an engine i didnt understand at first but then it grew louder overtopping the noise of the drill and in a sudden panic of realization i dived for the door just in time to see the plane become airborne it passed so low over the top of the truck that i instinctively ducked and as i straightened up i was cursing myself for a fool i should have known i should have realized gorde might want to get me out of the way i turned furiously on entwhistle who was standing in the doorway of the truck looking slightly uncomfortable you knew about this aye he told me he smiled a little doubtfully he asked me to give you his apologies for any inconvenience god rot the old man i muttered savagely to be caught like that to be fooled into thinking he was just trying to be helpful and all the time i stared at the plane which was rapidly dwindling to a speck feeling suddenly helpless isolated out here in an ovenhot world that i didnt understand a day or two he said entwhistle murmured apologetically thats all ill try and make it as pleasant as possible the plane had altered course i saw it circle once and then it was heading back towards us and for a wild moment i thought perhaps hed changed his mind it came in low flying slowly with the flaps down but the undercarriage remained up as it bumbled close over our heads something white fluttered down from the pilots window and then it turned and disappeared low over the dunes and the sound of it was lost again in the noise of the drill entwhistle was already running to retrieve the object they had dropped to us he came back with a cigarette packet and a crumpled sheet of paper all right you can stop drilling he shouted he repeated the order in arabic and as the drill slowed to an abrupt silence he handed me the paper on it was written in pencil stop drilling and proceed at once to saraifa concentration of armed tribesmen camped in the dunes two miles north of you warn sheikh makhmud and give him my salaams philip gorde a chill feeling crept up my spine as i read that message and entwhistles comment did nothing to restore my morale bit of luck the old man flying down here he flipped the coin that otto had used to weight the packet mightnt have seen the sun rise tomorrow otherwise it came as a shock to me to realize that he was perfectly serious they would have attacked you i asked slit our throats probably he sounded quite cheerful but i looked about me at the dunes asleep in the heat of the day the furnacehot world of the desert all around me quiet and peaceful it was hard to believe but youre still on saraifa territory i said he shrugged the emir would dispute that and the political boys all those bloody old etonians they dont want any trouble my names going to be mud he stared down at the coin in his hand and then he put it in his pocket and set about organizing the packing up of the outfit leaving me standing there feeling slightly lost a stranger in a strange world the doomed oasis his crew were all arab and they went about the business of breaking camp noisily but efficiently they had done it many times in fact it seemed a natural process out there amongst the dunes they were mostly young men a colourful mixture of race and dress their teeth flashing white in their dark faces as they fooled around making light of the work they were fit and full of life and laughter they had a football which they kicked at each other periodically the guttural arab tongue coming in staccato bursts from their lips there was nothing for me to do and i sat perched on the landrovers mudguard watching them and looking around me at the surrounding country there was a dune i remember that ran away into the distance like the prescelly hills north of st davids i was looking at it thinking of holidays i had spent in that part of wales and suddenly my eyes became riveted on a dark speck that showed for an instant on its back it vanished almost immediately so that i thought my eyes had played me a trick in that shimmering heat it was difficult to be sure and then it showed again nearer this time i could have sworn it was a man moving below the crest of the dune i was just on the point of telling entwhistle that he had a visitor when i was jolted off my seat the clang of metal against metal was followed instantly by the crack of a rifle and i was looking down at a hole the size of my fist in the side of the landrovers bonnet for an instant everything was still there was no sound no movement entwhistle and his arabs just stood there shocked into immobility staring at that hole in the side of the landrover then entwhistle shouted something rifles cracked from the top of the dune little spurts of sand were kicked up round us a bullet ricocheted off the trucks drill and went whining past my head entwhistle flung himself at the landrover jump in he shouted his crew were running for the truck another bullet smacked into the landrover so close that the wind of it fanned my trouser legs and then i heard shouts saw men running towards us from the line of the dunes the engines burst into life drowning all other sounds i dived for the seat beside entwhistle as he slammed the landrover into gear two arabs landed almost on top of me as the vehicle jerked forward behind us the truck was moving too and beyond its lumbering shape i caught a glimpse of longhaired tribesmen dropping on to their knees aiming their rifles but i never heard the shots all i could hear was the revving of the engine as entwhistle ran through the gears a moment later and we were clear out of their range the two arabs sorted themselves out and i turned to entwhistle his foot was hard down on the accelerator and his lips were moving the bastards he was saying the bloody bastards and then he looked at me dumdum bullets his face was white under the sunburn they cut them across to make them soft nosed blow a hole in you the size of a barn door it was this rather than the attack that seemed to outrage him who were they i asked and was shocked to find that i hadnt proper control over my voice the emirs men they must have seen the plane turn back and realized we were being warned of their presence he turned to make certain that the truck was following fine introduction youve had to desert life he grinned but not very certainly he shouted something in arabic to the two men perched on the baggage behind and they answered him with a flood of words shortly afterwards he pulled up the truck drew up beside us its engine throbbing excited arab faces looking down at us all talking at once he got out then and spoke to the driver walked all round the truck and then came back and lifted the bonnet of the landrover look at that he said i got out and my legs felt weak as i stared at the hole that first bullet had made little bits of lead were spattered all over the engine bastards he said and slammed the bonnet shut well it might have been worse i suppose nobodys hurt and the vehicles are all right it was only after wed got moving again that i realized the windscreen in front of me was shattered little bits of glass were falling into my lap i kept my eyes halfclosed until i had picked out all the bits how far is it to saraifa i asked him not much more than forty miles by air i gathered it was a good deal more the way wed have to go for the dunes ran southeast and we had to get east might make it shortly after dark if we dont get bogged down too often it was just after fourthirty then we kept to the gravel flats between the dunes travelling at almost thirty miles an hour the air that came rushing in through the shattered windscreen was a hot searing blast that scorched the face the ground was hard as iron crisscrossed with innumerable ridges over which the landrover rattled in an endless series of backbreaking jolts in these circumstances conversation wasnt easy the wind of our movement the noise of the engine the rattle of stones we had to shout to make ourselves heard and entwhistle wasnt a talkative man hed lived on his own too much besides he had a north countrymans lack of imagination he even used the word humdrum when i asked him about his job and yet i got the impression that he loved it but it was the job not arabia he loved hed no feeling for the country or its people more than once he used the contemptuous term wogs when speaking of the arabs but though he wouldnt talk about himself much he was quite prepared to talk about david he had met him three times in all once in bahrain and then later when he was sick and david had relieved him queer chap he said fact is i didnt like him much when he came out to take over my outfit but then he added you dont like anybody very much when youre suffering from jaundice but you felt differently about him later i prompted aye got to know him a bit better then we were two days together whilst we moved to a new location then he went off to saraifa hed got some leave due and he was going to spend it mucking around with an old seismological truck his father had got hold of i asked him what had made him change his mind about david and he said oh the way he talked he was a great talker mind you he added he was still too chummy with the wogs for my liking but you couldnt help admiring the chap wanted to make the desert blossom and all that water i asked he nodded thats it hed got a bee in his bonnet about it talked about saraifa being doomed well of course it is ive only been there once butwell youll see for yourself a few more years he didnt talk for a while after that for we had come to soft sand he took it fast his foot pressed hard down on the accelerator and we bucketed through it like a small boat in a seaway we came off the sand on to a hard gravel pan that scintillated with a myriad diamond gleams mica he shouted the glare of it was dazzling you interested in geology i shook my head pity he seemed genuinely sorry damned interesting country for him there was nothing else of interest in arabia we bucked another stretch of sand ridged into shallow waves and then he told me what had decided him to check davids survey report amongst the papers in that attache case he had found farrs report didnt tell the old man thought id keep it in reserve god knows where david dug it up it was twenty years old the paper all faded the typing too could hardly read the damned thing have you got it with you i asked aye he nodded i wasnt going to leave that behind ill show it to you later cant think why the company didnt do something about it there was a war on i said and farr was killed in abyssinia you know about it then he seemed surprised david referred to it in his report oh yes of course we hit another patch of sand a solid vista of it that stretched interminably ahead of us we didnt talk much after that it was soft sand and the going was tough twice the seismological truck got bogged down and we had to lay sand mats the sun sank slowly down into the desert behind us as we ploughed on engines roaring radiators steaming we were in big dune country that was like a huge petrified sea the waves coming up one after the other yet never moving always motionless and the shadows lengthening behind them it had an eerie still quality and it left me with a sense of awe for it had a certain majesty a cruel lost quality that was unnerving once i shouted is it like this all the way to saraifa christ i hope not he yelled back but dont you know i asked how the hell should i never been here before the sun set a brickred ball of fire hazed it seemed with dust here and there we came upon the derelict remains of trees gnarled and twisted in a lifelong struggle against crippling odds dusk descended swiftly and the light faded out of the dunes behind us they stood like downlands etched sharp against the skys last light above us the stars suddenly appeared again the truck behind us became bogged and we dug the sand mats down in front of the wheels and pushed and strained to gain a few yards and when at last we got it moving there was no light left and it was dark will you be able to find saraifa in the dark i asked entwhistle inshallah he said and we pushed on how he did it i dont know but about an hour later the dunes became smaller the stunted treegrowth more noticeable and then suddenly we ran out on to hard gravel again and shortly after that the headlights picked up the first of the date gardens a sad relic of a once fertile place the walls no longer visible just the starved tops of the palms sticking up out of the sand we passed between two of these ruined gardens and then we joined a wellworn track where the sand had been ground to a fine powder there were the marks of tyres the droppings of camels the headlights picked out the round bulk of a watch tower with men running from it their guns gleaming with silver furnishings entwhistle slowed as they stood barring our path they wore turbans and long white robes and strapped across their shoulders was a sort of harness of leather studded with the brass of cartridges stuffed into their belts were the broad curvedbladed khanjar knives the hilts of silver glinting wickedly as we stopped they came swarming over us enveloping us with their harsh guttural speech all talking at once white teeth flashing in villainous dark faces what do they want a blackbearded ruffian had the muzzle of his gun jammed against the side of my neck and though i tried to keep my voice under control i dont think i was very successful all right all right entwhistle was shouting at them one at a time for gods sake he didnt seem in the least bit scared finally after a long conversation with my bearded friend he said it looks like trouble were more or less under arrest he spoke to the bearded arab again and then he was ordering men on to the landrover and others to the truck behind it seems he said as we moved off that sheikh makhmud sent a party out in two landrovers this afternoon to arrest my outfit and bring me back to saraifa for questioning and he added this could be the sort of thing david came up against theyre scared stiff of the emir and frightened to death of any activity on the hadd border didnt you know that before you decided to run a survey there i asked of course i did but i was reckoning to run the survey and get out before anyone discovered i was there he crashed the gears savagely i took a chance and it didnt come off thats all we skirted the crumbling wall of a date garden the palms were green here the gardens uninvaded by the desert sand and then suddenly we were in the open driving on hard gravel and straight ahead of us a black bulk against the stars was the shadowy shape of the sheikhs palace standing like a fortress on its hill the wooden gate of the arched entrance was closed but it opened to the cries of our guards and then we were inside in a great courtyard packed with men and camels and lit by the flames of cooking fires in an instant we were surrounded lapped round by a tide of men all shouting and brandishing their weapons a big portly man appeared his face black as a sudanese the sheikhs secretary entwhistle said to me he looked like a eunuch fat and soft his manner almost feminine he gave orders for the care of the men and then escorted us into the palace along dark corridors sparsely lit by smoking lamps made out of old cans to a small room that looked out on to a central courtyard here the earthen floor was carpeted with rugs the walls lined with cushions an arab rose to greet us he was a compact stocky man with almost black eyes and a proudly curved nose the khanjar knife stuck in the girdle of his finelywoven robe was a beautiful example of the silversmiths craft sheikh makhmud entwhistle whispered i found my hand held in a firm grip you are welcome to saraifa the sheikh said in halting english my house is your house he had an air of command yet his voice was gentle but the thing that surprised me most was the fact that he wore glasses they were silverrimmed glasses and they drew attention to the blackness of his eyes his cleanshaven face was long and tiredlooking he was a man of about gordes age i suppose the other occupant of the room had also risen a thin man with a greying moustache and a little pointed beard his eyes heavily made up with kohl he was makhmuds brother sultan we sat crosslegged on the cushions and there was nothing in the sheikhs manner to indicate that we were anything but honoured guests polite conversation was made partly in the arab language partly in english slaves came with a silver jug and a silver ewer we washed our hands and then they brought in a simple dish of rice and mutton you eat with your right hand entwhistle whispered to me and i tried to copy his practised movements i was hungry enough not to care that the meat was stringy and overfat we ate almost in silence and when we had finished the handwashing was repeated and then coffee was served in little handleless cups poured by a slave from a silver pot of intricate native design and with the coffee came the questions sheikh makhmuds voice was no longer gentle it had a harsh imperious quality and entwhistle was soon in difficulties with the language lapsing periodically into english as he tried to explain his presence on the saraifahadd border in the end he passed sheikh makhmud the note gorde had written entwhistle had just launched into an account of the attack that had been made on us when a young man entered he was short wellbuilt and beneath his brown cloak he wore an old tweed jacket but it was the features that caught the eye they were delicate almost classic features the nose straight the eyes set wide apart with high cheekbones and the full lips framed by a neatly trimmed moustache that flowed round the corners and down into a little pointed beard he looked as though he had just come in from the desert and i knew instinctively that this was khalid the sheikhs son he had an air about him that showed he was born to command he greeted his father and his uncle waved us to remain seated and folded himself up on a cushion against the wall the brass of cartridge belt the silver of khanjar knife gleamed beneath the jacket he sat in silence listening intently his body so still that i was given the impression of great muscular control a hardsinewed body below the arab robes there was a long silence when entwhistle had finished and then sheikh makhmud made what sounded like a pronouncement and entwhistle exclaimed good god im not going to do that he turned to me he wants us to go to the emir and explain that we were on the border without authority you go freely sheikh makhmud said in english or you go with escort which you prefer entwhistle didnt say anything his face was set and pale is very difficult this situation the sheikh said almost apologetically very dangerous also you must make the emir understand please very dangerous for us too entwhistle muttered angrily i dont want any trouble you want oil dont you colonel whitaker is already drilling for oil then what was his son doing on the hadd border entwhistle demanded he ran a survey there he wrote a report and then he vanished there was no answer khalid you were his friend what happened to him but khalid was staring out into the courtyard in the silence i heard myself say he got a letter through to me just before he disappeared he knew he was going to die i felt them stiffen the silence suddenly intense i looked at khalid did he die a natural death his eyes met mine for a moment then fell away somebody here must know how he died and why nobody answered and the stillness of those three arabs scared me it was the stillness of unease wheres colonel whitaker i asked the sheikh stirred uncomfortably you are full of questions who are you briefly i explained i was still explaining when there was a sudden uproar in the passage outside and a man burst into the room followed closely by the sheikhs secretary a staccato burst of arabic and they were all suddenly on their feet i heard the word falaj run from mouth to mouth saw khalid rush out quick as a cat on his feet his father followed more slowly the others crowding behind him what is it i asked entwhistle whats happened one of the falajes i dont know exactly but for some reason the water has stopped we were alone now everybody had forgotten about us it was as though that word had some sort of magic in it what exactly is a falaj he didnt seem to hear me and i repeated the question falaj he seemed to drag his mind back oh its the water system on which the date gardens depend the water comes from the mountains of the jebel anything up to thirty miles away and its piped into saraifa by underground channels and the underground channels are the falajes yes thats it theyre centuries old a persian irrigation system in fact theyre the same as the persian quantas he went to the passage and stood listening bit of luck he said dropping his voice to a whisper if we can get hold of the landrover he grabbed hold of my arm come on i followed him down the dimly lit mud corridors and out into the courtyard the cooking fires still smoked the camels still crouched in a shapeless belching huddle under the walls but in the whole courtyard there wasnt a single arab to be seen look even the guard on the gate has gone but why i asked why should that word water dont you understand he sounded impatient water is life here in the desert but they cant depend on one channel there must be many to irrigate a place like this five or six thats all he was searching the courtyard there used to be more than a hundred once but tribal wars he gripped my arm theres the landrover over by the wall there he pointed come on theres just a chance whats the idea i asked get out whilst the goings good hurry man his voice was highpitched urgent im not risking my neck on a mission of explanation to that bloody emir he had seized hold of my arm again quick i started to follow him but then i stopped im staying i said christ man do you want to get killed no but i want to find out why that boy was killed he stared at me you think it was like that that he was murdered i dont know i said i didnt know anything for certain but im not leaving here until ive seen colonel whitaker he hesitated but then he shrugged his shoulders okay its your funeral as you might say but watch your step he added hes a tricky bastard by all accounts and if what youre suggesting is true and david was murdered then your life wouldnt be worth much would it ill be all right i said aye i hope so but just remember youre right on the edge of saudi arabia here and the british raj is worn a bit thin in these parts he hesitated looking at me and then he started towards the land rover i stood and watched him certain i was being a fool but equally certain that i wasnt leaving i saw him jump into the driving seat heard the whine of the starter the roar of the engine and then the landrover was moving and he swung it round and came tearing towards me jump in grant he shouted as he pulled up beside me hurry man hurry no i said im not leaving my voice was like the voice of a stranger to me you get out whilst you can ill be all right and i added ill make your excuses to the sheikh for you i meant it to be a jocular carefree remark but my voice sounded hollow he was still hesitating and i said quickly good luck to you he stared at me hard and then he gave a little nod okay i expect youll be all right ill notify the authorities of course and he slammed in the gear and went roaring across the courtyard and out through the empty gateway the cloud of dust hed raised gradually settled and i walked to the gate and stood there watching his headlights threading a luminous trail through the date gardens and when they finally disappeared in the open desert beyond i went slowly down the hill heading for the murmur of voices the glimmer of lights amongst the palms beyond the village i was alone then more alone than id ever been in my life before the moon was just risen and with the stars the village was lit by a soft translucence the mud buildings were pale and empty the open square deserted save for the hens nested in the dust and a solitary sadlooking donkey beyond the village i followed the crumbling wall of a date garden until i came out into the open again all saraifa seemed gathered there the men bunched together like a crowd at a cockfight the women dark bundles flitting on the edge of the crowd or squatting like hens in the sand everybody was talking at once a thick hubbub of sound that seemed to lose itself instantly in the great solitude of the desert that stretched away to the east to the dimseen line of the mountains nobody took any notice of me as i skirted the crowd it was thickest close by the date garden out towards the desert it thinned and here i found a raised water channel built of rock and spanning a hollow roman aqueduct it was my first sight of a falaj and it was empty i leaned over it touched the inside with my fingers it was still damp and in a little puddle of water at the bottom tiny fish flashed silver in the starlight as they gasped for breath clearly the water had only recently ceased to flow turned off as though by a tap fascinated i crossed the hollow to the far side for perhaps twenty yards the falaj was open a neat verticalsided trench running a black shadow line across the sand it was about two feet across and the same deep i walked along it to the point where it was roofed over for a hundred yards or so i could trace the outline of it but after that the sand swallowed it up entirely from a slight rise i looked towards the mountains anything up to thirty miles entwhistle had said and they were the source of the water i walked slowly back along the line of the falaj to the point where it broke surface and at the sight of the empty trough with the little fish gasping out their lives i could understand the calamity of it the sense of disaster that had seized upon the people of this channelfed oasis a dry falaj meant a ruined date garden the beginnings of famine only five or six left out of more than a hundred tribal wars the place was as vulnerable as an oil refinery fed by a desert pipeline cut the falaj and saraifa ceased to exist the sound of male voices died away leaving only the highpitched chatter of the women there was a stillness of decision as i approached the crowd gathered about the falaj channel where it entered the date garden in the centre stood sheikh makhmud and his brother sultan khalid was facing them arguing fiercely his features had no trace of effeminacy in them now from the skirts of the crowd i saw sheikh makhmud turn impatiently away from his son he called a man forth by name mahommed bin rashid a fierce hawkfaced man with a black beard the one who had stopped us as we entered saraifa he gave him an order and a long a aagh of satisfaction issued from the throats of the crowd instantly all was confusion men brandished their weapons calling on allah as a dozen or more of them were singled out and went hurrying back to the palace sheikh makhmud turned and with his brother and his secretary followed them slowly it was the signal for the crowd to break up and as they straggled away from the empty falaj khalid was left standing there alone a few men only remained a little compact group of silent followers ranged behind him they were different from the rest in that their arms were without any silver trappings they carried british servicepattern rifles he stood for a long time without moving staring after his father and the crowd that followed him noisy now with the excitement of action and when they had disappeared from sight he turned to his men with a gesture of dismissal and they too moved away but still silent still in a compact group he was completely alone then staring down at the empty water channel lost in his own thoughts even when i approached him he didnt stir i dont think he knew i was there for when i asked him whether he spoke english he turned to me with a start of surprise a little english yess his speech was slightly sibilant his features marred when he opened his mouth by long widelyspaced teeth i am at bombay university my education he was staring up the hill towards the palace his mind still on what had happened they think they are being brave and that i am afraid they dont understand his tone was bitter and angry their guns are very much old and the men of hadd will be waiting for them i asked whether it was hadd who had stopped the water supply and he said yess they perpetrate it once before then the british help us your people send soldiers with automatic guns and mortars but not now this time we are alone he turned and i saw his dark eyes sad in the starlight the falajes you understand sir are very much vulnerable he had acquired the indian penchant for long words and he added with great determination speaking slowly as though stating something to himself we must fight for them now but not like this this way is to die he began to walk slowly towards the palace there were many things i wanted to ask him but this didnt seem the moment and i walked beside him in silence conscious of his preoccupation his head was bent and he moved slowly his sandals dragging in the sand he was only two years older than david i learned that later yet his manner was that of a man upon whom the whole responsibility for this desert community rested do you know arabia much sir he asked suddenly and when i told him this was my first visit and that id only arrived a few days ago he nodded and said you are from a town called cardiff yess david speak of you sometimes that mention of cardiff the knowledge that this young arab knew who i was saraifa seemed suddenly less remote my position here less solitary when david first come here he is like you he speak arabic a little but he dont understand our customs or the way we live here in the desert the falajes mean nothing to him and he has never seen the big dunes when the shamal is blowing he had stopped and he was smiling at me despite the widespaced fanglike teeth it was a gentle smile i am glad you come now he offered me his hand and i found my wrist gripped and held in a strong clasp you are davids friend and i will see that no harm come to you i thanked him conscious that he had given me the opening i needed but already i was becoming vaguely aware of the subtlety of the arab mind and this time i was determined not to make the mistake of asking direct questions sues words came unconsciously into my mind david wanted to defend saraifa too i saw his face soften as he nodded and i asked what was it about this place that so captured his imagination his sister said he could be very emotional about it his sister he smiled i have seen his sister once when i am taking a plane at sharjah she is with the doctor and i do not speak a very fine person i think i knew then that david had spoken of sue to khalid what is there about saraifa i said that he fell in love with it the way other men do with a woman he shrugged he came here for refuge and we made him welcome also his father live here it became his home but that didnt explain it entirely it was something more than that i said yess he nodded is a very strange chap a nasrani a christian he live very much by your book the bible that surprised me but before i could make any comment he added i should hate him because he is an infidel instead i love him like my own brother he shook his head with a puzzled frown perhaps it is because i have to teach him everything when he first come here he knows nothing he has never hunted never owned a hawk he does not know how to ride a camel or how to make a camp in the desert for six months were are living together here in saraifa in the desert hunting up in the mountains shooting wild hare and gazelle but he is very good with machines and later when he is on leave from the oil company and we are working for the reconstruction of one of the old falajes then he spend all his time down in the underground channels with the family who specialize in that work you see sir this oasis is one time very much bigger with very many falajes bringing water to the date gardens then saraifa is rich richer than buraimi to the north richer perhaps even than the wadi hadhramaut to the south it is i think the richest place in all arabia but nobody can remember that time now it is he stopped abruptly his head on one side listening and then i heard it too the soft padpad of camels feet on gravel down the slope towards us came a bunch of camels moving with that awkward lumbering gait a dozen dark shapes swayed past us the riders kneeling in the saddles their robes flying their rifles held in their hands for an instant they were like paper cutouts painted black against the stars beautiful balanced silhouettes then they were gone and the pad of their camels feet faded away into the sand as they headed towards the mountains wallahi qaliletelmukh khalid muttered as he stared after them and then to me that man mahommed bin rashid you heard him when my father give the order inshallah he said we will kill every harlots son of them but he is more like to die himself i think and he turned away adding as he strode angrily up the hill allah give him more brain in the world hereafter the sight of that handful of men riding east into the desert along the line of the falaj had changed his mood he was preoccupied and though i tried to resume our conversation he didnt speak to me again until we reached the gates of the palace abruptly he asked me what sleeping quarters i had been allotted and when i told him none he said then i arrange it excuse my father please he is very much occupied he asked about entwhistle good he said when i told him hed gone he is not a fool that man he knows when it is dangerous and he added it would have been better perhaps if you had gone with him im not leaving here i said until i know what happened to david there was a moment then when he hesitated as though about to tell me something but all he said was is best you talk to his father haj whitaker i intend to i said and when i asked him whether colonel whitaker was in saraifa he replied i dont know he has his house here but is most times at the place of drilling and wheres that to the south of ere about ten miles towards sheikh hassas village of dhaid we had entered the great courtyard a man sidled up to us made his salaams to khalid he was dark and toothy with a ragged wisp of a turban on his head and his eyes watched me curiously as they talked together my name was mentioned and finally khalid turned to me now all is arranged yousif speak a little english he will show you where you sleep his hand gripped my arm ask haj whitaker why he goes to see the emir of hadd almost two moons past ask him that meester grant it was whispered to me his lips close against my ear and a hard angry glint in his eyes but before i could question him he had drawn back he said something to yousif and with a quick salaam alaikum he left me moving quickly through the camp fires the only man in all that throng who wore a european jacket come yousif seized hold of my hand heads were turned now in my direction and here and there a man got up from the fireside and began to move towards us i had no desire to stay there an object of curiosity yousif guided me through dark passages and up to a turret room by a winding staircase where the plaster steps were worn smooth as polished marble by the tread of many feet the floor was bare earth the roof beamed with palm tree boles a slit of a window no bigger than a firing embrasure looked out on to the flat beaten expanses of the village square i was in one of the mud towers of the outer wall and here he left me with no light but the glimmer of moonlight filtering in through the embrasure strange disembodied sounds drifted up to me on the warm night air the murmur of arab voices the grunt of camels a child crying and in the distance the weird chuckle of a hyena i knelt on the firing step peering down beyond the mud houses i could see the darker mass of the palms bare feet sounded on the turret stairs and the yellow light of a hurricanelamp appeared the room was suddenly full of armed men bearing bedding which they laid on the floor a carpet some blankets an oryx skin and a silken cushion may allah guard you yousif said and may your sleep be as the sleep of a little child he was halfway through the door before i realized what that long speech in english must mean youre colonel whitakers man arent you he checked and turned yes sahib me driver for collonel he was staring at me his eyes very wide so that the whites showed yellow in the lamplight i tell collonel you are here in sheikhs palace he was gone then there was no doubt in my mind that hed been sent to find me whitaker was in saraifa and khalid had known it as soon as yousif had sidled up to us i sat down on the silken cushion staring blindly at that celllike room there was nothing to do now but wait i felt tired dirty too but id no water with which to wash no soap no clothes nothing but what i was wearing yousif had left me the hurricane lamp and its light reached dimly to the palm wood rafters a large desert spider moved among them with deliberation i watched it for a long time as it went about its unpleasant business and finally i killed it overcome with a fellowfeeling for the flies caught in its web and then i put out the lamp and rolled myself up in a blanket it was hot but i must have fallen asleep for i didnt hear yousif return he was suddenly there his torch stabbing the darkness almost blinding me collonel say you come i sat up glancing at my watch it was past eleventhirty now yes now down in the courtyard the fires were almost out the sheikhs retainers lying like corpses wrapped in their robes a few stirred as we crossed to the gate now barred and guarded a brief argument and then i was in a battered landrover being driven at reckless speed across the deserted village square down into the date gardens behind us the palace fort stood bonewhite in the moonlight and then the palms closed round us whitakers house was an old mud fort on the far side of the oasis most of it seemed to be in ruins the courtyard empty the mud walls cracked and crumbling there was sand everywhere as we hurried through a maze of passages and empty rooms the palace seemed dead and i wondered that a man could live alone like this and retain his sanity for he seemed to have no servants but yousif and to live in spartan simplicity in one corner of this vast rambling building we came at last to a room where old portmanteaux and tin boxes stood ranged against the walls and then i was out on a rooftop that looked out upon the desert he was standing against the parapet a tall robed figure in silhouette for there was no light there only the moon and the stars yousif coughed and announced my presence whitaker turned then and came towards me his face was in shadow but i could see the black patch over the eye no word of greeting no attempt to shake my hand sit down he said and waved imperiously to a carpet and some cushions spread on the floor yousif gahwa his servant disappeared and as i sat down i was conscious of the stillness all about us no sound of arab voices none of the tumult of the sheikhs palace no murmur of the village below the walls the place was as isolated as deserted as though we were the only people in the whole oasis he folded himself up crosslegged on the carpet facing me and i could see his face then the beard thinning and grey the cheeks hollowed and lined by the desert years that single imperious eye deepsunken above the great nose you had a good journey i trust his voice was oddlypitched hard but unusually high and he spoke the words slowly as though english were no longer a familiar language it was interesting i said no doubt but quite unnecessary it was clearly understood between us that you would make no attempt to contact me direct and though i admit the financial situation must have seemed i came about your son i said my son he looked surprised your letter merely said you were worried about the amount of money i was spending your son appointed me his executor he moved his head slightly the eye glinting in the moonlight bright and watchful he didnt say anything behind him the low parapet hid the desert so that all i could see was the great vault of the night studded with stars the air was deathly still impregnated with the days heat im not convinced your son died a natural death i hadnt meant to put it like that it was his stillness the overpowering silence that had forced it out of me he made no comment and i knew that this was going to be more difficult than my interview with erkhard more difficult even than my meeting with gorde and some sixth sense warned me that this man was much more unpredictable the clatter of cups came as a distinct relief yousif moved silently as a shadow on to the rooftop and poured us coffee from a battered silver pot the cups were handleless the mocha coffee black and bitter does his mother know hes dead it surprised me that he should think of her and when i told him that id broken the news to her myself he asked how did she take it she didnt believe it at first and because i had an overwhelming desire to break through his strange aura of calm i added in fact she seemed to think it was your own death i was reporting why why did she think i was dead the stars i said she believes in astrology he sighed yes i remember now i used to talk to her about the stars and he added its a longtime ago a long time do you believe in astrology then i asked he shrugged sipping noisily at his coffee here in the desert we live a great deal by the stars it is very difficult not to believe that they have some influence and then abruptly changing the conversation how did you get here its not easy to get to saraifa i started to tell him but as soon as i mentioned gorde he said philip gorde i didnt know he was out here it seemed to upset him did he tell you why he was here he mistook my silence no of course not hed hardly tell you that he shook his cup at yousif to indicate that hed had enough and when i did the same the man departed as silently as he had come leaving a dish of some sticky sweetmeat between us halwa do you like it whitaker made a vague gesture of invitation ive never tried it we were alone again now and the silence between us hung heavy as the thick night air a blanket through which each tried to gauge the other i let it drag out and it was whitaker who finally broke it you were telling me about your journey he stared at me waiting for me to continue i broke off a piece of the halwa it was cloying on the tongue and it had a sicklysweet taste you arrived here with entwhistle one of the companys geologists what was he doing on the hadd border do you know the fellow had no business there he was checking your sons survey i said there was a sudden stillness i see he said it quietly and then in a voice that was suddenly trembling with anger on whose orders not philip gordes surely no erkhard you seem very worried about this worried the word seemed forced out of him dont you understand whats happened here tonight the thing ive been dreading the thing ive been trying to avoid ever since i knew he checked himself and then in a quieter voice no youre new out here you wouldnt understand one of the falajes has been stopped and all because of this blundering fool entwhistle running a survey on the hadd border his voice had risen again trembling with anger he was doing what david was doing at the time he disappeared i said quietly but it didnt seem to register he had withdrawn into his own thoughts twenty years his voice sounded tired and then his eye was staring at me again how would you feel if the thing youd worked for over a period of twenty years was in danger of being ruined by young fools too impatient to understand the politics of the desert he turned his head and stared for a moment into the night the air is heavy therell be a storm soon he gathered his robes about him and rose to his feet crossing to the parapet and leaning against it staring out into the desert like some biblical figure from the distant past come here grant and when i joined him he stretched out his arm look do you see those dunes he gripped my arm pointing west into the desert standing on that rooftop was like standing on the bridge of a ship lying anchored off a lowlying island to the left lay the darktreed expanse of the oasis and beyond the date gardens i could see the village and the squat bulk of the sheikhs palace standing on its gravel rise but to the right where his arm pointed was nothing but desert dim in the moonlight the dunes stretched away into infinity a ridged sea of sand pale as milk when youve seen a storm here youll understand then all the desert seems in motion like the sea beating against the shore of the oasis flooding into the date gardens the dunes smoke they stream with sand theyre like waves breaking the whole great desert of the empty quarter thundering in the sand flowing like water he turned to me and his grip on my arm tightened the only thing that stands between saraifa and destruction is the camel thorn out there do you see those trees theyre like a breakwater holding the sand sea back and theyre dying for lack of water the falajes i asked and he nodded entwhistle said there used to be around a hundred of them yes weve traced them from aerial photographs your son was very much concerned about oh yes concerned but he lacked patience he was like a young bull no subtlety no subtlety at all and he added whats been done tonight can be quickly repaired theres an open well every mile or so along the length of the underground channel of the falaj theyve blocked one of these wells with sand and stone it can be unblocked almost as quickly but the old falajes he shook his head the wells are fallen in the underground channels collapsed restoring them is a lengthy and costly business sheikh makhmud has managed to restore just one in the fourteen years hes been sheikh of saraifa it took two years and cost more than twenty thousand pounds if saraifa is to survive he gave a little shrug we need a dozen new falajes not one and only oil will pay for them he nodded yes david took the same view i said thats why he was prospecting on the hadd border and i added what happened colonel whitaker what happened to your son he turned and looked at me you think i should know ive come a long way i said in the certainty that you must know his eyebrows lifted the single eye stared at me not blinking the certainty yes i said the certainty and i added he was on loan to you at the time he disappeared it was the seismological truck you purchased in basra last june that he left abandoned on the side of a dune twenty miles inside the borders of saudi arabia and just before he disappeared you visited the emir of hadd you must know what happened well i dont he said it flatly and it was difficult not to accept it then why did you visit hadd who else could do it and he added david was on the hadd border against my orders against sheikh makhmuds orders too somebody had to try and convince the emir there wasnt any oil there because the borders in dispute yes theres been trouble there ever since the company was first granted a concession to prospect in saraifa as you probably know saraifa is an independent sheikhdom unlike the trucial states its not even in treaty relation with the british crown though its generally considered to be a part of the british sphere of influence hadd is different again its independent in theory and in fact and during the last few years it has strengthened its ties with arab countries some years back we were finally driven to sending troops in to keep the peace and they occupied the fort of jebel alakhbar overlooking the town of hadd but we couldnt do that now it would be much too dangerous he hesitated and then he added the risk would only be justified if vital interests of our own were involved what sort of vital interests i asked but i knew the answer before he gave it oil he said from a western point of view as youd know if youd been out here any length of time everything in arabia comes back to oil your sons death too i asked he looked at me but didnt say anything when did you first hear he was missing towards the end of february could you give me a date he frowned and for a moment i thought he wasnt going to answer that but then he said i cant be certain your calendar doesnt mean very much to us out here in the desert but by the moon it would be about the beginning of the last week in february almost a week before the abandoned truck had been found by the bedouin more than three weeks before his disappearance had been reported to the company you didnt notify erkhard no why not david was in the companys employ even if he was on loan to you he didnt say anything he seemed suddenly to have withdrawn inside himself i think perhaps he was waiting for my next question knowing it was coming the truck was discovered abandoned on february twentyeight i said yet you say you knew he was missing almost a week before that how did you know there was a long pause at length he said some askari were despatched from saraifa when they reached his camp they found it deserted not a soul there the truck and the landrover had gone too askari yes members of sheikh makhmuds bodyguard their orders were to arrest him and bring him back to saraifa alive of course he stared at me angrily what other instructions do you imagine they would be given they were despatched by sheikh makhmud at my request that was immediately after my return from hadd and he added it was done for his own good and because it was necessary the emir was in a very dangerous mood so that was how it had been and you didnt want erkhard to know that hed been operating on the hadd border i didnt want erkhard to know and i didnt want the political boys to know as ive said david was there against my express orders god almighty he breathed the impatience of youth they want the moon for breakfast and the sun for lunch he leaned on the parapet staring down to the white sand below i blame myself he said quietly i should have packed him off back to cardiff instead i let him stay more i tried to think of him as my son as gods gift from my loins a prodigal given back into my hands he shook his head i should have known it wouldnt work he paused there and i didnt say anything for i felt his isolation here might trap him into some selfrevelation if i didnt try to force it he looked at me again the desert lines deepetched by the moon a long sad solitary face as you know im a moslem i wanted him to become a mahommedan too i wanted him to make the desert his home and to carry on where i left off in due course he sighed softly i forgot the boy was already nineteen and only half mine and that half as obstinate as the devil he smiled in that harsh face it was a smile of extraordinary tenderness i turned him into a christian instead he said it with bitterness adding in the end i think he came to hate me why the question was out before i could stop myself and i saw him freeze and close up on me people get at crosspurposes you know his tone was casual now its one of the sad things about human relationships but there no point in talking about it now the boys dead and thats that you cant be sure of that i said he stared at me his eye blazing in the darkness what do you mean i had all the chaps i could spare out looking for him khalid was searching too and makhmud had men hunting for him all over saraifa the only place we never thought of searching was west into the empty quarter and he said with gentleness softly to himself the desert is like the sea no man can disappear into it for two months and come out alive all right i said hes dead but if you havent discovered what happened to him what do you think happened to him his eye looked into mine have you ever been frightened yes once i said in tanganyika he nodded then youll understand me when i say no man knows how hell react to fear until hes faced with it especially when hes alone and david was alone his arab crew had deserted him we found that out later they panicked and you think david did the same he shrugged its a cruel place the desert and solitary as hell empty too even in company the bedou sing to keep their spirits up it was much what griffiths had said and it seemed plausible enough he took my arm and led me back to the carpet you were telling me about your journey i told him as much as i thought hed a right to know about the package griffiths had brought me and my meeting with erkhard but it was gorde he was really interested in gorde and entwhistle and the fact that the two of them had been together at the locations david had been surveying it seemed to worry him and he questioned me closely about gordes reactions what had he said where was he going when hed left me there with entwhistle and then he asked me what it was that had decided entwhistle to check davids survey he must have known he was risking his life there on that border what made mm think it was so important i hesitated he was sitting there watching me very still very tense and i knew suddenly that this was what the whole interview had been leading up to and that he was deeply concerned when entwhistle searched the abandoned truck i said he found all davids papers they included his own survey report and also the report of a much older survey run just before the war i think it was that report whose report the question was shot at me out of the dark was it henry farrs report i stared at him you know about that of course henry sent me a copy of it he was well aware of my interest in the area later we had a talk about it just before he went into abyssinia but if you knew about it it seemed so incredible in his letter to me david said he found it in the companys files you never told him about it no why ever not you must have known how he felt about saraifa his desperate urge to he was employed by the company by erkhard his voice was taut and hard a note almost of hostility but i dont understand i saidall these years and khalid says youre drilling to the south of the oasis thats at least forty miles from davids locations exactly just about as far from the hadd border as its possible to get and still be in saraifa he got to his feet and began pacing up and down seeking relief in movement from the nervous tension that i now realized had existed inside him from the first moment of our meeting its not easy to explain you dont understand the situation he stopped suddenly and faced me for twenty years ive had to sit on this convinced that my theory was right that the oilbearing strata continued from the gulf down into saraifa between the empty quarter and the mountains you can see there to the east his voice was sharp and bitter with frustration i had to find some way he paused standing there over me and he was silent a long time as though reaching for a decision finally he said you know so much you may as well know the rest erkhards coming here tomorrow flying down from sharjah hes under pressure as i think youll have guessed from your conversation with philip gorde with gods help ill get him to sign the concession and once the companys involved he turned and resumed his pacing there was no other way no company would sign a concession with saraifa if they knew it involved drilling on the haddsaraifa border no company would dare but once theyre committed he beat his fist against the palm of his hand i spasmodic fighting on the border the emir you see was determined to grab any oil there was for himself and when we finally sent in troops to keep the peace it was too late for me to do anything about it the concession had lapsed philip gorde had gone home sick and erkhard had taker over erkhard would have dealt with the emir or anybody else hed no feeling for saraifa the way philip had he turned abruptly and shouted for yousif and then looking at me very hard he said youve come at a strange moment grant and ive told you things ive told no other man ive had to or youd have caused more trouble by the mere fact of coming out here he hesitated and i knew he was thinking of gorde what did philip say was he surprised when he discovered where i was drilling i dont think he knows i said he wasnt even sure you were drilling oh he knows a plane passed over the rig this afternoon i thought for a moment it must be erkhard arriving a day early but when it circled and turned away i began to wonder he was looking out into the desert again and his face showed the strain he was under i could have wished it had been anyone but philip gorde hes the only man in the whole company who knows enough to guess what im up to but theres nothing i can do about it now yousif had appeared and he held out his hand to me youre a lawyer grant youve been involved in our affairs for a long time i rely on you not to talk he held my hand gripped in his we have two enemies here in saraifa the emir and the sands he gestured towards the white expanse of the dunes and added softly tomorrow with gods help ill lay the foundation of victory over them both it was said with great intensity his eye fixed on my face i left him then standing alone as i had found him on that rooftop a strange almost fanatical figure against the backcloth of endless desert even when i got back to my turret room the memory of him was so clear in my mind that i felt he was still with me but i was too exhausted to think clearly about that extraordinary meeting i fell asleep and dreamed instead of women crying over children dead of thirst i woke in the small hours to the reality of their cries a queer keening sound coming up from the square below the palace too was alive with voices and though they were muffled by distance and the thickness of the walls i caught the vibrant note of disaster it was quite chill as i flung off my blanket and went to the embrasure the village square was ghostly pale in moonlight empty save for a little group immediately below me a dozen women and some children huddled like rags around the dead body of a man he had been shot in the face and he wasnt a pretty sight there in the moonlight nearby a camel lay in a pool of blood it was just after four by my watch and already the sky was paling in the east i put on my shoes and went down into the courtyard the place was in an uproar fires smoking and men standing in little groups all talking at once the nearest fell silent as they saw me and the word nasrani passed from mouth to mouth a whisper of fear perhaps of hate i beat a hasty retreat to the seclusion of my turret cell sleep was impossible after that and i sat huddled in my blanket and watched the dawn break over the jebel mountains the grey light of it creeping across the palm tops heralded by the brazen sound of an ass braying the keening ceased and when i went to the window embrasure there was no sign of the dead man and the camels carcase had gone it might have been a bad dream for as daylight flooded the square it was full of the sound of children and their carefree laughter there was a shireeya or open waterhole a short distance from the tower and young arab girls were driving goats towards it there were boys there too with their asses filling goatskin bags and dripping a dark trail of the precious fluid as they took it to houses in the village skinny undersized fowl pecked in the dirt a shapeless bundle of womanhood passed her face hideously concealed by the black mask of the burqa and when the sun lifted its glaring face above the distant line of the mountains the palms the sand the mud houses were all miraculously suffused with colour as though i were looking at the scene through rosetinted glasses exhausted i lay down again and was instantly asleep i woke to the cry of gahwa and a barefoot attendant pouring coffee for me his gun slung across his back the brass of his cartridge belt gleaming in the light from the embrasure it was eightthirty and the flies crawled over the dates he left for my breakfast i ate the dates slowly for time hung heavy on my hands and i didnt dare venture out alone after what had happened my eyes felt tired my body lethargic my mind wandered in weary circles as the heat of the desert grew in intensity invading the room it was almost eleven when khalid came for me a brief salaam a polite hope that id slept well and then he said my father holds a majlis he desires your presence sir his face looked grave and the eyes deepsunk and shadowed spoke of a sleepless night the emir of hadd has sent one of his sheikhs to make demand for a new border his voice sounded weary too what happened last night i asked there were women crying and a dead body in the square they waited in ambush by the fourteenth well mahommed bin rashid is dead and two of his men also three are wounded come my father waits for you i asked him if i could wash first but he said there was no time you must explain now please to the emirs representative why you and meester entwhistle are on the border and then urgently tell sheikh abdullah there is no oil there im not a geologist he dont know that he thinks you work for the oil company well i dont i spoke sharply irritable with lack of sleep im a lawyer and all im interested in is what happened to david whitaker his dark eyes stared at me hard is better you dont talk about david at this meeting he said quietly why angry and tired i didnt stop to think what i was saying because your father sent some of his bodyguard to arrest him you saw haj whitaker last night you know why they were sent he was on the hadd border against my fathers orders against whitakers orders too i gather yess if he had been a muslim instead of a nasrani he gave a little shrug the prophet has taught us that the word of the father is as a law and that the son must obey and he added my father is wishing to avoid trouble he does not believe that a few miles of desert sand is worth righting for and you do again the little shrug my father is an old man and he has known haj whitaker many years now he is guided by him in these matters and i i also am not a geologist who did your father send with the soldiers i asked was it you no mahommed bin rashid he turned abruptly come please my father is waiting and as i followed him down the turret stairs he said over his shoulder please you will not speak of david he said it fiercely with great urgency he led me through passages that were cool in semidarkness and up to a rooftop by another staircase the majlis or audience was being held in an open room with arches that looked out across the rooftops to the oasis sheikh makhmud didnt rise to greet me his face looked tired and strained sullen with anger he was also i think a little frightened beside him sat the representative of hadd a bearded slyeyed powerfullybuilt man with an elaboratelyembroidered cloak and a headdress that was like a turban of many colours sheikh makhmud motioned me to sit facing him i was thus in the position of the accused facing a court for all the notables were there seated crosslegged and grave on silken cushions ranged round the inner walls of that airy room on a carpet in the centre were bowls of camel milk and tinned pears nobody touched them except the flies the atmosphere was tense almost electric the situation was distinctly unpleasant for it was obvious as soon as sheikh makhmud began to question me in halting english that he regarded me as responsible for the situation that had developed entwhistles absence didnt help and though i answered the questions truthfully i could see from sheikh abdullahs manner that he didnt believe me he listened to the translation with a lack of interest that he didnt bother to conceal in the end i lost my temper with him i scrambled to my feet and standing over the man delivered myself of the sort of broadside i occasionally indulged in in the courts my action might have been dictated by expediency for attack was undoubtedly the best method of defence but in fact my nerves were on edge your men attacked us without warning and without cause i shouted at him and i described how the softnosed bullet had slammed into the bonnet of the landrover how the fusillade of shots had raised spurts of sand all around us he looked suddenly uncomfortable only a few years ago i said my country had to send troops here to keep the peace now you break it again why what explanation do you wish me to give when i return to bahrain my words translated the crafty eyes slid from my face to the assembled men and he licked his lips as though suddenly uncertain of himself you have no answer i said and with that i gave sheikh makhmud a quick bow and made my exit i couldnt go far for armed retainers barred the staircase leading down from the roof but i had made my point and felt better for it even though i was now forced to remain out in the full glare of the sun i sat myself down on the ovenlid heat of the mud parapet and pretended to be absorbed in watching a camel caravan being loaded at a huddle of barastis close by the date gardens behind me i could hear the guttural sound of their talk as they continued to deliberate coffee was served and khalid came over and joined me is no good he said the emir listens to cairo radio and he believes he has powerful friends it has made him bold also he has many new rifles they have come up from the yemen i think from the coast alsoand he added only if we have oil here in saraifa will your people give us their full support we know that mr erkhard is seeing colonel whitaker today i said he nodded my father will not make a decision until he hears from haj whitaker he is full of hope and you i asked for the way he said it suggested he didnt share his fathers optimism heshrugged also hope but haj whitaker is old and he is tired and sick sick sick here and he touched his heart i asked him then what exactly sheikh abdullah was demanding a new border he said and drew it for me in the sand of the rooftop floor with the toe of his sandalled foot it meant that all the area david had surveyed would belong to hadd and if your father refuses again that fatalistic shrug then sheikh abdullah say they will destroy another falaj and another and another until we have no water for the dates no water for our beasts none for ourselves even we die then of thirst and starvation he was staring out across the oasis i am young yet i had thought to rebuild the falajes one by one until saraifa is like a garden again and the desert at bay that is my dream and davids too yes it is the dream we share since we first hunt the gazelle together his eyes had a faraway look his voice sad with the loss of that dream his father called to him and he finished his coffee and went back to his place the conference was resumed and looking at the faces of the men gathered in that room i knew he was right they were in no mood to fight and if whitaker didnt save them then they would accept it as the will of allah and agree to the emirs demands the camel caravan down by the palmtree fringe finished loading i watched the heavilyladen beasts move off through the date gardens headed north into the desert the whole oasis shimmered in the heat and beyond it stretched the sands a golden sea thrusting yellow drifts amongst the palms the sun climbed the sky the heat became unbearable the talk spasmodic and sheikh abdullah sat there his heavy eyelids drooping not saying anything just waiting i was half asleep when i saw the dust trail of the vehicle it was coming through the date gardens from the south driven fast and when it emerged into the open i saw it was a landrover packed with arabs all shouting and waving their guns in a frenzy of excitement and as it reached the outskirts of the village they began firing into the air a few minutes later yousif burst through the retainers standing at the head of the stairs he went straight up to sheikh makhmud interrupting the deliberations with that extraordinary lack of respect that seems a contradiction almost of the feudalism of the bedou world he was excited and arabic words poured from him in a flood as he handed the sheikh a folded slip of paper as soon as sheikh makhmud had read it his whole manner changed his eyes lit up he became revitalized a man suddenly in command of the situation he said a few words speaking softly and with great control the name of allah was repeatedly mentioned presumably in praise and then he rose to his feet the effect was remarkable the place was suddenly in an uproar everybody on their feet and all talking at once there was a general movement towards the stairs and sheikh makhmud swept out ahead of his elders moving fast and with a light soundless tread so that he seemed to flow like water from the rooftop khalid followed him the others crowding after them and in a moment there was only myself and the emirs representative left he looked unhappy his arrogance undermined by this development which had clearly affected his embassy i smiled at him waving him to the staircase ahead of me and was amused at the childish way he turned his back on me in a huff from the rooftop i could see men running the news seemed to have spread round the oasis in a flash and south beyond the palms another dust trail moved across the desert by the time i had found my way down to the great courtyard the whole male population of saraifa seemed gathered there and when the landrover driven by colonel whitaker himself turned slowly through the gateway forcing a passage through the crush to where sheikh makhmud stood waiting a great shout went up haji haji in the passenger seat beside whitaker sat erkhard as cool and neat and spotless as when i had seen him last the greetings over the companys general manager was taken into the palace i had a glimpse of whitakers face as he walked beside sheikh makhmud towering over him and all the arabs round him he wasnt smiling and yet it expressed his elation a secret almost violent emotion twenty years was a long time and this the culmination of his life the moment of victory it seemed a pity david couldnt be here to share it nobody took any notice of me now i walked out through the main gate down into the shade of the palms and sat by the steaming waters of the shireeya gorde whitaker erkhard entwhistle those three women my brain reeled with the heat unable to fix any pattern to my thoughts i returned finally to my turret room it was cooler there the shadowed interior peaceful and i took my siesta to the lazy buzzing of flies the distant murmur of people wild with joy i must have slept heavily for when i woke the sun was low and there was a little pile of freshlylaundered clothes beside me a tropical suit shirt tie pants socks there was also a note from whitaker the concession is signed and there is a feast to celebrate i thought you might like a change of clothes yousif will call you at sunset as soon as i started to put them on i knew the clothes werent his for he was much taller and these fitted me reasonably well they were obviously davids and it seemed to me strange that i should be attending this feast in his clothes the acid smell of wood smoke permeated the room and the hubbub of sound from the village square drew me to the embrasure the whole beaten expanse was full of people and cooking fires the carcases of sheep and goats hung by their hind legs their slashed throats dripping blood into bowls chickens were being prepared and blackened pots of rice simmered over the fires half saraifa was in the square and there was a great coming and going of the sheikhs armed retainers who carried the cooked dishes into the palace the sun sank and the sky blazed red for an instant and then died to purple and light greens you come now sir please yousif stood at the head of the stairway almost unrecognizable in clean clothes and spotless turban a curved khanjar knife gleaming silver at his waist he took me down to a central courtyard that i hadnt seen before it was packed with retainers the silver and brass of guns and cartridges gleaming in the shadows the sheikh and his guests were already gathered in the long colonnaded room on the far side and dishes lay in lines in the dust khalid came forward to greet me he was beautifully clad in long robes of finest cashmere a brown cloak goldembroidered and his eyes newly madeup with kohl i looking enormous his beard shining and silky with some scented lotion whitaker was seated on one side of sheikh makhmud erkhard on the other and next to whitaker sat sheikh abdullah of hadd you sit with me khahid said as i passed erkhard he looked up grant i couldnt help being amused at his surprise they told me in sharjah that youd left with gorde but i didnt expect to see you here he frowned where is gorde do you know i think he flew back to bahrain he nodded good as i took my place beside khalid retainers were already moving among the guests with ewers of water we rinsed our hands and the first great platters were moved forward on to the rugs the occasion was very formal nobody talked unless the sheikh himself was talking the result was that conversation went in disconcerting leaps one moment bedlam the next a silence in which the only sound was the coming and going of the retainers in the courtyard the feast was a monstrous gargantuan affair mutton goats flesh young camel chicken gazelle the platters came on and on and kept on coming the meat nestled on piledup heaps of rice eggs floating in a spiced gravy like little yellow balls omelettes piled in tiers flat and leathery like girdle cakes flat discs of bread liquid butter and cheese half the dishes never got beyond the colonnades but remained outside in the dust enough to feed an army like all bedouin feasts it was intended as a meal for the sheikhs bodyguard who were waiting on us for all the palace retainers and finally for the people of saraifa themselves so that they should all feel that they had shared in the event the cooking was rough desert cooking the meat overdone and swimming in fat the dishes lukewarm at best but i was so damned hungry i scarcely thought about what i was eating khalid kept plying me with delicacies the tongue of gazelle i remember and something that i popped into my mouth and swallowed whole hoping it wasnt what i thought it was an old man sat in a corner playing intermittently on what i can only describe as a lute the palace poet i was told later he would unburden himself of a poem in praise of the guests and of the occasion it will be a long poem khalid said and his eyes smiled whilst his face remained quite serious there was a sudden silence and into it the man next to me tossed a belch of impressive loudness there was a great deal of belching it was a mark of appreciation and before we were halfway through the meal i found myself doing the same so quickly and easily does one fall into the other peoples conventions also my stomach was by then very full outside in the courtyard sheikh makhmuds falconers paraded their birds he was very proud of his falcons and seeing them talons gripped around wooden perches spiked into the sand or around the leathergauntleted arms of their keepers i found myself glancing at whitaker noticing the same quick predatory look the same sharp beaky features our eyes met for a moment and it seemed to me that the mood of exhilaration had drained out of him as though success had a sour taste or perhaps it was the clothes i was wearing reminding him of his son the main dishes had all been removed now lights were brought for the sun had set and it was growing dark they were modern chromiumplated pressure lamps and they were hung on nails in the walls where they hissed and glared and had to be constantly pumped to maintain the pressure and with the lamps came dishes of every sort of tinned fruit there was halwa too coffee followed and at a sign from sheikh makhmud the poet moved into the centre he sat facing the guests and began plucking at his lute chanting a ballad the story khalid said of saraifas need of water and haj whitakers long search for oil it had the effect of intensifying the mood of excitement that gripped all the arabs all except sheikh abdullah who sat staring stonily into space and then suddenly the stillness was shattered by the noise of an aircraft flying low the balladsinger faltered the sound of the lute ceased the story came abruptly to a halt unfinished the sound swept in a roar over the palms i thought i caught a glimpse of a dark shape against the stars and then the engine died it was coming in to land and sheikh makhmud called to his secretary and a guard was despatched to escort the visitors everybody was talking at once and erkhard leaned across to me and hissed who is it do you know i didnt answer but i think he must have guessed for his eyes were coldly bleak and there was a tightness about his mouth i looked past him to where whitaker sat his face was expressionless but his body had a stillness that was without repose after what seemed a very long wait gorde and otto were escorted into the courtyard it was a strange moment for gorde walked straight in on the feast limping and leaning on his stick the sweatstained trilby jammed firmly on his grizzled head his battered features set in grim lines he didnt greet sheikh makhmud he didnt greet anyone he stopped in the middle of the centre archway and stared in silence at the gathering my briefcase tucked under his arm it was an effective entrance and i knew by his aggressive manner that he had intended it to be impressive too for he was dressed exactly as i had last seen him and behind him crowded the bodyguard all armed to the teeth it was impressive because of the contrast the man so small so completely at the mercy of the armed men behind him and yet so dynamic so completely in command of the situation he ignored sheikh makhmuds greeting whats the feast for that harsh voice seemed to cut through the room nobody moved nobody spoke even sheikh makhmud seemed stunned into silence mister erkhard the mister was a calculated slap in the face i take it youve signed a concession agreement theres nothing else for saraifa to celebrate at this moment and then without giving erkhard a chance to reply he turned to sheikh makhmud i hope youre not a party to this that you signed in ignorance of the true situation i dont understand sheikh makhmuds hands fluttered in a way that suggested dark moths endeavouring to cope with the intrusion of unwelcome thoughts slipping into arabic he began a speech of welcome rudely gorde cut him short have you got the concession agreement on you id like to see it please he held out his hand and such was the driving force of the mans personality the absolute conviction that men would obey him that sheikh makhmud slipped his hand into the folds of his robe and brought out the document meekly he handed it over i think you find everything is all right the soft words the gentle voice gave no sign of doubt or tension gorde called to one of the bodyguard to bring him a light a stillness hung over the scene as he unfolded the document and glanced quickly through it then he raised his head and looked directly at erkhard and you signed this on behalf of the company the note of censure brought an immediate reaction from erkhard as general manager im entitled to sign concession agreements his voice was thin a little venomous as he added you should know that you signed enough of them in your day but never one like this and slapping the document with his hand he added this isnt our normal agreement our normal form of agreement simply gives the company the right to prospect this makes it a legal charge upon the company to do so moreover and his gaze fastened on whitaker it doesnt limit it to the area south of here where your rig is it covers the whole of saraifa including the area in dispute on the hadd border philip whitaker had risen to his feet id like a word with you and id like a word with you gorde said sharply in private no well settle this thing here and now i just want a straight answer to a straight question is there or is there not oil where youre drilling were only down to three thousand odd feet that doesnt answer my question gorde stared at him coldly there isnt any oil is there there never was any oil there and there never will be i dont believe it erkhard too was on his feet it doesnt matter whether you believe it or not alex gorde rapped backits the truth but hes drilling with his own money hes invested every penny hes got ask grant he handles his financial affairs and whitaker admits hes out here partly because his money is almost exhausted a man doesnt put all his savings first into a thorough seismological survey and then into a drilling programme bait the tone of gordes voice brought erkhard up short he was baiting the trap i dont understand of course you dont youd never in a thousand years understand a man like charles whitaker you ride him out of the company and it never occurs to you that hell get his own back some day if you hadnt been so intent on trying at the last minute to rectify your position and you thought you were getting an oilfield on the cheap for the price of his development cost plus per cent on royalties well you ask him you just ask him whether theres any oil there but it wasnt necessary one glance at whitakers face told erkhard all he needed to know it was drawn and haggard the colour of putty and though the mouth moved no words came erkhard crossed to gorde took the document from his hand and tore it across and across and dropped the pieces in the dust there was a deathly hush ah eyes were turned on sheikh makhmud waiting for his reaction his face was the colour of clay a shocked almost oldwomanish face and his hands were trembling in the wide sleeves of his robe sir philip he had some difficulty in controlling his voice your company has signed an agreement to tear up the paper is not to say the agreement does not exist you can take us to court erkhard said but if gordes right youll lose your case sheikh makhmud waved his hands to signify that he had no intention of taking the company to court he ignored erkhard addressing himself to gorde i have always trusted the british and you also you have been my friend i am still your friend gorde said then please you will honour the agreement there is no agreement his voice held a note of pity now mr erkhard has done the only thing possible in the circumstances he turned to whitaker for gods sake charles did you have to raise their hopes like this it was clear from his words that he didnt like the role he was being forced to play the truth was bound to come out in the end what is the truth the pale eye was fastened on gorde in an aloof stare do you know it are you so sure theres no oil in saraifa for twenty years now i have searched to hell with your theory gorde snapped just answer me this a simple yes or no is there oil where youre drilling ive told you were only down to just over three thousand feet erkhard could have waited you know damn well he couldnt wait youre not such a fool that you havent guessed why im out here risking my health on another tour of the gulf you thought my theory sound enough at one time remember and i backed you gorde rasped i backed you because youd got faith in yourself but now i wonder now i think youve lost that faith i dont think you believe in your theory any more what makes you say that whitakers voice was sharp unnaturally high and his face looked shocked gorde leaned his squat body forward because he said if youd any faith in your theory youd have backed your son instead you left him to die out there on his own alone deserted each word punched home in that rasping voice it was a terrible indictment and he added didnt you understand that he was attempting to do what youd no longer the guts to even try and do to find oil real oil not this sham this clever crooked dodge to trap us into signing philip it came from whitakers mouth as a strangled cry i want to talk to you alone it was an appeal the call of past friendship but gorde ignored it ive nothing to say to you charles the words came bleak and cold except perhaps this if there is any oil in saraifa then my guess is that its right there on the border where your son was prospecting but he added turning to sheikh makhmud i have to tell you that theres absolutely no question of our company or any other company for that matter undertaking exploratory work there at the present time i was with the political resident for two hours this morning he made the governments attitude very clear and now that i know what happened here last night simply because one of our geologists was inadvertently on that border i think hes right there was silence then and for a moment colonel whitaker continued to stand there as though shocked into immobility knowing what i did i felt sorry for him gorde had misinterpreted his motives but there was nothing he could do about it at that moment whitaker knew that abruptly he gathered his dark embroidered cloak about him im sorry you had to come when you did philip his tone was bitter his manner arrogant unbending aloof youll live i hope to regret the words youve said and your hasty judgment i did what i thought best for saraifa and makhmud knows it he walked past gorde then his one eye staring straight ahead of him as though on parade a beaten proud old man the ranks of the bodyguard parted and he walked through them magnificent and solitary with his departure the whole place became a babel of sound it was as though whitaker alone had held down the safetyvalve of the crowds temper violence quivered on the sultry air and i got up quickly and went over to gorde i think you ought to see whitaker i said as soon as possible tonight why but the place had suddenly become quiet sheikh makhmud was on his feet making a speech presumably of explanation i cant tell you here but i think its important you should see him its true is it you look after his financial affairs he stared at me his face tired now leaning heavily on his stick wheres entwhistle i told him and he nodded sensible fellow this is no place to be just now he glanced at the sea of faces that packed the courtyard beyond it all looks very feudal doesnt it but theres an element of democracy in these desert states the sheikhs rule by consent not by right just bear that in mind he was turning away but then he checked heres your briefcase he handed it to me youll find all the papers there again i pressed him to see whitaker but he shook his head it wouldnt serve any purpose after what ive said and anyway i dont intend to hes the pride of the devil has charles go and see him i said and take these papers with you i held the briefcase out to him he looked at the case and then at me i took them along with me when i went to see the prpg this morning i thought i might persuade him he gave that little shrug of his if he could have given us the all clear politically i think i might have taken a chance on that boys survey and backed erkhard but he didnt more he gave me a direct order that the company was to keep clear of the area it was final and as though to emphasize the point he said ill be leaving tomorrow morning as soon as its light no doubt charles will take care of you but if you want a lift out sheikh makhmud stopped talking and the courtyard was in an uproar again gordes hand gripped my arm hope turned to despair makes men dangerous he said his small bloodshot eyes looking into mine theres going to be trouble here and these people are in an ugly mood he turned abruptly away from me and in the midst of the noise and confusion i heard him say casually to sheikh makhmud mind if we have something to eat im damned hungry immediately sheikh makhmud was the solicitous host courteous and hospitable faddal faddal he waved gorde to the place vacated by whitaker found room for otto called for food to be brought khalid was in the courtyard now pacifying the tribesmen shepherding them out he was quick decisive a born leader but they went sullenly i returned to my place feeling nervous and illatease i didnt need to be told that they were in an ugly mood i could feel it all around me it was like an electric charge and the uproar had spread from the feasting place into the great courtyard beyond and out into the village of saraifa the sound of their voices murmured on the night air a continual angry buzzing as the whole population swarmed about the palace men came in and out to stand and stare and it seemed to me that their eyes in the lamplight blazed with a wild fanatical hate erkhard felt it too for he leaned across to me and said its all very well for gorde to say hell leave at daybreak hes got his plane here mine is ten miles away beside that rig and he added damn the man a moslem i should have guessed hed be up to every sort of trickery did you have to turn him against his son i said angrily but it didnt register with him greed he said its an arab failing i thought that was good coming from an oilman with his reputation but i didnt have a chance to reply for yousif was suddenly bending over me collonel want you come he hissed very important sahib i hesitated unwilling to leave the protection of sheikh makhmuds presence or to lose contact with gorde and his promise of a lift out but i couldnt very well refuse all right i said and got to my feet courtesy demanded that i pay my respects to sheikh makhmud before leaving he didnt rise and his eyes regarded me coldly from behind their glasses no doubt he held me partly responsible for what had happened his face looked haggard the line of his mouth bitter i turned to gorde im going to see whitaker now i said but id like to accept your offer of a lift he had just taken a piece of meat from the dish in front of him and he looked up licking the grease from his fingers first light he said and watch it grant charles has lost face and anything can happen to a man thats been hit as hard as he has yousifs hand was on my arm and as i turned i saw sheikh abdullahs dark eyes fixed on me the men in the courtyard fell back from me suddenly silent as we made our way out their eyes followed me gleaming in the lamplight and once again i caught the whisper of that word nasrani there was no mistaking the significance of it this time they were hating us all that night the quicksands of umm al samim whitaker was waiting for me on that same rooftop over looking the desert but this time he was pacing up and down it his movements were caged and restless he checked only momentarily as i entered will philip gorde come and see me do you think he asked and when i told him no he resumed his pacing after all these years to talk to me like that it was too dark for me to see his face but i could tell from the stooped outline of his shoulders the lowered head above all the nervous quickness of his movements the way he spoke that his mood was one of desperation all my life ive had to use subtlety its been part of my job out here always the need to find my way through the maze of arab politics never a straight course always the devious approach these oilmen out from england stupid men like erkhard who dont understand the arab mentality they dont realize the problems of these bedou sheikhs the feuds the vague boundaries that didnt matter so long as it was desert sand and nothing more history culture race they go back three thousand years and more virtually without change untouched by western civilization its a culture in which the individual is still dominant personality and human emotions the overriding factor governing mens actions and over all this are the outside factors international politics the foreign office even philip doesnt really know the arab though he likes to think he does it was the fact of having somebody with him of his own race the words came out of him in a pentup torrent but what he said was said for his own benefit not for mine an attempt to justify his actions but when hed said it all he turned and faced me suddenly almost humble suppose i go to philip myself there was no point in raising his hopes i dont think it would do any good and i told him about gordes visit to the prpg his head came up in other words i was right the companys not allowed to enter into any agreement involving the hadd border there was relief in his voice but it was overlaid by the bitterness of frustration and he added acidly nice of the political resident to confirm my own assessment of the situation so exactly his shoulders sagged he turned his face towards the desert then ive no alternative now he said it to himself not to me standing very still looking out to where the stars met the hard line of the sands over thirty years ive been out here grant im practically a bedou i think like them act like them im over sixty now and i know more about the arab and arabia he stopped there and in the stillness i could hear the breeze rattling the palms he turned slowly and stared at me all these years out here and a boy of twentyfour sees it clearer than i do his voice was harsh his face grim the lines cut by sand and sun so deep they might have been scored by a knife its a pity you didnt reach that conclusion earlier i said he took a step forward his eye bulging his body taut gripped in a sudden blaze of anger but all he said was yes its a pity he turned and resumed his pacing the shoulders stooped again heredity is a strange thing he murmured if wed been less alike he shrugged and added in that case i dont suppose hed have gone back to the locations against my orders he fell silent again then the breeze was from the east and it brought with it the murmur of saraifa like the beat of the surf on a distant shore you wanted to see me i reminded him the sound of that distant crowd made me anxious to get back to gorde yes about finances he kicked a cushion towards me and told me to sit down just what have i got left he demanded folding himself up on the floor beside me i was glad gorde had returned my briefcase then i could have told him the position more or less from memory but all the papers were there and it made it easier he shouted for yousif to bring a light and for the next ten minutes i went over the figures with him he hadnt much left but there were some shares i hadnt sold and theyd appreciated quite considerably and after repaying back loans i thought hed have just enough if he lived quietly i thought hed decided to go home you see to leave arabia and retire it seemed reasonable for a man of his age im sorry its not more i said putting the papers back in their folder he nodded ill have to borrow then it would be better i said returning the file to my briefcase if you could arrange to live within your means he stared at me and then he burst out laughing but the laughter was without humour so you think im beaten do you you think im turning tail and heading for home like a village cur the fury building up in him seemed to get hold of his throat so that the words became blurred thats what theyll all be thinking i dont doubt gorde makhmud that man erkhard and then in a voice that was suddenly matteroffact i take it youll be going back in one of the company planes gorde has offered me a lift good ill have letters for you to various merchants in bahrain a list of things to order too would you like to wait here whilst i write them or shall i send yousif up with them later when is philip leaving by the way first light and because i wanted to make certain i didnt miss the flight i asked him to have the letters sent after me he nodded that gives me the night in which to think this thing over he summoned yousif and gave him instructions to take me back to the palace by the way he said as i got to my feet you mentioned a package griffith had brought you something david took to him on board the emerald isle was that his survey report i nodded based on henry farrs old report yes i take it entwhistle was running a check on davids locations you dont know with what result i suppose no he didnt say he had risen to his feet and standing close to me he seemed to tower over me id like to see my sons survey report have you got it with you in your briefcase i realized then why hed considered his finances inadequate good god i said youre surely not going to start drilling operations on that border i was staring at him remembering what gorde had said but there was nothing wildeyed about him he was bitter yes hed been humiliated deeply shocked by the behaviour of a man hed always regarded as his friend but the eye that met mine was level and unflinching and i knew that he hadnt yet crossed the borderline into madness you havent a hope of succeeding now i said the emir will be watching that border and the instant you start drilling he smiled thinly im not afraid of death you know being a muslim makes one fatalistic he turned away leaning his body on the parapet and staring out across the dunes grey now with the first light of the risen moon i dont know what im going to do yet i havent made up my mind he hesitated and then turned to me but if i should decide to go ahead then id like to have davids report he gives the locations i take it and when i nodded he said do they coincide with henry farrs i dont know no of course not i ran a check survey myself you know that was a long time ago now when i had a bodyguard of more than a dozen men all on the companys payroll and the use of the companys equipment in those days quite soon after the war i reckoned my chaps could hold the emir off if it came to a showdown long enough for me to pull out with my equipment but it never came to that i got away with it without the emir knowing but i knew i couldnt do that with a drilling rig then how do you expect to get away with it now i demanded he shrugged i dont know that i can he was smiling softly to himself but ive been out here a long time grant i know that little emir inside out ive had spies in hadd sending me back reports and i think i know enough now he gave a little shrug and the smile was no longer soft it was hard almost cruel im outside the company now it makes a difference and its just possible that i could get away with it where the company couldnt he straightened up well what about it are you going to let me have davids report it wasnt ethical of course he hadnt been mentioned in his sons will but then id failed with gorde and i could now regard myself as free to take what action i liked also i thought that had david known what i now knew he would have wanted his father to have the locations i gave him a copy of the survey report and after writing the location fixes out on a slip of paper i gave him that too he glanced at it and then slipped it into the folds of his cloak thank you he held out his hand youve come a long journey im sorry it didnt have a pleasanter ending ill send yousif with the letters in a few hours i hesitated but i knew he wasnt a man to take advice in that case youd better let me know what im to tell gorde nothing he said nothing at all i left him then standing alone on that rooftop with the desert clean and white behind him and followed yousif out to the battered landrover it was cooler now and i felt almost relaxed in a few hours i should be able to have a bath and a change and sit back with a long cool drink and yet riding down the palmshadowed track between the date gardens i found myself filled with a strange nostalgia for the place it had an appeal i found difficult to define a sort of poetry and the dimremembered lines of a poem came into my mind something about being crazed with the spell of far arabia and stealing his wits away i was beginning to understand what this place had meant to david to a boy whod never had a real home before and who was wide open to the strange beauty of it and as impressionable as any celt i was still thinking about this when we ran out from the shadow of the palms and saw the square black with the mass of men standing there the roar of their voices came to us in a wall of sound yousif eased his foot off the accelerator hesitating uncertain whether to drive straight to the main gate or not and then three figures rose from beside the shireeya and stood blocking our path sheikh khalids men yousif said and there was relief in his voice as he braked to a stop they clambered on to the mudguards talking urgently in the hard guttural tongue that is always associated in my mind with flies and sand we go a different way is much better yousif swung the landrover round circling the gravel rise and approaching the palace from the rear through a litter of barastis all apparently deserted we stopped finally at a small door with an ironbarred grille set in an otherwise blank wall khalids three men closed round me as i got out and when i told yousif i wanted to be taken straight to gorde he said you go with them now sahib sheikh khalids orders and he drove off leaving me there eyes peered at us through the grille the door opened and i was hustled through the dark passages of the palace and up to my turret room there my three guards left me and standing at the embrasure i looked down on what was obviously a very explosive situation the crowd was being harangued by a man on a rooftop opposite and another was shouting to them from the back of a camel the whole square was packed solid every man and boy in the oasis must have been gathered there and many of them were armed camels were being brought into the square and men were mounting on the outskirts of the crowd and all the time the agitators shouting and the crowd roaring and the tension mounting the air was thick with menace and then somebody fired a rifle the bullet smacked into the mud wall not far from my embrasure it was all that was needed to set that crowd alight other guns were fired little sparks of flame a noise like firecrackers and a great shout the crowd became fluid flowing like water moving with the sudden purpose of a river in spate men leaped to their camels mounting on the arch of their lowered necks driving them with the flood tide down the slope to the dark fringe of the date gardens in a moment the square was deserted and with the murmur of the crowd dying to silence the dark walls of my room closed in on me i had a sudden overwhelming need then to find gorde and the others and i picked up my briefcase and felt my way down the black curve of the stairs a light showed faint in the passage at the bottom a figure stirred in the shadows thick arabic words and the thrust of a gun muzzle in my stomach halted me it was one of khalids men and he was nervous his finger on the trigger there was nothing for it but to retreat to my room again in the mood prevailing in the oasis it was some comfort to know that i had a guard i lay down and tried to get some rest the sound of the crowd was still faintly audible it came to me through the embrasure soft as a breeze whispering through the palm trees and then it died and there was an unnatural quiet it didnt last long for the shouting started again shots too it was a long way away i got up and went to the embrasure peering out at the empty square and the dark line of the palms shadowed by the moon a glow lit the night sky to the east it grew and blossomed then suddenly an explosion a great waft of flame and smoke beyond the date gardens and after that silence the flame abruptly gone and the palms a dark shadowline again in the moons light voices called within the palace the sound muffled by the thickness of mud walls and then for a while it was quiet but soon the crowd was ebbing back into the square flowing into it in little groups silent now and strangely subdued i was sure that it was gordes plane id seen go up in smoke and flame and i stayed by the embrasure watching the tide of humanity as it filled the square wondering what theyd do now hoping to god their passions were spent bare feet sounded on the stairs i turned uncertain what to expect my mouth suddenly dry the beam of a torch probed the room blinding me as it fastened on my face but it was only my three guards back again jabbering arabic at me and gesturing for me to accompany them i was hurried along dark passages past gaping doorways where men sat huddled in dimlit rooms arguing fiercely the whole palace was in a ferment we came finally to a lowceilinged room lit by a pressure lamp and in its harsh glare i saw khalid sitting surrounded by robed figures they were mostly young men and they had their guns resting across their knees or leaning close at hand against the walls he rose to greet me his face unsmiling the bones sharpetched in the lamplight i am sorry sir for the disturbance you have been given a gesture of dismissal and the room quietly emptied the conference broken up please to sit he waved me to a cushion on the carpeted floor and sat down opposite me his legs folding neatly under him with the ease of a man who has never known a chair what happened i asked did they set fire to gordes plane is a mistake they are angry and they fire some bullets into it he was very tense coiled up like a spring too tightly wound somewhere a child was crying and i heard womens voices soft and comforting you ave been to see haj whitaker is not so and when i nodded he said i understand you are concerned in the management of his affairs his financial affairs i didnt want him to think i was responsible for anything that had happened out here his manner his whole bearing had changed the surface layer of a university education gone entirely i glanced over my shoulder my three guards were still there squatting in the open doorway khalid was staring at me out of his dark eyes the kohl had worn off lacking that artificial lustre his eyes looked sad and sombre i have spoken with my father i understand now what it is haj whitaker try to do for saraifa unfortunately i am not before tonight in my fathers confidence and he added with a trace of bitterness better if he had told me better also if haj whitaker explain to david what he is doing he paused there and i was conscious again of the strain he was under of the tension building up in him he leaned suddenly forward what will he do now he asked me now that meester erkhard dont honour the concession he sign what will haj whitaker do thats his affair i said i didnt want to become involved in this please meester grant i must know i dont think hes made up his mind yet he stared at me do you think he may leave saraifa and when i didnt answer his eyes clouded and he seemed to sag we have very much need of him now he said quietly he has the ear of many sheikhs of some of his own people also and he added since ever i am a small boy i have known about this great man haj whitaker i can remember the feast to celebrate the original concession he was young then and full of fire but always always people here my father and myself also we have looked to haj whitaker he is known from the persian gulf to the hadhramaut from muscat on the indian sea to the waterholes of the rub al khali and the liwa oasis as a great man and the friend of all the bedou particularly he is known as the friend of sheikh makhmud if he desert us now im sure hes no intention of deserting you but he didnt seem to hear me there must be some reconciliation it is altogether vital he stared at me hard meester grant there is something i must know it is if i can trust you thats up to you i said wondering what was coming and i added ive been virtually a prisoner since i returned from seeing colonel whitaker he gave a quick impatient shrug is for your own safety but i wondered wheres sir philip gorde i didnt want to be involved in this any further id like to be taken to him now first you will listen please to what i have to tell you he seemed to consider his dark eyes fixed on me searching my face i think you are a friend to david before you work for his father is not so it was because i befriended david that colonel whitaker asked me to look after his financial affairs yess yess i believe that but his eyes still searched my face as though he wasnt sure what is it you want to tell me i wanted to get this over presumably gorde and otto would be leaving with erkhard and i wanted to be on that plane away from the dark feuds of this desert world he didnt answer at once but then he suddenly seemed to make up his mind he leaned forward david is alive he said i stared at him too astounded for the moment to utter a word alive those three women but remembering their attitude i remembered whitakers too what do you mean i was suddenly extremely angry with khalid how can he be alive and when he didnt say anything i added its more than six weeks since your father sent an armed guard to arrest him and they found his camp deserted i know but is alive he said it very seriously where is he then i still didnt believe him i thought it was a damned stupid lie hed thought up to try and keep whitaker in saraifa as if whitaker with all his experience of the desert would believe it you tell me where he is and no his voice was flat and decisive no i dont tell you not yet but is alive that i promise meester grant i suppose he realized that just stating it wouldnt convince me for he went on quickly when haj whitaker is gone to visit the emir i am much disturbed for davids life he is already on that border almost two moons with the truck that was brought by his father across the jebel mountains from muscat he is altogether alone and his father i believe to be hating him for things he has said what sort of things he shrugged he dont tell me but he is very much unhappy i know that he come here to this room to see me before he leave and he warn me there is no oil where haj whitaker is drilling that the only place there is any probability of oil is on that border he says also that his father is an old man now and has lost faith in himself and that he is drilling to cheat the company for revenge against this meester erkhard and nothing more and you believed him he is as my brother he dont lie to me and then he told me how hed taken two of his men and a spare camel and had ridden to the border as soon as he knew david was to be arrested hed found david alone deserted by his crew after emptying the spare cans from the seismological truck david had driven it into the rub al khali desert until it had run out of petrol on the side of that dune then he leaves the truck and rides on with us it is all as we arrange it together you mean you planned it in advance yess it is all arranged between us because i am afraid for this emergency the details fitted they fitted so well that i was forced to accept what hed told me as the truth but he wouldnt reveal where david was hidden he is with my two men hamid and a boy called ah they are of the wahiba and altogether to be trusted why have you told me this i asked because everything is gone wrong everything david planned and now i need your help you are davids friend and also you work for his father i think peraps only you can bring reconciliation between them and without reconciliation but he seemed reluctant to put his fears into words what do you think now sir he asked abruptly is reconciliation possible how will haj whitaker act when he finds david is alive how would you react if you thought your son were dead but i realized id no idea what whitakers reaction would be i didnt know enough about their relationship how hed come to regard his son in those last months if sue were right and they really had been close at one time itll come as a hell of a shock to him yess but is it possible a reconciliation of course particularly now that colonel whitaker i hesitated wondering whether i ought to tell him what was in whitakers mind but i thought hed a right to know that he was considering drilling on his sons locations after all it was what david had wanted theyd be able to work on it together now with this thought in mind i was quite unprepared for the violence of khalids reaction when i told him is imbecility he cried jumping to his feet he cannot do that now is altogether too late he was pacing up and down very agitated and waving his arms about sheikh abdullah has already left to return to hadd he will report to the emir all that has occurred here if then haj whitaker remove his oil rig to the border he turned to me still in great agitation and said it will mean war between us and hadd war do you understand for my father is guided by haj whitaker the emir knows that and if haj whitaker himself is on that border then the emir will know there is oil there and that my father will concede no revision of the boundaries between hadd and saraifa you understand you will help me he didnt give me time to answer but summoned my escort we leave at once for there is little time excuse please i go to my father now he left then and i was alone with my three arab guards the child had stopped crying there was no sound of womens voices the palace slept and sitting there thinking about david convinced now that he was still alive i gradually became resigned to the fact that i wasnt going to get away in the plane that morning khalid was gone about ten minutes when he came back his face was pale his manner subdued i tell my father i am going to dhaid to gather more men did you tell him about whitaker no i dont tell him and i dont tell him about david either not yet is very much disturbed already come is david at dhaid i asked no but sheikh hassa holds that village for us he will give us camels and perhaps salim bin gharuf is there i dont know we have to hurry he gave an order to my escort and i was hustled out of the palace into the great courtyard where his landrover stood the escort piled in behind us and as we drove down into the date gardens it was difficult to believe that the people of this peaceful place were threatened with extinction that they had been so roused that night that theyd set fire to an oil company plane the breeze had died and the whole world was still nothing moved and when we ran out into the desert beyond the palms it was into a dead white world for the moon was high now we headed south khalid driving the landrover flat out bucking the soft sand patches eating up the flat gravel stretches at a tearing speed we were held up for a time by a choked petrol feed and the first grey light of dawn was taking the brightness from the moon when a needletip of latticed steel showed above the grey whaleback of a dune it was whitakers oil rig a mobile outfit the sort they call an a rig truck and drill combined it stood up out of the desert floor like a steel spear planted in the sand as a challenge to the vast wastes of emptiness that surrounded it beside it was a barasti two bedou tents and some tattered wisps of black cloth that acted as windbreaks as we neared it we heard the sound of the diesel could see the arab drilling crew busy drawing pipe other arabs were loading a second truck with lengths of pipe early though it was the place was humming with activity and when khalid stopped and questioned them he learned that yousif had arrived just over an hour before with orders for them to prepare to move whitaker had made his decision he was moving his rig to the hadd border and up in my empty turret room there were doubtless letters waiting for me to take to bahrain is crazy khalid cried jumping back into the driving seat why does he do this now he should do it before or not at all he drove on then passing close below the derrick it looked old and battered the metal bare of paint and burnished bright in places by the drifting sands the derrick man was up aloft stacking pipe his loin cloth smeared with oil his turbanned head a bundle of cloth against the paling sky dawn was coming swiftly now and beyond the shallow slope of a dune i saw the tinselgleam of erkhards aircraft it stood at the far end of a cleared stretch of gravel and the sight of it brought back to me my urge to escape from the desert but when i demanded to be taken to it khalid took no notice except to give an order to the arabs in the back i reached for the ignition key a brown hand seized my arm another gripped my shoulders and i was held pinned to my seat while we plunged at more than thirty miles an hour into a world of small dunes and the plane vanished beyond my reach after that the going was very bad for mile after weary mile and when finally we came out of the little dune country it was on to a gravel plain ribbed by crumbling limestone outcrops a few driedup herbs brittle as dead twigs bore witness to the fact that it had rained there once many years ago the land was dry and dead flat as a pan and as dawn broke and the sun came up i lost all sense of horizon for the whitish surface reflected the glare in an endless mirage all the way from the rig the going was bad we had more trouble with the petrol feed and it was past midday before we caught sight of the low hill on which dhaid stood it throbbed in the heat haze looking like the back of a stranded whale surrounded by pools of water the crumbling mud walls of the village were merged in colour and substance with the crumbling rock on which they were built so that it wasnt until we stopped at the foot of a wellworn camel track that i could make out the shape of the buildings there was a singlearched gateway and we had barely started up the track on foot when the villagers poured out of it and rushed upon us leaping from rock to rock shouting and brandishing their weapons khalid showed no alarm walking steadily forward his gait his whole bearing suddenly full of dignity and then they were upon us engulfing us a wild ragamuffin lot teeth and eyes flashing dark sinewy hands stretched out to us in the clasp of friendship they were dirty dustylooking men some with no more than a loin cloth and they looked dangerous with their black hair and bearded faces and their animal exuberance and yet the warmth of that unexpected welcome was such after that empty gruelling drive that i greeted them like brothers their horny calloused hands gripped around my wrists it was the beginning of my acceptance of desert life sheikh hassa followed behind the rest of the village picking his way sedately over the rock his gunbearer just ahead of him carrying his new bsa rifle which was his pride and joy he was a short toughlooking man with a shaggy black beard that gave him an almost piratical appearance he greeted khalid with deference touching his hand with his fingers carrying them to his lips and to his heart faddal and we went up the track and through the gateway into the village a crowded square pulsating in the heat a cool darkened room spread with a rug camel milk in bowls still warm from the beasts udder and talk endless endless talk i leaned back on the cushions my eyelids falling my head nodding the buzz of flies the buzz of talk not even coffee could keep me awake and then khalid called to me and introduced me to a sinewy old man who stood halfnaked in the gloom a filthy loin cloth round his waist and his headcloth wound in a great pile above his greying locks so that he looked topheavy this was salim bin gharuf he is of the duru khalid said and he knows the place i asked him what place but he ignored that is better now that you wear these please he produced a bundle of bedou clothing holding them out to me they were castoff clothes and none too clean is this really necessary i demanded he nodded emphatically is better you look like one of us now why where are we going i tell you later not here you will change please he helped me off with my european clothes and wound the loin cloth round my waist the long dusty robe the length of cloth twisted about my head sandals too and an old brasshiked knife for my belt sheikh hassa watched me critically i think the clothes were his men came and peered and the crowded room resounded with their mirth khalid sensed my annoyance they dont mean any disrespect sir and you are going where no faranji has been before save david it was meant to mollify but all it did was rouse my curiosity again well if you wont tell me where he is i said at least tell me how long it will take us to reach him a day and then half a day if we travel fast perhaps two days i dont know there is possibility of a storm i think perhaps he might have told me more but at that moment a man burst into the room shouting something and instantly all was confusion the room emptied with a rush that carried me with it out on to the white glare of a rooftop below us a single camel climbed wearily up the track urged on by its rider khalid pushed past me is one of my fathers racing camels he said five minutes later he returned with the rider a thickset man with long hair twisted up in his headcloth khalid talked for a moment with sheikh hassa and then with salim finally he came to me the oilmen have left and at dawn this morning several large raiding parties from hadd crossed our borders my father orders me to return my surprise was occasioned less by the news than by the realization that the camel must have made the journey in less time than we had taken in the landrover but khalids next words jolted me into awareness of what it meant to me personally you go now with salim but please meester grant his face looked old now beyond his years haggard after the long drive the sleepless night his eyes staring at me burned with an inner fire is altogether important now tell david what has happened that his plan has failed and that there is no hope now of the oil concession he must go to his father immediately but my mind was on the practicalities thats all very well i said glancing uneasily at the old man but salim doesnt speak any english and i dont know the country i looked about me quickly khalids bodyguard was behind him sheikh hassa right beside me there was no escape where am i supposed to go anyway where is david you go to umm al samim sheikh hassa leaned his black beard forward and his harsh voice repeated the words umm al samim on a note of surprise and then he looked at me and rolled his eyes up into his head and laughed and made a strangling sound whats he mean by that i demanded whats he trying to tell me khalids hand gripped my arm the umm al samim is quicksands but there is a way he added quickly and i glanced at hassa and knew that hed been telling me that i was going to my death i tell you there is a way khalid said fiercely salim knows it as far as the first good ground he will guide you as he guided us when we make original exploration two seasons past and what about the rest you will find by testing with a stick perhaps when you call david or the wahiba will hear you his grip on my arm tightened you will go suppose i refuse then i take you with me back to saraifa he was looking me straight in the face this is what you want isnt it correct to find david now you find him and he added staring at me hard are you afraid to go no im not afraid i saw him smile he knew after that id hardly refuse all right khalid i said ill go but what do you want me to do a boy hiding out in some quicksands isnt going to help you now he must help us he and his father we are at point of desperation now and it is his fault he said it without rancour a statement of fact and he added it was a good plan the way he visualize it to go into hiding and by making appearance he is dead to draw attention to his survey he think you will succeed to obtain the signature of sir gorde to a concession and that then peraps we have oil at least the support of the company and so of your people i but instead all is turned to disaster because he is working on that border the raiders of hadd are in our territory and the concession haj whitaker arrange is torn up we have no arab friends like the emir has we are alone and everything is in conspiracy now to destroy us his words the intensity with which he spoke showed me the tragedy of it father and son working for the same ends but against each other yes but what can he do he must ride to a meeting with his father salim has good camels you and david together you must persuade haj whitaker to stop drilling on the hadd border and to go to bahrain to the political resident if they dont send soldiers then please to send us modern weapons and automatic guns so that we can fight very well i said ill do what you say i only hope it works out tell david also he hesitated tell him it is possible i do not see him again and if that is happening then say to him that he is my brother and the emir abdulzaid bin sultan my enemy into death what do you mean i asked he will understand but youre not going to your death inshallah i do not know that his tone was fatalistic this is an old feud meester grant as old as saraifa is old or hadd it goes back many centuries to the days when all the falajes are running with water a hundred channels making irrigation for the palms then saraifa is a great garden extending many miles and the dates go by camel north to the sea and to india across the mountains to the batina coast and south to the hadhramaut even some say to mukalla and the olden port of cana to be carried by dhow to the far places of the world but we are always too much occupied with our gardens and the people of hadd are very much envying us for our riches they are men of the hills cruel and hard and altogether without goodness so he gave a helpless little shrug so it is that we are always fighting for our date gardens and one after another the falaj channels are being destroyed until saraifa is as you see it now open to the desert and soon to die if the falajes are not rebuilt do you know meester grant there is not one man who can tell me even when i am a little boy even by the hearsay of others his father or his grandfather what it is like when there are more than six falajes working always wars always until the british come a hundred years ago and now he spread his hands in a little gesture of helplessness now another war perhaps and if we do not have a victory then it is finish and in a few months the shamal will have blown the sands of the rub al khali over our walls and our houses and we shall be like those old lost cities in india there will be nothing to show that we ever exist in this place he stopped there a little breathless because he had put so much of himself and his emotions into foreign words you tell him that please he turned then and spoke rapidly to salim the tattered figure moved towards me you go now khalid said fi aman allah in the peace of god and you also i said the skinny hand of my guide was on my arm a steel grip propelling me down mud steps out into the shadowed cool of an alley in a little open space beyond there were camels crouched and at his cries three tall beasts lumbered to their feet they had provisions already loaded and dark skin bags bulging with water a boy brought two more camels and salim chattered a gaptoothed protest as he realized that i didnt even know how to mount my beast they brought it to its knees and put me on it and at a word it hoisted me violently into the air the old man put his foot on the lowered neck of the other and stepped lightly into the saddle tucking his legs behind him we left dhaid by a small gateway facing south just the two of us and the three pack beasts tied nosetotail the boy ran beside us as far as the base of the limestone hill and then we were out on the gravel flat and travelling fast a peculiar swaying gait it required all my concentration just to remain in the saddle perhaps it was as well for it left me no time to consider my predicament our shadows lumbered beside us for the sun was slanting towards the west and salim began to sing a highpitched monotonous song it was a small sound in the solitude that surrounded us but though i couldnt understand the words i found it comforting the sun vanished before it reached the horizon hazed and purple as a mulberry we camped at dusk where the dusty green of new vegetation spattered the sand between ribs of limestone the camels were let graze and salim built a fire of furze and cooked a mess of rice and meat one of the pack beasts was in milk and we drank it warm from the same bowl and when hed looked at his ancient rifle oiling it carefully we mounted and went on again we travelled all that night without a break the moon turned the desert to a bleak bone white and in the early hours a mist came up and it was cold by then i was too tired to care where i was going and only the pain of the saddle chafing the inside of my thighs the ache of unaccustomed muscles kept me awake the dawn brought a searing wind that whipped the mist aside and flung a moving cloud of sand in our faces lightning flashed in the gloom behind us but no rain fell just the wind and the driving sand particles we stopped again for food lukewarm and gritty with sand and then on again until the heat and the moving sand drove us into camp i laid my head on my briefcase covering my face with my headcloth and slept like the dead only to be woken again and told to mount my nose and mouth were dry with sand and we went on and on at a walking pace that was relentless in the demands it made on my endurance dawn broke and the sun lipped the mountains that poked their rugged tops above the horizon to the east salim didnt sing that day and as the wind died and the sand became still the heat increased until my head reeled and dark specks swam before my eyes my midday we were walking our camels along the edge of a dead flat world that stretched away into the west to disappear without horizon in a blur of haze there was no dune nor any outcrop of rock no tree no bush nothing to break the flat monotony of it salim turned in his saddle umm al samim he said with a sweep of his hand the palm held downward and quivering i remembered the strangled sound sheikh hassa had made at the mention of that name and yet it looked quite innocent only that unnatural flatness and the dark discoloration of water seepage revealed the quagmire that lay concealed below the crust of windblown sand we followed the shore of the sands for about an hour whilst the sun beat down on us and the dull expanse shimmered with humidity and then by the gnarled remains of some camel thorn we dismounted and started into the quicksands leading our camels close inshore there were patches of solid ground but farther out there was nothing that seemed to have any substance the ground and air both quivering as we struggled forward i cant remember any sense of fear fear is a luxury requiring energy and i had none to spare i can however remember every physical detail it was a sabhkat on the grand scale and beneath the hardbaked crust my feet touched slime at times it was difficult to stand at all at others i broke through to the black filth below and at every step i could feel the quiver of the mud the camels slithered bellowing in their fear in constant danger of losing their legs and falling straddled we had to drag the wretched beasts even beat them to keep them moving this and the need to be ready to give them some support when they slipped did much to keep my mind from the filthy death that threatened at every step and whenever i had a moment to look ahead there was the umm al samim stretched out pulsating in the humid glare innocentseeming under its crust of sand yet deadlylooking because it was so flat and level as level as a lake and it seemed to have no end it was like the sea when visibility is cut by haze but here there were no buoys no markers that i could see nothing from which salim could get his bearings yet once i saw the old tracks of camels the round holes half filled with sand and whenever i broke through to the mud below my feet found solid ground before i was in farther than my knees in some way that was not apparent to me salim was following a rib of rock hidden below the surface of the sand time had no meaning in the pitiless heat and the sweat rolled dripping down my back i had a moment of panic when i would have turned and run if it had been possible but then a camel slipped and a moment later salim seized my arm and pointed ahead with his rifle little tufts of withered herbs lay limp in isolated clumps and on the edge of visibility a gnarled thorn tree shimmered like a witch its gaunt arms crooked and beckoning with the first of the withered herbs i felt the ground under my feet it was hard and firm and when i set my foot down nothing quaked there was no gurgling sound no sound of imminent breakup of the crust where the camel thorn stood there was naked rock and i flung myself down revelling in the scorched hardness of it we were on a little island raised imperceptibly above the flat level of the quicksands and it was as far as salim had ever penetrated i watched him as he searched for khalids tracks stopping every now and then to call a highpitched carrying sound made with his hands cupped round his mouth but the steaming heat absorbed his cries like a damp blanket and there was no answer in the end he gave it up and began prodding with his camel stick along the edge of the sands twice i had to pull him out but finally he found firm ground beneath the crust and leaving the camels we started forward again moving a step at a time watching the quiver of the crust and prodding with the stick behind us our tracks vanished into nothing the rock island vanished too the white glare swallowing even the bulk of our camels we were alone then just the old man and myself in a little circle of flat sand that quaked and gurgled and sucked at our feet i dont know how long we were feeling our way like that once we saw the faint outline of a camels pad but only once and then suddenly thorn trees throbbed in the haze ahead looking huge but dwindling as we approached the firm ground on which they stood they were no more than waistheight and standing beside them salim cupped his hands and called again this time his cry was answered a human voice calling to us away to our left where the sands ran flat i thought it was imagination perhaps an unnatural echo of salims voice for there was nothing there an empty void throbbing in the heat and the air so intensely pale it hurt the eyes and then suddenly the void was no longer empty a man had materialized like a genie out of the heat of a furnace his face burned black by the pitiless heat his lips cracked his ragged beard bleached by the sun his hair too under the filthy headcloth he came forward and then stopped suddenly suspicious reaching for the gun slung at his shoulder salim recognition brought a quick flash of teeth white in the burnt dark face wellah salaam alaikum he came forward and gripped salims wrist in a bedou handclasp whilst the old man talked his words coming fast and highpitched with excitement and then the man turned to stare at me pale eyes widening in startled disbelief it was only when he finally spoke my name that i realized this strange nomadiclooking figure was david whitaker its a long time i said i didnt recognize you he laughed and said yes a hell of a long time he reached out his hand and his grip was hard on mine not content with that he took hold of both my shoulders and held them as though overwhelmed by the need for physical human contact i cant believe it he said and again i cant believe it i could hardly believe it myself he was greatly changed as sue had said hed become a man but even in that first glimpse of him i recognized again the quality of eagerness that had first attracted me to him so you really are alive i dont think id fully accepted the fact until that moment yes im alive just his dark face was cracked in a boyish grin christ he said it never occurred to me youd come out here to look for me hell of a bloody journey how did you know where i was but i suppose he saw i was exhausted for he added quickly come up to the camp you can stretch out and ill have ali brew some coffee he called to two men who had materialized out of the weird glare and were hovering on the edge of visibility my companions he said they came forward warily like dogs suspicious of a new scent and they both had service rifles gripped in their hands the elder he introduced as hamid a big man with long hair to his shoulders bearded and impressive like a prophet the other was little more than a boy his face fulllipped and smooth almost a girls face and he moved with the same natural grace his name was ali bin maktum now lets have coffee and well talk david took my arm and led me to where the ground was higher and tattered pieces of black bedou cloth had been erected as windbreaks stretched on the bleached wood of camel thorn over holes they had scraped in the soft limestone faddal it was said with bedou courtesy but with an ironical little smile touching the corners of his mouth he sent hamid off to look to our camels and whilst the boy ali brewed coffee over a desert fire of sand and petrol he sat beside me talking hard about the heat and the humidity and the loneliness he had been suffering in this godforsaken place i let him run on for i was tired and he needed to talk he was desperate for the company of his own kind hed been there six weeks and in that time khalid had made the journey twice to bring them food and water i wouldnt trust anyone else they might have talked he was tracing patterns in the sand then his head bent shadowed by the headcloth flies buzzed in the sudden silence why are you here his voice came taut with the anxiety of a question too long delayed who told you where to find me khalid yes i said khalid and i added theres a lot to tell you he misunderstood me for his head came up his eyes bright with sudden excitement its all right then is it you saw sir philip gorde and he signed that concession agreement i typed out the words came breathless his eyes alight with hope but the hope faded as he saw my face you did see sir philip didnt you yes i said i gave him the envelope well then he didnt sign the agreement the effect of my words was to knock all the youth right out of him his face looked suddenly old and strained lines showed so that he seemed more like his father and his shoulders sagged so it didnt work he said it flatly as though he hadnt the spirit left for any display of emotion and i realized that all the weeks hed been waiting here alone hed been buoyed up by this one hope i thought if i disappeared completely so completely that everyone thought i was dead they did think i was dead didnt they yes i said everyone including your father presumed you were dead and i added a little irritably because i was so tired youve caused a lot of people a great deal of trouble and your mother and sister a lot of needless grief i thought for a moment he hadnt heard me but then he said yes indeed i realize that but sue at least would understand his face softened how is she did you see her yes i said i saw her and that too seemed a long time ago now i dont think she ever quite accepted the idea that you were dead nor did your mother or that girl in bahrain tessa the lines of strain were momentarily smoothed out you saw her too he seemed surprised and he added im sorry im afraid ive put you to a great deal of trouble he was staring down at the sand patterns between his feet abruptly he rubbed them out i was so convinced it was the only way i had to get past erkhard somehow i thought if i could get my report to sir philip gorde he was the one man his voice faded and then still talking to himself but i couldnt just send it to him it had to be done in some way that would enable him to override the political objections i thought all the publicity connected with my disappearance id planned it all very carefully i had a lucky break too that night i visited captain griffiths on the emerald isle there was an agency correspondent in transit to india stopping the night at the fort in sharjah i saw him told him the whole story my background how id escaped from borstal and got myself out to arabia everything i thought a story like that he darted a quick glance at me didnt he print it after you were reported missing when the search had failed and you were presumed dead yes i made him promise he wouldnt use it unless something happened to me but didnt it have any effect it seemed to cause quite a stir in the foreign office but what about the company it put the shares up i said trying to lighten it for him hell is that all he gave a bitter little laugh and ive been sitting here waiting hoping his shoulders had sagged again and he stared out into the throbbing glare his eyes narrowed angrily all these weeks wastedutterly wasted his voice was bleak he looked weary weary and depressed beyond words i suppose you think now ive behaved like a fool disappearing like that pretending i was dead but please try and understand he was leaning towards me his face young and defenceless his voice urgent now i was on my own and i knew there wasnt any oil where my father was drilling i ran a check survey without his knowledge it was an anticline all right but badly faulted it couldnt hold any oil his voice had dropped to weariness again hed been over all this many times in his mind i dont know whether he was kidding himself or trying to cheat the company or just doing it to get his own back on erkhard but i wanted the company to drill on my locations not his i wanted oil i wanted it for saraifa and i wanted it to be the real thing your father wanted it too i said gently and he too was convinced there was oil where you did your survey thats not true he refused to believe me told me i was inexperienced that id no business to be on that border and forbade me ever to go near it again i think i said youd better listen to what i have to tell you the coffee was ready then and i waited until ali had poured it for us from the battered silver pot it was mocha coffee bitter and wonderfully refreshing and as i sipped the scalding liquid i told him the whole story of my journey and all that had happened once whilst i was telling it he said im sorry i didnt realize and later when i came to the point where gorde had left me with entwhistle and wed been fired on he apologized again im afraid youve had a hell of a time sir and all my fault that sir took me back for it still didnt come easily from him but it was my account of that first interview with his father that really shook him when i had explained to him what his father had been trying to do he was appalled but christ why didnt he tell me id no idea none at all and when khalid told me hed been to see the emir of hadd he stared at me his face finedrawn his voice trembling as he repeated why the hell didnt he tell me what he was trying to do i think you know why i said you were employed by the company and the company to him meant erkhard and i added erkhard knew your background didnt he he used that as a lever to get you to spy on your father it was a shot in the dark but it went home he tried to his tone was almost sullen he looked uncomfortable and you agreed id no wish to conduct a crossexamination but i thought it essential he should see it from his fathers point of view if i were to succeed in bringing them together again i hadnt any choice he said stung to anger by my question erkhard threatened to turn me over to the cardiff police and your father knew about that it didnt mean i was going to do what erkhard wanted but youd agreed to do it i insisted and your father knew youd agreed i suppose so he admitted it reluctantly hes still got his friends inside the company so there it was at last the basic cause of the rift between them the thing that girl tessa had hinted at that sue had felt but hadnt been able to explain christ he said what a bloody stupid mess and all because we didnt trust each other like we should have done how could i guess what he was up to though its just the sort of twisted devious approach his voice faded and once more he was staring out into the void i got very close to him at one time but even then i was always conscious of a gulf of something hidden that i couldnt fathom hes very unpredictable you know mr grant more arab than the arabs if you see what i mean he was very much on the defensive then after four years i cant say i really understood him switching races like that and his religion too it left a sort of gulf that couldnt be bridged and when khalid told me hed been to see the emir it made me wonder he hesitated well as i say hes unpredictable so i decided it was time i put my plan into action and disappeared khalid thought so too ill hed brought hamid and ah two of his most trusted men and a spare camel so he shrugged i knew it was hard on sue hard on tessa too and on my mother but i was alone you see id nobody to turn to except khalid he was the only man in the world who had faith in me and i couldnt look to the company for help erkhard had made that very plain and anyway oil companies are in business for themselves not for the arabs theyve beer known to sit on an oilfield for years for political or commercial reasons the sweat was pouring off him and he wiped his hand across his brow well go on he said what happened when erkhard came to saraifa die my father succeed in getting a concession signed but i think hed guessed that i shouldnt have come here alone if it were all settled he listened silent not saying a word as i told him the rest of my story once his eyes came alight with sudden excitement that was when i told him or my second talk with whitaker and how khalid and i had seen the drilling rig being dismantled for the move up to the hadd border the thought that his father was at last doing what hed been wanting him to do for so long gave him a momentary sense of hope but it was only momentary for i went straight on to tell him of the scene at dhaid and how the lone rider had brought the news that gorde and erkhard had left and hadd forces had crossed the border into saraifa so its come to that has it open war between hadd and saraifa his body was suddenly trembling as though with fever and his voice was bitter and khalid sent you to me what did he say before you left what message did he give you he said he thought this time saraifa had reached the point of desperation and i gave him the gist of what khalid had said to me when i had finished he didnt say anything for a long time sitting there lost in thought staring out across the flat misery of the umm al samim the only home i ever had he whispered did you see it when the shamal was blowing with the rub al khali like a sea the dunes all smoking and the sands pouring into the date gardens its like a flood then his fathers words his fathers voice almost the oasis is doomed you see doomed to extinction by the desert but thats a natural process something to be fought with the natural resources of the country khalid and i we were going to rebuild the old falaj channels with the money from oil royalties that was our dream but this he stared at me hard his eyes wide youre sure its war are you its not just a border raid i gave him khalids speech then as near as i could remember it word for word so its my fault is it he said it with deep bitterness and after that he was silent for a long time finally he looked at me unto death you said khalid used those exact words did he and when i nodded so its not just a raidits the real thing this time he was almost in tears he was so deeply moved and then sadly my fathers fault too hes made his decision too late and he began cursing softly to himself those dungeating bastards from hadd theyll smash down the last of the falaj channels what would have taken twenty years by natural means will take less than that number of months the desert will roll in christ almighty the bastards it was a cry from the heart and i was conscious of desperation here too a desperation that matched khalids they cant fight a war against hadd theyve nothing to fight it with only antiquated guns he began questioning me then pressing me for details many of which i couldnt give him for he wasnt interested in his father now or gorde or the company his attention was fixed on hadd and the way sheikh abdullah the emirs representative had behaved and what had passed between him and sheikh makhmud that morning before whitaker and erkhard had arrived the sun sank in a bloodred haze and the air became dank my head nodded my body suddenly drainedof warmth and shivering with fatigue youd better get some rest now he said finally well be leaving as soon as the moons up and its light enough to see our way through the quicksands he seemed to have reached some decision for his voice was firmer his manner less depressed he brought me a tattered blanket musty with sand ive kept you talking when you should have been getting some sleep what do you plan to do i asked him youll go to your father i take it yes hes still got a few of his bodyguard left a dozen men and i could create a diversion that would keep the emir busy until my father has time to make his influence felt in bahrain khalids right we must work together now my father and i the mention of khalids name seemed to bring his mind back to his friend he said he was my brother didnt he unto death your brother yes i said but as i remember it he used the words into death in connection with the emir my enemy into death well pray god it doesnt come to that there were tears in his eyes and standing there staring straight into the flaming sunset he quoted from the bible the lord be between me and thee and between my seed and thy seed for ever dimly i recognized the quotation as the oath sworn by his namesake i didnt realize it then but this was the covenant sworn in the midst of the quicksands of the umm al samim that was to take him to that fort on top of jebel alakhbar and to the terrible final tragedy i saw the sun set and the quicksands turn to blood and then the sky faded to the palest pastel green and the stars came out lying there it was like being stranded on a coral reef in the midst of a flat lagoon sometime in the small hours the wind woke me blowing a drift of sand in my face the moon was up but its face was hidden in a cloud of moving sand there was no question of our leaving and i lay till dawn unable to sleep my eyeballs gritty my nose and mouth clogged with sand and when the sun rose all it showed was a sepia haze we ate in extreme discomfort the sand whistling like driven spume across the flat surface of the umm al samim the storm lasted until almost midday and then it ceased as abruptly as it had started we cooked a meal of rice and dried meat and then we started back collecting our camels on the way and struggling through the quicksands to the solid desert shore we mounted them and keeping the umm al samim on our left rode till dusk when we camped a meal and a short twohour rest and then on again with salim arguing sullenly the old fool thinks the beasts will founder davids face was grim he was in a hurry and he had no sympathy for men or beasts like all the bedou he loves his camels more than he loves himself we marched all night and there were times when i hoped the camels would founder my muscles were stiff and aching and where the wooden saddle chafed my legs i was in agony the starlight faded swamped by the brighter light of the risen moon and in the grey of dawning day we reached the big well at ain salim went forward alone to water the camels for early as it was there were others at the well before us men of the duru tribe i expect david said as we sat on the ground with the loads stacked round us brewing coffee salim will bring us the news i dozed and woke to the sound of the old mans voice whats happened i asked for his face was lit by the excitement of some great event whats he saying hes talked with some men of the rashid back from selling camels at saraifa davids face was grey in the dawn they say theres been fighting already a battle between hadd and saraifa its hearsay thats all they dont know anything he didnt want to believe it but his voice was urgent as he gave the order to mount we loaded the camels in a hurry and as we started out again i saw that our direction had changed i asked him where we were going and he said dhaid well get the news there and after that he didnt talk his mood was sullen and withdrawn his temper short and he answered salim angrily whenever the old man protested at the pace of our march we rode all day and far into the night and in the morning the camels were almost done their pace painfully slow we reached dhaid a little after midday nobody came out to meet us camels dotted the limestone slopes of the hill and men lay listless under the walls of the village inside the arched entrance the little open place was packed with people whole families with their beasts and chattels were crowded there in the oven heat that beat back from the walls they were all from saraifa refugees the atmosphere was heavy with disaster the news bad two more falajes they said had been destroyed and a battle fought out by one of the wells khalid was reported dead his fathers soldiers routed oldfashioned rifles against automatic weapons davids tone was bitter for months the emir has been receiving a steady trickle of arms and weve done nothing about it nothing at all theyre independent states i reminded him thats what the political boys said when i told them arms were being smuggled in dhows to the batina coast and brought by camel across the mountains a perfect excuse for doing nothing and now if khalid is dead his voice shook his face looked ghastly the skin burned black yet deathly pale sheikh makhmuds an old man he cant fight this sort of a war and the emir has only to block two more falajes and his men can just sit and wait for the end we left salim with the camels and fought our way through the crowds to sheikh hassas house we found him in the room where i had left khalid a few days before he was sitting surrounded by a crush of men all talking at once the new rifle lay forgotten on the floor beside him sat a young man with long features that were tense and pale mahommed david whispered khalids halfbrother hed fled from the battlefield but hed seen enough to confirm the rumours wed heard in the market place the battle had been fought by the ninth well out along the line of the mahdah falaj and the casualties had been heavy sheikh makhmud himself had been wounded and the latest reports of survivors indicated that he had retired to the oasis with the remnant of his forces and was shut up in his palace and preparing to surrender david talked to the two of them for about ten minutes and then we left sheikh hassas scared he said as we pushed our way out into the shade of the alleyway all these frightened people flooding into his village its knocked the fight right out of him and mahommeds only a boy hassa will hand over dhaid without firing a shot he said it angrily with deep bitterness and he added fifty resolute men could defend this place for a month long enough to preserve its independence from hadd what about khalid i asked did his brother say what had happened to him no he doesnt know his face was grey and haggard all this killing and destroying its so bloody futile a lust for oil cant they understand the oil wont last its just a phase and when its past theyll be faced with the desert again and the only thing that will matter then is what theyve built with the oil against the future and he added angrily the emir didnt care a damn about that border until my father got gorde to sign a concession it was just sand and nothing grew there and then to cancel it i can almost see the look on sheikh makhmuds face that night god he exclaimed the callousness of men like erkhard gorde too they dont care these people are human beings and theyre being mucked around by hardfaced men who think only in terms of commerce and money we were out of the alley back in the glare of the crowded market place he spoke to salim and gave him money a handful of maria theresa silver dollars poured from a leather bag and then we settled ourselves in the dust by the entrance gate leaning our backs against the crumbling mud walls amongst a crowd of listless refugees who watched us curiously ive sent salim to buy fresh camels david said well leave as soon as he returns how long will it take us to reach the hadd border i was feeling very tired but his mind was on khalid i must find out whats happened to him he was silent a long time then tracing patterns in the sand with his camel stick and then abruptly he rubbed them out with the flat of his palm if hes dead his emotions seemed to grip him by the throat so that the sentence was cut off abruptly and then his voice suddenly practical in that case there are his men he had more than a score of them a paid personal bodyguard wahiba mostly and some rashid all good fighters he was staring hungrily out into the burning distance of the desert i need men he whispered his teeth clenched men wholl fight not these he gestured with contempt at the listless figures around us a score of men properly armed and i could put the fear of god into that bloody little emir i didnt bother to ask him how for i thought it was just wishful thinking and all in his imagination my eyes were closing with the heat and the weariness of my aching muscles i heard him say something about getting me to sharjah as soon as he could and then i was asleep i woke to the voices of salim and the two wahiba they were arguing loudly whilst david sat listening a tattered bible propped on the rifle across his knees two camels stood disdainfully in front of us theyve become infected with the mood of this place blast them david closed the book and got to his feet a crowd was beginning to collect he said something to hamid and the man looked suddenly like a dog thats been beaten and then david took his rifle from him and handed it to me come on he said lets get going he spoke angrily to the two wahiba and then we mounted the camels were thoroughbred oman racing camels i could feel the difference immediately the crowd parted letting us through and we picked our way daintily down the rocks out on the flat gravel of the desert below we moved into an ungainly canter circling the hill on which dhaid rested and heading northeast again these people david said theyre so damned uncertain full of guts one minute craven the next salim i didnt expect to come but hamid and ali he sounded depressed my father now he can handle them the way ill never be able to there was admiration a note of envy in his voice theyd never have left him in the lurch we rode in silence then and at a gruelling pace the heat very great so that i was thankful for the water we had got at dhaid we camped at dusk and david had just lighted a fire when he turned suddenly and grabbed his rifle i heard the pad of camels feet and then the riders emerged out of the gathering darkness there were three of them and david relaxed salim too he whispered he didnt give them any greeting and they slunk to the fire like dogs i gave hamid back his rifle he took it as though it were a gift and made me a long speech of thanks theyre like children david said his voice sounded happy we had a handful of dates each and some coffee that was all and then we rode on in the early hours of the morning with the moon high and a white miasma of mist lying over the desert we approached the ninth well of the mahdah falaj hamid and ali were scouting ahead on either flank david and salim rode close together their rifles readytohand across their knees the tension had been mounting all through that night ride for wed no idea what we were going to find at the end of it for the first time i rode my camel without conscious thought of what i was doing my whole being concentrated in my eyes searching the mist ahead the desert was very still and halfconcealed under that white veil it had a strange almost eerie quality from far ahead came a weird banshee howl it rose to a high note and then dropped to an ugly cough hyena david said and there was loathing in his voice the sound repeated much nearer and to our flank checked my camel in its stride it was an eerie disgusting sound a little later salim stopped to stare at some camel tracks their droppings too and he dismounted sifted them through his fingers smelt them and then delivered his verdict men of the bait kathir and they had come south the night before with two camels belonging to saraifa loot david said and we rode on in silence until about ten minutes later hamid signalled to us he had sighted the first corpse it had been stripped of its clothes and there wasnt much meat left on the bones which stared white through the torn flesh the teeth bared in the remains of a beard had fastened in agony upon a tuft of driedup herb it wasnt a pretty sight with the sand all trampled round about and stained black with blood and after that the bodies lay thick they had been caught in ambush and slaughtered as they rushed a small gravel rise where the enemy had lain in wait there were camels too their carcases bared to the bones and white and brittlelooking like the withered remains of dwarf trees dead of drought the whole place smelt of death and things moved on the edge of visibility two men slunk away like ghouls mounted their camels and disappeared into the mist we let them go for davids only interest was to discover whether khalid had been killed methodically he and salim checked every corpse while the two wahiba scouted the edges of the battlefield david could put a name to most of the bodies despite decomposition and the mutilations of scavengers and one i recognized myself the leader of khalids escort he lay face down in the tyre marks of a landrover and close beside were the bodies of three more of khalids men stripped of their clothes and arms we hadnt far to go after that the tyre marks lipped a rise and a little beyond the burnedout remains of the landrover itself loomed out of the mist they had sought cover behind it and their bodies had been ripped to pieces by a murderous fire khalid lay with eyeless sockets and half his face torn away the nearnaked body was already disintegrating and where the stomach had been torn open the rotten flesh crawled with maggots and the blood was dry and black like powder four of his men lay near him in much the same state of putrefaction the waste david breathed he was standing staring down at the remains of his friend and there were tears in his eyes the bloody senseless waste there was a shovel still clipped to the landrover its handle burned away he seized hold of it and attacked the ground with violent energy digging a shallow grave and when wed laid what was left of khalid to rest and covered it with sand david stood back with bowed head he might have saved saraifa he was the only one of them who had the vision and the drive and energy to do it he wiped his face with his headcloth may he rest in peace and may allah guide him to the world beyond he turned his back abruptly on the grave and strode blindly off across the sand towards the gravel rise that had been the scene of the ambush along the back of it ran a ridge of bare rock behind it the ground was scattered with the brass of empty cartridges war surplus he tossed one of them to me governments sell that stuff they never think of the loss of life their bloody auctions will ultimately cause a pity the little bureaucrat but he let it go at that wandering on along the ridge at four places we came upon the empty magazines of automatic guns in each case they lay beside the tyre marks of vehicles they hadnt a chance he said bitterly and started back to where salim waited with the camels before we reached them ali came hurrying back he had been scouting to the east along the line of the falaj and had almost stumbled into a small hadd force camped by the next well he said the walls of the well had been thrown down the whole thing filled with sand and rock we waited for hamid he was a long time coming and when he did arrive his manner was strange his eyes rolling in his head as words poured out of him hes just buried his father david said the old mans body had a dozen bullets in it grimly he gave the order to mount i was glad to go dawn was breaking and a hot wind beginning to blow from the northwest i was sick of the sight of so much death so was david this after the lonely weeks hed spent in that filthy area of quicksands i didnt need the set withdrawn look of his face the occasional mumbling of the lips to tell me that he was mentally very near the end of his tether where are we going i asked as we rode towards the next well the wall of which was just visible on the horizon a little rock turret above the drifting moving sands saraifa he said ill know the worst then i think he could already picture the misery that awaited us halfway there we met with a family of the junuba heading towards the mountains with a long string of camels loaded with dates for the coast they gave us the news the last falaj had ceased to flow that morning sheikh makhmud was said to have died during the night his brother sheikh sultan ruled in his place we purchased some dates from them we had been unable to buy any supplies in dhaid and hurried on all the way to saraifa the traces of disaster were with us the carcase of a camel a body sprawled in the sand discarded arms but according to the junuba the emirs men were not in the oasis they dont need to attack now david said they can sit on the falajes theyve destroyed and just wait for the end like vultures waiting for a man to die and he added sheikh sultan will make peace hes a gutless effeminate old man and they know it the wind increased in force until it was blowing a strong shamal and we never saw saraifa until the crumbling walls of a date garden appeared abruptly out of the miasma clouds of windblown sand the palms thrashed in the blinding air as they closed around us we passed a patch of cultivation the green crop already wilted and turning sere and when we reached the first shireeya we found it dry the mud bottom hard as concrete split with innumerable cracks the falaj channel that supplied it was empty the skeletal shape of little fish lay in the sand at the bottom of it only when we came to the outskirts of saraifa itself was there any sign of human activity camels were being loaded household possessions picked over but most of the barastis were already empty the human life gone from them men stopped to talk to us but only momentarily they were bent on flight it was the same when we reached the mud buildings in the centre of saraifa everywhere there were beasts being loaded but it was the tailend of the exodus most of the houses already deserted and in the great square under the palace walls the watering place no longer delivered its precious fluid to a noisy crowd of boys with their asses the ground round it was caked hard and the only person there was an old man with a child of about two we circled the walls and came to the main gate the great wooden portals were closed no retainers stood guard on the bastions above the palace had the look of a place shut against the plague and given over to despair david sat for a moment on his camel looking down on the date gardens halfhidden beneath the weight of driven sand and tears were streaming down his face he turned to me suddenly and swore an oath demanding that the almighty should be his witness and the oath was the destruction of hadd khalid is dead he added and his eyes burned in their sockets now i must do what hed have done and ill not rest till the falajes are running again not only the five theyve destroyed but the others too that i swear before almighty god or my life is worth nothing we rode out of saraifa then leaving behind us the pitiful sight of a people driven from their homes by thirst heading into the desert our heads bent against the wind our mouths covered once david paused his arm flung out pointing now you see it now you see the rub al khali rolling in like the sea and indeed it did look like the sea for through gaps in the flying curtain of sand i could see the dunes smoking like waves in the gusts the sand blowing off their tops in streamers thats what khalid was fighting like water isnt it like water flooding in over a lowlying land and riding on he said with the people gone the wells all dry this place wont last longhis words came in snatches on the wind how long will they survive do you think those families hurrying to go theyre not nomads they cant live in the sands theyll die by slow degrees turned away by sheikh after sheikh who fears they and their beasts will drink his own people out of water and what can they live on when their camels are gone he was riding close beside me then sometimes i hate the human race hate myself too for being human and as cruel as the rest and then quietly his teeth clenched his eyes blazing therell be men die in hadd for what ive seen today it was the strange choice of words the way he was trembling and the violence of his manner i thought hed been driven half out of his mind by khalids death and the tragic things wed seen all i need is a few men he whispered to me khalids are all dead half a dozen men thats all i need the suns heat increased and the wind gradually died i suffered badly from thirst for we hadnt much water left and we were riding fast towards midday in a flat gravel pan between high dunes we came upon the tracks of heavy vehicles we followed them and shortly afterwards heard the roar of diesels it was the drilling rig both trucks floundering in a patch of soft sand the big eightwheeler was out in front the rig folded down across its back and it was winching the second truck loaded with pipe and fuel drums across the soft patch they were working with furious energy for theyd had refugees from saraifa through their camp just before theyd pulled out and they were scared we stopped with them long enough to brew coffee and give our beasts a rest and when we rode on david said to me whys he want to bring that rig here now what good will it do he was haggardeyed his face pale under its tan they told me hed requisitioned entwhistles seismological outfit the men as well as the truck he did that just after the battle when he knew what had happened i dont understand it he must realize its too late now the shadows of the dunes were lengthening their crests sharpetched against the flaming sky we were working our way across them then and as the sun finally sank we came to the top of a dune out of the shadow into the lurid light of the bloodred sunset and in the gravel flat below we saw the tracks of vehicles and the blackened circles of camp fires location b david said and we rode down into shadow again the camp had been abandoned that morning so much salim was able to tell us from the ashes of the camp fires and after that we kept just below the dune crests riding cautiously with ali scouting ahead wed only just lost sight of the abandoned camp when the thud of an explosion shook the ground and the sands on the steep face of a dune opposite slid into motion with a peculiar thrumming singing sound our camels stood halted their bodies trembling and the singing sound of the sands went on for a long time there was no further explosion but almost as soon as we started forwards again ali called to us and at the same moment there was the crack of a rifle and a bullet sang uncomfortably close i dont remember dismounting i was suddenly stretched on the sand with salim pulling my camel down beside me david and hamid were crawling forward to the dune crest their guns ready i thought for a moment we had been ambushed but then ali shouted a greeting he had dropped his rifle and was standing up throwing sand into the air it was the bedou sign that we came in friendship and in a moment we were dragging our camels down the steep face of the dune and three arabs were running to meet us brandishing their weapons and shouting we had reached colonel whitakers camp at location c the tents were huddled against the base of a dune black shapes in the fading light and out on the gravel flat entwhistles seismological truck stood lit by the glow of cooking fires there were perhaps fifteen men in that camp and they flitted towards us like bats in the dusk as they crowded round us one of them recognized david all was confusion then a babel of tongues asking questions demanding news david didnt greet them i doubt whether he even saw them his eyes were fixed on his father who had come out of one of the tents and was standing waiting for us a dark robed figure in silhouette against the light of a pressure lamp david handed his camel to salim and went blindly forward i think he still held his father in some awe but as i followed him i began to realize how much the day had changed him he had purpose now a driving overriding purpose that showed in the way he strode forward there wasnt enough light for me to see the expression on colonel whitakers face when he realized who it was and he didnt speak even when david stood directly in front of him neither of them spoke they just stood there staring at each other i was close enough then to see whitakers face it was without expression no surprise no sign of any feeling its your son i said hes alive so i see the voice was harsh the single eye fixed on david youve decided to return from the dead why khalid asked me to come here and talk to you he wanted us to khalids dead know that i buried his body this morning davids voice trembled with the effort to keep himself under control he died because his father hadnt the sense to avoid a pitched battle and he added we passed that rig of yours a few miles back its too late now to start drilling on my locations on your locations on farrs then as checked by me and by me whitaker snapped since youve got grant with you i presume you now have some idea what i was trying to do if you hadnt disappeared like that dont for gods sake lets have another row davids voice was strangely quiet and dont lets start raking over the past its too late for that now khalid was right weve got to work together i came because i need men men colonel whitaker stared at him with a puzzled frown what do you need men for ill tell you in a moment but first id like to know what youre planning to do with that rig you cant surely intend to drill here not now after whats happened why not but its crazy itll take you months you call it crazy now do you whitakers voice was hard and pitched suddenly very high last time i saw you you were raising hell because i wouldnt drill here well now im going to try it your way but dont you realize whats happened in saraifa of course i do sheikh makhmud is dead and ive lost an old friend his brother sultan is ruler in his place and you know what that means saraifa is finished david stared at him in disbelief you mean youre going to do a deal with the emir his tone was shocked whitakers face was without expression ive seen him yes weve reached a tentative agreement and then as he saw the look of contempt on davids face he exclaimed allah akhbar when are you going to grow up boy you dont have to worry on that score sir ive grown up fast enough these past few months davids voice was calmer much quieter he seemed suddenly sure of himself but theres no point in discussing whats gone its the future im concerned with the future of saraifa can i rely on you for support or not whitaker frowned support for what for an attack on hadd ive worked it all out in my mind davids voice came alive then full of sudden enthusiasm for centuries theyve been destroying other peoples wells theyve never known what it is to be short of water themselves im going to give them a taste of their own medicine im going to destroy the wells in hadd are you out of your mind whitaker glared at him even if you did blow up a well what good would it do in a day or at most two they would have repaired it i dont think so david said quietly just let me have a few men men you wont get men out of me for a crackbrained scheme like this and then in a gentler voice see here david i realize youve probably been through a lot during the past two months and if youve been out to the battlefield on the mahdah falaj as i rather suspect from your attitude i dont imagine it was a pleasant sight it wasnt a pleasant sight riding through saraifa and seeing the people there without water and fleeing from the oasis david answered hotly no but colonel whitaker hesitated hed seen the obstinate look on davids face no doubt he sensed his mood too which was desperately determined come into the tent he said i refuse to continue this discussion out here he glanced at me if youll excuse us grant id like to talk to my son alone for a moment he pulled back the flap of the tent faddal it was said quite automatically a carpet showed red in the glare of the lamplight some cushions a tin box and the two of them were inside the tent and the flap fell the outline of the dunes smooth and flowing like downlands faded into darkness as i sat alone on the sand a centre of curiosity for the whole camp the sky was clouded over so that there were no stars and it was very dark it was about half an hour later that david suddenly emerged out of the night and sat down beside me what happened i asked him nothing he replied tersely and after that he sat for a long time without saying a word without moving finally he turned to me of his own accord i dont understand him he said it was like talking to a complete stranger and he added i dont think saraifa means anything to him any more the bitterness of his voice was overlaid with frustration its tragic he whispered half a dozen men thats all i asked him for but he thinks its all a dream that i dont know what im doing you told him about khalid what hed said to me of course and it made no difference none what did you talk about then he laughed a little wildly about locations geological formations a drilling programme he wasnt interested in anything else and then speaking more to himself than to me i couldnt get through to him i just couldnt seem to get through he beat his fist against the ground what do you do when a mans like that he stared at me angrily i dont understand him do you know what he said he said i was forgiven he said everything was to be just as it was between us in the early days when i first worked with him im to stay here and help him drill a well he and i together were going to drill the most important well in arabia again that slightly wild laugh and when i mentioned hadd he said hadd or saraifa what did it matter now hell treat with the emir with the devil himself so long as hes left in peace to drill his well and prove his bloody theory to the damnation of philip gorde and all the rest of the oil boys god i wonder i didnt kill him and he added the mans mad he must be mad obsessed perhaps i murmured mad he glared at me how else do you explain his attitude his fantastic assumption that id be content to sit here drilling a well after whats happened for khalids sake id have agreed to anything id have played the dutiful bastard sitting at the feet of the great bedouin but when i asked him for men he shook his head he wouldnt give them to me he wouldnt do a damned thing to help said i was crazy even to think of it me and all he could talk about with makhmud dead and men hed known for years lying by that well with their guts half eaten out all he could talk about was his damned theory and how hed known all along he was right i tell you the mans mad his voice was sharp with frustration i wish to god he said bitterly id never come out here never set eyes on him and to think i worshipped the man yes worshipped him i thought he was the greatest man living the bitterness in his voice what are you going to do i asked him take what men i can and get the hell out of here do what i planned to do without his help his voice had a bite to it and he slid to his feet theres nothing else left for me to do nothing that means anything nothing useful he left me then and hurried down to the dark shapes sitting around the cook fires calling to them in their own tongue gathering them about him and then he began to harangue them a little wind had sprung up and it chilled the sweat on my body but it wasnt the drop in temperature that made me shiver i was caught up in a situation that was beyond my control isolated here in the desert with two men equally obsessed the one with oil the other with an oasis and then whitakers voice close behind me grant youve got to talk him out of it i got to my feet he was standing there a dark silhouette against the dunes staring down at where his son stood amongst the smoke of the fires his plan is madness but id been with david too long not to feel sympathy for him hes fighting for something he believes in i said why dont you help him by giving him men his harsh beaked face was set and stony ive few enough for my purpose as it is and then in a softer voice i had my loyalties too but now with makhmud dead im free to do what perhaps i should have done in the first place ive seen the emir ive sent yousif to sharjah with those letters to merchants there im rechecking the earlier surveys in a few days well spud in and start to drill and when ive brought in the first discovery well then all this trouble between hadd and saraifa will be seen in perspective a small matter compared with the vast changes an oilfield will bring to the desert here and your son i asked he shrugged as i told you before when i thought he was dead id hoped hed follow me a second whitaker to carry on where i left off instead i find myself cursed with an obstinate stupid youth whos no respect for my judgment and opposes me at every turn he put his hand on my arm and in a surprisingly gentle voice he said talk to him grant try and do for me what i know i cant do myself his plan is suicidal he was looking straight at me and i was shocked to see there were tears running down his cheeks not only from the one good eye but welling out from beneath the black patch that concealed the other do what you can he said softly and then he turned quickly away and went back to his tent ten minutes later david was back at my side looking tired and drained one man he said in a bleak voice one man will come with me thats all hamids brother bin suleiman and hes coming not because he understands my plan but simply because with him as with hamid its a blood feud now he gave a shrug and a quick laugh well the fewer the better perhaps theyll drink less water and water is going to be our trouble he called to hamid and gave the order to load the camels well leave as soon as ive got the things i need out of entwhistles truck i started to try and talk him out of it but he brushed my words aside my minds made up talking wont change it and then he said what about you are you staying here or will you come with me he stared at me a long speculative look if you should decide to come with me then i can promise to get you away to the coast with salim as your guide and he added if you dont come then i think i may be throwing my life away for nothing youre my only hope of contact with the outside world and if the world doesnt know what im doing then its all wasted i asked him what exactly he planned to do but he wouldnt tell me the details youd have to know the ground or you might agree with my father and think it crazy but i assure you he added with great conviction that with any luck at all it will work its the last thing the emir will be expecting and the fact that well be a very small party he smiled it makes it easier really the first part at any rate and i promise you youll not be involved in the rest think it over will you sir i need your help in this desperately he left it like that and disappeared abruptly into the night i lay on the hard ground listening to the movement of the camels the sounds of preparation for another journey a little wind came in puffs sifting the sand and it was dark a stillness had enveloped the camp i dont think im any more of a coward than the next man but to seek out death deliberately and in cold blood you see it never occurred to me he could succeed i thought his father was right and that he was throwing away his life in a futile gesture i remembered gordes description of whitakeran old man tilting at windmills david was very like his father in some ways i closed my eyes thinking of tanganyika and the hard life id led there and then i felt a hand on my shoulder well david asked and when i nodded almost without thinking he passed me a rifle i take it you know how to use it he had another which he handed to bin suleiman and a revolver with holster and belt which he strapped to his own waist the stark reality of what i was doing came with the feel of the welloiled breech under my hand it took me back to days i thought id forgotten to the deadly slopes of monte cassino to anzio and the gothic line i rose quietly to my feet salim and ali were loading cartons of explosive cartridges on to one of the camels hamid and his brother a squat hairy man with wild eyes and a lowbrowed head were packing coils of fine wire and a contact plunger with its batteries into the saddle bags of another beast the camels staggered to their feet bulking suddenly large against the overcast and we were on our way a lone figure standing by one of the tents watched us go it was colonel whitaker he made no move to stop us nor did he call out we left the camp in silence and though they knew we were going no man stirred from the camp fires it was as though they feared to have any contact with us it was as though we had already passed beyond the shadows of death clear of the camp we turned east working our way silently up the face of a dune in short zigzags at the crest we stopped to mount and then we were riding the dark desert all around us and the swaying shapes of our camels the only movement in the stillness of night the clouds thinned and gradually cleared leaving us exposed in bright moonlight but if the emir had men watching whitakers camp we never saw them dawn found us camped among sparse camel thorn on a flat gravel plain sharpetched against the break of day stood the jagged tops of the mountains dates and coffee and then sleep we start at dusk david said and buried his face in his headcloth the withered camel thorn gave little shelter and as the sun climbed the burning vault of the sky it became very hot flies worried us clinging to the sweat of exposed flesh and we suffered from thirst for our water bags were empty and all we had was the contents of two water bottles we took it in turns to keep watch but the shimmering expanse of gravel that surrounded us remained empty of life as the sun sank we lit a fire and had a huge meal of rice and dried meat a bowl of warm camels milk passed from mouth to mouth our four arabs talked excitedly amongst themselves and the meal finished they began to oil their guns cleaning them with loving care in contrast david and i sat silent doing nothing the sun set and in an instant the sky had paled the visibility was fantastic in the dry air everything sharp and clear as though magnified youd better tell me what you plan to do i said and my voice reflected the tension that had been growing in me all through that long inactive day david was staring at the distant line of the mountains and for a moment i thought he hadnt heard my question but then he said it isnt easy to explain to somebody who has never been to hadd ive flown over it i said he looked at me then a sudden quickening of interest did you see the fort of jebel alakhbar did you see how the town is backed right into the rock and when i explained how id passed close over it in gordes plane he said then you know the situation that fort is the key to hadd who holds that fort holds the people of hadd in the hollow of his hand its as simple as that he was suddenly excited his eyes bright with the vision of what he planned to do when there was trouble here before the trucial oman scouts moved into the fort and that was the end of it were not the trucial oman scouts i thought it was time he faced up to the facts there are six of us thats all were armed with rifles and nothing else and our ammunition is limited theres ammunition for us in the fort he said two boxes of it and a box of grenades apparently he and khalid had found them left there by the tos and halfburied under a pile of rubble they were out hunting as the emirs guests and had taken refuge in the fort during a sandstorm its a long time ago now he added but i think well find the boxes still there we buried them pretty deep as for numbers he gave a little shrugone man well armed and determined could hold that tower for as long as his water held out he smiled grimly water it always comes back to water in the desert doesnt it and he slid to his feet and gave the order to move as we rode he pointed out the fort to me small as a pinhead on top of a hill that miraculously detached itself from the line of the mountains standing clear in the last of the daylight and much nearer than i had expected dawn tomorrow he said thats where well be he looked very much like his father as he stared at me his youthful features set in the grimmer mould of an older man god willing he breathed and when were there youll understand he rode on then with his four wahiba talking with them urgently in their own tongue and leaving me to ride alone prey to my own forebodings dusk fell and merged imperceptibly into night the stars lit our way and in no time at all it seemed there was the jebel alakhbar a black hat of a hill bulked against the night sky we rode slowly in a tight little bunch the time was a little after ten well water our camels at the well on the outskirts fill our water bags davids voice was taut and if theres a guard i whispered were travellers from buraimi on our way to the coast bin suleiman will explain hes known here and after weve filled our water bags ssh the camels had stopped at a signal from hamid we sat still as death listening there were rock outcrops ahead and the dim shapes of buildings a solitary light showed high up on the slope of the hill which now towered above us a dark mass against the stars somewhere a goat bleated there was no other sound a whispered word from david and we moved forward again the wellhead appeared a simple wooden structure topping a crumbling wall of mud and stone we dismounted and the leathern bucket was dropped into the depths the wooden roller creaked as it was drawn up one by one the camels were watered one by one the skin bags filled and all the time the wood creaked and we stood with our guns ready but nobody came the solitary light vanished from the slope of the hill leaving the whole town dark as though it were a deserted ruin salim and ali left with the camels and david went to work with cartridges of explosive and detonators and when hed mined the well we went forward on foot running the thin line of the wire out behind us the second well was close under the walls and there were camels couched near it we could hear them stirring uneasily could even see some of them dark shapes against the lighter stone a man coughed and sat up dislodging a stone the sound of it was magnified by the silence and then i saw his figure coming towards us hamid and bin suleiman moved to intercept they talked together in whispers whilst david went on working and i helped him glancing every now and then over my shoulder expecting every moment to hear the man cry out and raise the alarm but nothing happened the camels quietened down the man went back to his interrupted sleep and david was left to complete his work in peace he worked fast and with absolute sureness but it all took time it was past midnight before he had finished and a paler light above the mountains warned that the moon was rising as we trailed our wire towards a gap in the crumbling walls two shots sounded far out in the desert behind us we checked standing there motionless and sweating but there were no more shots somebody out hunting gazelle david whispered they do it at night by the lights of their landrovers and we went on through the gap which led to a narrow alley there were no doors to the buildings on either side only window openings high up the alley led into the market place more camels some goats and figures asleep against the walls of the houses the well was on the far side there was a baby camel there and a small boy lay curled up beside it the camel its coat fluffy as a kittens rose on straddling spindly legs and gazed at us in amazed silence the boy stirred but didnt wake a dog began to bark i caught hold of davids arm youve done enough surely i whispered scared he grinned in the darkness and shrugged me off we cant climb to the fort till the moons up and he squatted down in the dust and went to work the boy suddenly sat up staring at us roundeyed i thought my god if he kills that child but david said something and the boy got slowly to his feet and came hesitantly forward gazing in fascination david gave him the wire to hold a man moved in the shadows by an archway the boys father as he came forward other figures stirred a little knot of men gathered round us but the boy sitting there in the dust beside david helping him made it all seem innocent they stood and watched for a while talking with hamid and bin suleiman and then they drifted back to their sleep the moon rose the mud walls of the houses on the far side of the open place stood suddenly white and moment by moment the dark shadowline retreated until it touched the base of the buildings and began to creep across the ground towards us at last david tied his mine to the well rope and lowered it down we left then and the boy came with us trailing the baby camel behind him other figures followed us curious but not hostile they dont belong to hadd david whispered theyre bedou in from the desert to sell camels otherwise wed never have got out of there alive what did they think we were doing i said we were testing the wells before installing pumping equipment they know all about pumps theyve seen them in buraimi and also in saraifa by the second well we picked up the line of our wire clipped on another coil and trailed it to the limit up the hill just outside the walls there david fastened it to the terminals of the plunger and then he handed it to the boy and told him what to do hell tell the story of this moment till the end of his days he patted the boy on the shoulder smiling almost cheerfully as he turned and left him we climbed quickly came out from the shadow of the wall on to the moonlit slope of the hill and on a rock well above the rooftops of the highest houses we halted the boy was squatting there beside the detonator his face turned towards us david raised his hand above his head and then let it fall the boy turned away and his shoulders hunched as he thrust down on the plunger the silence ceased abruptly the stillness of the night rent by three deep rumbling explosions that were instantly muffled and snuffed out by the collapse of the earth walls of the wells the sound nevertheless went on travelling back through the mountains reverberating from face after face and gradually fading the boy still hadnt moved when all sound had ceased the baby camel stood beside him it was as though the shattering effect of the explosion had turned them both to stone then suddenly he was jerked to life for an instant his face was turned towards us white and startled in the moonlight and then he fled screaming down the hillside the camel breaking away in ungainly puppet strides fort jebel alakhbar we turned then and followed a zigzag track that climbed by crumbling outcrops and below us the town came to life the sound of voices the glimmer of lights a shot stabbed the night but it wasnt directed at anything in particular and we were close under the fort before the pursuit got under way we could see them clear on the moonlight slope below us zigzagging up the path by which we had come there were about a dozen of them climbing in single file and moving fast with the agility of mountain goats the fort tower hung on the lip of the cliff above us a white stone keep crumbling to decay and where the track doubled back through a narrow defile in the rocks david posted hamid to guard our rear i hope to god we find salim there he panted the path had steepened so that we climbed with our hands as well as our feet rocks slipping away from under us and then we reached the walls and the track led through a narrow opening we were inside the outer defences then an open space of half an acre or more that occupied all the top of the hill the walls had originally been about twenty feet high with a firing step round the inside but they were now in a bad state of repair and there were few places where they were higher than ten feet they were horseshoe shaped the two ends finishing abruptly at the cliff edge the tower between them there was no sign of the camels damn the old fool he should have been here by now davids sudden uneasiness made me wonder whether perhaps salim had taken the opportunity to desert us but when i suggested this he shook his head why do you think i sent ali with him that boy knew what those camels meant to us no something has happened to them a shot ripped the silence apart hamid had opened fire on our pursuers and the sound of it echoed back from the naked rock faces that surrounded us a scatter of shots sounded from lower down the slope and a bullet hit the wall close by us with a soft thud wait for me here im going to see whats happened david ran quickly across the open courtyard of the fort and out through the main gate on the north side and when he was gone i climbed to the broken top of the wall and threw myself down beside bin suleiman from this vantage point we commanded the final approach to the fort perched high on the edge of the sheer cliff face i could see right down into the town of hadd the market square where wed mined the third well was clearly visible a white rectangle with people moving about or standing in little groups it was not more than a thousand feet away an easy rifle shot and the wells outside the walls i could see them too i began to understand then why david had been so sure these damaged wells would stay out of action immediately below was the defile i could see hamid stretched out on top of one of the rock shoulders his rifle gleamed as he raised it to his shoulder a stab of flame the crack of the shot and then silence again on the slope beyond there was now no sign of pursuit the men who had started to follow us were pinned down amongst the rocks it was an incredible position impossible to take from that side so long as it was defended by men who knew how to shoot a bullet whined low over my head and i ducked automatically poking my rifle forward and searching the steep slope beyond the defile but there was nothing to fire at the night was still and without movement we remained in that position for two solid hours whilst the stars moved sedately round the sky and all away to our right the desert stretched its white expanse the sense of isolation of a long wait for ultimate death gradually took hold of me it had a strange effect a throwback i think to the mood that had filled me as we lay pinned down like rats on the slopes of monte cassino a mood compounded of fear and the desire to survive that expressed itself in the need to kill so that when a figure moved on the slope below me my whole being was concentrated in my trigger finger and as he stumbled and fell my only feeling was one of elation a deep trembling satisfaction a little after three the first glimmer of dawn brought the mountains into sharp relief a small wind whispered among the stones and it was quite chill it was the time of night when the body is at the lowest ebb and i began to worry about david and about our rear by now men from the village below could surely have circled jebel alakhbar to climb by the camel track to the main gate i called to bin suleiman and made a motion with my hand to indicate what i was going to do and then i abandoned my position and started on a tour of the walls the result was encouraging they were built on sheer rock slopes only on the north side was there any means of reaching the fort there the camel track climbed steeply from the desert below to enter by the only gateway old palm tree timbers sagged from rusted iron hinges this was the way attack must come if it were to succeed bastion towers flanked the gate on either side and from the top of one of them i could see down the whole length of the track it was empty so too were the slopes of the hill there was no cover and nowhere could i see any sign of david or the camels i was turning away when my eye caught a movement on the white floor of the desert below four shapes moving slowly their shadows more sharply defined than the shapes themselves they were camels moving towards the bottom of the track and as they turned to start the climb i made out the figure of a solitary rider on the leading camel i lay down then on the broken stone top of the bastion and pushed the safety catch of my rifle forward our camels had numbered six and with david there should have been three riders they came on very slowly whilst the grey of dawn overlaid the moonlight and the whiteness faded out of the desert as the light improved and they came nearer i saw the body of a man lying slumped over the saddle of the second camel skin bags bulging with water confirmed that the beasts were ours and soon after that i was able to recognize david i met him as he rode in through the broken gateway he didnt say anything as he dismounted but his face looked grey what happened i asked those shots we heard they rode straight into a party of the emirs men camped outside the town he asked me then whether theyd tried to rush us yet no i said theyre still pinned down less than a third of the way up the slope good give me a hand will you he led the second camel to the foot of the tower and got it couched the body tied with cord across its back was alis hes badly hurt we laid him gently on the ground he moaned softly barely conscious hed a ghastly wound in the chest id seen the effect of a softnosed bedouin bullet on the metal of a landrover now i was seeing its effect on human flesh and the sight appalled me hed a knife wound in the shoulder too and hed lost a lot of blood the dark broadlipped girlish face had taken on a sickly pallor david stood for a moment staring down at him poor kid he murmured i found him lying in a pool of blood by the ashes of their camp fire i suppose they thought he was dead salims body was close beside him theyd slit his throat his voice shook the murdering dungeating bastards why did they have to do it there were at least twenty of them there twenty of them against an old man and a boy apparently hed found the camp deserted our four camels wandering loose they must have been disturbed by the sound of the explosions he said otherwise they wouldnt have left the camels they only took one it was the other that led me to their camp it was i wandering around on three legs bellowing with pain i had to finish it off he gave a quick angry shrug as though wanting to dismiss the whole thing from his mind well lets get him up into the tower he cant lie here he got the camel to its feet and stood it close by the wall of the tower standing on its back he was just able to reach the hole halfway up the towers side he scrambled in and from the dark interior produced a crude ladder made of palm wood we dragged the boy up and laid him on the dirt floor and david plugged and bound the wounds again using his headcloth which he tore in strips a bloody lousy piece of luck he said id planned to get you away before daylight with salim to guide you youd have been in buraimi tomorrow in sharjah by the next day id got it all planned now he shrugged well have to do some fresh thinking it was daylight now it came filtering into the interior of the tower through the entrance hole and through four narrow slits in the thick walls they were firing embrasures and they reminded me of the turret room id occupied in saraifa but the view was vastly different two of them looked out east and west each covering an arm of the walls the other two close together faced south they looked straight down on to hadd itself well thats all i can do for him david got to his feet you stay here i must have a word with hamid and bin suleiman and then we must deal with the camels he left me sitting by one of the embrasures and i had time to think then the excitement of the action that had sustained me so far was gone now the future stared me in the face and i began to be afraid of it however impregnable the forts position there were still only four of us and right there below me was that arab town teeming with life and utterly hostile i could see men clustered thick in the open square and some of them were armed it could only be a matter of time they had already started work on the well inside the walls men were being lowered into it and every now and then a bundle of stones and rubble was handed up the sun was rising behind the mountains the sky was crimson and all the desert flushed the colour of a rose it looked very beautiful so serene in the clear morning air and the mountains standing like cutouts painted purple it was just after the sun had lipped the mountain tops that david climbed back into the tower theyve started work on that well in the square havent they i nodded the little square was teeming like an anthill what are they townspeople or the emirs bodyguard he had his rifle with him and he came straight over to where i was squatting on the floor beside the embrasure both i said the men working on the well were mostly stripped to the waist but standing about watching them were a number of armed men their bodies strapped about with cartridges a band of brass that glinted in the sun their rifles untrammelled with silver had the dull gleam of modern weapons he pushed past me kneeling in the embrasure steadying himself with his elbows on the sill as he brought the rifle to his shoulder and fired the sound of the shot was very loud in that dim confined place thats one of them that wont go murdering old men and boys again he was trembling slightly as he sat back on his heels the crowd in the square was scattering a little knot gathered in one corner and then that too melted away and the square was suddenly empty an occasional shot like that and theyll learn to leave it alone in a day or two theyll begin to understand what its like to have the sources of water cut off the wells dry he got up and set his gun against the wall not that theyll die of thirst theyre better off than the people we saw in saraifa he went back down the ladder and left me staring at the empty rectangle of the sundrenched square littered with the baulks of timber theyd brought in to shore up the inner walls of the well behind me the wounded boy moaned restlessly muttering words i couldnt understand and when i went to him i found his dark eyes wide open and staring his skin dry and parched i gave him some water and then david called to me he and hamid had started unloading the camels bin suleiman kept watch from the eastern wall we worked fast but the sun was high above the mountains before wed humped all the stores and the last of the water skins up into the tower what about the camels i asked as we lifted the saddles from their backs it was already blisteringly hot the bare rock acting as a firebrick and throwing back the suns heat there was no vestige of vegetation inside the fort for them to feed on ill keep one for you the other three will have to be slaughtered they were fine beasts in the prime of life and in beautiful condition but when i started to remonstrate he cut me short what did you imagine we were going to do with them weve no other meat he stared at me angrily even the bedou who love camels a damn sight more than i do dont hesitate to kill them when theyre short of food and were going to be short of everything before were through i stood and stared at him without camels hed have no means of retreat hed be trapped here do you reckon you could get through to buraimi on your own i hesitated but i knew now there was no alternative for me only death here on this pitiless hilltop i could try good well keep the one youve been riding then and get you away tonight as soon as its dark immediately after wed breakfasted bin suleiman butchered the three camels slitting their throats and letting the blood drain into a tin bowl the carcases were then disembowelled and the meat cut into strips and hung to dry in the sun flies buzzed and the place smelt of blood and yet it didnt seem unnatural sand and rock and the blazing sky that boy lying in the dim interior of the tower his breath gurgling in his throat and blood seeping on to the floor and below us an arab town ruled by a man consumed by a murderous greed death didnt seem so hateful when life itself was so cruel action followed hard upon my thoughts hamid from his lookout post on the very top of the tower called down to us men were circling the hill to the north from the walls we watched them climb by the camel track they were well spaced out their guns ready in their hands others were coming up by the zigzag path direct from hadd lying prone on the blistering stones we waited holding our fire the stillness seemed to break their nerve for they began shooting at a range of almost three hundred yards the attack when it came was a senseless illdirected affair men clawing their way up the last steep rock ascent to the walls without any supporting fire we caught them in the open unprotected and the attack petered out almost before it had begun they went back down the sides of the hill taking their wounded with them and not leaving even a single sniper to harass us from the shelter of the rocks it wont be as easy as that next time they come davids eyes had a cold dead look untouched by the light of battle that id glimpsed for a moment on bin suleimans broad animal face we had used i suppose no more than two or three dozen rounds but it was sufficient to make david anxious about his ammunition whilst the two wahiba kept watch david and i lowered the ladder through a hole in the mud floor of the tower and climbed down into the black rubblefilled pit below it was slow work searching in the dark for wed nothing but our hands to dig with and after so long david wasnt at all certain where he had buried the boxes we must have been down there at least an hour and all the time we were scrabbling at the rubble with our hands ah lay delirious on the floor above twice hamids rifle cracked as he carried out davids orders and kept the wells in hadd clear of people those sounds and the darkness and the feeling that at any moment we might be overwhelmed through lack of ammunition gave a sense of desperate urgency to our work finally we found the boxes and hauled them through the hole to the floor above more than a thousand rounds of ammunition and two dozen grenades wed barely got the boxes open when hamid reported a landrover leaving the palace we watched it from the embrasures blaring its horn as it snaked through hadds crooked alleys and out through the main gates of the town it headed south toward saraifa and david let it go not firing a shot the sooner sheikh abdullah is informed of the situation here he said the sooner his raiding force will leave saraifa in peace his eyes were shining now for this was what hed intended that little puff of dust trailing across the desert was the visual proof of the success of his plan but what happens i said when sheikh abdullah attacks us here with all his forces he smiled a flash of white teeth in the dark lean face were not short of ammunition now but were short of men there are only four of us how many do you think sheikh abdullah musters i thought it was time he faced up to the situation its not numbers that count he answered tersely not up here whoever built this fort designed it to be held by a handful of men and he added were bloody good shots you see hamid and bin suleiman theyre like all bedou theyve had guns in their hands since they were kids and me i learned to shoot out hunting with khalid he was almost grinning then i tell you man i can hit a gazelle running with a rifle bullet and a gazelles a bloody sight smaller than a man anyway he added no call for you to worry with any luck well get you away under cover of darkness tonight and what about you i asked youve no camels now no he stared at me a strange sad look in his eyes and then he gave a little shrug there comes a moment in every mans life i suppose when his destiny catches up with him again i was conscious of his strange choice of words the sense of fatalism if you dont get out if you stay here until sheikh abdullahs men have surrounded you what could i say to make him see sense youll die here i told him bluntly probably we stood there staring at each other and i knew there was nothing i could say that would make him change his mind he didnt care he was filled with a burning sense of mission it showed in his eyes and i was reminded of the word sue had used to describe his mood the word dedicated all the misdirected energy that had involved him in gang warfare in cardiff docks now it had found an outlet a purpose something he believed in death meant nothing what about hamid and bin suleiman i asked will they fight with you to the end yes he said theyve a blood feud on their hands and they want to kill there was nothing more to be said then if i reach buraimi and get through to the coast ill inform the authorities of the situation at once of course he said it with a bitter little smile so that i was afraid hed read my thoughts and knew i was thinking that help would arrive too late but then he said its no good talking to the authorities you know they wont do anything much better give the story to the newspapers i wouldnt like to die without anybody knowing what id tried to do again that bitter little smile and then he turned away better get some sleep now youve a long journey and youll need to be fresh for it but sleep wasnt easy the only place where there was any shade was the tower and there alis agony of mind and body was a thin thread of sound piercing each moment of unconsciousness so that i dreamed i was listening to davids death throes at times to my own he died as the sun sank a brief rattle in the throat and silence and at that same moment david scrambled in by the entrance hole to announce that there were vehicles coming from the direction of saraifa i think ali is dead i said he bent over the boy and then nodded i should have put him out of his misery he said without a doctor he hadnt a hope poor kid from the embrasures we watched a trailer of dust moving in from the desert three open landrovers packed with men a machinegun mounted in the back of each vehicle david called down to hamid who was cooking rice over a fire and he grabbed his gun and climbed the outer wall to lie prone beside bin suleiman david motioned me to the other embrasure dont fire till i do and remember every man you hit is one less for us to deal with later he had dropped to his knees his rifle ready in the slit of the embrasure the three landrovers reached the main gates and there they halted stopped by the crowd of people who swarmed round them all pointing and gesticulating towards us an arab askari in the leading landrover swung his machinegun and a long burst ripped the sunset stillness bullets splattered against the base of the tower the guns of the other two landrovers followed suit a sound like ripping calico several rifles were let off it was a demonstration designed to restore morale my hand trembled as i set the sights of my rifle to and then david fired and i was conscious of nothing but my finger on the trigger and the third landrover fastened like a toy to the v of my sights the smell of cordite singed my nostrils fire blossomed like a yellow flower against the dun of desert sand men scattered some fell and in a moment there was nothing to shoot at one landrover in flames the other two deserted some bodies lying in the dust tracer bullets exploded like fireworks from the back of the burning vehicles and almost immediately a second landrover caught fire as the petrol tank went up im afraid they wont give us an opportunity like that again david sat back on his haunches and cleared his gun it will be night attacks from now on hadd was deserted now not a soul to be seen anywhere the alleyways and the square empty the emirs green flag hung limp above the palace nothing stirred hamid went back to his cooking the sun set and the excitement of the action ebbed away leaving a sense of nervous exhaustion youd better leave as soon as its dark david said dusk had fallen and we were feeding in relays he began to brief me on the route to follow and listening to his instructions the lonely desolate miles of desert stretched out ahead the embers of the fire were warm the dark shapes of the surrounding walls gave a sense of security i was loath to go and yet i knew the security of those walls false the embers probably the last fire for which they would have fuel he gave me dates and a bottle filled with water sufficient to take me to the first well and then began to saddle the camel youll be seeing sue i nodded give her my love tell her ill be thinking of her and of a day we spent on the gower shell know what i mean she thinks youre dead i reminded him well tell her im not not yet anyway and he laughed and slung the heavy blanket over the wooden saddle ten minutes and id have been away just ten minutes that was all i needed but then the sound of a rifle cut the stillness of the night and a man screamed and went on screaming a thin highpitched sound that had in it all that anyone could ever know of pain bin suleiman shouted a warning from the eastfacing wall and david let go the camel and raced to meet the attack get out now he called to me over his shoulder get out before its too late he called something to hamid who was posted on the far side of the fort by the main entrance gate and then the darkness had swallowed him a stab of flame showed high up on the wall and the echo of the shot cut through the mans screams as though it had severed his vocal cords a sudden silence followed an unnatural stillness the camel startled by the noise had fled into the night i found him close under the wall of the tower bewildered and obstinate the wretched beast refused to move and by the time i had coaxed him to the main gate it was too late firing had broken out all round us a figure appeared at my side gripped my arm and shouted something in arabic it was hamid and he gestured towards the tower rocks thundered against the wooden timbers of the gate we had barricaded that afternoon hamid fired working the bolt of his rifle furiously the noise of his shots beating against my eardrums and then he was gone running for the tower i let the camel go and followed him my gun clutched in my hands bin suleiman was at the ladder ahead of me david followed close behind as i flung myself through the hole and into the darkness beyond as soon as we were all inside we drew the ladder up bullets splattered the wall the soft dull thud of lead the whine of ricochets didnt expect them to attack so soon david panted we heard the wood splinter as they broke down the gate they were inside the walls then vague shadows in the starlight and we fired down on them from the embrasures the shouts the screams the din of firing it went on for about ten minutes and then suddenly they were gone and the inside of the fort was empty save for half a dozen robed figures lying still or dragging themselves laboriously towards the shelter of the walls from the top of those walls our attackers kept up a steady fire bullets whistled in through the entrance hole so often that the slap of lead on the opposite wall became a commonplace they caused us no inconvenience for they struck one particular spot only and the convex curve of the wall prevented them from ricocheting we kept a watch at one of the embrasures but did not bother to return their fire let them waste their ammunition david said our turn will come when the moon rises once they misinterpreted our silence and left their positions along the outer walls we waited until they were in the open and as they hesitated considering how to reach the entrance hole we caught them in a withering fire our eyes accustomed to the darkness of the towers interior picked them out with ease in the starlight very few got back to the safety of the walls or out through the gateway and when the moon rose about an hour later we climbed the ladder to the very top of the tower and from there we were able to pick them off as they lay exposed along the tops of the walls below us hadd lay white and clearly visible there was great activity round all the wells david fired one shot that was all the people scattered activity ceased and in an instant the whole town appeared deserted again we took it in turns to sleep then but there was no further attack and sunrise found us in command of the whole area of the fort with no cover from which they could command our position the hadd forces had retired we took the guns and ammunition from the dead and dragged the bodies outside the walls nobody fired on us the hilltop was ours and the sun beat down and the rock walls became too hot to touch we buried ah and retired to the shade of the tower the camel that was to have carried me to buraimi had disappeared there was nothing for me to do but resign myself to the inevitable how long do you think you can hold out here i asked until our waters gone david answered or until we run out of ammunition and hadd i asked how desperate will they become he shrugged theres a well in the emirs palace and they can always evacuate the town and camp out in the date gardens theres plenty of water there its more a question of the emirs pride he cant afford to sit on his arse and do nothing and each night wed be a little wearier the hours of vigilance more deadly i closed my eyes the heat was suffocating the floor on which we lay as hard as iron sleep was impossible the flies crawled over my face and my eyeballs felt gritty against the closed lids the hours dragged slowly by wed nothing to do but lie there and keep watch in turns shortly after midday a cloud of dust moved in from the desert men on camels riding towards hadd from the south it was sheikh abdullahs main force they halted well beyond range of our rifles and the smoke of their cooking fires plumed up into the still air there were more than a hundred of them and at dusk they broke up into small groups and moved off to encircle our hill they seemed well organized and under a central command it was that and the fact that they were mounted on camels that decided me i went to where david was standing by one of the embrasures im going to try and get out tonight i told him whilst its dark ill get out on to the hillside and lie up and wait for a chance to take one of their camels and i added why dont you do the same a quick sortie its better than dying here like a rat in a trap no the words came sharp and hard and violent his eyes burned in their shadowed sockets staring at me angrily as though id tried to tempt him to be caught running away that isnt what i want and theyd give me a cruel death this way again i was conscious of that sense of mission blazing in his eyes this way ill write a page of desert history that old men will tell their sons and ill teach the people of hadd a lesson theyll never forget and then in a quieter less dramatic voice think you can make it on your own i dont know i said but its dark and theres bound to be a certain amount of chaos when they put in their attack he nodded okay its worth trying but theyre bedou theyve eyes like cats and they know the desert and remember the moon rises in four hours time if youre not away by then he left it at that and stood for a moment watching me as i gathered together the few things i needed a canvas bandolier of ammunition my rifle the water bottle a twist of rag containing a few dates and some pieces of dried meat my matches and my last packet of cigarettes i left with him and also something id become very attached to a little silver medallion of st christopher given me by a mission boy in tanganyika after id saved his life youre travelling a longer road than i am i said ten minutes later i was saying goodbye to him by the splintered timbers of the main gate when i told him id get help to him somehow he laughed it was a quiet carefree strangely assured sound dont worry about me think about yourself he gripped my hand good luck sir and thank you youve been a very big factor in my life a man i could always trust for a moment i saw his eyes pale in the starlight and bright now with the nervous tension that comes before a battle and then with a quick last pressure of the hand a muttered god be with you he pushed me gently out on to the camel track behind me the timbers creaked as he closed the gate i heard the two palm trunks with which wed shored it up from the inside thud into position i started down the track then and in an instant the walls had vanished merged with the dark shapes of the surrounding rocks black night engulfed me and i left the track feeling my way down the slope my feet stumbling amongst loose scree and broken rocks high overhead a thin film of cirrus cloud hid the stars it was this that saved me for i was lying out in the open not two hundred paces from them as they climbed to take up their positions on the north side of the fort i kept my face down and my body glued tight to the rock against which i lay my rifle clutched ready in my hand was covered by my cloak so that no gleam of metal showed and the two grenades david had given me dug into my groin as i waited tense and expectant for the moment of discovery and then they were past and the scuff of their sandalled feet faded on the slope above me i lifted my head then but all i could see was the dark hillside in my immediate vicinity no sign of the men who had passed no shadows moving on the edge of the darkness i slid to my feet found the track and went quickly down the hill and at the bottom i walked straight into a camel i dont know which of us was the more surprised it had been left to graze and it stood with a tuft of withered herb hanging from its rubbery lips staring at me in astonishment there were other camels they seemed to be all round me humped shapes in the dark champing and belching i seized the head rope of the one facing me forced it down and stepping on to its neck the way the arabs did i found myself sprawled across its back as it started into motion with a bellow of fear and rage there was a guttural arab cry a shot rang out the bullet whining close over my head but the only thing i cared about at that moment was whether i could hang on for the brute had gone straight into a gallop if it hadnt still been saddled i should undoubtedly have come off but the saddle gave me something to hold on to and after a while the crazy motion slowed and i was able to get my feet astride and by means of the head rope obtain some control and when i finally brought the animal to a halt there was no sound of pursuit there was no sound of any sort that wild swaying gallop seemed to have carried me right out into a void and then behind me the sound of shots carrying clear and hard on the still night air the rip and blatter of a machinegun twisting round in my saddle i saw the firefly flicker of the attackers guns high up on the black bulk of jebel alakhbar distant shouts and cries came to me faintly more firing and the sharper crack of small explosions three of them grenades by the sound of it the cries faded the fire slackened suddenly there was no longer any sound and i was alone again riding across an endless dark plain haunted by the thought of david wondering what had happened the silence and the sense of space were overwhelming now particularly when the curtain of cirrus moved away and the stars were uncovered then i could see the desert stretching away from me in every direction and i felt as lost as any solitary mariner floating alone in an empty sea far behind me the jebel alakhbar lifted its dark shape above the deserts rim for all the world like an island and all around me were small petrified waves an undulating dunescape that seemed to disappear into infinity in the darkness without any stars to guide me i had trusted to luck and let the camel have its head now i saw it had carried me westward towards the big dunes of the empty quarter and whitakers lonely camp i kept going not changing my direction it was a dangerous decision i knew that id only the one bottle of water and there were no wells where i was heading no caravan routes to guide me nothing but empty desert my decision was based on the fact that whitakers camp was much nearer than buraimi and after all he was the boys father i had two chances that was all our own camel tracks and the tracks of whitakers trucks if i missed both of these or if they had become obliterated by windblown sand then i knew id never get out of the desert alive i rode through the night without a stop guiding myself as best i could by the stars and when the dawn came i turned so that the rising sun was behind my right shoulder if my navigation was right then i had placed myself to the south of the line between jebel alakhbar and whitakers camp some time during the morning my new course should intersect the tracks made by our camels three nights back it was the first time i had ridden in the desert alone the solitude was immense the emptiness overpowering the heat too it came at me in waves so that time had no meaning it seared my eyes and beat against the membranes of my brain i drank sparingly from the water bottle rinsing the tepid liquid round my mouth a wind sprang up and small grains of sand were lifted from the gravel floor and flung in my face a fineground dust that clogged nose and throat and made the simple act of swallowing an agony without any saliva to look the desert in the face searching for our old tracks was like pricking needles into my eyes by midday id finished the water and still no sign of our tracks i was trembling then but not with the heat i had reached the sands and the dunes were growing bigger like an oceans swell building up against the continental shelf dune followed dune and the sense of space the feeling that this petrified world of sand went on and on without end appalled me a dirty scum formed in my mouth as i rode and my tongue became a swollen leathery mass the camels pace was slow and reluctant we had passed no vegetation no sign of anything growing and as the sun slanted to the west fear took hold of me for i knew i was headed into a desert that was four hundred miles across memory plagued me with the vision of a stream i knew in the black mountains of wales where the water ran over rocks brown with peat and fell tinkling to a cool translucent pool the sun sank into a purple haze and the sense of space with the dark shadowed dune crests stretched out in endless ridges ahead of me was more terrifying than the close confinement that produces claustrophobia and then a chance turn of the head a sudden glance and there it was a diagonal line ruled faintly across the back of a dune away to my left i stared at it through slitted gritswollen eyes afraid i was imagining it but it was real enough a single scuffedup thread scored by the feet of camels and halfobliterated by sand in the hard gravel at the foot of the dune i counted the tracks of six camels i had actually crossed the line of our three day old march without knowing it if the sun had been higher i should never have seen that faint shadow line i should have ridden on to certain death i realized then why david had insisted on my making for buraimi i had been very fortunate indeed i headed into the sunset then following the tracks knowing they would lead me to whitakers camp the camel seemed to know it too for its pace quickened the sun set and darkness came i camped at the foot of a dune not daring to go on for fear of losing the faint intermittent line of those tracks the desert lost its warmth immediately i ate a few dates but my mouth was too dry and sore to chew on the meat tired though i was i couldnt sleep the moon rose just before the dawn and i went on the tracks became more difficult to follow at times i lost them and had to cast about until i came upon them again a wind was blowing and the sifting sand was covering them moment by moment the sun rose and it was suddenly very hot long before i reached whitakers camp the sound of the drilling rig was borne to me on the wind the steady hum of machinery was utterly incongruous in that empty desolate world one of his bedouin guards brought me into the camp and as i slid exhausted from my camel i saw whitaker himself coming towards me from the rig i must have passed out then for the next i knew i was lying in his tent and he was bending over me holding a mug of water to my cracked lips the water was warm but its wetness cleaned my mouth eased the swollen dryness of my tongue and as i began to swallow i suddenly wanted to go on drinking and drinking for my body was all dried up but he took the mug away are you alone he asked and when i nodded he said what happened is he dead i sat up staring at him something in the way hed said it but his face was in shadow and i thought i must have imagined it he was alive when i left him i i see so hes still up there and he added hed made his gesture hed carried out a successful attack on the wells why couldnt he leave it at that i started to explain about davids determination to keep the wells from being repaired but he cut me short i know all about that i got the news from hadd yesterday my chap said the streets of hadd were deserted and no man dared venture out of his house for fear of being fired at he also said that the inhabitants had made a daylight attack on the fort and had been driven off by heavy fire there were just the four of us i said and i told him how salim had been killed at the outset and ali fatally wounded and hes alone up there now with just hamid and his brother bin suleiman he was silent for a moment and then he said i gather the emir sent to saraifa for sheikh abdullah had his forces arrived before you left and when i nodded he said what happened were you there when they attacked the fort no and i explained how id got out just before the attack started i dont know what happened but if david did manage to beat off that attack therell be others or else theyll just snipe at him from the rocks until theyve worn him down or his water runs out so hes got himself trapped and then almost irritably whats wrong with the boy does he want to die he will i said angrily if you dont get help to him somehow ive done what i can yousif was just back from sharjah and i sent him straight off with letters to colonel george who commands the trucial oman scouts and to gorde its up to the authorities now fortunately i dont think the emir has any idea yet who it is holding that fort it was something at least that hed notified the authorities and i lay back exhausted he gave me some more water and then left me saying hed arrange for some food to be brought when it came it was a halfcold dish of rice and camel meat i ate it slowly feeling my strength beginning to return and then i slept i hadnt intended to sleep but the food and the heat in the tent i couldnt keep my eyes open i woke to the sound of voices speaking in english it was almost three in the afternoon the camp was strangely quiet the drilling rig had stopped i peered out of the tent an army officer in khaki shirt and shorts and a peaked cap was standing talking to whitaker there was an raf officer there too and resting on the gravel beside the silent rig was a helicopter whitaker saw me as i came out of the tent and called me over this is colonel george of the tos he was a short thickset man bouncing with energy of a type that a frenchman in zanzibar had once described to me as a typical officer of the bled small protruding eyes stared at me curiously from beneath the peaked cap i was in buraimi when i got whitakers message the raf had loaned me a helicopter so i thought id fly down and see what it was all about his words were sharp and crisp understand young whitakers alive and that hes playing merry hell with our aggressive little emir correct i didnt answer for i was staring past him to a strange figure walking towards us from the rig a short fat figure in a powderblue tropical suit that was now crumpled and dirty and sweatstained ruffini i called he came almost running mister grant he seized hold of my hand i think he would have liked to embrace me he seemed so pathetically glad to see somebody he knew ow are you i ave been so concerned for you when you dont return with gorde i am asking questions making a damn nuisance of myself and nobody tell me nothing what are you doing here i asked what is a newspaper man ever doing looking for a story i go to buraimi by invitation of the sheikh and an italian oil man who is there also then this gentleman is sent by the british authorities to remove me they dont wish for ruffini to be in buraimi or anywhere else in the desert so i am under arrest no question of arrest colonel george snapped ive explained to you but ruffini wasnt listening i tell you once before signore he said to me still holding on to my hand i think you are sitting on the story i want now i talk to some of the bedouin ere and i know it is true what is this boy doing they say you are with him in that fort that you come from hadd this morning i could have wished it had been a british journalist but that wasnt so important as the fact that chance had put me in touch with the outside world ruffini might be prevented from filing his copy immediately but the knowledge that sooner or later davids story would become known might stir the authorities to action but when i suggested this to colonel george he shook his head i dont think you quite understand the official view we were back in the tent then and id been talking and answering questions for more than an hour the tos he said had been reinforced with regular army units some time back and had been standing by for more than a month ready to move at short notice the attack on saraifa and the battle at the mahdah falaj was just the sort of trouble their intelligence had expected and as soon as hed received the news hed given the order to prepare to move it was two nights ago hed everything lined up the convoy spread out round the perimeter of sharjah airfield and everybody ready to go and then the foreign office clamped down the political resident called the whole thing off but why i asked why because of cairo saudi the americans the united nations world opinion cairo radio he said had first referred to the haddsaraifa border dispute two weeks back there were reports from riyadh that saudi intended to raise the matter at the next meeting of uno the political resident came under the foreign office and to the foreign office this wasnt just a local problem but a small facet in the pattern of world diplomacy until that moment i had seen the attack upon saraifa as it appeared to david a personal matter now i was being forced to stand back mentally and look at the situation as a whole from the viewpoint of authority twentyfour hours colonel george said thats all we needed in twentyfour hours we could have put paid to the emirs little game and saved a hell of a lot of lives i know weve no treaty obligation so far as saraifa is concerned but it lies within the british sphere of influence and weve certainly a moral obligation to protect them against this sort of thing he shrugged well there it is im just a soldier not a politician he glanced at his watch and then at the raf pilot officer time we were moving eh outside the tent he turned to whitaker that boy of yours hes going to get himself killed if somebody doesnt do something the protruding eyeballs stared youve been out here a long time colonel couldnt you see the emir talk to your son you must have considerable influence still a little but not with my son it seems whitaker was clearly disconcerted hes acting contrary to my advice contrary to my express orders in fact he hesitated of course if the political resident authorized me to negotiate a settlement of the haddsaraifa border dispute i have some influence with the emir but he added a just settlement for saraifa would almost certainly require the backing of british military forces thats out of the question at the moment then whitaker gave an awkward little shrug colonel george grunted a small peremptory sound pity that boys got a lot of guts and hes going to die he started towards the helicopter but then he stopped and faced whitaker again ive heard stories about you and if half of what ive heard is true your sons doing just the sort of thing youd have done yourself in your younger days eh he paused and then in a harder voice ill tell you something whitaker if that boy holds out for a week hell go down in desert history his name remembered long after yours is forgotten he stared at him hard for a moment and then marched off across the gravel towards the helicopter sorry i cant give you a lift out grant no room weve got to deliver this wop journalist to sharjah but ive got one of my company commanders with a wireless truck up at buraimi i propose to send him down to patrol hadds northern border and keep tabs on the situation ill tell him to pick you up if you like names berry sound chap understands the bedou that do you i nodded and behind me whitaker said you might tell him to keep an eye out for my two vehicles my fuel tanker and the supply truck should have been in two days ago the rotor blades of the helicopter began to turn ruffini gripped my hand a rivederla i see the story of this david whitaker reaches london dont worry we have an arrangement with one of your newspapers he was sweating already as he ducked into the ovenheat of the fuselage colonel george paused in the open door want to give me a message for his sister i could send it straight down to the hospital shed get it this evening i hesitated just tell her hes alive thats all she needs to know at the moment i should have thought something more personal was called for he stared at me playfully tapping my arm probably you dont realize it but shes been raising hell on your account as soon as she knew you were missing she came straight down to sharjah she caught that oil chap gorde just as he was boarding his plane and the story is she tore him off such a strip for abandoning you that he dropped his stick and took off without it since then shes been badgering the life out of me ill be damn glad to be able to tell her youre safe well he cocked his eyebrow at me and grinned ill give her your love will that do and without waiting for a reply he got into the helicopter and slammed the door whitaker and i watched it take off a mechanical dragonfly whirring in the clean bright air i turned then conscious of the quickened beat of my pulse the sudden desire to be alone it was strangely heartwarming to know that somebody had been concerned about whether i got back safely or not i walked to the steep shadowed edge of the dunes and lay there longing for a cigarette the drill so useless now without its fuel stood like a toy dwarfed by the dunes the arab crew lying about listless with nothing to do whitaker had gone to his tent the shadows lengthened and i wondered what was happening on that hilltop forty miles to the east was david still alive the answer came next day just after whitakers two trucks had pulled in and the noise of their arrival had woken me from the first long uninterrupted sleep i had enjoyed in well over a week everything was confusion stores being unloaded the rig started up when a bulletscarred landrover appeared flying the emirs green flag out of it stepped a big portly man with very black features under a large turban the emirs secretary whitaker said and went forward to greet him a bodyguard of four askari sat silent in the back of the vehicle wildeyed men with greasy locks hanging to their shoulders who fingered their weapons nervously whitaker took the secretary to his tent and they remained there over an hour talking over tinned fruit and coffee finally the man left but before getting into the landrover he made a long angry speech a harangue that was clearly intended for the whole camp what did he want i asked as the dust of his departure finally settled and the men returned to their jobs if i dont go at once to hadd and get david out of that fort the emir will hold me responsible whitakers face was very pale his whole body trembling allah akhbar he muttered why did the idiot have to choose this moment when id talked the emir into agreement and had obtained the financial backing i needed why now hes still alive then he turned his eye on me a fixed glassy look yes he said hes alive the night you left him he beat back the attack captured a prisoner and sent him to the emir next day with a message it announced who he was and the terms on which hed vacate the fort and leave them free to repair the wells the terms required the emir to declare publicly that he accepted the present borders between hadd and saraifa for all time and this declaration was to be supported by a signed document to the same effect lodged with the united nations david also demanded an escort of the trucial oman scouts to see him and his men safely out of hadd territory but it wasnt the terms that upset whitaker it was the fact that david had disclosed his identity did he have to involve me he demanded angrily staring towards the rig i dont suppose he meant to involve you i said youre involved by the simple fact that youre his father his father he turned on me i took a servant girl he said harshly a moment in time a passing need but that was all it ended there and i made provision for her you cant buy immunity from your actions he ignored that twenty years and the moment catches up with me and im faced with the brat a raw undisciplined boy with a vicious background he glared at me and you sent him out here hed have come in any case i said once he knew you were his father i was angry myself then i dont think you realize what a shock it was to him to learn that he was illegitimate to discover that his mother had been deserted in childbirth shed no claim on me he said quickly and even if she had it doesnt justify his coming out here with some idea at the back of his mind that he was going to kill me did you know about that i had it all out of him shortly after he arrived that and his criminal background and how he was wanted by the police for causing the death of that man thomas and he added i should have sent him packing i should have realized the boy was bent on destroying me on ruining all my plans you know thats not true i said then why did he pretend he was dead when he wasnt and now when the truth of my theory is within my grasp when the thing ive been searching for all my life is here he gets me involved in this stupid useless demonstration of his he was sweating and there were little flecks of white at the corners of his mouth what hes doing i said hes doing because hes accepted the things you believed in he made your world his own saraifa his home and the background you complain of is the reason hes doing it so successfully hes got the emir to withdraw his forces from saraifa now is the time surely when your influence my influence what influence do you think i have now men have been killed and thats something only blood can wipe out and he added staring into the distance if id gone with the emirs secretary id have been held hostage for davids submission his life or mine and when next the emir sends an emissary hell come in force that was made very plain he put his hand up to his head covering his eye as though to shut out the desert and concentrate on what was in his mind its madness he breathed madness he cant achieve anything how do you know i demanded angrily ruffini has the whole story now and that italian he let his hand fall staring at me in surprise how can he affect the situation the authorities arent going to take any notice of him he said it as though to convince himself and then in a voice so hoarse it seemed to be torn out of him hell die up there and thatll be the end of it the look on his face was quite frightening he turned and walked slowly to his tent i didnt see him again that evening and the next day his manner was still very strange we hardly exchanged a word and i was glad when captain berry arrived looking back on it i suppose i should have tried to understand his predicament he hadnt enough men to get david out by force and he was probably right in saying the situation had gone beyond the reach of his influence with the emir what i didnt realize was that i was seeing a man in the grip of events forced to a reassessment of his whole life and the values by which he had lived and being driven half out of his mind in the process it was late afternoon when berry got in a lean bonylooking scot with fair hair and a face that was almost brickred in the slanting sun he brought a breath of sanity into that sultry camp for he was from outside and not emotionally involved in what was happening forty miles to the east he had a message for me from colonel george picked up on his radio that morning im to tell you that your italian friend got his story out in time and that youre not to worry everything possible is being done the colonel has been ordered to bahrain to report to the political resident in person oh and he said a nurse thomas sent you her love and is glad to know youre safe okay i nodded not trusting myself to speak for the moment i could think of nothing but that message from sue captain berry was speaking to whitaker something about his son showing what one determined and resolute man could achieve he was one of those soldiers that believe action is the solution to everything you must be very proud of him sir colonel whitakers face was without expression but a nerve flickered along the line of his jaw and he turned away berry watched him for a moment a puzzled look on his face thats a man ive always wanted to meet he said but im surprised he left this to his son after whats happened in saraifa i should have thought hed have been busy raising the desert tribes it would have solved our difficulty if he had we might be allowed to support a desert rising against the emir i take it i said youll be leaving at once it wasnt only that i wanted to know what had happened since id left jebel alakhbar i wanted to get away from that camp but he told me it was out of the question theyd been driving for over twenty hours both the wireless truck and the landrover had to be serviced the men needed sleep he had a wireless operator with him and five levies of the tos under a corporal leave at first light makes no difference im afraid he added seeing my impatience i cant help colonel whitakers son mines only a watching brief anyway its no good bashing these dunes in the dark hed brought spare kit for me so that i had the luxury of a camp bed that night and in the morning i was able to discard my arab clothes which by then were very filthy and put on clean khaki shirt and shorts we breakfasted on bullybeef and tinned peaches washed down with a brew of strong tea and then we left colonel whitaker was there to see us go and as he said goodbye to me he gave me instructions that were to have considerable significance later if anything happens to me grant i leave you to look after my affairs i think you know enough about me now to understand what i want done if they find oil here we drove off then and i remember thinking he looked a very lonely figure standing there with the clutter of the rig behind him we went north taking the shortest route across hadd territory and driving fast keeping to the flat gravel stretches between the dunes we were clear of hadds northern border by tenthirty we turned east then and the going became much slower for we were crossing the lines of the dunes at set times we stopped to make radio contact with tos hq the only news of any importance was that colonel george before he left for bahrain and therefore presumably acting on his own initiative had ordered berrys company south into the desert for exercises shortly after midday the dunes began to get smaller and in an area where it had rained quite recently we came upon the black tents of a bedouin encampment and there were camels browsing on untidy bushes of abal berry stopped and spoke with some of the men well your chap was alive yesterday he said as we drove on i thought they were al bu shamis but they were of the awamir and they came up past jebel alakhbar yesterday they say they heard intermittent firing they also told me that the people of saraifa are beginning to return to the oasis that two falajes are running again and khalids halfbrother mahommed is calling men to arms it was the first indication i had that what david had done had not been done in vain soon after that we became bogged down for several hours in an area of small dunes so confused that it looked like a petrified tidal race as a result we didnt sight jebel alakhbar until late afternoon we stopped at sunset the hill looked deceptively close in the clear still air the colours of the rock almost mauve the sky behind quite green its about six miles away berry said handing me his glasses i could see the fort quite distinctly then the tower in silhouette against the fantastic sky nothing moved there no sign of life i was tired after the long drive and i felt depressed darkness fell we had our food and after the meal berry disappeared into the back of the truck he wanted to hear the bbc news it kept him in touch he said but what he meant was that it brought home nearer and made the desert seem less remote natures needs took me into the desert and when he called to me i didnt hear what it was he shouted but only caught the excitement in his voice back at the truck i found him seated with the earphones pressed tight against his head it was in the summary he said and then after a while your chaps made the headlines apparently a big story in one of the papers this morning he removed the earphones and switched off they even got his name right and the name of the fort and the foreign secretary is to be asked a question about it in the house tonight he rolled his long body over the tailboard and stood beside me funny thing he said if it had been a soldier up there on the jebel alakhbar theyd have taken it for granted or more probably somebody would have raised hell because the fellow had disobeyed orders but because hes a civilian he gave a quick derisive laugh not that it makes any difference one newspaper story and a question in the house wont change my orders well be left to sit here and watch him die that is if he isnt dead already wed heard no sound since wed gone into camp the night was deathly still not a breath of air and berry made it plain to me that he couldnt go any nearer his orders were to stay in trucial territory and in front of us stretched the invisible barrier of the hadd border you can be certain were under observation if i cross that border the political repercussions would be endless as it is my colonels sticking his neck out sending me down here on his own authority we stayed up late to listen to the last news summary from home the item we were waiting for came towards the end questioned in the house this evening about reports that a british civilian david whitaker with two arabs was holding the fort of jebel alakhbar in the arabian emirate of hadd the foreign secretary said that the newspaper report emanated from a foreign source and was almost certainly without foundation he added that he was having enquiries made cairo radio this evening accused britain of concentrating a large force on the hadd border including armoured cars and artillery armoured cars and artillery berry snapped the receiver off why the hell do they repeat that sort of nonsense like most soldiers who know what the situation is on the spot it made him contemptuous of the organs of publicity and you heard what the foreign secretary said its all going to be hushed up oil and politics its always the same out here in the middle east for the sake of peace and quiet a petty tyrant is going to be allowed to get away with murder he jumped out of the truck and stood staring a moment towards the jebel alakhbar finally he gave a little shrug care for a drink ive got a little scotch left i shook my head i was wondering whether any of the other papers would take the story up and if so whether theyd make enough of it to stir up public opinion only public opinion could force the government to accept its responsibility for saraifa and take action and without that davids sacrifice became pointless i think ill turn in now i said im still very tired i slept like the dead that night and in the morning it wasnt the sun that woke me but berry shaking my arm somebodys still in the fort i heard shots just after dawn very faint but definitely rifle fire ive reported it to hq i scrambled up sweaty from lying in my sleeping bag in the blazing sun but even through the glasses there was nothing to be seen just the jebel alakhbar shimmering in a heat haze berry glanced at his watch you might like to listen to what the newspapers are saying back home we went into the back of the truck and switched on the radio it was an overseas service of the bbc with a roundup of news and opinions from the national press i dont know what i expected what berry expected a few references perhaps a leader instead every newspaper had taken up the story for almost ten minutes the thin voice of the announcer came to me through the earphones speaking as though from another world and giving variations on the theme of the story i had told ruffini david was headline news one i particularly remember borstal boy holds fort for foreign office and another popular paper was quoted as attacking the foreign secretary for trying to hoodwink the public but the press reaction seemed to have made no impression on the official attitude the only indication of increased interest was that radio contact with tos hq was every hour now on the hour colonel george we learned was back in sharjah ruffini was still there berrys company was in a position ten miles west of buraimi and about a hundred miles to the north of us the day dragged on the sun rose until the sky was a burnished bowl a throbbing ache to the eyes and the desert sand beneath our feet as hot as the lid of a stove several times we heard the distant sound of shots but though we took it in turns to keep watch through the glasses we saw no movement we dozed between watches ate snacks out of tins and waited water was rationed and we became thirsty boredom set in we listened to the bbc but david was no longer in the news time was running out for him and my presence here seemed to serve no purpose those occasional intermittent shots didnt tell me whether he was alive or dead they only indicated that the fort was still held repeatedly i tried to persuade berry to move forward and recce under cover of darkness but he was absolutely adamant i cross that border with british military vehicles and god knows where it would end by the end of the day we were beginning to get on each others nerves the truth was that nothing would have pleased berry more than to be allowed to call up his company and go in and settle the whole business in his quiet scots way he was so tensedup over the situation that the battle would have been a welcome relief instead of which he was tied down within sight of the emirs stronghold in the company of a man who was becoming more and more irritable at the delay it wasnt that i didnt understand his difficulty if he acted on his own initiative he might plunge the whole of arabia into war involve his own country and certainly ruin his career it was a diplomatic tightrope that i couldnt possibly expect him to walk but understanding his difficulty didnt help me to bear the inaction to have to sit there doing nothing whilst six miles away that boy was dying by inches the heat and frustration it nearly drove me mad i suppose it was the strain of the past fortnight berry gave me salt tablets a large whisky and sent me to bed at dusk at midnight he woke me to say wed be moving at first light the colonel finally got bahrain to agree to my making an attempt to get him out alive im to try and arrange an audience with the emir in the morning and suppose he refuses to see you i asked he wont whats more hell accept my offer to mediate you seem very confident i am im offering him a way out thatll save his face if we do what the men of his bodyguard have failed to do and get young whitaker out of the fort then the emir at least gets credit for being cunning thats something to set against the laughter of the bedou round their desert camp fires i take it youd like to come with me of course he hesitated i think id better make it clear that i could be wrong about the emir he hasnt a particularly savoury reputation and if he did decide to turn nasty he gave a little shrug so long as you understand the position six hours later we were on the move motoring across the flat stony plain with the jebel alakhbar growing bigger every minute until it towered above us a grey sugarloaf mass against the rising sun a union jack fluttered from the landrovers bonnet there were just the two of us and berrys driver ismail a tall darkskinned man very neat in his khaki uniform and coloured tos headcloth no sound reached us above the noise of the engine i could see no sign of movement on the hill above us we rounded the shoulder of jebel alakhbar by a dusty track and there suddenly was hadd yellow now in the sunshine with the emirs green flag hanging limp above the palace and the town silent and strangely empty with the tower i had known so well perched above it on the lip of the limestone cliffs we passed a camp of the emirs men smoke spiralled blue from their cooking fires in the still morning air and they watched us curiously wild lankhaired men their bodies strapped around with cartridges their rifles slung across their shoulders several were wounded the blood caked black on their bandages the well outside the town was as we had left it that night the wall destroyed by the explosion and nothing done to repair it we entered hadd by the main gate the streets were empty the little square deserted baulks of palm timber still lay where they had been thrown down in panic beside the damaged well looks as though the population has moved out into the date gardens berry said three men and theyve stopped the life of this whole town dead its incredible but looking up it wasnt quite so incredible that tower hung right over the town all the way to the gates of the palace we could see it perched there above us the narrowness of the streets was no protection it looked right down into them berrys appreciation of the emirs situation proved correct after keeping us waiting for over an hour he received us in a small room off one of the palace rooftops there were armchairs in the western style and a table on which stood an expensive german camera and some models of tanks and armoured cars the walls were hung with finely silvered guns and pictures of the emir driving through hadd in a glossy american car the man himself was small and wiry with a face that somehow managed to combine craftiness with great dignity it was a long rather cruel face its length emphasized by the big nose and the little pointed beard glistening black with oil his eyes were heavily madeup with kohl sheikh abdullah was there and several other notables including the emirs secretary and though i couldnt follow what was said i was conscious of the atmosphere which was distinctly hostile the audience lasted a long time with the emir insisting at first that berry storm the fort with his own troops take david prisoner and have him shot when he refused the emir launched into a harangue that was so violent that the spittle actually flew from his lips i thought for a moment berry said afterwards that we were for it threatening us however didnt solve the emirs problem which was that he was being made to look a fool before his own people and all the desert world after a long argument he finally agreed that if we were able to persuade the defenders to evacuate the fort they would be allowed to go unmolested we waited whilst sheikh abduallah gave one of his men orders to climb the slopes of jebel alakhbar under a white flag and announce a ceasefire berry had guessed that there were snipers posted among the rocks below the fort walls and he was taking no chances the extraordinary thing is he said as we hurried out of the palace that theyre convinced there are at least a dozen men up there in the fort we drove back through the silent town out past the deserted wells and the askari encampment and took the dusty track that led round the shoulder of the hill we left the landrover at the foot of the camel track on the north side and started up on foot the sun was high now and the heat throbbed back from the bare scorched rock beating up through the soles of our shoes for a time the fort was lost behind ridges but as we climbed higher the walls gradually came into view there was no sign of sheikh abdullahs snipers no movement on the hilltop the air was very still the silence and the heat appalling it was just over five days since i had come down this very track in the dark five days just over one hundred and thirty hours to be exact and under constant attack it didnt seem possible that david or any of them could still be alive and yet hadd was deserted and the emir had agreed to berrys terms we climbed fast hoping for the best fearing the worst they must be out of water by now wounded probably perhaps only one of them left alive the timbers of the main gate sagged open splintered by the rocks that lay at the foot of the two crumbling bastions as we climbed the last steep rise the tower appeared framed in the gateway pale yellow in the sun with the shadowed opening halfway up yawning like a mouth agape no sign of life no sound i called out david its george grant the rocks echoed back his name and nothing stirred david and then unbelievably he answered a hollow croaking sound from the interior of the tower i have captain berry of the trucial oman scouts with me my throat was parched my voice hoarse the emir offers you a safe conduct even as i said it i wondered the stillness and the heat beating at my nerves concealed amongst the rocks below us were men with rifles how did we know they wouldnt open fire on us the hairs at the back of my neck crawled treachery seemed to hang in the hot air and even as david told us to come in through the open gateway i knew we shouldnt have trusted the emir the open expanse of the forts interior was a shambles there were the remains of fires the tattered remnants of camels carcases those things i remembered but now there were bodies of arabs too lying where they had fallen unburied and rotting buzzing with flies i counted nine of them the place smelt of death was littered with the debris of attacks beaten back and the sun the cauterizing sterilizing sun blazed down something moved in the black mouth of the tower and the rickety ladder was thrust out of it it fell the last few feet to the ground and david appeared climbing stiffly and very slowly down it at the bottom he paused as though to gather his strength together and then he turned and faced us standing very stiffly erect a bloodstained strip of cloth round his right forearm and blood showing in a black patch below his left shoulder berry took a tentative step forward weve just seen the emir if you leave with us now hes agreed to allow you to cross the border into trucial territory unmolested and you believed him david started to move towards us but then he stopped he was swaying slightly too weak to walk hes ordered a ceasefire he nodded slowly thats true i heard the order given a man came up by the path from hadd a little while back he carried a white flag but then he disappeared went to earth amongst the rocks his voice was thin and very weak i dont trust the bastards he added coming towards us very slowly closeto he looked ghastly his eyes had gone quite yellow the skin of his face yellow too and all the flesh fined away so that the cheeks were sunken the bones staring his body seemed smaller dried up and shrivelled he looked about half his normal size completely desiccated the deaths head face the yellow burning eyes the croaking voice i thought he couldnt last much longer and i pleaded with him to take his chance but he was like a man in a trance have the authorities decided to act will they support saraifa and when we told him no all he said was they will they will if i hold out long enough theyll be forced to act the eyes fastened on me why didnt you go to sharjah why come here this isnt what i wanted his voice sounded desperately tired utterly dispirited didnt you understand i wanted the world to know if people at home dont know what im trying to do the people at home do know i said and i told him about ruffini and how the story had been taken up by the national press and a question asked in the house his eyes lit up his whole bearing suddenly changed wonderful he breathed wonderful he was standing erect now his head up his voice much stronger time he said time and a little luck thats all i need now time is against you berry said this is your last chance to get out of here alive is it the dry cracked lips produced a twisted smile do you really believe the emir would let us get out of here alive particularly when they see how few we are hed lose too much face anyway im not going ill stay here till i die unless the emir agrees to my terms or the authorities make some move to safeguard saraifa surely to god youve done enough i said and gave him the rumour wed heard about the two falajes running again at saraifa and the people returning to the oasis berry more practical said how much water have you got left not much but its cooler inside the tower were drinking very little and your two men berry asked are they alive yes theyre still alive hamids very weak a bullet through the shoulder and a splinter of rock from a ricochet in the back bin suleimans leg is smashed but theyll both last as long as the water so you wont leave with us no berry nodded accepting his decision as final he seemed to understand davids attitude and he didnt attempt to reason with him instead he unstrapped his web belt slipping his water bottle from it its not much he said holding it out but one day could make the difference ill report your decision by radio to hq as soon as i get back to my wireless truck david took the water bottle and though there couldnt possibly be any moisture left in that emaciated driedup hull of a body his eyes glistened for a moment thanks he whispered ill remember his thin hands were gripped tight round the bottle one more day he breathed youll have that i promise he wasnt looking at berry or at me he was looking upwards to the burning vault of the sky a pact with god and on this barren burnedrock hilltop where the air was heavy with the stink of rotting bodies it would be an old testament god one more day he whispered again in that croaking voice and at that moment a rifle cracked the thud of the bullet the scream of pain the clatter of a gun barrel on rock it was all on the instant and i turned to see the body of an arab writhing on the eastern wall it reached the edge paused and then fell and as it pitched screaming on its face a second shot rang out the screams thinned to silence the body on the ground arched a series of violent jerks something sounded in the throat and after that it lay still i glanced at berry he hadnt moved nor had david the click of metal on stone drew my eye to the top of the tower the glint of a rifle a thin wisp of smoke everything was still again it was difficult to believe that in that instant a man had died you see thats all the treacherous bastards safeconduct is worth david gave a dry little laugh youd better get out of here whilst you still can berry hesitated and then he nodded he reached into his pocket and produced some field dressings and a small firstaid kit had an idea these might be required he handed them over and then drew himself up and gave david a formal paradeground salute good luck he said and turned quickly david looked at the firstaid tin and the dressings his eyes quite blank his face suddenly fallenin the flesh tight on the bones of the skull i could only guess what he was thinking a few more days and if he hadnt been killed by a bullet hed be dead of thirst he looked up this is goodbye sir he held out his hand tell my father will you that i hope its a bloody good well but if he lets the emir get his hands on one penny of the royalties ill haunt him to the grave and beyond his skin was dry the bones of the hand like an old mans bones i stared at him not knowing what to say for i was sure i wouldnt see him again he was so damned young to die and like this in cold blood with his eyes open trading life for the sake of a gesture and yet like berry i didnt try and argue with him goodbye i said and turned quickly before my eyes betrayed me at the gateway i paused and looked back he hadnt moved he was still standing there quite alone and swaying slightly all his muscles slack with weariness we stared at each other for a second and then i went out through the gateway and i knew if the emir attacked again that night it would be the end what a waste i said to berry stumbling almost blindly down the track he looked at me i dont agree his voice was hard and there was a ring to it as though id struck a chord deep down if there werent men like david whitaker he shrugged its a big question isnt it why were born what we do with our lives and he added after a pause id like to think given his circumstances that id behave the same way he had loosened his pistol holster and his eyes searched the rocks as we hurried back down the track but we saw nobody and the only sound was the heat throbbing at our temples the landrover was still there with ismail standing beside it treachery had gone back to its lair and high up over the fort the black speck of some carrion bird planed on the still air berry had seen it too and as we drove off he said i give him four days in four days i reckon hell be dead of thirst hes weak i said theyve only got to make a determined attack now but berry shook his head so long as theres one man left in that tower capable of firing a rifle or tossing a grenade theyll never take it and sheikh abdullah knows it now only artillery or mortars could blast them out i couldnt understand even from your description how three men could hold a fort against a hundred tribesmen but now that ive seen the place he was staring back at it over his shoulder i am only surprised that a civilian should have appreciated the military possibilities of it he was a gang leader in cardiff docks before he came out to join his father in saraifa i said he laughed well i suppose thats as good a training as any and after that we drove in silence when we got back to the wireless truck berry found a message ordering him to return to sharjah immediately but why i said youre not on hadd territory theyve got cold feet over the situation by the sound of it my companys been ordered back too he stood staring towards jebel alakhbar and there was an obstinate look on his face ive given orders that we move at dawn and ive notified hq that im held here the night with a damaged spring on the wireless truck twelve hours isnt much but you never know the situation could alter by this simple stratagem we were still there on the border when the slanting sun showed a cloud of dust moving across the desert from the direction of hadd through the glasses we counted thirtytwo camels and the riders were all armed berry ordered his corporal to issue additional ammunition and personally sited both the bren guns on a low ridge but the raiding force kept to hadd territory heading due west towards the sands their objective must be whitakers camp berry said theres nothing else out there but he made no move to follow them colonel whitaker will have to look after himself i thought of the lone figure wed left standing with the clutter of that drilling rig behind him this was what he had feared the emissary returning in force whitaker would go with them this time hed have no alternative i wondered what would happen when he met the emir would he agree to go up to the fort and if he did how would david react but that was all in the future i watched the dust cloud until it disappeared below the rim of the horizon and then i fetched my briefcase and settled down to write a report it was finished by the time the sun had set and darkness closing in i gave it to berry and he agreed to have his wireless operator transmit it to sharjah at the next contact with hq the report was a long one for it covered davids situation our visit to the fort and the treacherous attempt on his life and i addressed it to ruffini we were both civilians and i thought there was just a chance that it might be passed across to him before anyone in authority stopped it if hes still there berry said the thing was sent now and we were sitting in the truck waiting for the bbc news more questions in the house and the opposition had attacked the government for refusing to grant newspaper correspondents visas for any arabian territory except bahrain they were accused of trying to hush up an ugly situation and then in the morning when we picked up the bbc newspaper roundup i was staggered to find that virtually the whole national press had carried a story obviously based on the report i had sent to ruffini somehow he had got it through uncensored and the result was a fantastic perversion of the facts so colourful so written up as to be almost unrecognizable from the sad spectacle we had witnessed and yet it was all there the heroic quality of davids stand magnified a thousandfold to give jaded townspeople the best breakfasttable reading for weeks and the story had spread from the front pages right through to the leader columns an angry outraged demand for government action and when the last editorial flag had been waved by the bbc announcer and the last exhortation of the government to act immediately had been read berry and i looked at each other in astonishment i think we were both of us quite dazed by the violence of the reaction at home it was only twelve hours since berrys wireless operator had laboriously tapped out in morse my long report and in that short time davids situation had been put before the highest tribunal in the land the british public moreover something had obviously roused the press to anger the secretive attitude of whitehall presumably as one paper put it up to a late hour last night despite a barrage of phone calls nobody in authority appeared to be in a position to confirm or positively deny the story the only comment was we regard the source as highly unreliable this is either stupendous arrogance or stupendous ignorance we suspect both and we demand that the foreign secretary take immediate action the country is deeply disturbed on the strength of that berry cancelled his orders to move and within half an hour his action was confirmed colonel george acting on a hunch that political decisions would now have to be reversed and entirely on his own initiative i gathered later had already turned berrys company round and ordered it to drive with all possible speed to the hadd border im to wait here until they arrive berry said by then the colonel hopes to be here himself to take command how long before they get here i asked if they keep going without being stopped in the dunes theyll arrive sometime after midnight i imagine he started to go back to the wireless truck but then he stopped it might interest you to know that signer ruffini was appointed reuters correspondent with the full knowledge of the political resident yesterday afternoon but for that very odd appointment i imagine your report would have been passed to bahrain in which case ive no doubt it would now be rotting in some pigeonhole in the residency instead of making the worlds headlines the official attitude was obvious by agreeing to reuters request perhaps even instigating it they could justify their refusal to grant visas to correspondents by saying that the press already had coverage from an accredited agency correspondent and that the very man from whom the story had originated no doubt they took the view that as a foreigner ruffini would be more amenable to control than a british correspondent and therefore unlikely to cause them further embarrassment it was a little ironical that in their hurry to appoint him they had given me almost direct and immediate access to the whole of the british press i am to tell you berry added with a thin smile that no further messages for ruffini will be accepted through military channels a matter of bolting the door after the horse has gone what about that raiding party headed for whitakers camp i said i hadnt mentioned it in my report to ruffini the previous night somebody ought to be told already done he said it wont be passed on to ruffini but the prpg will be notified and so will sir philip gorde hes in sharjah now so that was that and nothing to do now but wait the day passed slowly no sound from the direction of jebel alakhbar not a single shot all day the hill seemed suddenly dead the heat was very bad the wireless operator was on constant watch on the headquarters waveband we switched only once to the bbc news a foreign office spokesman had stated that whilst there was no official news there was reason to believe that press reports were substantially correct and that a young englishman had instigated some sort of guerilla activity against the emir of hadd the whole matter was under urgent review there were rumours of reinforcements standing by in readiness to be flown to bahrain and two destroyers had left aden steaming north along the arabian coast cairo radio had stepped up its propaganda offensive late in the afternoon i was woken from a stifling sleep in the shadow of the w t truck with the news that the hadd raiding force was returning and theres been no sound from the fort at all berry passed me the glasses as i stood with slitted eyes gazing at a dust cloud right in the path of the sun thirtythree of them now he said the dust made it difficult but as they passed to the south of us and i could see them more distinctly i confirmed his count they must have been travelling all night and moving very fast the figures flickered indistinctly in the heat the emir will have picked up the arab news he added hell know he hasnt much time had whitaker a radio do you know i dont think so then he probably doesnt know whats happening at home that the governments being forced to take action oh well he added if he goes up to the fort and his sons still alive colonel whitaker will learn from him what we were able to tell him yesterday it might make some difference i thought of that scene father and son facing each other in the shambles of that fort watching the emirs force move past us men and camels all lifted bodily off the ground by a mirage and turned into strange distorted shapes by the heat rising from that sea of sand i felt once again the cruelty of this desert world it was so hard so empty so casual of human life a crucible to transmute the flesh to skin and bone the mind to something as distorted as those shapes dancing in a mirage i had a premonition of disaster then but not i think of tragedy certainly not a tragedy quite so grim i watched them until they disappeared beyond the shoulder of jebel alakhbar and shortly afterwards the sun set one more night but there was still no news no certainty of action better turn in and get some sleep berry suggested i havent even got an eta from the colonel yet will we move in the morning do you think david cant last out much longer and in the morning he might be faced with his fathers desperate situation for gods sake its got to be tomorrow youd better pray then he snapped back irritably for only god and the foreign office know what action will be taken and when and he added angrily i dont even know whether the colonels order to my company has been officially confirmed i took his advice then and went to my camp bed but sleep was out of the question the night was hot and very still the stars bright time dragged and i dozed to be jerked awake by the distant sound of engines it was hours and berrys company was motoring in dark shapes moving in convoy across the desert without lights an officer reported all present and correct but warned that the only orders hed received were to wait for the colonel and not to cross the border orders whispered in the night the dark trucks spewing men out on to the sand the area of our camp was suddenly full of movement an antheap settling to sleep and a voice at my elbow said ullo mister grant is ruffini his pudgy hand gripped my arm patted my shoulder words tumbled out of him they had rushed him up to this company to get him out of the way hed been made fabulous offers by several newspapers i am lucky eh lucky to be a journalist and out ere at this minute but i think he was a little scared he was certainly lonely his knowledge of the arabs was based on mussolinis shortlived empire a bare two hours sleep and then the dawn breaking another day and the antheap stirred and came to life little groups of men forming and reforming an everchanging pattern against the blistering yellow of sand and gravel and standing there on the rim of the desert to the southeast the jebel alakhbar black at first against the rising sun but soon duncoloured and bare no sound no movement to be seen through the glasses and the desert all around us that was empty and silent too and then that solitary shot we were sitting under a canvas awning rigged from the side of the headquarters truck and drinking tea we all heard it a sharp faint sound from the direction of jebel alakhbar but when we looked through the glasses there was nothing to see and there was no further sound just that one isolated shot the time was we had no reason to regard it as any different from the other shots we had heard though afterwards we realized the sound had been slighter we settled down again and finished our tea an island of men camped in a void waiting whilst the sun climbed the brassy sky and the ovenlid of the days heat clamped down on us stifling all talk only ruffini was active trotting sweating from one to the other of us tirelessly questioning endlessly scribbling staring through creasedup eyes at the jebel alakhbar and then finally badgering berry until he had given orders for his copy to be transmitted over the radio to sharjah and then just before midday the dead stillness of the desert torn apart by the buzzsaw sound of a helicopter it came sidling in from the north a strange aerial insect painted for desert war and in the instant of its settling the whole camp was suddenly changed to a single organism full of purpose with ruffini i stood apart on the edge of this ordered turmoil and watched the man responsible for it surrounded by his officers standing with his legs straddled head thrown back a man conscious of the dramatic quality of the moment ruffini noticed it too el colonello e is going to war but my attention had shifted from colonel george coming towards me from the helicopter was the squat battered figure of philip gorde grant he was leaning heavily on his stick as he faced me wheres charles whitaker whats happened to him and when i told him what we feared he said christ almighty man couldnt you do something but then he shrugged no of course not bloody politicians he growled always too late making up their minds hope were in time thats all he was staring at me out of his bloodshot eyes i gather hed moved his rig up to the border hed started to drill had he yes i wish id known that earlier he looked tired his face liverish not that i could have done anything to help him he added heavily its a hell of a situation and that boy of his a bloody little hero doesnt he realize what hes doing to his father or doesnt he care god he was jabbing at the ground with his stick well well just have to hope we get there in time he said again and he stumped off to talk to colonel george the cluster of officers was breaking up now voices shouting orders men running the whirr of starter motors the roar of engines a landrover disappearing in a cloud of dust ah there you are grant the colonel neat and dapper cool almost in the torrid heat came towards me the boys still alive i gather there was a shot fired so berry tells me well just have to hope for the best im sending a small force up to take over the fort the rest of the outfit will move direct on hadd berrys gone ahead to make contact with the emir you and ruffini can ride in the headquarters truck the column was lining up now and ten minutes later we were on the move if he is still alive it is a great story eh ruffini said you think he is still alive how the hell do i know but berry had given him four days i was pinning my hopes to that well it dont matter alive or dead he is a hero and this is the biggest story i am ever writing that was all ruffini saw in it a newspaper story nothing more and gorde hating david because i hadnt had time to explain his motives i felt suddenly sad depressed by the thought that davids action would be misunderstood how could you explain to men like gorde what khalids death had meant to him how hed felt when hed seen the people of saraifa forced to leave the oasis half an hour later the column halted we were close under the jebel alakhbar time passed and nothing happened the wait seemed endless and then suddenly the colonels landrover came roaring down the column he had gorde in the seat beside him jump in he called to me ruffini too the emir has agreed to meet me at the first well he was in a mood of boyish elation a reaction from nervous tension the column was moving again now and several vehicles had swung away and were headed for the camel track on the north side of jebel alakhbar we reached the head of the column just as it breasted the shoulder of the jebel there once more was hadd jammed against the limestone cliffs with the emirs palace flying the limp green flag and the fort stark against the sky above it hell colonel george signalled his driver to stop and berrys landrover drew up alongside the column ground to a halt behind us i dont like it the colonel said too quiet between us and the crumbling walls of hadd there wasnt a living soul no sign of sheikh abdullahs askaris no vestige of the camp wed seen two days before even up by the date gardens nothing moved ah the wadi hadd alakhbar as far as the eye could strain through the glare and the mirages was empty of human life the blighters up to something what do you think berry i think wed better be prepared for trouble sir i told you i didnt like the speed with which he saw me the crafty look in his eye the colonel nodded go ahead then the orders were signalled and the column fanned out across the level gravel plain whilst we drove straight to the first well behind us the bedouin scouts leapt from their trucks and spread out over the sand mortars and machineguns ammunition and not a shot fired at us we sat in the landrover roasting by the shattered parapet of the well and the tension mounted with the uncanny silence nothing stirred anywhere a full hour the emir kept us waiting there in the blazing sun he judged it nicely a little longer and colonel georges patience would have been exhausted and then at last life stirred in the muddun town a scattering of figures moving towards us across the flat shelved expanse of gravel that lay between the well and the walls old men and children not an armed man amongst them hes going to play the injured innocent gorde whispered in my ear the old men and the children had closed around us some had empty drinking bowls others goats skins they whined and begged for water as they had been told to do my heart bleeds gorde snorted with contempt ah here he comes through the arched entrance to the town came a figure riding a white camel riding absolutely alone not a single retainer hes clever the colonel muttered there isnt a desert ruler who wouldnt have regarded this as an occasion to parade his full power and to ride a camel when hes got an almost brand new cadillac his eyes were fixed with a puzzled frown on the solitary figure on the slow stately gait of that lone camel he turned abruptly to gorde whats he got up his sleeve something that cadillac was a present from saudi hed surely want to flaunt that in our faces gorde didnt say anything and we sat and waited the crowd fell back the clamouring ceased the emir rode his camel through them and sitting there in the landrover i realized suddenly why he hadnt used his cadillac with set face and without any gesture of greeting he rode his beast right up to us and when he finally halted it the supercilious head was right over us the rubbery lips white with foam dripping saliva on the colonels beret the emir himself towered above us godlike against the burning sky it was extraordinarily effective the man was simply dressed in spotless robes and looked much bigger the features more impressive the curve of the nose more marked he waited in silence for colonel george to greet him instead the colonel barked an order and his driver backed the landrover turning it so that the bonnet faced the emir but it was no good patiently without expression the camel moved resumed the same dominating position and then the emir began to speak it was an address that lasted almost a quarter of an hour the manner of delivery was cold and restrained but underlying the restraint was the hate that filled the man it was there in the thin vibrant tone of his voice in the black gaze of his eyes in every gesture a bitter fury of hatred and that bloody camel slavering over my head seemed the very embodiment of his masters mood gorde whispered the gist of the emirs speech to me it followed a familiar pattern it ignored entirely the unprovoked attack on saraifa the cruel intention behind the blocking of the falajes the murderous slaughter of men driven to desperate action to save life and home instead it dwelt at length on hadds territorial claims these the emir based on a particular period in hadds history a period that went back more than five hundred years he conveniently brushed aside all that had happened in the area since that time he attacked the oil companies for sucking arabias life blood the spittle flew from his mouth as he called them nasrani thieves jackals of the west imperialist bloodsuckers he ignored the fact that without the companies the oil would have remained beneath the sands that the wealth of arabia depended on them that the very arms hed been given had been bought with the royalties they paid and in attacking the oil companies he also attacked britain and america imperialist murderers he called us hes coming to the point now gorde muttered the camel belched a deep rumbling sound that blew a fleck of froth from its lips into my lap the emir leaned forward the dark cruel face bending down towards us murderers he screamed i thought he was going to spit in our faces start the engine colonel george ordered his driver im not standing for any more of this he said something to the emir the man smiled that smile it was curiously excited i call you murderers because you come here armed to protect a murderer he gestured with his hands pointing towards the fort and when colonel george tried to explain davids motives the rough justice of his action in depriving the hadd of water the emir silenced him you do not think it is murder when an arab man is killed what do you say if he is the murderer of a white man one of yourselves he turned raising his body in the saddle shouting and signalling with his hand a closed landrover emerged from hadd the crowd which had drawn in a tight circle round us scattered before it and as it roared past us a figure in arab clothes was thrust out of the back of it a limp rag of a figure battered and covered in blood it hit the sand beside us rolled over once and then lay sprawled face upwards in an undignified heap and as the cloud of dust settled i saw what it was that lay there the dead body of colonel whitaker he had been shot in the face and his head was badly battered his arms broken his clothes were black with blood flies settled in a swarm and i felt suddenly sick you know this man the emir demanded and when colonel george nodded the emir explained that haj whitaker had that morning agreed to go up to the fort and reason with his son what had happened up there he did not say he merely gestured to the body this mans son has murdered my people you say it is not murder look now at that which lies before you and tell me is that murder colonel george sat there his eyes hard his face set he had no answer his own father his voice was shocked and he made no attempt to challenge the emirs version of what had happened you cant be sure i said it was gorde who answered do you think it would have occurred to him to have the body flung at our feet like that if charles had been killed by one of his men he was staring down at the bloody figure lying in the dust his hands clenched then he looked up at the emir and demanded to know where the body had been found and when the emir replied that his men had picked it up at the foot of the cliffs directly below the tower he nodded his head slowly as far as he was concerned that settled it it was very hot there in the sun yet a cold shiver ran through me i was remembering the solitary shot wed heard that morning and into my mind came mrs thomass words it was never dafydd that was going to die colonel george was the first to recover ignoring the body he dealt with the terms on which the fort would be evacuated and his forces withdrawn and when the emir finally agreed he made the prearranged signal to his troops waiting on the jebel alakhbar and withdrew his force into the desert taking whitakers body with him back at our old encampment we found the helicopter gone and one of the trucks belonging to the jebel alakhbar detachment already returned after interviewing the driver colonel george announced david whitaker is apparently still alive the helicopters gone up to bring him out he said it flatly and behind me i heard gorde murmur god help him hed have been better dead the helicopter took off from the fort and when it landed they carried david to the shade of the headquarters truck awning when i saw him i thought for a moment it was all over his face was relaxed the eyes closed the flesh tightdrawn was bloodless it was a deaths head all skull and bone and the skin like parchment but then the eyes flicked open and he saw me the cracked lips smiled and he tried to say something but no words came he was too driedup to speak the eyes closed again and he went into a coma the helicopter had also brought bin suleiman out he was badly wounded and very weak but he was alive only hamid was dead they brought his body down and buried it beside colonel whitakers within sight of the jebel alakhbar gorde stood with bared head and hard frozen eyes as they laid his old friend to rest in his shallow desert grave and ruffini was there sitting on the ground his pencil moving steadily across the pages of the notebook held against his knee the burial over i went to talk to him i wanted to try and persuade him to softpedal the fatal news i was thinking of sue rather than david the boy was a hero and the newspapers avid for news and now the world was going to be told that hed killed his father i was probably the only person who could justify it who understood the provocation the publics reaction would be one of revulsion sue would be torn to bits her life made a hell i touched ruffini on the shoulder about colonel whitaker i said he paused his face creased against the suns glare as he glanced up at me we talk about him later he said and he added it is fantastic the most fantastic story i ever write there is this boy david who by imself has forced the british government to take action and now this man they ave just buried his father who is a great figure in the desert a sort of he clicked his fingers searching for a name it doesnt matter what matter is that he is dead killed by a stupid tyrant a sort of arabian condottiere in a lousy little mud town in the desert you mean you think the emir i checked staring down at him and for what he demanded his mind concentrated on assembling the english phrases he wanted he kill him to blacken his sons name a ridiculous attempt to destroy this heroic young man it is a tragedy a great tragedy and with the death of colonel whitaker it is the end of an epoch in the desert the last great englishman in arabia he bent his head his pencil flying again i stared at him in astonishment hed been there hed understood what the emir had said and he didnt believe him his story would accuse the emir of colonel whitakers murder and because he was the only journalist here the press would carry his version i could only hope that the authorities would leave it at that colonel george took that story with him when he left shortly afterwards in the helicopter he also took david and because of that gorde was left to travel by landrover i was standing beside him as the helicopter took off he turned to me and i can still remember the rasp in his voice as he said if that little bastard of whitakers lives youll have a lot to answer for how do you mean my mouth felt suddenly dry you sent him out here knowing hed killed a man knowing he was a selfdramatizing little gangster fellows like that dont change and patricide is something every society abominates hes a hero now but when the public learns the truth he stared at me his eyes cold and hard charles whitaker was a man in a thousand probably the greatest englishman who ever made the desert his home ive known him since i first came out to arabia and you can rest assured ill see to it that the truth is known he turned abruptly without giving me a chance to say anything and i watched him as he limped across to where berry was organizing his convoy colonel george had placed a landrover at gordes disposal and he left immediately so that i had no opportunity to talk to him and when i finally reached sharjah he was on his way back to england and it was already too late david had been placed under arrest and an official statement had been issued to the press iii the court stands adjourned it was the third day of the trial and david whitaker had gone into the witness box immediately after the lunchtime recess counsel for the defence had taken him through the salient points arising from my evidence with the object of showing his relationship with his father in the best possible light now late in the afternoon he had arrived at the crucial point colonel whitakers visit to fort jebel alakhbar the packed court was very still every eye on the fairhaired boy standing neat and tidy in the box his arm in a sling and the sunburned face looking almost black in contrast with his light tropical suit i would like the court to have a clear picture of your situation on that particular morning counsel glanced down at his papers his hands resting lightly on the desk in front of him by then you had been on the jebel alakhbar seven days is that right yes and there were only two of you left salim ali and hamid were dead grant had gone there was just yourself and bin suleiman and you were both wounded yes had you been attacked during the night no it was some days since theyd made any attempt to take the fort but you were under fire theyd got men lying out in the rocks all round the fort but we were all right as long as we remained in the tower theyd fire a few shots once in a while just to remind us they were there and at night theyd move up to the walls but they didnt bother us much we were pretty used to them by then you see just the trace of a welsh accent to remind the court that this was the same boy who had run wild in cardiff docks the reporters were scribbling furiously this was the big moment and when the court adjourned there would be a rush for the telephone to catch the daily papers before they went to press on the morning in question were there any shots fired other than the shot that killed your father no none did that strike you as unusual i cant remember that i thought about it it was some time since any shots had been fired they were lying quiet you see hoping wed think there was nobody there and get careless but we knew the bastards were there waiting for us so you remained inside the tower of course i hadnt been out of the tower since mr grant came up to talk to me there wasnt any point it was cooler there and the walls were good protection was there any other reason you didnt leave it i tell you man they were lying out there waiting for us i wasnt risking being shot at when there wasnt any point quite so but what im getting at is this wasnt it a fact that you were too weak by then to attempt a descent from the tower well yes i suppose so anyway there wasnt any reason for us to be wasting what little strength we had left to no purpose were you weak because of lack of water or lack of food or was it because you were wounded that you hadnt the strength to leave the tower i tell you there wasnt any point his tone was irritable he didnt seem to understand what his counsel was trying to establish when had you last had any food i cant remember wed some dried camel meat left but it wasnt any use to us we couldnt swallowit we did try and chew it but it was very painful and in the end we didnt bother you couldnt chew because of lack of water yes wed no saliva and our tongues were swollen and quite black our mouths were absolutely dry had you any water left captain berry had given me a water bottle wed finished our own supplies and now that bottle was half empty your situation then was quite desperate pretty desperate i want the court to be absolutely clear about this counsel paused glancing from the judge to the crowded press desks in your opinion how much longer do you think you could have held out in other words and here he spoke slowly and with great emphasis how long before you were dead of thirst david shook his head i cant be certain wed have finished the water bottle that day if wed been left alone we might have stayed alive a few days more you heard the evidence of doctor logan who saw you when you arrived in sharjah he said you were in such a weak condition that he didnt believe you could have lasted more than another twentyfour hours davids head went up that all depends on how urgently you want to stay alive doesnt it id have lasted longer than that but not if theyd attacked us counsel seized on this you say not if theyd attacked you do you mean you were too weak by then to defend yourselves thats about it could you stand i dont know i didnt try could you have lifted a rifle to your shoulder and fired it if theyd attacked us i expect id have managed somehow but you were so weak that it would have required the urgency of an attack to give you the strength to lift even a rifle to your shoulder david hesitated i suppose so he murmured and then in a clearer voice its difficult to explain to you people here but everything was an effort by then everything he repeated quite so and if you couldnt lift a rifle to your shoulder except in a moment of great urgency then youd hardly have had the strength to descend from the tower by that ladder and then climb back up again and pull the ladder objection counsel for the prosecution was on his feet facing the judge the defence is putting words into the witnesss mouth but counsel for the defence had made his point i will rephrase the question then and turning to the witness box again he asked did you at any time on the morning in question and before the trucial oman scouts arrived to take over the fort leave the tower for any purpose whatsoever no sir did you at any time attempt to lower the ladder no the court breathed an audible sigh one more question before we come to the moment of the meeting with your father did you know that the trucial oman scouts would move into the emirate of hadd that day in other words had you any reason to suppose that your ordeal was nearing its end none at all we have the evidence of mr grant that from their position six miles away beyond the hadd border they could see the fort quite clearly through field glasses could you see them in other words could you see that over a dozen vehicles had materialized at that position during the night no as far as you were concerned nothing had altered that morning your situation remained as desperate yes all you knew of what was going on in the world outside was what mr grant had told you two days before thats right counsel paused again consulting his papers now we come to the moment of your fathers arrival at the fort youd no reason to expect him how could i quite so i suppose youve no idea what time it was when he arrived david shook his head my watch had stopped id forgotten to wind it a few days back all i know is the sun had been up some time had you any warning that you were going to receive a visitor there was some shouting an order in arabic not to fire it was given by a man holding a white flag the last time that had happened was when mr grant came with captain berry that was the occasion on which a treacherous attempt had been made on your life and when david nodded counsel added and on that occasion you had taken the precaution of sending bin suleiman to the top of the tower just in case did you take the same precaution this time no why not he was unconscious and you hadnt the strength to climb up there yourself no would you tell the court please what happened when your father arrived well david hesitated his eyes glancing quickly round the courtroom finally he turned towards the judge i thought it was an arab at first one of the emirs men he came in by the main gate and he was dressed in arab clothes you see i didnt recognize him my eyes werent too good but then he stopped just inside the gate and called me by name and said who he was were you surprised to see him david shrugged he was there that was all there was to it and he added no i dont think i was surprised when youre in the state i was you just dont register anything what happened then well he came to the foot of the tower and we talked what about i dont remember he wanted you to abandon the fort didnt he at first he changed his mind then yes what made him change his mind an obstinate look had come into davids face he just changed it thats all was that after youd told your father that your defence of the fort had made headline news back home i dont remember you did tell him that didnt you you did pass on to him this information which you had obtained from mr grant i dont know i expect so was your father surprised and when david didnt answer counsel went on what i want the court to know is whether or not colonel whitaker knew about the newspaper stories of your exploits and the fact that there had been questions in the house the evidence at the moment points to the fact that he couldnt have known before you told him would you agree i really cant say but he must have made some comment shown some reaction i tell you i dont remember i wasnt in a fit state to remember details you were talking to him from one of the embrasures of the tower or from the entrance hole from the embrasure i should have been an easier target if id dragged myself to the entrance hole and i was afraid of getting sniped at and the whole interview was carried on with you in that same position you didnt move at all no where was colonel whitaker standing right below me could you see him yes and when the interview was ended where did he go then i think he moved nearer to the tower away to my right i cant be sure but i lost sight of him towards the clifftop yes and what happened then well a little time passed and then then there was a shot a rifle shot or a pistol shot it was a rifle shot youre certain of that yes and after the shot was there any other sound yes a sound of falling stones thats when i knew hed gone over the cliff what did you do then i dragged myself to the southern embrasure but i couldnt see directly down the cliff face so i didnt know what had happened i tried to call out to him but i dont think my voice made any real sound counsel leaned forward his voice pitched low youve heard a ballistics expert give it as his opinion that your father was killed by a bullet from a pistol not a rifle it was a rifle counsel stared at him and the whole court could see the quandary he was in but the evidence that had gone before had to be disposed of you have also heard dr logans evidence he has said that postmortem examination strongly suggests that the shot that killed your father was fired at close range he too thinks it was a pistol shot how do they know david said almost belligerently they didnt find the bullet did they and they werent there i was and im telling you it was a rifle shot the judge leaned forward i would like to get this quite clear you have said that your condition was such that you cannot remember what passed between you you have in fact left the court with the impression that your powers of perception at that time were at a very low ebb yet on this point of the shot you are quite categorical you say it was a rifle shot yes sir had you a rifle in your hand no sir i didnt fire the shot it was fired by one of those treacherous but the judge stopped him you will kindly confine yourself to answering the questions put to you am i to take it that youre absolutely clear in your mind that the fatal shot was fired from a rifle and not from a pistol yes the murmur of a sigh filled the courtroom they didnt like it the judge sat back nodding to counsel to continue i glanced at sue her face was white she too felt the change of mood in the room it was obvious that david was withholding vital evidence about what had passed between his father and himself and hed been altogether too determined to put the blame for his fathers death on the emirs men i heard the man next to me whisper to his companion he hasnt a hope if he goes on like this counsel stood for a moment staring down at his papers undecided whether to pursue the matter further finally he lifted his head and faced the witness box again suppose we consider for a moment that you were in no fit state to be certain on this point and that it was in fact a pistol shot that killed your father had you a pistol david stared at him sullen and whitefaced you know i had that ballistic chaps already given evidence that he examined it quite a sixchambered revolver with two rounds still left in the chambers and you had some spare rounds loose in a leather bag exactly how many rounds had you fired with that weapon just the four i didnt use any of the spare rounds why a rifle was more useful i only used the revolver once that was on the night mr grant left they got pretty close then and when id emptied the magazine of my rifle i used the revolver and you fired four rounds with it that night yes i see counsel paused and then speaking very slowly he said if we accept the medical evidence based on dr logans postmortem following the exhumation of your fathers body and the evidence of the ballistics expert then the possibility of your father having been killed by one of the emirs men is ruled out entirely he leaned forward staring at david i want you to be quite clear on this point there remain then only two possibilities either you killed your father or he killed himself a long pause this time and then the question put bluntly did colonel whitaker kill himself he hadnt got a rifle he wasnt armed are you sure he might have had a pistol concealed under his robes and then counsel put the question again trying for the way out pressing the issue in an attempt to give david the one chance that might save him did colonel whitaker shoot himself or did he not david stared at him his eyes unnaturally big in his dark face and then his mouth opening slowly and the courtroom hushed some sixth sense warning us all that he was about to close the door on this one hope of acquittal and finally the words ive told you before he was killed by a rifle shot fired by one of the emirs men and then turning from counsel towards the court he added in a firm clear voice does anyone imagine my father was the sort of man whod kill himself that more than anything else settled it in the minds of the court for he was voicing what everyone there felt and after that there was nothing counsel could really do to help him the defence rests he sat down abruptly and the stillness in the courtroom was absolute the judge spoke then his thin tired voice sounding remote and detached it is almost fivethirty he was leaning slightly forward and i gather there are certain gentlemen here who have deadlines to catch the dry humour produced an easing of tension a little whisper of relieved laughter i intend to adjourn now until tomorrow but before i do so i think it is my duty to address a word to the prisoner your counsel has advised you to go into the witness box and you have elected so to do rightly in my view since otherwise the court would have no means of knowing what happened on the morning of your fathers death the voice was warmer now almost fatherly today you have been answering questions put to you by your own counsel when the court resumes tomorrow however it will be the prosecutions turn to crossexamine you and i must warn you that he is likely to question you most closely on what passed between you and your father the witness george grant has shown in his evidence that there was a great deal of misunderstanding not to say friction between the two of you i feel it my duty to warn you therefore that it will greatly prejudice your case if you refuse to tell the court what passed between you and i would ask you to take advantage of the adjournment to consider very carefully your attitude here justice is dependent on the evidence of witnesses you are now a witness you would be wise not to withhold from whatever motive vital evidence for a moment he remained leaning forward staring at the prisoner then he picked up his gavel and rapped the court stands adjourned until ten oclock tomorrow morning the court rose the judge bowed and the rush for the doors began still standing in the box david glanced slowly round the courtroom he was sweating and he looked tired for a brief moment his gaze rested on his sister and he gave her an uncertain almost apologetic smile then police guards closed round him and he was lost to view beyond the milling heads of the crowd i suppose the judge meant it kindly sues hand was on my arm and i could feel her trembling slightly but david wont change his mind and tomorrow the prosecution will make a strong case out of his silence wont they she sounded nervously exhausted her voice tired it wont look good i said and it was a mistake wasnt it trying to blame it on one of the emirs men yes no point in pretending it wasnt a mistake the medical evidence is against it the ballistics expert too we passed out into the sunlight and the humid heat of bahrain engulfed us like a steam bath the street was crowded with cars packed with people a solid mass of bahrainis gorde was waiting beside his car and he called to me a word with you grant he took me aside that boys going to be convicted if somebody doesnt persuade him to talk i thought you were behind this witchhunt i said angrily i made a statement but i hadnt all the facts had i he stared at me accusingly as though i were to blame for that now that ive heard your evidence seen the way hes behaving in the witness box he hesitated and then turned abruptly towards the car get in grant you too miss thomas i want to talk to you and as the driver nosed the car through the crowds he turned to sue and said i think i could arrange for you to see your brother tonight she gave a hopeless little shrug it wouldnt do any good i think hed rather be convicted you see than have the world know that colonel whitaker that legendary figure of the desert committed suicide she was very near to tears and she added with a hint of wildness in her voice just because his fathers dead all davids feeling for him the heroworship my mother fed him when he was a kid has returned magnified a thousand times by the friction there was between them when he was alive nothing that i can say will make him change his mind i know that i see gorde didnt seem surprised then we must think of something else nobodys happy about the situation least of all the authorities he put his hand out and his gnarled fingers rested for a moment on sues arm miss thomas your father was a strange man and hed been a long time in the desert a hell of a long time and alone he spoke with surprising gentleness he was a great man in his way you should be proud of him she stared at him dryeyed her face white well im not i dont care about him to me it doesnt matter a damn whether he killed himself or was killed by somebody else hes dead all i care about is david gorde sighed would it help you to understand him if i told you that he tried to join david in that tower that david either couldnt or wouldnt lower the ladder to him he actually got as far as the entrance hole but couldnt pull himself in how do you know bin suleiman after he left hospital he disappeared ive had men scouring the desert for him ever since they brought him in two days ago your brother says he was unconscious so he was most of the time you mean he regained consciousness i asked and when gorde nodded i thought hed found the witness who could save david why didnt you notify davids counsel then because it wouldnt help bin suleiman heard them talking but he didnt know who it was david was talking to and he didnt know what they were saying they were talking in english and the fact that charles climbed up to the entrance hole which is the only material fact he can add to the evidence would only operate against david bin suleiman thought it was one of the emirs men trying to get in and he reached for his rifle the effort or more probably the pain of movement caused him to lose consciousness again so that he knows nothing of what happened after that but its sufficient to cause you to change your mind about davids guilt i said why oh its not that thats only a fragment of the picture thats been building up in my mind one of the first things i did was to send entwhistle down to take over at charless camp on the hadd border he reported the rig gutted the seismological truck burned out the place deserted he had the sense to go on to saraifa where he had a talk with some of charless men that raiding party you saw heading into the desert towards the rig attacked the camp at dawn they came in firing their guns and when theyd got hold of charles the emirs secretary had him bound to a camel and made him sit there whilst they set fire to everything when they started back towards hadd there wasnt a thing left that they hadnt destroyed visualizing the scene i began to understand how desperate whitakers mood must have been he said he had some sort of hold over the emir i murmured i can even remember his words he said i know that little emir inside out probably he did certainly well enough to know that the man was in a vicious mood and prepared to go to any lengths i sent a couple of the best bedouins weve got on the payroll into hadd a month ago they reported that when he reached hadd the emir gave charles the choice either he brought his son down from the fort alive or dead or hed be taken out into the empty quarter and left there to die didnt it occur to him that whitaker might throw in his lot with his son i asked oh it was more subtle than that the emir also thought he knew his man that was why he ordered the destruction of the rig he offered to finance charless drilling operations once his son was out of the way and the jebel alakhbar in his hands thats the story anyway but surely the defence had a right to know rumours gorde growled it wasnt evidence besides how could i be sure what had happened till i knew the facts i wanted your evidence and david whitakers evidence he shrugged even now i cant be sure but you think you know what happened sue was leaning forward staring at him yes i think i know now i think charles realized after talking to his son that what hed regarded as a useless demonstration had in fact a chance of succeeding he wanted to join david then but probably he hadnt told his son what the alternative was and david refused to lower the ladder charles tried to get into the tower and failed and then he stood on the edge of the cliff looking down on to hadd knowing that if he went back to the emir hed be going to his death its a slow death to die of thirst and it would serve no purpose whereas to die quickly by a bullet i suppose hed been allowed to carry a pistol with him and ive no doubt he thought that a dramatic end like that he sighed hed nothing to live for any more the rig destroyed his son doing what he might have done himself but he could still do something he could still die and like that tumbling down from that cliff top the news of his death would be spread by camel men from waterhole to waterhole he still had a great reputation amongst the bedou and his death would be attributed to the emirs treachery i suppose he thought it might provoke a desert rising against the tyrant he hesitated and then he gave a little shrug im just guessing thats all i knew charles very well and that i think was what was in his mind he looked at sue then thats why miss thomas i think you should be proud of your father and he was right in a way his death did influence the situation if he hadnt died like that the emir might not have agreed to colonel georges terms there might have been fighting and god knows where it would have ended you must tell this to the court sue said but he shook his head its no good miss thomas the judge trying this case has been brought out from england he couldnt begin to understand the sort of man charles was the sweep of his vision the almost arab subtlety of his mind and the only absolute proof the pistol with one bullet fired i dont possess my men searched the ground where his body was picked up but they couldnt find that or anything else that has a bearing on the case doubtless the emir had it destroyed since he wanted to show charles as a defenceless man murdered by his son no he said quietly this is a matter for action now he turned and ordered the driver to head for my hotel well drop grant and then youll come on with me miss thomas ill arrange for you to see your brother tonight when you do give him this he pulled his wallet out of his pocket and removed a thick wad of east african notes therell be a message too he handed the notes to sue she stared at him too startled for a moment to say anything and then she burst out i dont know what youre planning to do sir philip but whatever it is youre not doing it for david youre doing it because you want him back in saraifa youre signing a concession and you want to be sure youll be drilling how do you know were signing a concession gorde barked in that peculiar rasping voice of his alex erkhard knows a few other executives but thats all how the devil has it got to your ears its true then she turned to me her voice tired in court when you were giving evidence i sat next to that girlfriend of davids she told me shed got it from one of the oilmen at the almenza club and she said she was telling me because if things went badly for david i might be able to make use of it she glanced at gorde and there was suddenly a glint of that irrepressible celtic humour in her eyes she thought youd need david alive and free gorde caught the glint and the hard battered features relaxed in a smile she sounds a clever girl whats her name tessa i said and shes a hostess at the almenza he nodded ill remember that but please understand this miss thomas free your brother could be very useful to us i admit that arabs respect force particularly the force of a strong and fearless personality the emir is afraid of him and in saraifa hed be worth more to us than a hundred armed men we dont want any more trouble on that border but i promise you this anything i can do will be done for one reason only because im satisfied now that hes innocent of course sir philip sues voice the little smile on her lips were tinged with irony but i noticed also that her eyes were alight with excitement the car slid to a stop we had reached my hotel you get out here grant im taking miss thomas on with me gordes hand gripped my arm dont try and get in touch with her tonight and dont talk to anybody what weve said here is between ourselves understand i nodded and got out the car drove off then and i went into the hotel it was full of newspaper men they crowded round me as soon as i entered what did i think of david whitakers chances was he going to talk i told them id no comment to make and escaped to my room i had my dinner brought up to me read the papers which were full of the trial and went to bed early to this day i dont know what part gorde played in the events of that night sue saw david shortly after ten oclock she was allowed to see him alone and she said afterwards that he looked tired at first though he was quite cheerful she gave him the money and also gordes message and after that the tiredness seemed to drop from him the message was simply bin suleiman is in bahrain he and another bedouin will be waiting by the side entrance all night he asked her a lot of questions then about gordes attitude to him and what he thought had happened up there in the fort and when she had answered them all he seemed anxious for her to go his eyes very bright his manner tense almost nervous it was hot in my room and i didnt sleep very well my nerves were on edge and i kept worrying about sue and then just as it was beginning to get light i heard footsteps in the corridor outside and the door of the next room was flung open muffled conversation and the movements of a man dressing in a hurry i looked at my watch it was just after four i got dressed and went down by then the hotel was in a ferment reporters and cameramen trying to telephone for cars the word escape on everybodys lips within half an hour the hotel was deserted i got one of the houseboys to bring me some coffee and sat over it smoking endless cigarettes waiting and wondering what had happened in less than an hour the first of the newspapermen were drifting back and it was official david had escaped i never got the details absolutely clear i doubt whether anyone did for the thing was hushed up and there was no enquiry of any sort there was a lot of talk about a force of bedou from the desert but that was clearly a story invented by his guards to cover themselves the only arab definitely implicated was bin suleiman and then only because a strolling reporter happened to recognize him loitering outside the walls faithful companion rescues alakhbar hero ran the headlines of that particular newspaper but it was more subtly managed than that though whether david bribed his guards to unlock the doors or whether it was all arranged by some outside agency i dont know the fact is that david was able to walk out of the place and from that point it must have been very carefully organized for when his guards raised the alarm at hours he had completely disappeared there were rumours that he was being hidden in a rich merchants house that he was lying up disguised as an arab in a house on muharraq that he had been got away in a dhow the whole of bahrain seethed with rumours but nobody knew anything definite and neither sue nor i dared go and see tessa who was the one person we both thought might know where hed been taken the newspapermen stayed another twentyfour hours and then they were suddenly gone like a cloud of locusts moving on the story dead and all gorde would say when i went to see him was i dont know anything and i wouldnt tell you if i did but this way its a lot easier for everybody the heavylidded eyes stared at me tell his sister not to worry i expect shell hear from him in due course we were married in a registry office in cardiff four months later and when we got back from our honeymoon there was a letter waiting for us it came in a parcel containing a silver coffee pot very intricately worked the letter was headed saraifa a mutual friend of ours in godco has sent me word that you two are getting married congratulations i thought youd both like something from arabia as a wedding present it should have been native work from saraifa but i came to the conclusion that only the best would do the coffee pot comes from riyadh by courtesy of godco and is as good as any arab potentate possesses remember me sometimes when you use it the situation here has settled down i have a small force under my command composed mainly of men of the wahiba and the rashid and the money for its upkeep is provided all five falaj channels are running with water and we hope within about a month to have the first of the old channels back in use the concession agreement has provided the funds and we are running the channel right through the oasis to irrigate the camel thorn well be planting as a break against the sands of the empty quarter as soon as you have time i want you both to come out here for a holiday i think i can promise you more comfort than you had last time and therell be plenty for you to see come next winter the weather is perfect at that time of the year well have struck oil by then and if its all that we hope it will be called the whitaker oilfield not much news except that the emir has invited sheikh mahommed and myself to go hawking we shall go in force exchange presents and i hope live in peace thereafter god bless you both affectionately the brother of sheikh khalid the end
