chapter her name was erin like her country and like her country she was a maze of contradictions rebellion and poetry passion and moodiness she was strong enough to fight for her beliefs stubborn enough to fight on after a cause was lost and generous enough to give whatever she had she was a woman with soft skin and a tough mind she had sweet dreams and towering ambitions her name was erin erin mckinnon and she was nervous as a cat it was true that this was only the third time in her life shed been in the airport at cork or any airport for that matter still it wasnt the crowds or the noise that made her jumpy the fact was she liked hearing the announcements of planes coming and going she liked thinking about all the people going places london new york paris through the thick glass she could watch the big sleek planes rise up nose first and imagine their destinations perhaps one day shed board one herself and experience that stomachfluttering anticipation as the plane climbed up and up she shook her head it wasnt a plane going up that had her nervous now but one coming in and it was due any minute erin caught herself before she dragged a hand through her hair it wouldnt do a bit of good to be poking and pulling at herself after thirty seconds more she shifted her bag from hand to hand then tugged at her jacket she didnt want to look disheveled or tense or poor she added as she ran a hand down her skirt to smooth it thank god her mother was so clever with a needle the deep blue of the skirt and matching jacket was flattering to her pale complexion the cut and style were perhaps a bit conservative for erins taste but the color did match her eyes she wanted to look competent capable and had even managed to tame her unruly hair into a tidy coil of dark red the style made her look older she thought she hoped it made her look sophisticated too shed toned down the dusting of freckles and had deepened the color of her lips eye makeup had been applied with a careful hand and she wore nannys old and lovely gold crescents at her ears the last thing she wanted was to look plain and dowdy the poor relation even the echo of the phrase in her head caused her teeth to clench pity even sympathy were emotions she wanted none of she was a mckinnon and perhaps fortune hadnt smiled on her as it had her cousin but she was determined to make her own way here they were she thought and had to swallow a ball of nerves in her throat erin watched the plane that had brought them from curragh taxi toward the gate the small sleek plane people of wealth and power could afford to charter she could imagine what it would be like to sit inside to drink champagne or nibble on something exotic imagination had always been hers in quantity all shed lacked was the means to make what she could imagine come true an elderly woman stepped off the plane first leading a small girl by the hand the woman had cloudwhite hair and a solid sturdy build beside her the little girl looked like a pixie carrottopped and compact the moment theyd stepped to the ground a boy of five or six leaped off after them even through the thick glass erin could all but hear the womans scolding she snatched his hand with her free one and he flashed her a wicked grin erin felt immediate kinship if shed gauged the age right that would be brendon adelias oldest the girl who held the womans hand and clutched a battered doll in the other would be keeley younger by a year or so the man came next the man erin recognized as travis grant her cousins husband of seven years owner of thoroughbreds and master of royal meadows he was tall and broadshouldered and was laughing down at his son who waited impatiently on the tarmac the smile was nice she thought the kind that made a woman look twice without being sure whether to relax or brace herself erin had met him once briefly when hed brought his wife back to ireland four years before quietly domineering shed thought then the kind of man a woman could depend on as long as she could stand toetotoe with him on his hip he carried another child a boy with hair as dark and thick as his fathers he was grinning too but not down at his brother and sister his face was tilted up toward the sky from which hed just come travis handed him down then turned and held out a hand as adelia stepped through the opening the sun struck her hair with arrows of light the rich chestnut shone around her face and shoulders she too was laughing even with the distance erin could see the glow she was a small woman when travis caught her by the waist and lifted her to the ground she didnt reach his shoulder he kept his arm around her erin noticed not so much possessive as protective of her and perhaps of the child that was growing inside her while erin watched adelia tilted her face touched a hand to her husbands cheek and kissed him not like a longtime wife erin thought but like a lover a little ripple of envy moved through her erin didnt try to avoid it she never attempted to avoid any of her feelings but let them come let them race to the limit whatever the consequences and why shouldnt she envy dee erin asked herself adelia cunnane the little orphan from skibbereen had not only pulled herself up by the bootstraps but had tugged hard enough to land on top of the pile more power to her erin thought she intended to do the same herself erin squared her shoulders and started to step forward as another figure emerged from the plane another servant she thought then took a long thorough look no this man would serve no one he leaped lightly to the ground with a slim unlit cigar clamped between his teeth slowly even warily he looked around as a cat might she thought a cat that had just leaped from cliff to cliff she couldnt see his eyes for he wore tinted glasses but she had the quick impression that they would be sharp intense and not entirely comfortable to look into he was as tall as travis but leaner sparer tough the adjective came to her as she pursed her lips and continued to stare he bent down to speak to one of the children and the move was lazy but not careless his dark hair was straight and long enough to hang over the collar of his denim shirt he wore boots and faded jeans but she rejected the idea that he was a farmer he didnt look like a man who tilled the soil but like one who owned it what was a man like this doing traveling with her cousins family another relative she wondered and shifted uncomfortably it didnt matter who he was erin checked the pins in her hair found two loose and shoved them into place if he was some relation of travis grants then that was fine but he didnt look like kin of her cousins husband the coloring might be similar but any resemblance ended there the stranger had a rawboned sharpedged look to him she remembered the picture books in catechism class and the drawings of satan better to rule in hell than to serve in heaven yes for the first time a smile moved on her lips he looked like a man whod have similar sentiments taking a deep breath erin moved forward to greet her family the boy brendon came first barreling through the doorway with one shoe untied and eyes alight with curiosity the whitehaired women came in behind him moving with surprising speed stand still you scamp im not going to lose track of you again i just want to see hannah there was a laugh in his voice and no contrition at all when she caught his hand in hers youll see soon enough no need to worry your mother to death keeley you stay close now i will the little girl looked around as avidly as her brother but seemed more content to stay in the same place then she spotted erin there she is thats our cousin erin just like the picture without a hint of reserve the girl crossed over and smiled youre our cousin erin arent you im keeley momma said youd be wailing for us aye im erin charmed erin bent down to catch the little girls chin in her hand nerves vanished into genuine pleasure and the last time i saw you you were just a wee thing all bundled in a blanket against the rain and bawling fit to wake the dead keeleys eyes widened she talks just like momma she announced hannah come see she talks just like momma miss mckinnon hannah kept one hand firmly on brendons shoulder and offered the other its nice to meet you im hannah blakely your cousins housekeeper housekeeper erin thought as she put her hand in hannahs weathered one the cunnanes shed known might have been housekeepers but theyd never had one welcome to ireland and youd be brendon ive been to ireland before he said importantly but this time i flew the plane did you now she saw her cousin in him the pixielike features and deep green eyes hed be a handful she thought as her mother claimed adelia had always been well youre all grown up since i saw you last im the oldest bradys the baby now erin she glanced over in time to see adelia rush forward even heavy with child she moved lightly and when she wound her arms around erin there was strength in them the recognition came strongly family to family roots to roots oh erin its so good to be back so good to see you let me look at you she hadnt changed a bit erin thought adelia would be nearly thirty now but she looked years younger her complexion was smooth and flawless glowing against the glossy mane of hair she still wore long and loose the pleasure in her face was so real so vital that erin felt it seeping through her own reserve you look wonderful dee americas been good for you and the prettiest girl in skibbereens become a beautiful woman oh erin she kissed both her cousins cheeks laughed and kissed them again you look like home with erins hand still held tightly in hers she turned you remember travis of course its good to see you again youve grown up in four years he kissed her cheek in turn you didnt meet brady the last time no i didnt the child kept an arm around his fathers neck and eyed erin owlishly faith hes the image of you its a handsome boy you are cousin brady brady smiled then turned to bury his face in his fathers neck and shy adelia commented stroking a hand down his hair unlike his da erin its so kind of you to offer to meet us and take us to the inn we dont often get visitors ive got the minibus you know from the last time you came that renting a car is tricky so ill be leaving it with you while youre here while she spoke erin felt an itch at the base of her neck a tingle or a warning deliberately she turned and stared back at the leanfaced man shed seen step off the plane erin this is burke adelia placed a hand on her skirt at the stirrings within her womb burke logan my cousin erin mckinnon mr logan erin said with a slight nod determined not to flinch at her own reflection in his mirrored glasses miss mckinnon he smiled slowly then clamped his cigar between his teeth again she still couldnt see his eyes but had the uneasy feeling that the glasses were no barrier to what he saw im sure youre tired she said to adelia but kept her gaze stubbornly on burkes the bus is right out front ill take you out then well deal with the luggage burke kept himself just a little apart as they walked through the small terminal he preferred it that way the better to observe and figure angles just now he was figuring erin mckinnon a tidy little package he mused watching the way her long athletic legs moved beneath her conservative skirt neat as a pin and nervous as a filly at the starting gate just what kind of race did she intend to run he wondered he knew snatches of the background from conversations on the trip from the states and from curragh to this little spot on the map the mckinnons and cunnanes werent first cousins as near as could be figured adelias mother and the mother of the very interesting erin mckinnon had been third cousins who had grown up on neighboring farms burke smiled as erin looked uneasily over her shoulder in his direction if adelia cunnane grant figured that made her and the mckinnons family he wouldnt argue for himself he spent more time avoiding family connections than searching them out if he didnt stop staring at her like that he was going to get a piece of her mind erin told herself as she slid the van into gear the luggage was loaded the children chattering and she had to keep her wits about her to navigate out of the airport she could see him in the rearview mirror legs spread out in the narrow aisle one arm tossed over the worn seat and his eyes on her try as she might she couldnt concentrate on adelias questions about her family as she wound the van onto the road she listened with half an ear and gave her cousin the best answers she could everyone was fine the farm was doing well enough as she began to relax behind the wheel she dug deep for bits and pieces of gossip still he kept staring at her let him then she decided the man obviously had the manners of a plow mule and was no concern of hers stubbornly avoiding another glance in the rearview mirror she jabbed another loose pin back in her hair she had questions of her own erin expertly avoided the worst of the bumps on the road and trained her eyes straight ahead the first of them would be who the hell was this burke logan still she smiled on cue and assured her cousin again that her family was fit and fine so cullens not married yet cullen despite her determination erins gaze had drifted back to the mirror and burke she cursed herself no much to my mothers regret hes still single he goes into dublin now and again to sing his songs and play she hit a rough patch that sent the van vibrating im sorry its all right turning her head she studied adelia with genuine concern are you sure im wondering if you should be traveling at all im healthy as one of traviss horses in a habitual gesture adelia put a hand on her rounded belly and ive months to go before theyre born they twins this time the smile lit up her face ive been hoping twins erin repeated under her breath not sure whether she should be amazed or amused adelia shifted into a more comfortable position glancing back she saw that her two youngest were dozing and that brendon was putting up a courageous if failing battle to keep his eyes open ive always wanted a big family like yours erin grinned at her as the van putted into the village it looks like youre going to match it and may the sweet lord have mercy on you with a chuckle adelia shifted again to absorb the sights and sounds of the village she remembered from childhood the small buildings were still neat if a bit rough around the edges patches of grass were deep and green shimmering against dark brown dirt the sign on the village pub the shamrock creaked and groaned in a breeze that tasted of rain from the sea she could almost smell it and remembered it easily here the cliffs were sheer and towering slicing down to a wild sea she could remember the times shed stood on the rock watching the fishing boats seeing them come in with their days catch to dry their nets and cool dry throats at the pub the talk here was of fishing and farming of babies and sweethearts it was home adelia rested a hand against the open window and looked out it was home a way of life a place shed never been able to close out of her heart there was a wagon filled with hay its color no brighter its scent no sweeter than that of the hay in her own stables in america but this was ireland and her heart had never stopped looking back here it hasnt changed erin eased the vehicle to a stop and glanced around she knew every square inch of the village and every farm for a hundred miles around in truth shed never known anything else did you expect it would nothing ever changes here theres odonnellys the dry goods dee stepped out of the van foolishly she wanted to have her feet on the ground of her youth she wanted to fill her lungs with the air of skibbereen is he still there the old goat will die behind the counter still counting his last pence with a laugh dee took brady from travis and cuddled him as he yawned and settled against her shoulder aye then he hasnt changed either travis you see the church there wed come in every sunday for mass old father finnegan would drone on and on does he still erin erin slipped the keys of the van in the pocket of her purse he died dee better than a year ago because the light went out of her cousins eyes erin lifted a hand to her cheek he was more than eighty if you remember and died quietly in his sleep life went on she knew and people passed out of it whether you wanted them to or not dee glanced back at the church it would never seem exactly the same again he buried mother and da i cant forget how kind he was to me weve a young priest now erin began briskly sent from cork a hellraiser he is and not a soul sleeps through one of his sermons put the fear of god into michael ryan so the man comes sober to mass every sunday morning she turned to help with the luggage and slammed solidly into burke he put a hand on her shoulder as if to steady her but it lingered too long i beg your pardon she couldnt stop her chin from tilting forward or her eyes from spitting at him he only smiled my fault grabbing two hefty cases he swung them out of the van why dont you take dee and the kids in travis ill deal with this normally travis wouldnt have left another with the bulk of the work but he knew his wifes strength was flagging he also knew she was stubborn and the only way to get her into bed for a nap was to put her there himself thanks ill take care of checking in erin well see you and your family tonight theyll be here on impulse she kissed dees cheek youll rest now otherwise mother will fuss and drive you mad that i can promise do you have to go now couldnt you come in ive some things to see to go on now or your children will be asleep in the street ill see you soon over brandons protest hannah bundled them inside erin turned to grip another pair of cases by the handles and began unloading it passed through her mind that expensive clothes must weigh more when she found herself facing burke again theres just a few more she muttered and deliberately breezed by him inside the inn was dim but far from quiet the excitement of having visitors from america had kept the small staff on their toes all week wood had been polished floors had been scrubbed even now old mrs malloy was leading dee up the stairs and keeping up a solid stream of reminiscence the children were cooed over and hot tea and soda bread were offered deciding shed left her charges in good hands erin walked outside again the day was cool and clear the early clouds had long since been blown away by the westerly wind so that the light as it often was in ireland was luminescent and pearly erin took a moment to study the village that had so fascinated her cousin it was ordinary slow quiet filled with workingmen and women and often smelling of fish from almost any point in town you could see the small harbor where the boats came in with their daily catch the storefronts were kept neat that was a matter of pride the doors were left unlocked that was a matter of custom there was no one there who didnt know her no one she didnt know whatever secrets there were were never secrets for long but were passed out like small treasures to be savored and sighed over god she wanted to see something else before her life was done she wanted to see big cities where life whirled by fast and hot and anonymous she wanted to walk down a street where no one knew who she was and no one cared just once just once in her life she wanted to do something wild and impulsive that wouldnt echo back to her on the tongues of family and neighbors just once the van door slammed and jolted her back to reality again she found herself looking at burke logan theyre all settled then she asked struggling to be polite looks like he leaned back against the van with his ankles crossed he pulled out a lighter and lit his cigar he never smoked around adelia out of respect for her condition his eyes never left erins not much family resemblance between you and mrs grant is there it was the first time hed spoken more than two words at a time erin noted that his accent wasnt like traviss his words came more slowly as if he saw no reason to hurry them theres the hair he continued when erin didnt speak but hers is more like traviss prize chestnut colt and yours he took another puff as he deliberated yours is something like the mahogany stand in my bedroom he grinned the cigar still clamped between his teeth i thought it was mighty pretty when i bought it thats a lovely thought mr logan but im not a horse or a table reaching into her pocket she held out the keys ill be leaving these with you then instead of taking them he simply closed his hand over hers cradling the keys between them his palm was hard and rough as the rocks in the cliffs that dropped toward the sea he enjoyed the way she held her ground the way she lifted her brow more in disdain than offense is there something else youre wanting mr logan ill give you a lift he said simply its not necessary she clenched her teeth and nodded as two of the towns busiest gossips passed behind her the evening news would have erin mckinnon holding hands with a stranger in the street sure as faith ive only to ask for a ride home to get one youve got one already with his hand still on hers he pushed away from the van i told travis id see to it after releasing her hand he gestured toward the door dont worry ive nearly got the hang on driving on the wrong side of the road its you who drive on the wrong side after only a brief hesitation erin climbed in the day was passing her by and shed have to make every minute count just to catch up burke settled behind the wheel and turned the key in the ignition youre losing your pins he said mildly erin reached behind her and shoved them into place as he drove out of the village youll take the left fork when you come to it after that its only four or five kilometers erin folded her hands deciding shed granted him enough conversation pretty country burke commented glancing out at the green windswept hills there were blackthorns bent a bit from the continual stream of the westerly breeze heather grew in a soft purple cloud while in the distance the mountains rose dark and eerie in the light youre close to the sea close enough dont you like americans with her hands still folded primly she turned to look at him i dont like men who stare at me burke tapped his cigar ash out the window that would narrow the field considerably the men i know have manners mr logan he liked the way she said his name with just a hint of spit in it too bad i was taught to take a good long look at something that interested me im sure you consider that a compliment just an observation this the fork aye she drew a long breath knowing she had no reason to set her temper loose and every reason to hold it do you work for travis no he grinned as the van shimmied over ruts you might say travis and i are associates he liked the smell here the rich wet scent of ireland and the warm earthy scent of the woman beside him i own the farm that borders his you race horses she lifted a brow again compelled to study him at the moment erins lips pursed as she considered she could picture him at the track with the noise and the smells of the horses try as she might she couldnt put him behind a desk balancing accounts and ledgers traviss farm is quite successful his lips curved again is that your way of asking about mine her chin angled as she looked away its certainly none of my concern no its not but i do well enough i wasnt born into it like travis but i find it suits me for now theyd take you back with them if you asked at first it didnt sink in then her lips parted in surprise as she turned to him again i recognize a restless soul when i see one burke blew out smoke so that it trailed through the window and disappeared youre straining at the bit to get out of this little smudge on the map though if you ask me it has its charm no one asked you true enough but its hard not to notice when you stand on the curb and look around as though you wished the whole village to hell thats not true the guilt rose in her because for a moment just a moment shed come close to wishing it so all right well alter that to you wishing yourself anywhere else i know the feeling irish you dont know what i feel you dont know me at all better than you think he murmured feeling trapped stifled smothered she said nothing this time looking at the same space you saw the day you were born and wondering if its the last thing youll see before you die wondering why you dont walk out stick out your thumb and head whichever way the winds blowing how old are you erin mckinnon what he was saying hit too close to the bone for comfort im twentyfive and what of it i was five years younger when i stuck my thumb out he turned to her but again she saw only her own reflection cant say i ever regretted it well its happy i am for you mr logan now if youll slow down the lanes there just pull to the side i can walk from here suit yourself when he stopped the van he put a hand on her arm before she could climb out he wasnt sure why hed offered to drive her or why hed started this line of conversation he was following a hunch as he had for most of his life i know ambition when i see it because it looks back at me out of the mirror most mornings some consider it a sin ive always thought of it as a blessing what was it about him that made her throat dry up and her nerves stretch have you a point mr logan i like your looks erin id hate to see them wrinkled up with discontent he grinned again and tipped an invisible hat top of the morning to you unsure whether she was running from him or her own demons erin got out of the van slammed the door and hurried down the lane chapter she had a great deal to think about erin sat through dinner at the inn with her family talking on top of each other with laughter rolling into laughter voices were raised to be heard over the clatter of tableware the scrape of chair legs the occasional shout scents were a mixture of good hot food and whiskey the lights had been turned up high in celebration the group filled mrs malloys dining room at the inn but wasnt so very much bigger than a sunday supper at the farm erin ate little herself not because one of her brothers seemed to interrupt constantly to have her pass this or that but because she couldnt stop thinking about what burke had said to her that afternoon she was dissatisfied though she didnt like the idea that a stranger could see it as easily as her family had always overlooked it years before shed convinced herself it wasnt wrong to be so how could it be wrong to feel what was so natural true shed been taught that envy was a sin but damn it all she wasnt a saint and wouldnt choose to be one the envy she felt for dee sitting cozily beside her husband felt healthy not sinful after all it wasnt as if she wished her cousin didnt have it was only that she wished she had as well she doubted a body burned in hell for wishes but she didnt think they grew wings for them either in truth she was glad the grants had come back to visit for a few days she could listen to their stories of america and picture it she could ask questions and imagine the big stone house dee lived in now and almost catch glimpses of the excitement and power of the racing world when they left again everything would settle back to routine but not forever erin promised herself no not forever in a year maybe two she would have saved enough and then it would be off to dublin shed get a job in some big office and have a flat of her own of her very own no one was going to stop her her lips started to curve at the thought but then her gaze met burkes across the table he wasnt wearing those concealing glasses now she almost wished he was theyd been disturbing but not nearly as disturbing as his eyes dark gray intense eyes a wolf would have eyes like that smoky and patient and cunning he had no business looking at her like that she thought then stubbornly stared right back at him the noise and confusion of the table continued around them but she lost track of it was it the amusement in his eyes that drew her or the arrogance perhaps it was because both added up to a peculiar kind of knowledge she wasnt sure but she felt something for him at that moment something she knew she shouldnt feel and was even more certain shed regret an irish rose burke thought he wasnt sure hed ever seen one but was certain they would have thorns thick ones with sharp edges an irish rose a wild rose wouldnt be fragile or require careful handling it would be sturdy strong and stubborn enough to grow through briers it was a flower he thought he could respect he liked her family they would be called salt of the earth he supposed simple but not simpleminded apparently their farm did well enough as long as they worked seven days a week mary mckinnon had a dressmaking business on the side but seemed more interested in discussing children with dee than fashion the brothers were fair except for the oldest cullen who had the looks of a black irish warrior and the voice of a poet unless burke missed his guess erin had her softest spot there throughout the meal he watched her curious to see what other soft spots he might discover by the time dinner was over burke was glad hed let travis talk him into an extra few days in ireland the trip had been profitable the visit to the track at curragh educational and now it seemed it was time to mix business with a little pleasure youll play for us wont you cullen adelia was already reaching across the table to grip erins oldest brothers hand for old times sake hell take little enough persuading mary mckinnon put in youd best clear a space she gestured to her two youngest sons its only fitting that we dance off a meal like that i just happen to have my pipe cullen reached in his vest pocket and drew out the slim reed he stood a big man with broad shoulders and lean hips the fingers of his workingmans hands slid over the holes as he lifted the instrument to his lips it surprised burke that such a big roughlooking man could make such delicate music he settled back in his chair savored the kick of his irish whiskey and watched mary mckinnon placed her hand in her youngest sons and without seeming to move at all set her feet in time to the music it seemed a very restrained dance to burke with a complicated pattern of heels and toes and shuffles then the pace began to pick up slowly almost unnoticeably the others were keeping time with their hands or occasional hoots when he glanced at erin she was standing with a hand on her fathers shoulder and smiling as he hadnt seen her smile before something shimmered a bit inside him shimmered then strained then quieted all in the space of two heartbeats she still moves like a girl matthew mckinnon said of his wife and shes still beautiful erin watched her mother whirl in her sons arms then spin with a flare of skirt and a flash of leg can you keep up with a laugh that was only slightly wistful erin shook her head ive never been able to come now her father slid an arm around her waist my moneys on you before she could protest matthew had spun her out his grin was broad as he held her hand high and picked up the rhythm of the timeless folk dance shed been taught as soon as she could walk the pipe music was cheerful and challenging caught up in it and her familys enthusiasm erin began to move instinctively she put her hands on her hips and tossed up her chin can you manage it adelia looked up at her eighteenyearold cousin can i manage it she repeated with her eyes narrowed the day hasnt come when i cant manage a jig boyo travis started to protest as she joined her cousins on the floor but then he subsided if there was one thing his dee knew it was her own strength the depth of it continued to surprise him quite a group arent they he murmured to burke theyre all of that he drew out a cigar but his eyes remained on erin i take it you dont jig with a chuckle travis leaned back against the wall dees tried to teach me and labeled me hopeless im inclined to believe you have to be born to it he saw brendon go out to take his place as his mothers partner his mothers son travis thought with a ripple of pride of all their children brendon was the most strongwilled and hardheaded she needed this more than i realized burke managed to tear his eyes from erin long enough to study traviss profile most people get homesick now and again shes only come back twice in seven years travis watched her now her cheeks pink with pleasure her eyes laughing down at brendon as he copied her moves its not enough you know shell take you to the wall in an argument half the time an argument no sane man can understand but she never complains and she never asks for a moment burke said nothing it still surprised him after four years that his friendship with travis had become so close so quickly hed never considered himself the kind of man to make friends and in truth had never wanted the responsibility of one hed spent almost half his thirtytwo years on his own needing no one wanting no one with the grants it had just happened i dont know much about women at traviss slow smile burke corrected himself wives but id say yours is happy whether shes here or in the states the fact is travis if she loved you less i might have made a play for her myself travis continued to watch her as his mind played back the years the first time i saw her i thought she was a boy burke drew the cigar out of his mouth youre joking it was dark a poor excuse his chuckle was warm and easy as he looked back she seemed to think so too nearly took my head off i think i fell for her then and there he heard her laugh and looked over as she shook her head and stepped away from the dancers she came to him hands outstretched the jeweled ring hed put on her finger years before still glimmered i could go for hours she claimed a little breathlessly but these two have had enough with her free hands she covered her babies are you going to try it burke not on your life she laughed again and put a hand on his arm with the simple generosity hed never quite gotten used to if a man doesnt make a fool of himself now and again hes not living she took a couple of deep steadying breaths but couldnt keep her foot from tapping oh its like magic when cullen plays and all the more magic to be here hearing it she brought traviss hand to her lips then rested her cheek on it mary mckinnon can still outdance anyone in the county but erins wonderful too isnt she burke took a long sip of whiskey its not a hardship to watch her laughing again adelia rested her head against her husbands arm i suppose as her elder cousin i should warn her about your reputation with women burke swirled the whiskey in his glass and gave her a bland look what reputation is that with her head still nestled against travis she smiled up at him oh i hear things mr logan fascinating things the racing worlds a tight little group you know ive heard murmurs that a man not only has to watch his daughters but his wife when youre about if i was interested in another mans wife youd be the first to know he took her hand and brought it to his lips her eyes laughed at him travis i think burkes flirting with me apparently he agreed and kissed the top of her head a warning mr logan its easy enough to flirt with a woman whos five months along with twins and who knows youre a scoundrel but mind your step the irish are a clever lot she stood on her toes and kissed his cheek if you keep staring at her like that matthew mckinnons going to load his shotgun he glanced back as erin stepped away from the group no law against looking there should be when it comes to you she snuggled against travis again looks like erins going outside for a breath of air when burke merely lifted a brow she smiled youd probably like to light that cigar maybe take a little walk in the night air yourself as a matter of fact i would he nodded to her then sauntered to the door were you warning him off or egging him on travis wanted to know just enjoying the view love she turned her mouth up for a kiss erin drew her jacket tightly around her nights were coldest in february but she didnt mind now the air was bracing and the moon halffull she was glad her father had pressured her to dance it seemed too seldom now that there was time for small celebrations there was so much work to be done and not as many hands to do it now that frank had married and started his own family and within a year she expected sean to marry the hennessy girl with cullen more interested in his music than milking that left only joe and brian and herself the family was growing but at the same time spreading out the farm had to survive erin knew that was indisputable her father would simply wither away without it just as she knew she would wither away if she stayed much longer the only solution was to find a way to ensure both she hugged herself with her arms to ward off the wind it brought with it the scent of mrs malloys wild roses and rhododendrons she wouldnt think of it now in a short time the grants would be gone and her own yearnings for more would fade a bit when the time was right something would happen she looked up at the moon and smiled hadnt she promised herself that shed make something happen she heard the scrape and flare of a lighter and braced herself nice night she didnt turn the little jolt to her system teased her no she hadnt wanted him to come out she told herself why should she since he had she would hold her own its a bit cold you look warm enough she wouldnt give an inch it only gave him the pleasure of taking it from her i liked the dancing she turned to walk slowly away from the inn it didnt surprise her when he fell into step beside her youre missing it you stopped the end of his cigar grew bright and red as he took another puff your brother has a gift aye she listened now as the music turned from jaunty to sad he wrote this one hearing its like hearing a heart break music like this always made her long and fear and wonder what it would be like to feel so strongly about another are you a music lover mr logan when the tunes right this one was a waltz a slow weepy one on impulse he slipped his arms around her and picked up the time what are you doing dancing he said simply a mans supposed to ask but she didnt pull away and her steps matched his easily the motion and the music made her smile she turned her face up to his the grass was soft beneath her feet the moonlight sweet you dont look like the kind of man who can waltz one of my few cultural accomplishments she fit nicely into his arms slender but not fragile soft but not malleable and it seems to be a night for dancing she said nothing for a moment there was magic here starlight roses and sad music the flutter in her stomach the warmth along her skin warned her that a woman took chances waltzing under the night sky with a stranger but still she moved with him the tunes changed she murmured and drew out of his arms relieved regretful that he didnt keep her there she turned once again to walk why did you come here to look at horses i bought a pair in kildare he took a puff on his cigar hed yet to realize himself what his horses and farm had come to mean to him theres no match for the thoroughbreds at the irish national stud you pay for them god knows but ive never minded putting my money on a winner so you came to buy horses it interested her though she didnt want it to and to watch a few races ever been to curragh no she glanced up at the moon again curragh kilkenny kildare all of them might have been as far away as the white slash in the sky you wont find thoroughbreds here in skibbereen no he smiled at her in the moonlight and the smile made her uneasy then lets say im just along for the ride its my first time in ireland and what do you think of it she stopped now unwilling to pass out of the range of the music ive found it beautiful and contradictory with a name like logan youd have some irish in you unsmiling he glanced down at his cigar its possible probable she said lightly you know you said you were a neighbor of traviss but you dont sound like him your accent accent his mood changed again with a grin i guess if you want to call it that it comes from the west the west it took her a moment the american west cowboys this time he laughed a full rich laugh so that she was distracted enough not to protest when his hand touched her cheek we dont carry sixguns as a rule these days her feathers were ruffled you dont have to make fun of me was i because her skin had felt so cool and so smooth he touched it again and what would you say if i asked you about leprechauns and banshees she had to smile id say the last to have seen a leprechaun in these parts was michael ryan after a pint of irish you dont believe in legends erin he stepped closer so that he could see the moonlight reflected in her eyes like light in a lake no she didnt step back it wasnt her nature to retreat even when she felt the warning shiver race up her spine whether you won or went down in defeat it was best to do it with feet firmly planted i believe in what i can see and touch the rest is for dreamers pity he murmured though he had always felt the same lifes a bit softer the other way ive never wanted softness then what he touched a finger to the hair that curled at her cheekbones i have to go back it wasnt a retreat she told herself she felt cold all at once cold to the bone but even as she started to turn he closed a hand over her arm she looked at him eyes clear not so much angry as assessing youll excuse me mr logan the winds up i noticed you didnt answer my question no because its no concern of yours dont she said when his fingers closed lightly over her chin but she didnt jerk away im interested when a man meets someone he recognizes hes interested we dont know each other but she understood him when hed brought his arms around her in the waltz shed known him there was something something in both of them that mirrored back whatever it was had her heart beating hard now and her skin chilling and if its rude i have to be then ill say it plain i dont care to know you do you usually have such a strong reaction to a stranger she tossed her head but his fingers stayed in place the only reaction im having at the moment is annoyance which was one of the biggest lies she could remember telling shed already looked at his mouth and wondered what it would be like to be kissed by him im sure you think i should be flattered that youre willing to spend time with me but im not a silly farm girl who kisses a man because theres a moon and music he lifted a brow erin if id intended to kiss you id have done so already i never waste time with a woman she felt abruptly as foolish as shed claimed not to be damn it she would have kissed him and she knew he was well aware of it well youre wasting mine now ill say goodnight why hadnt he kissed her burke asked himself as he watched her rush back to the inn hed wanted to badly hed imagined it clearly for a moment when the moonlight had fallen over her face and her face had lifted to his hed all but tasted her but he hadnt kissed her something had warned him that it would take only that to change the order of things for both of them he wasnt ready for it he wasnt sure he could avoid it taking a last puff he sent the cigar in an arch into the night hed come to ireland for horses hed be better off being content with that but he was a man on whom contentment rarely sat easily shed come late on purpose erin rolled her bike to the kitchen entrance of the inn and parked it she knew it was prideful but she simply didnt want dee to know she worked there it wasnt the paperwork and bookkeeping that bothered her that made her feel accomplished it was her kitchen duties she preferred to keep to herself mrs malloy had promised not to mention it but she tuttutted about it erin shrugged that off as she entered the kitchen let her tuttut as long as that was all she let out of her mouth dee and her family were visiting in town through the morning that had given erin time to clear up her chores at home then ride leisurely from the farm to handle the breakfast dishes and the daily cleaning since the books were in order shed be able to take a few hours that afternoon to drive out to the farm where her cousin had grown up it wasnt being deceitful she told herself as she filled the big sink with water and if it was it couldnt be helped she wouldnt have dee feeling sorry for her she was working for the money it was as simple as that once enough was made she could move on to that office position in cork or dublin by the saints the only dishes shed have to clean then would be her own she started to hum as she scrubbed the inns serviceable plates shed learned young when there was work to be done to make the best of it because as sure as the sun rose it would be there again tomorrow she looked out the window as she worked across the field where shed walked with burke the night before where shed danced with him in the moonlight she thought then caught herself foolishness he was just a man dallying with what was available she might not be traveled or have seen big cities but she wasnt naive if shed felt anything in those few minutes alone with him it had been the novelty he was different but that didnt make him special and it certainly didnt warrant her thinking of him in broad daylight with her arms up to the elbows in soapy water she heard the door open behind her and began to scrub faster i know im late mrs malloy but ill have it cleared up before lunch shes at the market fussing over vegetables at burkes voice erin simply closed her eyes when he crossed over and put a hand on her shoulder she began to scrub with a vengeance what are you doing id think youd have eyes to see that she set one plate to drain and attacked another if youll excuse me im behind saying nothing he walked over to the stove and poured the coffee that was always kept warm there she was wearing overalls baggy ones that might have belonged to one of her brothers her hair was down and longer than hed imagined it shed pulled it back with a band to keep it out of her face but it was thick and curly beyond her shoulders he sipped watching her he didnt quite know what his own feelings were at finding her at the sink but he was well aware of hers embarrassment you didnt mention you worked here no i didnt erin slammed another plate onto the drainboard and id be obliged if you didnt either why its honest work isnt it id prefer it if dee didnt know i was washing up after her pride was another emotion he understood well all right she sent him a cautious look over her shoulder you wont tell her i said i wouldnt he could smell the detergent in the hot water despite the years that had passed it was still a scent that annoyed mm erins shoulders relaxed a bit thank you want some coffee she hadnt expected him to make it easy for her still cautious but less reserved she smiled no i havent the time she turned away again because he was much easier to look at than she wanted him to be i ah thought youd be out by now im back he said simply hed intended to grab a quick cup and leave take a leisurely walk around town or duck into the local pub for conversation he studied her her back straight at the sink her arms plunged deep into the soapy water want a hand she stared at him this time caught between astonishment and horror no no drink your coffee im sure therere muffins in the pantry if you like or you might want to go out and walk its a fine day trying to get rid of me again he strolled over and picked up a dishcloth please mrs malloy is at the market he picked up a dish and began to polish it dry he was standing close now nearly hiptohip with her erin resisted the urge to shift away or was it to shift closer she plunged her hands into the water again i dont need any help he set down the first dish and picked up another ive got nothing else to do frowning she lifted out a plate i dont like it when youre nice dont worry im not often so what else do you do except wash dishes and dance it was a matter of pride she knew but she turned to him with her eyes blazing i keep books if you want to know i keep them for the inn and for the dry goods and for the farm sounds like youre busy he murmured and began to consider are you any good ive heard no complaints im going to get a job in dublin next year in an office i cant see it she had a castiron skillet in her hand now and was tempted i didnt ask you to too many walls in an office he explained and lowered the pan into the water himself youd go crazy thats for me to worry about she gripped the scouring pad like a weapon i was wrong when i said i didnt like you when you were nice i dont like you at all you know youve only to ask and dee would take you to america she tossed the pad into the water and suds lapped up over the rim of the sink and what live off her charity is that what you think i want to take what someone is kind enough to give me no he stacked the next plate i just wanted to see you flare up again youre a bastard mr logan true enough and now that were on intimate terms you ought to call me burke theres plenty id like to be calling you why dont you be on your way and let me finish here ive got no time for the likes of you then youll have to make some he caught her off guard though she told herself later she should have been expecting it with her arms still elbow deep in water he curled a hand around her neck and kissed her it was quick but a great deal more of a threat than a promise his lips were hard and firm and surprisingly warm as he pressed them against hers for a second for two she didnt have time to react and certainly no time to think before hed released her again and picked up another dish she swallowed and beneath the soapy water her hands were fists youve a nerve you do a man doesnt get very far without any or a woman just remember this if i want you touching me ill let you know your eyes say plenty irish its a pleasure to watch them she wouldnt argue she wouldnt demean herself by making an issue of it instead she pulled the plug on the sink ive the floor to do youll have to get your feet off it then i guess id better take that walk he laid the cloth down spread open so it would dry without another word or another glance he strolled out the back door erin waited a full ten seconds then gave herself the satisfaction of heaving a wet rag after him two hours later after a quick change into a skirt and sweater erin met the grants in the public room of the inn joes overalls were bundled into a sack tied on the back of her bike and shed used some of mrs malloys precious cream to offset the daily damage she did to her hands burke was there of course he was she thought and deliberately ignored him as he bounced young brady on his knee ma sent this erin handed dee a plate wrapped tightly in a cloth its her raisin cake she didnt want you to think mrs malloy could outcook her i remember your mothers raisin cake dee lifted the corner of the cloth to sniff now and then shed bake an extra and have one of you bring it by the farm the scent brought back memories some sweet some painful she covered the cake again im glad you could come with us today you remember its only on the condition that you come by and visit mas counting on it then wed best be rounding up the brood burke if you give the lad chocolate you deserve to have him smear it on you brendon keeley into the van now were going for a ride they didnt have to be told twice first they went to the cemetery where the grass was high and green and the stones weathered and gray flowers grew wild adding the promise of life some of erins family were buried there most she barely remembered shed never lost anyone close or grieved deeply but she loved deeply when it came to her family and thought she could understand how wrenching it would be to lose them yet it had been so long ago erin thought as she watched her cousin stand between the graves of her parents didnt a loss like that begin to fade with time adelia had been only a child when theyd died nine or ten wouldnt her memory of them have dimmed still though she could imagine a world away from her family she couldnt imagine one where they didnt exist it still hurts dee murmured as she looked down at the stones that bore her parents names i know travis ran a hand down her hair i remember father finnegan telling me after it happened that it was gods will and thinking to myself that it didnt seem right it still doesnt she sighed and looked up at him ill never be able to figure it out will i no he took her hand in his there was a part of him that wanted to gather her up and take her away from the grief and a part of him that understood shed been strong enough to deal with it years before theyd even met i wish id known them theyd have loved you she let the tears come but smiled with them and the children theyd have fussed over the children spoiled them more than hannah does it comforts me that theyre together i believe that you know but its painful that they missed knowing you and the babies dont cry momma keeley slipped a hand into adelias look i made a flower burke showed me he said theyd like it even though theyre in heaven dee looked at the little wreath fashioned of twigs and wild grass its lovely lets put it right in the middle like this bending she placed it between the graves aye im sure theyll like this what a strange man he was erin thought as she sat beside burke in the van and listened to brendons chattering shed seen him sit in the grass and twine twigs together for keeley though shed kept herself distant enough that she hadnt heard what hed said shed been aware that the girl had listened attentively and had looked at him with absolute trust he didnt seem to be a man to inspire trust she knew the road that led to the farm that had been the cunnanes she remembered dees parents only as the vaguest of shadows but she did remember lettie cunnane well the aunt dee had lived with when shed been orphaned shed been a tough sternfaced woman and because of her erin had kept her visits to the farm few and far between that was behind them now she reminded herself as she gestured toward the window for brendon you see just over this hill is where your mother grew up on a farm he said knowledgeably the patches of green pasture and yellow gorse meant little to him we have a farm the best one in maryland he grinned at burke as if it was an old joke itll still be the second best when im finished burke answered willing to rise to the bait royal meadows has been around for genergener generations burke supplied yeah and youre still wet behind the ears cause uncle paddy said so brendon patrick grant it was all the warning hannah had to give she turned her stern eye on burke and you should know better than to encourage him burke merely grinned and tousled the boys hair doesnt take much burke won his farm in a poker game brendon supplied as the van shuddered to a halt hes teaching me to play thats so when royal meadows belongs to you i can win that too he pushed open the sliding door then grabbed the giggling boy around the waist did he really erin asked in an undertone as hannah took keeleys hand win his horse farm gambling so im told hannah stepped a bit wearily out of the van rumor is hes lost and won more than that she glanced over as burke settled brendon on his shoulders its hard to hold it against him she wouldnt erin thought as she joined the others she was too irish to turn her nose up at a gambler especially a successful one trailing behind dee she looked over the rise to the farm below it hadnt changed much not in her memory oh the milking parlor was new and a fresh coat of paint had been slapped on the barn a year or so before it was the only farm in sight to the east the hills rose up and blocked the view the vegetable garden was already tilled and planted and a smattering of the dairy cows could be seen in the strip of pasture there was smoke spiraling out of the chimney of the little stone cottage which was a great deal like her own the good rich smell of peat carried on the wind the sweeneys are a nice family she said at length because her cousin stared down so long without speaking i know they wouldnt mind if you wanted to go down and look about no she said it too quickly then softened the refusal with a touch of her hand i dont mind looking from here the truth was she couldnt bear to go any closer to what had been and was no longer her own do you remember erin when aunt lettie was so sick and you and your mother came visiting yes you gave ma one of the roses from the bush there the bush had been her mothers erin remembered and she linked her fingers briefly with dees the roses still bloom every summer she smiled at that such a little place smaller now than even i remember look keeley see that window there she crouched down to show her daughter that was my room when i was your age adelia stood again there was only she and travis now as the others strolled down the side of the road dee ive told you before you can have it back if you want we can make the sweeneys a good offer for it she continued to look down remembering then with a little sigh she slipped an arm around traviss waist you know when i left here all those years ago i thought id lost everything she tilted her head back and kissed him i was wrong lets walk a little ways its such a beautiful day erin watched them there was a small meadow that was green now but would be choked with wildflowers in only a matter of weeks she heard burke behind her and spoke without thinking if i were to go to leave here and find something else id never look back if you dont look over your shoulder once in a while things catch up with you faster than you think i dont understand you she turned and her hair fluttered around her face and shoulders free of bonds one minute you sound like a man without any roots at all and the next you sound as though youve just transplanted them where its convenient but not too deep he caught the ends of her hair in his fingers he was becoming more and more fascinated by it it wasnt silk it was too wild and untamed for silk maybe thats the trick irish not letting them sink too deep you can yank yours up because youll damn well strangle if you dont but youll take some of this with you he reached down and took up a handful of soil seems like a good enough base and whats yours he looked down at the rich dirt in his hand have you ever seen the sand in the desert irish no no you havent its thin itll slip right out of your hands no matter how hard you hold on to it grains of sand have a habit of clinging to the skin and are easily brushed away he glanced around as brady let out a squeal of laughter at a gull that had glided in from the sea why did you kiss me before she hadnt wanted to ask rather she hadnt wanted him to know it mattered he smiled at her again slowly with the amusement only a hint in his eyes a woman should never wonder why a man kisses her annoyed with herself she shrugged and turned away it wasnt a proper one anyway you want a proper one no she continued to walk but the devil on her shoulder took over she glanced around a half smile on her face ill let you know when i do chapter there was a storm coming erin could feel it brewing inside her just as she could see it brewing in the clouds that buried the sun and hung gloomily over the hills she worked quickly routinely pulling the pins off the line and dropping the dry billowing clothes in the basket at her feet she didnt mind this kind of monotonous mindless work it left her brain free to think and remember and plan just now with the wind tossing sheets away from her and the sky boiling she liked the simple outside chore she wanted to see the storm break to be a part of it when the wind and rain raised hell when it was over things would settle back into the quiet routine she knew was slowly driving her mad what was wrong with her erin yanked one of her brothers work shirts from the line and out of ingrained habit folded it to ward off wrinkles she loved her family had friends and work to keep the wolf from the door so why was she so restless so edgy she couldnt blame it all on her cousins visit or on the unexpected appearance of one burke logan shed been feeling restless before theyd come but for some reason their presence his presence intensified it she couldnt talk to her mother about it erin stripped down one of her mothers aprons and buried her face in the cool fresh scent of the material her mother simply couldnt understand discontent or yearnings for more not when there was a sturdy roof over the head and food enough for everyone time and again erin had wished herself as serene a heart as her mothers but it wasnt meant to be she couldnt go to her father though erin knew he would understand the storm inside her he wasnt a calm easy man from the stories shed heard hed been a hellion in his youth and it had taken marriage to his mary and a couple of babies before hed begun to take hold but while her father would understand erin knew he would also be distressed if she wanted more needed more he would take it to mean he hadnt given her enough there was cullen shed always been able to talk to cullen but he was so busy just now and her feelings were so mixed the longings so indistinct that she wasnt sure she could articulate them in any case so she would wait let the storm come and the wind blow hed been watching her for some time burke never considered that it was rude to stand and observe people without their knowledge you learned more about people when they thought they were alone she moved well even doing something so simple there was an innate sensuality in her movements she had more fire than showed in her hair inside her there was a flame smoldering he recognized it because hed been born with one himself that kind of heat of passion could and would break free it only took the right elements falling into place time place circumstance she didnt hum as she worked now but occasionally looked up at the sky as if daring it to open and pour its fury on her her hair blew back from her face fighting against the band that held it just as she fought whatever held her hed wondered what the results would be when she finally broke free hed already decided he wanted to be around to see for himself i havent seen a woman do that for a long time erin spun around her heels digging into the soft ground a pillowcase clutched in her hand he looked so at home she thought with the collar of his jacket up against the wind the buttons undone in contradiction he had his thumbs hooked in his pockets and that damned devil smile on his face shed never known a man to look better or more suited to the raw air and the warring skies she turned away to snatch another clothespin because she knew her reaction to him would bring her nothing but trouble dont women take down the wash where you come from progress often stamps out tradition he moved to her with the easy strides of a man used to walking toward what he wanted he unhooked a cotton slip her cotton slip folded it and dropped it in the basket erin clamped her teeth together and told herself only a foolish chucklehead would be embarrassed theres no need for you to be putting your hands on the wash dont worry theyre clean enough as if to prove it he held them out for the first time she noticed a thin jagged scar across his knuckles what are you doing here i came to see you she said nothing for a moment he didnt make it easy when he didnt invent comfortable excuses why because i wanted to he took down a pair of serviceable white panties folded those too without a blush then laid them on top of the slip erin felt a slow uncomfortable curling in her stomach shouldnt you be with travis and dee i think theyll survive the afternoon without me i liked your farm when we were here yesterday he glanced around now at the neat buildings the cottage was nearly half again as large as the one where adelia grant had grown up but the roof had the same bleached yellow thatching and sturdy stone walls there were flowers here as well the irish seemed happy to let them grow as they chose gay untamed and sturdy a hedge of wild fuchsia was already blooming it made him think of home and the snow covering the fields the roof of the barn showed fresh patching the paint on the silo was peeling and no longer white but the chickens in the coop were fat and clucking he imagined the mckinnons worked seven days a week to maintain the place such was the life of a farmer this is a fine piece of land apparently your father knows what to do with it its his life erin said simply as she took down the last of the wash what about yours i dont know what you mean he lifted the basket before she could its a good farm a good life for some you werent meant for it you dont know me well enough to say what im meant for she took the basket from him and walked toward the kitchen door but ive already told you im going north to an office job in a year or so taking a deep breath she swung the door open her mother would be horrified if she didnt ask the man in and at least offer him a cup of tea she turned to him but before she could issue the invitation he was taking the first step lets take a walk i have a proposition for you erin leaned back against the door and studied him coolly oh ill just bet you do he took the basket from her again set it inside the door and gave it a little shove youre getting ahead of yourself irish lets just say when i want you in bed i wont ask and he wouldnt she thought as they watched each other he wasnt the type to court a woman with flowers and pretty words any more than he was the type to coax a woman gently into his arms well she wasnt the type who wanted to be coaxed but neither would she be steamrollered just what is it youre wanting burke lets take a walk he repeated but this time he closed his hand over hers she could have refused but then she wouldnt know what it was he had to say erin decided that if she shook free and shut the door in his face hed tuck his hands in his pockets and stroll off leaving her the one who was fuming there was no harm in walking with him she told herself as she stepped down beside him her mother was in the house and her father along with a couple of her brothers was somewhere on the farm added to that was the fact that she had every confidence she could take care of herself i dont have much time she said briskly theres a lot more to be done today this wont take long but he said nothing more as they walked away from the house he didnt seem to look but he saw everything the care the sweat that went into the farm the long hours and the hope he counted thirty cows a man could make a living off less he imagined it hadnt been so many years since hed worked backbreaking hours he hadnt forgotten just as he never forgot that fate could take what he had just as easily as it had given it to him if it was a tour of the farm you were wanting erin began i had one yesterday remember he paused a moment to look out over a field he knew what it was to haul rocks from them to ride sweating over them at baling time and to curse the land as much as you worshiped it you grow grain here for the stock aye itll be plowing time soon you work the fields ive been known to burke turned her hand palmup and studied it it wasnt raw and cracked but toughened with a ridge of callus the nails were trimmed short and left unpainted you havent pampered them what good would that do me im not ashamed of the work theyve done no youre too practical for that he turned her hand over again and looked at her face youre not the kind of woman who daydreams about white knights she could smile at that though the intensity of his eyes made her uneasy ive always thought white knights would be painfully dull and the last thing i want is to be a lady in distress id rather be slaying my own dragons good i dont have much use for a woman who wants to be taken care of he still had her hand he still watched the wind whip furiously through her hair why dont you come back to america with me erin she stared at him speechless the skies opened up they were both soaked in a matter of seconds she might have stood there wideeyed and openmouthed but he grabbed her arm and yanked her inside a shed inside it was dim and smelled of soil and damp tools for the vegetable garden lined the walls her mothers peat pots and seeds were stacked on shelves waiting for planting rain beat on the tin roof and the wind snaked through the cracks in the boards and moaned erin stood shivering just inside the door her hair plastered to her head her sweater dripping at the hem but her senses had come back full force youre a madman burke logan by the saints youre as mad as a hatter do you think id just bundle up my skirts and cross an ocean with you she still shivered but the more she spoke the hotter her temper became sure and its a conceited ox you are to believe all you have to do is crook your finger to have me tagging after you i dont even know you she swiped a hand over her face to dry it then went one better and shoved him hard in the chest and its the gods truth that i have no desire to she turned to the shed door and would have yanked it open if he hadnt caught her by the shoulders take your hands off me you snake on impulse she grabbed a rake and turned on him with it touch me again and ill slice you into pieces little ones that wont be put back together easily so shed slay her dragons with a garden rake he thought lifting both hands palms out in a gesture of peace you dont have to defend your honor irish im not after it yet this is business what business would i be having with you when he took a step toward her she gestured with the rake come closer and i promise youll be missing an ear at the very least fine he made as if to take a step back then he moved quickly erin cursed him when he wrenched the rake out of her hands even as it clattered to the floor her back was against the wall youll have to learn not to drop your guard his face was close so close she could see his eyes smoky and dark and little else she twisted but his fingers only dug in harder hold still a minute will you youre making a fool of yourself nothing he could have said would have struck the light to her temper faster she all but bared her teeth and snarled therell come a time and therell come a place when youll pay for this everyone pays irish now take a deep breath shut your mouth and listen im offering you a job thats all she stopped wriggling to stare at him again i need someone sharp someone clever with figures to run my books your books the farm expenses payroll the man i had was a little too creative since hes going to be a guest of the state for the next few years i need someone else i want someone i know someone i can see and talk to handling my money rather than a big shiny company that doesnt give a damn about the farm or me because her head was whirling she took one long breath before she spoke again you want me to come to america and keep your books he smiled because she sounded almost disappointed im not offering you a free ride youre a pleasure to look at erin but at the moment all i intend to pay for is your brain move back she ordered in a voice that was suddenly firm i cant breathe with you pushing me through the wall no more attacks with garden tools her chin came up all right just move aside when he did she took a couple of deep breaths she had to keep a clear head now she didnt mind taking a new road in fact shed often fretted to do just that she only wanted to study all the curves and angles of it first you want to hire me thats right why ive just told you she shook her head still cautious you told me you need a bookkeeper i imagine therere plenty of them in america lets just say i like your style bending he picked up the rake and replaced it he wondered briefly if she would have used it yes indeed he thought grinning to himself oh yes indeed for all you know i cant add two and two mrs malloy and odonnelly at the dry goods say differently he leaned back against a workbench studying her from there he decided hed spoken no less than the truth even wet and dripping she was a pleasure to look at mrs malloy youve spoken to her you went to mr odonnelly and asked questions about me just checking your references no one told you to go poking about the town asking questions about me business irish strictly business what i found out is that youre neat as a pin and dependable your figures tally and your books are clean thats good enough for me this is crazy struggling against a surge of excitement she dragged a hand through her stilldripping hair a body doesnt hire someone theyve known only a few days irish people are hired after a tenminute interview thats not what i mean this isnt a matter of me giving you a resume then catching a bus to take a new job across town youre talking about me coming to america and taking on a job thats bigger than the inn the farm and the dry goods put together he only moved his shoulders its just a matter of more figures isnt it youre talking about going north in a year im giving you a chance to go to america now make the break its not so simple along with the excitement was a growing panic wasnt this what shed always wanted now that it was nearly as close as a handspan she was terrified its a gamble he was watching her again in that quiet intense way most things worth winning are ill pay for your ticket as a sign of good faith youll start out at a weekly salary he considered a moment then named a figure that had her mouth dropping open if it works out therell be a tenpercent raise in six months for that you take care of all the details all the figures all the bills ill want a weekly report well leave in two days two days she was numb now so numb she could only stare at him but even if i agreed i could never be ready to leave by then all you have to do is pack and say your goodbyes ill handle the rest but i you have to make up your mind erin stay or go he stepped toward her again if you stay youll be safe and youll always wonder what if he was right the question was already nagging at her if i go where will i live ive got plenty of room no on this she would have to be firm right from the start i wont agree to that i may say ill work for you but i wont live with you its your choice again he moved his shoulders as if it didnt matter hed already anticipated her balking there i dont imagine adelia would have any problem putting you up in fact i think you know shed love to have you with her it wouldnt be charity he said keeping one step ahead of her youd be bringing in a wage you could get your own place for that matter but i think youd be more comfortable with your cousin at first and our farms are close enough to make it convenient ill talk to her sometime during the last two minutes her mind had been made up she was going her bridges might not be burning behind her but they were certainly smoking ill have to speak to my family as well but id like to accept your offer she held out her hand burke took it just as casually though he wondered about the wild surge of relief that coursed through him i expect a days work for a days pay i dont doubt youll give it to me that i will im grateful for the chance ill remind you of that after youve spent a few days sorting through the mess my last bookkeeper left me with she stood very still for a moment letting it all soak in layer by layer then she spun in a quick circle and laughed i cant believe it america its like some kind of a mad dream ive hardly been more than fifty kilometers from skibbereen and now im going thousands in the blink of an eye he liked to see her this way her face flushed with pleasure her eyes lit with it and the rain still drummed on the roof it takes a bit longer than that to cross the atlantic dont be so literal but she was too excited to take offense in a matter of days ill be in a new country a new place a new job new money he started to reach for a cigar then thought better of it the money puts a gleam in your eye anyone whos ever been poor gleams a bit when theyve got enough money he acknowledged this with a nod hed been poor but he doubted erin would understand that degree of poverty he appreciated money though if he lost it as he had before he would simply shake the dust off his shoes and make more youll earn it i wouldnt be having it any other way she stopped as reality began to seep through but i need a passport and the green card that allows you to work there must be a pile of papers that have to be processed i told you id see to it he drew a paper out of his pocket fill this out and drop it off at the inn tonight its an application he explained as she studied it ive already arranged to have it processed tomorrow your passport and whatever else you need will be in cork when we get there she tapped the paper slowly against her palm you were damn sure of yourself werent you it pays to be youll need a picture they can use too a recent one what if id said no he simply smiled then youd have been a fool and id have thrown the application away i cant figure you she tucked the application in the pocket of her baggy pants but shook her head at him youve made me a very generous offer youre giving me the opportunity to do something ive wanted to do for as long as i can remember but even as youre doing it it doesnt seem to matter to you one way or the other he remembered the surge of relief but chose to ignore it things matter too much to people thats how they get hurt are you saying that things dont matter to you nothing at all what about your farm he shifted a bit surprised that the question when she asked it made him uncomfortable its a place a comfortable and fairly profitable one at the moment but thats all it is i dont have the ties to it that you have to the land here erin thats why if i leave it i will leave without a second glance when you leave ireland no matter how much you want to go youre going to hurt theres nothing wrong in that she murmured its my home its only right to miss your home some people dont make homes they just live somewhere and leave it at that she saw more clearly now though the light was still dim she saw though shed told herself she didnt care that there were places inside him no one no woman would ever touch thats a cold and sorry way to live its a choice he corrected then he pushed the subject aside make sure you get me the application tonight im leaving for cork first thing in the morning but you said we werent going for a couple of days ill meet you there all right then i should be getting along theres a lot to be done theres something else i think we should get out of the way he rocked back on his heels a moment then stunned her by grabbing both her arms and dragging her against him this has nothing to do with business infuriated she brought her hands to his chest and gave him one hard shove it didnt budge him an inch then he clamped his mouth down on hers rough and ready and with no patience at all she would have ripped and clawed at him she would have struggled and bit and cursed that was what she told herself she would have done if she hadnt been so stunned by the heat his lips were firm that she already knew but she hadnt known they could be so hot so passionate so tempting her head filled with sounds louder deeper sounds than the rain that drove furiously on the roof above her hands were trapped between their bodies so that she could feel the pounding of a heart without knowing which of them it came from this is what the apple must have tasted like when eve took the first forbidden bite she thought giddily succulent tart unbearably delicious nothing else ever tasted would be as satisfying lost in the flavor she parted her lips and let him take more hed known what hed wanted but hadnt been sure what to expect if shed hissed at him he would have ignored her and taken his fill if shed struck out at him in anger he would have taken her struggles in stride and enjoyed the fury hed fought or gambled for everything hed wanted all of his life for days hed been trying to convince himself that erin mckinnon was no different but she was she gave after the first stunned instant she gave passionately with the kind of desperation that left him shaken and edgy for more her mouth was avid and mobile her body taut and trembling he could feel the raw jagged need raging through her rising speeding up to meet and match his own he wanted to take her there on the damp floor with the smell of rain and earth everywhere he wanted her to touch him to feel those capable hands on his flesh to hear her say his name to watch her eyes go dark as midnight as he covered her body with his it could be now he could feel it in the press of her body against his in the give of her mouth it could be now there had been times and there had been women with whom he wouldnt have hesitated why he did so now he couldnt be sure but he drew her away though his hands stayed on her shoulders and his eyes stayed on hers as they slowly fluttered open she couldnt speak not for a moment the feeling was so immense it left no room for words shed never known that a body could be filled so quickly with sensations or that a mind could be emptied of them just as swiftly she knew now if anyone had told her that the world could change in the single beat of a heart she would have laughed now she understood he didnt speak erin struggled to find her footing as he kept his silence she couldnt allow herself that kind of madness not again if she were to travel an ocean with him work for him understand him just a little she couldnt let this happen again not with a man like him taking a deep breath she steadied herself no never with him if the past few moments had taught her anything it was that he was a man who knew women and who understood their weaknesses very well you had no right to do that she didnt unleash her temper knowing she hadnt the energy left for it he was shaken down to the bone down to the heart but it wasnt the time to dwell on it it wasnt a matter of right but of want that was a proper kiss irish and we needed to get it out of our systems whether you were coming with me or not she nodded hoping she sounded as casual as he shed rather have died on the spot than have admitted her own inexperience now that our systems are clear therell be no need for it to happen again dont ask me for promises youll be disappointed he strolled to the door pushing it open so that the wind and rain lashed their way in it helped cool his head and steady his heart rate you can talk to dee and travis when you bring the papers in give your family my best then he was gone into the storm though erin dashed to the door he was only a quickly fading shadow in the gloom a shadow she thought who she knew nothing about and she would be going with him to america chapter america erin wasnt naive enough to believe the streets were paved with gold but she was determined to make it the land of opportunity her opportunity it was the speed of things that struck her first the hurry every living soul seemed to be in well she was in a bit of a hurry herself she decided as she sat in the back of her cousins station wagon and tried not to gawk the cold had surprised her too a numbing bonechilling cold shed never experienced in the mild irish climate but the snow was novelty enough to make it a small inconvenience piles of it more than shed ever seen rolling over the gentle hills and heaped on the sides of the road it was a different sky above different air around her so what if she gawked erin thought to herself and she smiled as she tried to see everything at once burke had been true to his word the paperwork had gone so smoothly that in a matter of days after hed offered her the job shed been across the atlantic hed left her with her cousins family at the airport in virginia with a casual comment that hed see her in a couple of days after shed settled in just like that erin was still trying to catch her breath shed hoped hed say more shed hoped perhaps foolishly that he would seem more pleased that she was there shed even waited to see that half smile that dark amusement in his eyes or to feel the flick of his finger down her cheek but hed only dismissed her as an employer dismisses an employee erin reminded herself that was precisely what they were now there would be no more waltzes or wild embraces did she wish there would be the devil of it was shed done just as much thinking about burke logan as she had about coming to america something had told her that they were both chances the man and the country sometime somehow shed begun to mix them together and had discovered she wanted both she knew she was being foolish again and resolved to settle for the land it was beautiful the mountains dark in the distance reminded her just enough of home to make her comfortable while the whiz of the cars beside them in three lanes were foreign enough to add excitement erin found it a palatable combination and was already hoping for more adelia shifted in her seat so that she could smile back at her cousin i remember my first day here when uncle paddy picked me up at that same airport i felt like id been plopped down in the middle of a circus ill get used to it erin smiled and took another long look out the window ill get used to it very quickly as soon as i believe im really here i for one am grateful to burke distracted a moment dee murmured to brady who was fretting in his car seat then soothed him with a stuffed dog it was never in my mind when we went to ireland that wed be bringing family back with us the guilt tingled a little shadowing the pleasure i know it was all very sudden and im beholden to you dee oh what a pack of nonsense i feel like a girl again having my best friend come to stay well have a party the minute the thought struck adelia rolled with it a proper one too dont you think travis i think we could handle it i dont want you to go to any trouble erin put in if you dont let dee go to any trouble youll break her heart travis said without embellishment they crossed over the line into maryland nearly home now love im as excited to be back as i was to leave brendon if you dont stop teasing your sister youll be seeing nothing but the four walls of your room until morning dee sighed a bit and shifted all right travis sent her a quick concerned glance theyre just active she patted his hand to make light of the discomfort probably squabbling between themselves already id like to help with the children the closer they came the more erins nerves began to jump or however else i can to pay you back for taking me in this way youre family adelia said simply then she sat up straighter as they drove between the stone pillars that led to home welcome to royal meadows cousin be happy erin didnt know what shed been expecting something grand surely she wasnt disappointed the sun shone hard on the february snow causing the thin crust to glitter and shine acres of it erin thought this world was white and gleaming even the trees were coated with it their bare black branches mantled with snow and dripping with cold clear ice like a fairyland she mused then called herself foolish when the house came into view she could only stare shed never seen anything so big or so lovely the stone rose up as sturdy as it was majestic from the white base of snow charm was added by the wroughtirontrimmed balconies that graced the windows its beautiful erin murmured its the most beautiful house ive ever seen ive always thought so too dee reached over to unhook brady as travis brought the car to a halt and its so good to see it again come now my lad were home uncle paddy from the back seat both brendon and keeley began to shout then they were out and kicking through the snow a short stocky man with wiry gray hair and a face like an elf spread his arms wide for them give me the baby missy hannah told dee youre already carrying two and well let the men handle the bags while you come in for a nice cup of tea and put your feet up stop fussing dee said then she laughed as her uncle grabbed her in a fierce hug hows my best girl fit as a fiddle and glad to be home look what we brought back with us from skibbereen still laughing she held out a hand to erin you remember erin mckinnon uncle paddy mary and matthew mckinnons daughter erin mckinnon his face seemed to scrunch together as he thought back then with a hoot he was beaming erin mckinnon is it faith lass the last time i saw you you were no more than a baby i used to raise a glass with your da now and then but you wouldnt be remembering that no but they still speak of paddy cunnane in the village do they now he grinned as if he knew exactly what was said well get inside out of the cold i can help with the bags erin began as adelia started to shoo her children indoors id appreciate it if youd go with dee let her show you your room travis was already pulling out the first of the luggage even as he set them in the drive his gaze was following his wife she doesnt like to admit she gets tired and having you to fuss over will keep her from overdoing erin stood a moment torn between carrying her own weight and doing what was asked of her all right if you like it wouldnt hurt if you told her youd like to sit down with a cup of tea quietly domineering erin thought again on impulse she leaned over and kissed traviss cheek your wifes a fortunate woman ill see that she rests without knowing shes been maneuvered into it still she picked up one of the cases and took it inside with her the warmth struck her immediately not just the change of temperature but the colors and the feel of the house itself the children were already racing through the rooms as if they wanted to make sure nothing had changed in their absence youll want to go up first see your room dee was already stripping off her gloves and laying them on an ornamental table in the hall hooking her arm through erins she started up the stairs youll tell me if it suits you or not and if theres anything else you want as soon as you feel settled in ill show you the rest erin only nodded the space alone left her speechless adelia opened a door and gestured her inside this is the guest room i wish wed had time to have some flowers for you she glanced around the room regretting she hadnt been able to add a few more personal touches the baths down the end of the hall and im sorry to say the children are always flinging wet towels around and making a mess of it the room was done in gray and rose with a big brass bed and a thick carpet the furniture was a rich mahogany with gleaming brass pulls and a tall framed mirror over the bureau there were knickknacks here and there a little china dog a rosecolored goblet more brass in a whimsical study of a lion the terrace doors showed the white expanse of snow through gauzy curtains making a dreamlike boundary between warmth and cold unable to speak erin gripped her case in both hands and just looked will it suit you youre free to change anything you like no erin managed to get past the block in her throat but her hands didnt relax on the handle of the case its the most beautiful room ive ever seen i dont know what to say say it pleasures you gently dee pried the case from her i want you to feel comfortable erin at home i knew what its like to leave things behind and come to some place strange erin took a deep breath she wasnt able to bear it not for another second i dont deserve this what foolishness businesslike dee set the case on the bed with the intention of helping her cousin unpack no please erin put her hand over dees then sat she didnt want her cousin to tire herself and she didnt want her to see what a pitiful amount shed brought with her i have to confess amused dee sat beside her do you want a priest with a watery laugh that shamed her erin shook her head ive been so jealous of you there it was out dee considered a minute but youre much prettier than i am no thats not true and thats not it in any case erin opened her mouth again then let out a long breath oh i hate confession me too sinning just comes natural to some of us erin glanced over saw both the warmth and humor and relaxed it comes natural enough to me i was jealous of you am she corrected determined to make a clean breast of it id think about you here in a big beautiful house with pretty things and pretty clothes your family all the things that go with it and id just near die with envy when i met you at the airport that day i was resentful and nervous nervous she could pass over resentment easily about seeing me erin we all but grew up together but you moved here and youre rich she closed her eyes ive a powerful lust for money a smile trembled on dees lips but she managed to control it well that doesnt seem like a very big sin to me a couple of days in purgatory maybe erin i know what is it not to have and to wish for more i dont think less of you for envying me in truth im flattered i suppose thats a sin too she added after a moments thought its worse because youre so kind to me all of you and i feel like im using you maybe you are but im using you as well to bring ireland a little closer to be my friend i have a sister traviss sister but she moved away about two years ago i cant tell you how much i miss her i guess i was hoping youd fill the hole because her conscience was soothed by the admission erin touched a hand to dees i guess its not so bad if we use each other lets just see what happens now ill help you unpack lets leave it id really like to go down and have a cup of tea as erin rose adelia eyed her did travis tell you to keep me off my feet i dont know what youre talking about lyings a sin too dee reminded her but she smiled as she led her downstairs she dreamed of ireland that night of the heady green hills and the soft scent of heather she saw the dark mountains and the clouds that rushed across the sky ahead of the wind and her farm with its rich plowed earth and grazing cows she dreamed of her mother telling her goodbye with a smile even as a tear slid down her cheek of her father holding her so tight her ribs had ached she heard each of her brothers teasing her one by one she cried for ireland that night slow quiet tears for a land shed left behind and carried with her but when she woke her eyes were dry and her mind clear shed made her break chosen her path and shed best be getting on with it the plain gray dress she chose was made sturdily and fit well her mothers stitches were always true erin started to pin her hair up then changed her mind and tamed it into a braid she studied herself with what she hoped was a critical and objective eye suitable for work erin decided then started downstairs she heard the hoopla from the kitchen the moment shed reached the first floor at ease with confusion she headed toward it youll have plenty to tell your friends at school hannah was at the stove lecturing brendon as she scooped up scrambled eggs youve missed two weeks my lad at the kitchen table dee was fussing with a ribbon in keeleys hair theres no reason in the world you shouldnt go back to school today i have jet lag he made a hideous face at his sister then attacked the eggs hannah set in front of him jet lag is it with an effort dee kept a straight face after kissing the top of keeleys hair she nudged her daughter toward her own breakfast well if thats the truth of it i suppose we have to forget those flying lessons when youre sixteen a jet pilot cant be having jet lag maybe its not jet lag brendon corrected without missing a beat its probably some foreign disease i caught when we were in ireland bog fever erin said from the doorway clucking her tongue she walked over to rest a hand on brendons brow sure and thats the most horrible plague in ireland bog fever dee made sure there was a tremor in her voice oh no erin it couldnt be not my baby young boys are the ones who catch it easiest im afraid theres only one cure you know dee shuddered and closed her eyes oh not that poor darling poor little lad i dont think i could bear it if the boy has bog fever it has to be done erin put a hand on his shoulder for comfort nothing but raw spinach and turnip greens for ten days its the only hope for it raw spinach brendon felt his little stomach turn over he wasnt sure precisely what turnip greens were but they sounded disgusting i feel a lot better are you sure dee leaned over to check his brow herself he seems cool enough but i dont know if we should take any chances i feel fine to prove his point he jumped up and grabbed his coat come on keeley we dont want to miss the bus well if youre sure dee rose to kiss his cheek then keeleys uncle paddys going to drive you to the end of the lane its cold so stay in the car until the bus comes dee waited until the door slammed behind them before she lowered herself in the chair again and howled with laughter bog fever where in the blue heaven did you dig that up ma always used it on joe it never failed youve a quick mind hannah chuckled as she turned around what can i fix you for breakfast oh i dont if you think mrs malloy can cook wait until you taste hannahs muffins understanding her cousins embarrassment dee took the cloth off a little wicker basket why dont you have some eggs to go with it i have the appetite of a hog when im carrying and i hate to eat alone coffee hannah was by her shoulder with the pot please thank you ah is travis not up yet up and gone dee said comfortably hes been down at the stables for more than an hour when he travels on business im never sure if he misses me or the horses more she glanced at the muffins lectured herself then took another anyway after all she was eating for three brendons in the first grade now and keeley goes mornings to kindergarten so theres only brady she gestured to the high chair where he sat his face covered with oatmeal as he sang to his fingers hes the besttempered child in the world if i do say so myself now what would you like to do today actually i thought id go over to mr logans and begin work already dee smiled her thanks at hannah as the breakfast plates were set in front of them youve only just got here surely burkes willing to give you a day or two to get your bearings i know but im anxious to get started to see what there is to be done and to make certain i can do it i cant imagine burke logan putting anyone on his payroll who didnt know their business its different for me even thinking in dollars instead of pounds is different if im in the middle of it working my way out i wont worry so much about making a mess dee remembered how anxious she herself had been to begin work when shed come to america to prove to herself she was still competent and able to make her own way all right then ill drive you over myself after breakfast not on your life missy hannah said from the stove oh for pity sakes i can still fit behind the wheel of a car youre not driving anywhere until you have your next checkup and the doctor clears it paddy can take miss mckinnon dee wrinkled her nose at hannahs back but subsided im a prisoner in my own house if i go down to the stables travis has every hand on the place watching me like a hawk youd think i never had a baby before twins come early as you know very well the sooner the better then she smiled well ill just stay in and plan the party and brady and i can build block houses cant we love in answer he squealed and slapped his hand into his oatmeal after he has a bath why dont i take care of that rising erin moved over to free brady from his high chair youre not going to start pampering me too ill go mad nothing of the kind i just think its time this handsome young man and i got better acquainted by the time she was finished erin had to clean the oatmeal off herself as well bundled inside a cardigan and a coat she drove with paddy cunnane to burkes neighboring horse farm the nerves were back she could feel them tense in her fingers as she curled them together it was a waste of time to be nervous about the likes of him she told herself what had happened on that stormy morning in the shed was over and done with now they were nothing more than boss and employee hed said he expected a days work for a days pay and she intended to give it to him whatever other feelings shed had had been born of the moment lust she said firmly telling herself she was mature enough to face that as a fact of life just as she would be strong enough to resist it she was a bookkeeper now her nerves were suddenly tinged with excitement a bookkeeper she repeated silently with a good job and a good wage within the month she could start sending money home with enough left over to buy lord she couldnt begin to think what would be first paddy turned the jeep under an arch the sign was large wrought iron strong rather than fancy with its block letters three aces erin caught her lip between her teeth was that the hand hed won it with or the hand the former owner had lost it with the snow lay here as well but the rise of hill wasnt as gentle she saw a willow old and gnarled with its leaves dulled and yellow from winter perhaps in the summer it would look peaceful and lovely but for now it looked fierce then she saw the house shed thought nothing could surprise her after the grants shed been wrong it had cupolas like a castle and the stone was dull and gray the windows were arched some of them with little parapets across from the steps and circled by the drive was an oval island that was now covered with untrampled snow do people really live in places like this she said half to herself cunningham hed be the owner before logan liked to think of himself as royalty paddy sniffed but erin wasnt entirely sure if the sound was directed at the present or the former owner put more money into fancying up this place than into the stables and the stock got a pool right inside the house youre joking indeed not right inside the house now youve only to call when youve finished here ill come fetch you or one of the boys will im obliged to you but her fingers seemed frozen on the handle good luck to you lass thanks screwing up her courage she pushed out of the jeep she was grateful it stayed parked where it was as she climbed the stone steps to the front door and what a door she thought as big as a barn and all carved she ran a hand over it before she pulled back the knocker erin counted slowly under her breath and waited it was opened by a darkhaired woman with big eyes and a small erect figure erin swallowed and kept her chin up im erin mckinnon mr logans bookkeeper the woman eyed her silently then stepped back erin managed to throw a smile to paddy over her shoulder before she stepped inside by the saints she thought tonguetied again as she stood in the atrium shed never seen anything to match it with its high ceilings and lofty windows it seemed the sun shone in from all directions and slanted over the leaves of thick green plants a balcony ran all the way around in one huge circle the rail gleaming and carved as the door had been the heels of her sensible shoes clicked on the tile floor then stopped as she stood uncertain what to do next ill tell mr logan youre here erin only nodded the accent sounded spanish making her feel more out of place than ever erin wiped her hands on her skirt and thought she knew what alice had felt like when shed stepped through the looking glass are you eager to work or did you just miss me she turned knowing shed been caught gaping he was in jeans and boots and the smile was the same the confidence shed lost when shed stepped inside came flooding back it was the best defense eager to work and earn a wage the cold and excitement had heightened the color in her cheeks and darkened her eyes as she stood in the center of the big open room burke thought she looked ready and able to take on the world you could have had a day or two to settle in i could but i didnt want it im used to earning my way fine youll certainly earn it here he lifted a hand and gestured her to follow morita my last bookkeeper managed to embezzle thirty thousand before the cage shut on him in the process he made a mess of the records your first priority is to straighten them out again while youre doing that youre to keep up the payroll and the current invoices of course of course a little voice inside her said mockingly burke pushed a door open and led her inside youll work here hopefully you wont have to ask me a bunch of annoying questions but if something comes up you can call rosa on the intercom and shell pass it on to me make a list of whatever supplies you think youll need and youll have them she cleared her throat and nodded her office was every bit as large as odonnellys entire storeroom the furniture was old and glossy the carpet like something out of a palace determined not to stare again erin walked over to the desk he had been right about one thing it was a mess for the first time since shed approached the big stone house she felt relief here was something familiar ledgers and books and papers were piled together in one heap there was an adding machine but it was nothing like the clunky manual one shed used before besides the clutter there was a phone a china holder stuffed with pencils and a basket clearly marked in and out burke moved behind the desk and began opening and closing drawers youve got stamps stationery extra work sheets checkbooks since morita nothing goes out without my signature if youd taken that precaution before youd be thirty thousand dollars richer point taken he didnt add that morita had worked for him for ten years during lean times and better set your own pace as long as its not sluggish rosa will fix you lunch you can take it in here or in the dining room there may be times ill join you are you here most of the day im around he settled a hip on the corner of the desk you didnt sleep well no i but her fingers had automatically lifted to the slight smudges under her eyes the time change i guess are you comfortable at the grants aye theyre wonderful to me all of them theyre extraordinary people you wont find many like them youre not she hadnt meant to say it but told herself it was too late to be sorry she had youve an edge to you then be careful you dont get too close edges can be sharp ive already seen that for myself she said it lightly as she reached for the first stack of papers he closed his hand slowly and firmly around her wrist are you trying to provoke me irish no but i dont imagine it takes much youre right there it might be fair to tell you that i have a short fuse and a dangerous one im so warned she looked amused but when she tried to free her hand his fingers only tightened one more warning then since youve moved into our little community youll hear it from others soon enough when i find a woman who attracts me i find a way to have her fair means or foul it doesnt mean a damn to me it wasnt a warning erin realized it was a threat beneath his fingers her pulse was beating hard and fast but she kept her eyes even with his i didnt have to be told to know that nor have i any intention of attracting you too late he grinned but released her hand i find you intriguing enough to dance in the moonlight with desirable enough to kiss in a garden shed and passionate enough to imagine making love to her stomach knotted with fear with longing well a womans head could be turned clear around with such flattery mr logan tell me did you bring me to america to sleep with you or to fix your books both he said simply but well deal with business first business is all well deal with now id like to begin fine but instead of leaving he ran his hands up her arms erin stiffened but didnt back away she wouldnt play the fool and struggle though she braced herself for the hot passion shed experienced before he only brushed a kiss over her cheek hed thought of her and little else since hed come home again hed thought of how shed felt in his arms of how his system reacted when she smiled of how her voice flowed warm and sweet so that a man didnt care what the words were as long as she spoke again he knew he could have her her response had been too quick and too encompassing before for either of them to pretend otherwise he knew she wanted him though it didnt sit well with her even now as he kissed her lightly avoiding her lips her breath was beginning to tremble hed never known a woman whose passion was so close to the surface now that she was here in his home he knew he wouldnt rest until he had all of it but she would come to him his pride demanded it so he teased her with his lips knowing he stirred her he teased her with his lips knowing he was slowly killing himself fair means or foul he murmured nipping gently at her earlobe i want you her eyes were closed how was it possible to be swept away so quickly to want so desperately what you knew you shouldnt have she put a hand to his chest willing it to be steady and youre used to taking what you want i understand that i wont deny you move something in me but im not here for the taking burke maybe not he murmured some women were only there for the earning i can be patient irish when a mans got the cards hes got to know when to hold and when to lay them on the table thoughtfully he ran a finger down her braid well play out this hand sooner or later ill let you get started erin waited until hed left before she let out a long breath how was it he could be that arrogant and still make her want to smile with a shake of her head she sat behind the desk in a plush leather chair that made her sigh burke was right about one thing she mused they would play out the hand sooner or later the problem was erin was afraid that even if she won shed lose chapter within a week erin had developed a routine that pleased her in the mornings she rose early enough to help dee ready the children for school then drove a borrowed car to the three aces to report to work by nine the mess of burkes bookkeeping had been an enormous understatement so had her estimate of his wealth as she tallied figures and pored over ledgers she tried to think of it in simple practical terms numbers after all were just numbers she was rarely interrupted and took her lunch from the silent rosa at her desk by the end of the first week shed made enough headway to feel pleased with herself only once or twice had she been made to feel foolish shed had to ask burke for the instruction book on the adding machine then shed asked him to supply her with a pencil sharpener hed simply picked up a cylinder with a hole in it and handed it to her and what good is this shed demanded it doesnt even have a crank hed picked up a pencil and shoved it in the hole then damn him had laughed when shed jumped at the grinding batteries hed said not magic shed gotten over that small humiliation by burying her face in the account books maybe she wasnt used to gadgets but by the saints shed balanced his books now she sat at the little electric typewriter and wrote up her weekly report after tidying her desk erin picked up her report and went to find burke his house was still almost completely uncharted territory to her in the atrium erin hesitated she could have called for rosa on the intercom but talking into the blasted thing always made her feel foolish instead erin set off in what she hoped was the general direction of the kitchen the place went on forever she thought and found it increasingly difficult not to open doors and peek inside as she went hearing a hum she turned in that direction dishwasher she thought or a washing machine with a shrug she decided shed find rosa at the end of it the woman was a mystery erin thought as she walked rosa rarely spoke and always seemed to know precisely where to find burke though the housekeeper referred to burke as mr logan erin sensed something less formal between them shed wondered though it hadnt brought her any pleasure if they were or had been lovers pushing the thought aside she moved to the south end of the house but it wasnt the kitchen she found or the laundry room as she pushed open one of a pair of double doors erin entered the tropics the pool was an inviting blue sparkling under the sun that poured through the glass roof and walls there were trees here the likes of which shed never seen planted in huge pottery urns and flowers she stepped in farther overwhelmed by the heady scent when she could still see the snow through the glass there were rich red petals brilliant orange and yellow exotic blues if she closed her eyes she imagined shed hear the chatter of parrots paradise she thought smiling as she walked farther with his eyes halfclosed and his body just beginning to relax burke watched her she didnt look sultry like the room but fresh untouched the sun was all over her hair drawing out the fire licking at the layers of light shed pulled it back in a band as hed seen her wear it in ireland and he could remember very well too well what it felt like to run his fingers through its mass he saw her reach for a flower as if her fingers itched to pick it then draw back her hand and bury her face in the blooms instead her laugh was quiet delighted and he knew she thought herself alone so the irish rose had a weakness for flowers he thought then watched her shake her head and look wonderingly longingly around and for money at the latter he shrugged his shoulders it was difficult for someone in his position to blame her he could blame her however for the fact that his body was no longer even close to relaxing want a swim irish at the sound of his voice she whirled around shed forgotten about the hum she saw its source now and burke in the middle of it another pool no not a pool she corrected she wasnt a complete dunderhead shed seen pictures of spas with their jets and bubbles and steamy water and she couldnt help for just a moment wondering what it felt like to lower ones body into it want to join me because he grinned when he said it erin merely shrugged thank you but ill be leaving for home in a few minutes ive finished for the day and brought you your first report he nodded but merely gestured to a white wicker chair beside the spa have a seat biting off a sigh erin did as he asked you may be a man of leisure yourself but ive things to do burke stretched his arms along the edge of the spa he didnt mention that hed been up and at the stables since dawn or that hed strained every muscle in his body overseeing the mating between a stud and a particularly highstrung mare youve still got a few minutes on the clock irish so how are my finances youre a rich man mr logan though how that might be with the mess your books were in amazes me ive done a bit of studying and come up with a new system the truth was shed spent two nights burning the midnight oil with books on accounting if you like ill wait until youve finished and go over it with you itll keep suit yourself by the end of next week i should have everything running smoothly enough thats good to know why dont you tell me how he stretched his shoulders erin watched the muscles ripple along the damp skin then deliberately shifted her gaze above his head this was no place for her to be she told herself especially when her mind was wandering away from accounting its all in this report if youd care to pull yourself out of the tub there and have a look at it have it your way burke pushed the button that shut off the jets then stood erins limbs went weak as she saw he wore no more than hed been born with she was grateful color didnt rise to her cheeks though she couldnt prevent some from leaving burke took a towel and swung it easily over his hips as he stepped from the spa youve no shame burke logan none at all well if youd meant to shock me ill have to disappoint you ive four brothers if youll remember and she glanced over again prepared to look at him without interest it was then she noticed the darkening bruise just under his left ribs youve hurt yourself she was up immediately and laying gentle fingers on it oh its a nasty one without thinking she took her fingers up over his ribs carefully checking you didnt break anything not so far he murmured he was standing very still the amusement hed felt completely wiped out her fingers felt so cool so tender on his skin she touched him as if she cared that was something hed learned to live a long time without itll look worse yet tomorrow she said with a cluck of her tongue you should put some liniment on it then she realized her fingers were spread over his chest and his chest was hard and smooth and wet erin snatched her hand away and stuck it behind her back howd you come by it the new colt i picked up in ireland she closed her hand into a fist it was damp from his skin youll have to give him more room next time the shudder inside her came as no surprise and was quickly controlled i intend to i have the highest respect for the irish temper and so you should if youd look over the report now i could answer any questions you might have before i leave burke picked up the neatly typed sheets erin found it necessary to clear her throat as she turned to look out through the glass now lightly fogged from the steam of the spa but she didnt see the snow she could still see him the long arms roped with muscle the hard chest glistening with water the narrow hips leading to taut thighs a fine specimen some would have said herself included and she could have murdered him for making her want it seems clear enough she jolted a bit then cursed herself you know your business erin but then i wouldnt have hired you if i hadnt believed that no he wouldnt have but hed have found some other way to bring her back with him got anything in mind for your first paycheck a thing or two she relaxed enough to smile at him schooling her gaze to go no lower than his neck half the money would be on its way to ireland in the morning and the rest she couldnt begin to think of it if youre satisfied ill be going home now im a long way from satisfied burke said under his breath listen did you ever think the bookkeeping would be more interesting if you knew more about the stables the racing no then she moved her shoulders as the thought hed planted took root i suppose it might though ive got a horse running tomorrow why dont you come along see where the money comes from and where it goes go to the races she caught her lip between her teeth as she thought of it could i bet theres a woman after my heart be ready at eight ill take you around the stables and paddock first all right good day to you she started out then glanced over her shoulder id put some witch hazel on that bruise erin paced the living room it was her first day off and she was going to spend it at the races there would be mobs of people shed never met shed hear dozens of voices for the first time she ran a hand down her hair and hoped she looked all right not for burke she thought quickly for herself that was all she wanted to look nice to feel she looked nice when she stood in the midst of all those people the minute she heard burkes car she was racing out of the house she hesitated on the steps staring down at the firered sports car with its long sleek hood she made a mental note of the make so she could write home and tell brian youre prompt burke commented as she climbed in beside him im excited it didnt seem foolish to admit it now ive never been to the races before cullen has and he told me the horses are beautiful and the people fascinating faith look at all these dials she studied the dash youd have to be an engineer to drive it want to try when she glanced at him and saw he was serious she was sorely tempted but she remembered all the cars that had been on the highway when theyd driven from the airport ill just watch for now when does the racing start weve got plenty of time hows dee shes fine the doctor gave her a clean checkup but told her she had to stay off her feet a bit she grumbles because she cant spend as much time down at the stables but were keeping her busy the snows melting a few more days like weve been having and itll be gone i hope not i like to look at it she settled back deciding that riding in the sports car was like riding on the wind are you going to be warm enough she asked looking at his light jacket and jeans theres still a bite in the air dont worry so what do you like best about america so far besides the snow the way you talk she said instantly talk you know the accent its charming charming he glanced over at her then laughed until the bruise began to throb still chuckling he rubbed a hand over it absently is that troubling you what this no did you use witch hazel he knew better than to laugh again i couldnt put my hands on any id imagine youd have a case or two of horse liniment down in the stables oh look at the little planes when he turned into the airport she looked over at him what are we doing here taking a ride on one of the little planes her stomach did a quick flipflop but i thought we were going to the races we are my horse is racing at hialeah thats in florida whats florida burke paused in the act of swinging his door closed on the other side of the car erin stared at him south he told her and held out a hand too excited to think too terrified to object erin found herself bundled onto a plane the cabin was so small that even she had to stoop a bit but when she sat the chair was soft and roomy burke sat across from her and indicated the seat belt once hers was secured he flipped the switch on an intercom were set here tom okay mr logan looks like smooth sailing skies are clear except for a little patch in the carolinas we ought to be able to avoid most of them when she heard and felt the engines start erin gripped the arms of the chair are you sure this things safe lifes a gamble irish she nearly babbled before she caught the amusement in his eyes deliberately she made her hands relax so it is as the plane started to roll she looked out the window within minutes the ground was tilting away under them its quite a sight isnt it she smiled leaning a little closer to the window when all of you landed in cork i looked at the plane and wondered what it would be like to sit inside now i know how is it she gave him a sideways smile well theres no champagne there can be at half past eight in the morning with a laugh she sat back again i think not i should have thanked you for asking me to go today the grants have been nothing but kind to me so im really grateful to give them a day to themselves is that the only reason you should have thanked me he stood and went into a little alcove no i appreciate the chance to go you want cream in this coffee aye he could have said youre welcome she thought then let it pass nothing was going to spoil her mood when he sat she took the cup but was too wound up to drink will you give me an answer if i ask a question thats none of my business burke drew out a cigar then lit it ill give you an answer but not necessarily the truth he kicked out his legs then rested his ankles on the seat beside her did you really win three aces in a poker game he blew out smoke yes and no thats not an answer at all yes i played poker with cunningham quite a bit of poker with cunningham and he lost heavily when you gamble you have to know when to stick and when to walk away he didnt so you won the farm from him shed like that he thought watching her eyes he imagined she saw a smoky liquorscented room with two men bent over five cards each and the deed to the farm between them in a manner of speaking i won money from him more money than he had to lose he didnt have enough cash to pay me or for that matter to pay certain other parties who were growing tired of holding ious in the end i bought the farm from him dirt cheap oh it wasnt quite as romantic you must have been rich before then you could say my luck was on an upswing at the time gamblings no way to make a living it beats sweeping floors since she could only agree erin fell silent a moment did you know about horses before i knew they had four legs but when youve got your money riding on a game you learn fast where did you learn to keep books arithmetic came easily to me when i could i took courses in school then i started to run the books at the farm it was more satisfying than morning milking then because everyone knows what everyone else is up to back home i found myself working for mrs malloy then mr odonnelly i worked for francis duggan at the market for a time too but his son donald thought i should marry him and have ten children so i had to let that job go you didnt want to marry donald duggan and spend my life counting potatoes and turnips no thank you it came to the point where i knew i had to either black both his eyes or give up the job it seemed easier to give up the job what are you smiling at i was just thinking that donald duggan was lucky you didnt carry a rake erin tilted her head as she studied him its you whore lucky i held myself back comfortable now she tucked her legs under her and sipped her cooling coffee tell me about the horse youre racing today double bluff hes a twoyearold temperamental and nervy unless hes running hes proved himself from his first race took the florida derby last weekend thats the biggest purse in the state aye i heard travis mention it he seems to think this horse is the best hes seen in a decade is it might be in any case hell be my derby entry this year his sire won over a million dollars in purses in his career and his dam was the offspring of a triple crown winner likes to come from behind on the outside he took another puff and again erin noticed the scar along his knuckles you sound as though youre fond of him he was and that fact was a constant surprise burke only shrugged hes a winner what about the one you bought in ireland the one who kicked you im going to start him off locally charles town laurel pimlico so i can keep an eye on him if my hunch is right hell double what i paid for him in a year and if your hunch was wrong they arent often in any case id still consider my trip to ireland paid off she wasnt completely comfortable with the way he looked at her being a gambler she said evenly youd know how to lose i know how to win better she set her coffee down how did you get the scar on your hand he didnt glance at it as most people would but tapped out his cigar as he watched her broken bottle of texas star in a bar fight outside of el paso there was a disagreement over a hand of sevencard stud and a pretty blonde did you win the hand the woman wasnt worth it i suppose it makes more sense to gash your hand open over a game of cards than it does for a woman depends on what the woman on the game irish it always depends on the game when they arrived erin stepped off the plane into another new world burke had told her to leave her coat on the plane but even so she hadnt been expecting the warmth or the glare of the sun palm trees she managed then laughed and grabbed burkes hands those are palm trees no fooling before she had a chance to be annoyed he swung an arm over her shoulders and swept her away there was a car waiting for them erin slipped inside wanting to pretend she did such things every day theres no handle for the window she began burke leaned over and pressed the button to lower it oh after ten seconds she gave up trying to be poised i cant believe it its so warm and the flowers oh my mother would die for the flowers its like that room in your house with all the glass two weeks ago i was scrubbing mrs malloys floor and now im looking at palm trees he drove competently without asking directions or checking a map erin realized this life wasnt new to him here she was babbling and sounding like a fool she made one attempt to restrain herself then gave it up it didnt matter how she sounded he hadnt realized hed get such enjoyment out of seeing someone take little things and make them special for a moment he wished they could just keep driving so that she would go on talking laughing asking questions hed nearly forgotten there were people who could still find things fresh and new no matter how often theyd been used traveling was a profession to him and like most professional travelers hed long ago stopped looking at what was around him now with erin pointing out white sand young skateboarders and towering hotels he began to remember what it was like to see something for the first time they knew him at the track erin noticed as they walked over the green lawn toward the spread of stables that people nodded in his direction or greeted him as mr logan there were jockeys and trainers and grooms already preparing for the afternoon races logan erin glanced over and saw a big potbellied man in a straw hat she saw the flash of a diamond on his finger and the light film of sweat the heat had already drawn on his face durnam didnt know you were coming down for a looksee i like to keep an eye on things your horse ran well last week at charles town i didnt know you were there i wasnt erin mckinnon charlie durnam he owns durnam stables in lexington real horse country maam he took her hand and flashed her a smile a pleasure a real pleasure nobody picks the fillies like logan i wont be running any races mr durnam she told him but she smiled judging him harmless from ireland are you shes adelia grants cousin burke spoke mildly giving durnam a straight look until he released erins hand well aint that something i tell you maam any friend of the grants is a friend of charlie durnams fine people thank you mr durnam im going to go check on my horse charlie see you around take a look at charlies pride while youre at it he called after them thats a real piece of horseflesh what a funny man erin murmured that funny man has one of the best stables in the country and a roving eye she glanced back over her shoulder and chuckled his eye can rove all it pleases i cant imagine he has much luck on a landing youd be surprised the kind of luck ten or fifteen million can buy burke nodded to a groom im running against him today is that so erin tossed her hair back and was sure the sun had never shone brighter then youll just have to beat him wont you with a grin burke put his arm around her shoulders again i intend to he walked by a few stalls erin cautiously kept on the far side of him the smell of horse and hay was familiar and so was the little knot in her stomach ignore it she told herself stepping up beside burke as he stopped at a stall this is double bluff she judged the dark bay to be about fifteen hands broad at the chest and streamlined for speed the beauty of him struck her first then she froze when he tossed his head hes a big one her throat had gone bonedry but she forced herself to take one step closer ready to win with a laugh burke reached up to stroke his nose the colts ears came forward in acknowledgment but he continued to prance impatient this one hates to wait hes an arrogant devil and i think he might just win three aces its first triple crown what do you think of him hes lovely erin had taken a step backward the first time the colt had looked in her direction im sure hell do you proud lets have a closer look make sure the grooms done his job burke opened the stall door and stepped in erin steeled herself and with her heart pounding walked to the opening you look good fella burke ran his hands over the colts flank then dipped under him to check the other side he lifted each hoof then nodded in approval clean as a whistle wait until they put a saddle on him the minute they do hes ready you have to hold him back from the starting gate as if he understood double bluff pawed the ground he tossed up his head and whinnied as burke laughed erin fainted dead away when she surfaced there was an arm supporting her something cool and wet was being urged through her lips she swallowed reflexively then opened her eyes what happened you tell me burkes voice was rough but the hand that stroked her cheek was gentle probably too much sun erin heard the drawled pronouncement and shifted her gaze beyond burkes shoulder she saw a young face and a thatch of sandy hair thats right she said grabbing the excuse im fine now just sit still burke held her down as she tried to get up its okay bobby ill handle it from here yes sir mr logan you take it easy now miss stay in the shade thank you oh erin closed her eyes and cursed herself for seven kinds of a fool im sorry i caused a scene i dont know what could have happened you were fine one minute and in a heap the next and nothing absolutely nothing in his life had ever scared him so badly youre still pale why dont we take bobbys advice and get you up and into some shade aye she let out a breath of relief just as burke started to help her up double bluff stuck his head out again and shook the stall door with a muffled cry erin threw her arms around burkes neck and clung it took him only a moment to put one and one together for gods sake erin why didnt you tell me you were afraid of horses im not nitwit he muttered hauling her unceremoniously into his arms dont carry me ive had enough humiliation already shut up when he judged they were far enough away from the stables he set her down under a palm if youd had the brains to tell me you wouldnt have shaved ten years off my life with another oath he dropped down beside her his heart had yet to resume its normal rhythm the last thing im wanting from you is a lecture she would have stood and stormed away but she knew her legs werent ready to carry her besides there was nothing to tell i thought i was over it you thought wrong then because she was still pale he relented and took her hand why dont you tell me about it its childish tell me anyway we had some field horses two good ones she let out a long breath he could hardly think her any more of a fool then he did now we had them out and a storm was coming up brian unhooked the one to take him back to the barn there was a lot of thunder and lightning so the horses were nervous joe was unhooking the second and i was at the head trying to calm him i dont know it happened fast lightning spooked him and he reared god those hooves are big when theyre over your head she shuddered once i fell and he ran right over me oh god burke tightened his fingers on her hand i was lucky it wasnt that bad a couple of broken ribs only bruises but ive just never been able to get too close to one without panicking if youd told me i never would have brought you i thought id beaten it by now it was more than five years ago stupid she ran a hand over her face then tucked back her hair ive been making excuses all week to dee and travis why i dont go down to the stables why dont you just tell them when she only shrugged he shifted closer its not half as stupid to be afraid as it is to be ashamed of it her chin came up then she sighed maybe avoiding his eyes she plucked a blade of grass dont tell them more secrets patiently he caught her chin in his hand and turned her face to his it was far more difficult to resist her now when her cheeks were pale her eyes a little damp and the vulnerability like a sheen on her skin you shouldnt worry so much about what people think of you i know you wash dishes and faint at the sight of horses but i still like you do you a reluctant smile tugged at her mouth really well enough unaccustomed to resisting any desire for long he lowered his mouth to hers to taste to nibble to explore she lifted a hand to his chest as if to hold him off but then her fingers simply curled into his shirt and held him there his other kisses hadnt made her feel peaceful or secure anything but yet this one was different even as excitement shimmered warm in her stomach she felt safe maybe it was the way his hand curved around her neck with his fingers gentle and soothing or maybe it was the way his lips made hers feel soft and tingly he wanted to draw her close to cuddle her to rock her on his lap and murmur foolish things hed never had that urge with a woman before it was an odd and uneasy sensation and at the same time comforting he drew away slightly but kept her close ill take you home home but i want to see the races for some reason she felt as though she could face anything at that moment im fine i promise you besides maybe if i can learn to watch them from a distance i wont freeze up when im near one she stood grateful that her legs were sturdy again come now burke we didnt fly all the way to where are we florida he told her and rose aye florida to turn right around and go home again that great beast in there is going to win isnt he ive got my money on him and ive got ten more on the nose with a laugh he accepted the hand she held out lets go get a seat the stands were already filling up in them erin indeed saw many faces tanned and sunburned ones faces with lines spreading out from the eyes and more with skin as smooth as new cream some people pored over racing forms others smoked fat cigars or sipped from plastic cups but in the boxes was elegance the kind that spoke of confidence and poise sheer summer dresses in pastels mixed well with light cotton suits and straw hats she saw more than one tanned slender woman tilt a head in burkes direction now and then he lifted a hand but he made no effort to mix with them from burkes box in the front she could see the wide brown oval where the horses would ran and the lush green infield filled with tropical flowers and pink flamingos still farther away were more stands with more people every minute more were filing in ive never seen so many people in one place at one time and theyre all here to watch the race want a beer erin nodded absently and continued to take in everything as burke left her she spotted durnam not far away talking to a woman in the tiniest pair of shorts erin had ever seen erin passed over him and looked at the electronic board that was beginning to flash with numbers and odds for the first race i want you to explain to me what it all means up there erin began before burke had a chance to sit down again so ill know best how to bet if you want a tip youll wait for the third race bet on number five why the horse is out of royal meadows sentiment aside hes a strong runner records a little shaky but he looks good today first race is anybodys game so far the odds arent spectacular are you betting on it no i thought you were a gambler i like to pick my own game erin sat back and listened to the announcements for the first race crystal maiden sounds pretty pretty names dont win races hold on to your money irish she settled back and contented herself with absorbing the sounds and sights around her by the time the horses were brought to the starting gate she was leaning forward in her chair they are beautiful she said but she felt a great deal better when burkes hand rested lightly on hers her pulse was hammering he gauged it to be almost as much from excitement as nerves hed been right about the contradictions in her as the gates opened her fingers linked hard with his but she didnt cringe what a noise she murmured while her heart beat almost as loudly as hooves on turf as they rounded the first turn she strained to keep following them that was power she thought both raw and controlled they might well have made it a business but she could see why it had been and was still the sport of kings when it was over she laid a hand on her breast my hearts still pounding dont smile at me like that she warned but laughed with it its the most wonderful thing ive ever seen all those colors all that energy can you imagine doing this every day there are plenty who do but she only shook her head today was special a onceinalifetime day i want to bet on the next one third race burke repeated and sipped his beer when her time came she insisted on betting herself erin put the stub in the pocket of her shirt then changed her mind and tucked it carefully in her billfold seated beside burke again she fretted until the horses were brought to the gate i dont mind losing she said with a quick grin but id sure as hell like to win better when they were off she stood and leaned against the rail which one is he she demanded grabbing burkes hand to drag him forward with her fourth back on the inside redandgold silks aye she watched urging him on he runs well doesnt he yes oh look hes moving up better hang on irish theyve got half a mile to go but hes moving up she gave a hoot of laughter as she pointed hes in second now there was shouting all around her competing with the announcer and the thundering of hooves erin strained to hear all three as she grabbed burkes shirt and tugged hes taken the lead look at him she spun away from the rail and into burkes arms as he finished half a length ahead he won won laughing she kissed burke hard how much mercenary little witch its nothing to do with mercenary and everything to do with winning im going home and tell dee i bet on her horse and won how much the odds were five to one fifty dollars she gave another peal of laughter ill buy the next beer she took him by the hand when does your horse race in the fifth thank goodness itll give me time to recover she bought him a beer then went one better and bought them both hot dogs the only time she could remember spending such a frivolous day was at a fair this seemed like one to her with the noise and smells and colors she had another ticket in her pocket and burkes sunglasses on by the time the fifth race was announced i really hope he wins she told him with her mouth full not just because i bet on him either that makes two of us how does it feel to own one she wondered not just a horse but a horse from a great line most of the time its like having an expensive lover one you have to keep happy and lavish money on for moments of intense gratification erin turned and tipping the glasses down looked at him over them youre full of blarney at the very least he turned and watched his horse charge through the gate how did it feel burke asked himself how did it feel for a dirtpoor bastard from new mexico to sit and watch his sixfigure horse come flying by incredible so incredible he couldnt begin to describe it and wasnt sure he wanted to it could all be gone tomorrow and what of it hed taught himself long ago that when you held on to something too tightly it squeezed through your fingers he was giving three aces the best he had though hed never intended to get involved with the running of it hed certainly never intended to get attached to it he worked better on the move yet hed been in one place for four years just recently hed been telling himself that maybe it was time for him to get a manager for the place and take an extended vacation monte carlo san juan tahoe if a man stuck with one game too long didnt he get stale but then hed gone to ireland and had come back with erin the damnedest thing was he wasnt thinking about monte carlo or playing the wheel anymore it was becoming easier and easier to stay in one place and think about one woman you won suddenly she was laughing and her arms were around his neck you won by two lengths maybe three i couldnt tell oh burke im so pleased for you are you hed forgotten the race the horse and the bet of course i am its wonderful that your horse won and he looked so beautiful doing it and im happy for me too she grinned the odds were eight to five then he stunned her by dragging her closer and kissing her with a power and passion that left her limp she didnt protest but held trapped in his arms allowed herself to be buffeted by the storm the hell with the odds burke muttered and kissed her again chapter one didnt know what to think no one could have been kinder than burke the day erin had spent with him shed watched the races the strong beautiful horses striving for speed shed seen women dressed in elegant clothes and jockeys in brilliant silks shed heard the noises that came from thousands of people in the same place shed seen exotic birds and flowers had sipped champagne in a private plane but her clearest memory of the day was of sitting on the grass in burkes arms she didnt know what to think since then the days had passed routinely erin had to remind herself she was doing exactly what shed set out to do making a wage starting a life seeing new things but burkes visits to her office had become few and far between she began to catch herself watching the door and wishing it would open she told herself that her feelings for him were surface ones he made her laugh showed her exciting things and could be kind enough when it suited him he was just arrogant enough to keep an edge on without alienating her a woman could like a man like that without putting her heart at risk couldnt she a woman could even kiss a man like that without falling too deep wasnt that right and yet she knew shed come to the point where she thought of him a bit too easily and watched for him far too often hed stayed away from her long enough that was what burke told himself as he came in through the back of the house from the stables hed stayed away from her since their quick trip to florida because his feelings were mixed he was used to clear thinking and welldefined emotions not this jumbled mess of needs and restraint he couldnt stop thinking about the way shed looked at the track watching the horses race by shed been vivid excited exciting the kind of woman he could handle yet he couldnt stop thinking about the way shed looked when shed fainted all but at his feet shed been pale and helpless frightened hed needed to protect and soothe hed never wanted the responsibility of a woman who needed protection or care yet he wanted erin she wasnt the kind of woman you took to bed for a night of mutual enjoyment then strolled away from yet he wanted her for all her strong talk she was a woman who would put down roots and sink them deep hed never wanted the restriction or the responsibility of a home in the true sense yet he still wanted erin mckinnon and hed stayed away from her long enough when he walked into the office she was marking in the ledger in her clear careful hand she knew it was him even without looking she knew but made herself finish before she glanced up hello i havent seen much of you lately ive been busy thats clear from the papers on my desk ive just paid your vet bill dr harrigan back home could live a year off what you pay a month are the new foals well theyll do i see youve hired a new stable boy my trainer sees to the hiring erin lifted a brow so he was going to play master of the estate was he i see your ante up ran well at santa anita reading the sports page these days i figure living with the grants and working for you i should keep up erin picked up her pencil again now that weve had such a pleasant little talk ill get back to work unless theres something youre wanting come with me what i said come with me before either of them had a chance to think it through he took her arm and hauled her to her feet wheres your coat why where are we going instead of answering he glanced around and spotted it folded on a chair put this on he told her then even as he thrust it at her he began to walk a fine thing erin began breathlessly as he pulled her down the hall interrupting my work in the middle of the day dragging me off without any explanation just because you pay me burke logan doesnt mean i have to jump at your bidding an employee has rights in this country which reminds me ive been meaning to ask you about my paid holidays you learn fast he muttered as he pushed the door open if you dont let go of my arm i wont be able to put it in my coat when he did erin rammed her arm in the sleeve but left the coat unbuttoned sure and its a fine day the grounds a bit of a mess with the snow melting but thats all the better for spring growing if that was all you wanted to show me ill go back to work she managed to hiss out a protest when he grabbed her arm and began walking again burke what the devils got into you if theres something you want me to do or see fine but theres no need to strongarm me how long have you been working for me three weeks giving up erin matched her stride to his and in three weeks youve barely poked your head out of the office i work in the office she reminded him did it ever occur to you that you cant understand the work if youve never looked at where the money comes from or where it goes i thought thats why we went to the races theres more to this place than one race why do i have to understand as long as the figures tally he wasnt sure of the answer himself but he knew he wanted her to see what was his to understand it to move closer to it pushing the hair out of her eyes she glanced up at him his profile was set and she thought she detected a shadow in his eyes is there something troubling you no he said it sharply almost defensively then made himself relax no nothing except the need tethered tight inside him that strained hard at the scent of her what the hell was happening to a man who could only think of one woman of one voice of one taste she continued to walk beside him in silence but she noticed the crocuses big fat purple ones that pushed their way up through the soggy ground unmindful of the patches of snow she saw the way the land sloped the way the sun slanted over it and she saw the stables with their white wood gleaming in the sunlight she saw the checkerboard of paddocks and the long oval track where even now a horse was being ridden why its lovely she murmured like something out of a book you must be proud that its yours he wasnt sure he had been but he stopped and looked out as she did hed won it fairly but then hed won and lost a great deal in his life it had never been his intention to stay but rather reorganize so that the gamble paid off hed come into this knowing little about horses and nothing about racing or breeding and had told himself hed better learn in order to turn a true profit that had been four years ago and he was still here looking out with erin beside him he began to understand why it was lovely it was his and it was and would always be a gamble keeping erins hand in his he began to walk again weve got thirty horses two of which are studs that do nothing but please the ladies and themselves erin added two of the mares just foaled and weve two more that are due any day nearly half of whats left are being trained for next year at the moment ive got five prime twoyearolds and a few veterans that have another season or two in them before they go out to stud or retirement there you see the horse being exercised now thats one of the pair i picked up in ireland erin looked back at the track the rider was up in the stirrups and bent low but he earned no more than a glance the horse was magnificent a chestnut with a slash down his face like white lightning already his legs were spreading out in a rhythm that picked up speed and pounded on the soggy track hes fast and mean as hell that would be the one that kicked you erin looked back again beautiful he might be but shed keep her distance if hes badtempered why did you buy him i liked his style as he started to walk again erin held back id just as soon not be on closer acquaintance i want to show you something else erin told herself to relax as she walked with him if youd told me we were going tramping around the yard id have worn boots he glanced down but kept walking you could use some new shoes anyway thank you very much id have thought youd have gone shopping by now with a couple of paychecks under your belt im thinking about it they passed the stables where the scent of horses and wet grass was strong she could hear men talking inside erin braced herself but he continued to walk then she saw the paddock where the mare was standing nursing a fawncolored foal thats one of the newest residents of three aces cautiously erin approached the fence theyre sweet when theyre little arent they she relaxed enough to curl her hands over the top rail and lean a little closer the air was mild with just a hint of spring it wasnt the green or the scent of ireland but she found herself suddenly content we never had much time to think of an animal as any more than a means to an end she smiled as the foal burrowed deeper and sucked joe was always the one for animals cooing at them and stroking hed love to see this you miss your family its strange not seeing them every day i hadnt realized she let the words trail off word from home is everyones fine cullens back in dublin playing at one of the clubs and brians taken a fancy to mary margaret shannesy ma says hes making a fool of himself but thats to be expected the foal having had his fill began to scamper around the paddock erin watched him absently thinking of home franks wifes nearly ready to have the baby i could be an aunt already its funny most mornings when i wake up i think its time to go down to the henhouse but theres no henhouse here the foal came over to the fence to sniff at her without thinking erin reached out a hand and rubbed between his ears do you wish there were i suppose i could live my life happily enough without gathering eggs again she glanced down and focusing on the foal started to draw her hand back automatically burke set his on top of hers and rested it on the foals head trusting little soul isnt he aye but his mother is probably relieved that hes distracted for a few minutes sometimes if youre afraid its best to face it in small doses i suppose the foal was soft as butter and nuzzled its nose between the rails to nip at her coat find something else to chew on she said laughing its all i brought with me finding nothing of interest the foal scampered away to race around his mother will he be a champion if its in the cards erin stepped away from the fence and dipping her hands in her coat pockets looked at him why did you bring me out here i dont know he didnt think about the men walking around the yard and going in and out of the stables he thought only of her as he lifted a hand to her cheek why should it matter had it come so far so fast that it only took the touch of his fingers on her skin to send her heart racing inside her pockets the palms of her hands grew damp i think it does and i think i should go back in youve faced one fear today why not face another im not afraid of you that was true and she felt a surge of relief that it was her heart might not be steady but it wasnt in fear that it raced maybe not he slid his hand from her cheek to the back of her neck as he drew her closer he was afraid afraid of what she was doing to him without his planning without his calculations she yearned toward him she strained away i dont think its wise for you to kiss me that way again all right well try another way so he nibbled teasing tempting tormenting she felt the scrape of his teeth then the moist trace of his tongue her hand went to his cheek and rested there as she opened herself for an emotional assault like nothing shed ever experienced so he could be sweet and patient and alluring she hadnt known her fingers crept into his hair as her lips parted and invited no she wasnt afraid not of him if what he brought to her was more than shed ever imagined then she was willing even eager to accept it with a sigh she tilted her head back and let him take he held himself back the more generosity she showed him the more wary he became of accepting burning inside him was a desire to sweep her away to some dim private place where they could both take their fill to touch her he pressed his lips over hers and imagined how it would be to fill his hands with her no barriers while her teeth nipped gently he imagined what it would feel like to have her flesh slide warm over his there was such a flavor here warm and wild and willing but he wanted more than her mouth as her sigh whispered into him he knew he needed more he took his hand to her hair and held her close against him i want you to stay with me tonight stay she floated up out of the dream and was stunned by the heat and passion that had turned his eyes to smoke stay he repeated tonight damn it more than tonight get your things and bring them here the thrill moved through her there was something in the command in the look in his eyes as he gave it that called to her even as it raised her hackles move in with you she lifted her hands to his chest and struggled to keep her voice calm you want me to live under your roof eat your food sleep in your bed i want you with me you know damn well ive wanted that since the first time i put my hands on you aye maybe i did but what i agreed to do was work for you she tilted her head back again but not in surrender this time yes shed been willing to accept the feelings he stirred in her but not to compromise her principles for them do you think id be your mistress do you think id let you keep me in your fine house no ones talking about keeping no youre not a man for keeping are you but for taking enjoying and moving on ill tell you now no matter how you make me feel how you make me want ill not be any mans mistress it was foolish to be hurt ridiculous to be insulted but she was both erin jerked out of his hold and stood with her feet planted if i kiss you its because it pleasures me to do so and nothing more ill not live in your house shaming my family until youre tired of me she tossed back her hair and crossed her arms ill be going back to work now and youd best keep out of my way unless you want to explain to your men why the payroll isnt done she turned on her heel and strode away burke leaned back against the paddock fence a smart man would have folded his cards and pushed away from the table he figured hed stay for the next hand and see where the chips fell whether she was feeling festive or not erin was swept along in her cousins plans for the party and what better day to celebrate than st patricks day erin decided if thered been a dog around shed surely have kicked it no come live with me and be my love from the likes of burke logan she thought she attacked a silver platter with a polishing cloth as though she could have rubbed through the metal oh no with him it was just pack your things and be quick about it hah as if shed want pretty words from that swine of a man the truth of it was erin mckinnon didnt want pretty words from anyone what she wanted was to be left alone to pursue her new career in six months shed have a place of her own and a new job altogether she decided shed find a job where she didnt have to put up with a man who made her laugh one minute and steam the next and steam in more ways than one she added as she tossed the polishing cloth aside turning the platter over she studied her own reflection he was toying with her he was hadnt she known that right from the beginning well what was fine for him was fine for her she could do some toying herself and tonight was as good a time as any to start it from what dee had told her there would be plenty of men at the party tonight including a certain snake in the grass have you finished scowling at yourself from the other side of the table dee set aside another tray almost thats good then because weve only a couple more hours rising she stacked the bowls and platters beside the crystal between hannah and the caterers the rest could be easily handled is there anything youd like to talk to me about no nothing that might have to do with why youve been muttering to yourself for the past week or so erin set her teeth then dropped her chin on her hand i think american men are even more rude and arrogant than irish men ive always thought it was a draw adelia came over to lay a hand on her shoulder has burke been troubling you to say the least something in the way erin said it caused dee to smile he has a way with him not my way well then we wont be worrying about him anymore weve a party to get ready for erin nodded as she rose shed known she was in trouble as soon as shed seen the silver and crystal things had only gotten worse when shed watched the team of caterers descend to fuss over things like salmon mousse and gooseliver pate shed seen the cases of champagne delivered cases by god then there was the black caviar shed managed to sample while no one was looking and there were the flowers tubs of them that were being arranged even as she walked with dee down the hall a madhouse isnt it dee began when they started up the stairs later if youve had your fill of hearing about horses and tracks and stud fees just send me a sign i like listening its a bit like learning a new language its all of that dee moved into her room and took a large box off the bed happy st patricks day automatically erin put her hands behind her back what is it its a present of course arent you going to take it theres no need for you to give me presents no but i didnt think of it as a need pride was something adelia understood too well her own had been bruised repeatedly id like you to have it erin from all of us as a kind of welcome to a new place when i came here i had only uncle paddy i think i understand now how happy it made him to share with me please i dont mean to seem ungrateful good then youll pretend to like it even if you dont dee sat on the bed and gestured with both hands open it ive never been long on patience erin hesitated only another moment then laid the box on the bed to draw off the top under a cushion of tissue paper was dark green silk oh what a color its expected today well take it out she demanded im dying to see if its right on you cautiously erin touched the silk with her fingertips then lifted the dress from the box the material draped softly in the front and simply fell away altogether in the back to a slim skirt dee rose to hold the dress in front of her cousin i knew it she said and her face lit up i was sure it was right oh erin youll be dazzling its the most beautiful thing ive ever seen almost reverently she brushed her fingers over the skirt it feels like sin aye then with a laugh dee stepped back for a better viewpoint itll look like it too there wont be a man able to keep his eyes in his head youre kinder to me than i deserve probably gathering up the box she handed it to erin go put it on fuss with yourself awhile erin kissed her cheek then letting her feelings spread she gave her cousin a hard laughing hug thank you ill be ready in ten minutes take your time erin paused at the door no the sooner i have it on the longer i can wear it the party was already underway when burke drove up hed nearly bypassed it altogether restless and edgy hed thought about driving up to atlantic city placing a few bets spinning a few wheels that was his milieu he told himself casinos with bright lights back rooms with dim ones a party with the racing class with their old money and closed circles wasnt his style he told himself he was here because of the grants the fact that erin would be there hadnt swayed him so he told himself since their last encounter hed nearly talked himself out of believing there was something between them oh a spark certainly a frisson a lick or two of flame but that was all that overwhelming and undesirable feeling that there was something deeper something truer had only been his imagination he hadnt come tonight to prove that either so he told himself it was travis who let him in burke could hear voices raised in the living and dining rooms along with the piping irish music that set the tone dee was worried about you travis closed the door on the nippy midmarch air outside i had a few things to see to no problems no problems burke assured him but if that was true he wondered why his shoulders were tensed why he felt ready to jump in any direction youll know just about everyone here travis was saying as he led him into the living room youve got quite a crowd burke murmured and was already searching through it though he didnt move beyond the doorway i think youll see that dees outdone herself in more ways than one with the slightest gesture travis had burkes gaze traveling to the far end of the room and erin he hadnt known she could look like that coolly sexy polished she was sipping champagne and laughing over the rim of her glass at lloyd pentel heir to one of the oldest and most prestigious farms in virginia flanking her were two more men he recognized thirdand fourthgeneration racing barons with ivy league educations and practiced moves burke felt his blood heat as one of them leaned close to murmur something in her ear both amused and sympathetic travis laid a hand on burkes shoulder beer whiskey he downed the first one easily appreciating its bite but it did nothing to relax his muscles he took a second and sipped it more slowly erin was perfectly aware that he was there she doubted hed been in the room ten seconds before shed felt his presence she smiled and flirted with lloyd and the others who wandered her way and told herself she was having a wonderful time but she never stopped watching burke and the women who gravitated to him adelia had been right the talk was horses purses the size of which made the head reel were discussed and the politics of racing dissected erin took it in determined to hold her own but as she nursed her single glass of champagne her gaze kept roaming the man didnt even have the courtesy to say how do you do she decided but then he seemed more interested in the leggy blonde than in manners erin accepted a dance with lloyd and if he held her a bit too close she ignored it and watched burke it didnt appear to bother her to have the young pentel stud pawing her burke noted as he swirled his whiskey and where in the hell had she gotten that dress setting down his whiskey he lit a cigar she was nothing to get worked up over he reminded himself if she wanted to wear a dress that was cut past discretion and bat her baby blues at pentel that was her business the hell it was burke crushed out his cigar and leaving the blonde who had snuggled up beside him staring walked over to erin pentel annoyed but as wellbred as his fathers prize colt lloyd nodded logan i have to borrow erin a minute business before either of them could object burke had maneuvered his way between and had erin in his arms youre a rude shameless man burke logan she was delighted i wouldnt talk about shameless while youre wearing that dress do you like it id be interested to hear what your father would say about it youre not my father though she smiled there was more challenge than humor in the curve of lips doesnt a man like you worry about luck burke no wearing of the green on st patricks day who says im not his eyes tossed the challenge right back money doesnt count i was talking about something more personal than money if you want to go somewhere private ill be happy to show you where im wearing my green im sure you would she murmured and tried not to be amused now what business do we have he wasnt holding her as close not nearly as close as lloyd had been but she felt the pull of him youve come a long way from dancing in moonlit fields irish aye some of the pleasure went out of her as she studied him what does that mean youre an ambitious woman one who wants things big things god it was driving him mad to be this close to smell her as he had once before in a dim garden shed with rain pelting the roof and what of it lloyd pentels not a bad choice to give it to you hes young rich not nearly as shrewd as his old man the kind of man a smart woman could twist easily around her finger its kind of you to point that out she said in a voice that was very low and very cold she didnt know what possessed her to go on but whatever it was she swore she wouldnt regret it but why should i settle for the colt when i can have the stallion the old mans a widower burkes mouth thinned as he smiled you work fast and you the skinny blondes still pouting after you it must be rewarding to walk into a room and have six females trip over themselves to get to you it has its compensations well why dont you get back to them she started to pull away but his hand pressed into her back so that their bodies bumped the flame that was never quite controlled flared at the contact damn you she said from the heart as he tightened his fingers on hers im tired of playing games he had her across the room and into the hall before she found the breath to speak what are you doing were leaving wheres your coat im not going anywhere and i he merely stripped off his jacket and tossed it over her shoulders before he yanked her outside get in the car go to hell he grabbed her then hard and fast therell be little doubt of that after tonight when his mouth came down on hers her first reaction was to fight free for this was a man to fear but that reaction was so quickly buried under desire that she moved to him get in the car erin she stood at the base of the steps a moment knowing no matter how strong how determined he was the choice would be hers she opened the door herself and got in without looking back chapter had she lost her mind erin sat in burkes car watching his headlights cut through the night and heard nothing but the sound of her own heart pounding in her ears she must be mad to have thrown all caution all sense all pretense of propriety to the winds why had no one ever told her that madness felt like freedom shed never been selfdestructive or had she she asked herself almost giddy from the speed and the night and the man beside her perhaps that was one more thing hed recognized in her a need to take risks and damn the consequences if that wasnt true why didnt she tell him to stop to turn back erin gripped her fingers together until the knuckles turned white she wasnt at all sure hed listen but that wasnt the reason she didnt speak no the reason she didnt speak was that shed lost more than her mind her heart was lost as well perhaps one was the same as the other erin thought surely it was a kind of madness to love him but love him she did in a way shed never imagined she could love anyone there was a ferocity to it an edgy sort of desperation that didnt swell the heart so much as tighten it indeed it felt like a hard hot lump beneath her breast even now was this the way love should feel shouldnt she know there should be a warmth a comfort a sweetness not this wild combination of power and terror though she searched she could find no tenderness in her feelings perhaps they were a reflection of his at a glance she could see no gentleness in the man beside her his hands gripped the wheel tightly and he looked nowhere but straight ahead erin pressed her lips together and told herself not to be a romantic fool love didnt have to be gentle to be real hadnt she known all along that her emotions when it came to burke would never be ordinary or simple she didnt want them to be still she would have liked to have laid a hand over his to have offered some word to show him how deep her feelings went and how much she was willing to give but more than her heart was involved there was pride and spirit as well she had to be realistic enough to understand that just because she loved didnt mean he loved in return so she said nothing as they drove under the sign and onto his land why did he feel as though his life had just changed irrevocably burke saw the lights of his house in the distance and tensed as though readying for a blow he wanted her and if the need was stronger than he wanted to admit at least tonight it would be assuaged she hadnt said a word his nerves neared the breaking point as he rounded the first curve in the drive did it mean so little to her could she take what was happening between them so casually that she sat in silence he didnt want this he wanted it more than hed ever wanted anything in his life what was she feeling damn it what was going on inside her couldnt she see that every day every hour hed spent with her had driven him closer and closer to the brink of what burke demanded of himself what line was he teetering on that hed never crossed before what would his life and hers be like once hed stepped over it the hell with it burke braked at the base of the steps and without sparing her a glance slammed the door and got out of the car legs trembling erin got out and started up the steps the door looked bigger somehow like a portal to another world with one long breath she passed through was it always so silent and angry when lovers came together she wondered as she started up the staircase her hand on the banister was dry dry and cold she wished hed reached for it held it warmed it in his own that was nonsense she told herself she wasnt a child to be coddled and soothed but a woman he walked into the bedroom ahead of her waiting for her to smile to offer her hand to give him some sign that she was happy to be with him but when the door closed at her back she simply stood chin up eyes defiant the hell with it he thought again she didnt need sweetness and neither did he they were both adults both aware and willing he should have been glad she didnt want coaxing and candlelight and the promises that were so rarely kept so he pulled her against him their eyes met once acknowledging then his mouth was on hers and the chance for quiet words and gentle caresses was past this was enough erin told herself as the heat rose like glory this had to be enough because she would never have more from him accepting she pressed against him offering her mind and body along with her heart he didnt know was already his there was no hesitation now as her lips parted as their tongues met in a hot greedy kiss when his hands roamed over her back pressed into her hips she only strained closer she was prepared to trust him to show her the art of intimacy she was prepared to risk selfdestruction as long as he was part of the gamble her fingers trembled only slightly as they dug into his arms the strength was there an almost brutal kind of strength that had her heart racing and her body yearning good god no woman had ever taken him so close to desperation so quickly it only took a touch a taste when she kissed him avidly for one sweet moment he could almost believe he was the only one that was its own kind of madness a sane man would think of just this one night but like a drug she was seeping into his system making his heart race and his mind swirl he tugged on her dress and she moved against him murmuring he recognized the excitement the tremble of anticipation but not the modesty when her flesh was freed for him he took with rough hands that incited both desire and panic no one had ever touched her like this as if he had a right to every part of her no one had ever caused this hard fist of need to clench inside her so that she was willing to cede to him that right then she was naked tumbling to the bed so that his body covered hers his hands found her sent her spiraling so that she arched against him even as the fear of the unknown began to brew her breath caught with the sensation of being pressed under him vulnerable dizzy with desire her own body seemed like a strangers filled with towering emotions and terrifying pleasures she wanted a moment just one moment of reassurance one soft word one tender touch but she was beyond asking and he beyond listening greedy impatient he took his lips over her as he wrestled out of his shirt he wanted the feel of her flesh against his how many times had he imagined them coming together this way urgently without questions she was murmuring his name in a breathy desperate whisper that had his passion snowballing out of control he dragged at his clothes swearing hardly able to breathe himself and far beyond the capacity to think her body was like a furnace beneath his and with each movement she stoked the flames higher she dug her nails into his shoulders he fused his mouth with hers past all reason he plunged into her she was curled away from him trembling burke lay in the dark and tried to clear his head innocent dear god hed taken her with all passion and no care and he was the first he should have known yet from the first time hed held her shed been so ripe so ready there had been the strength the hotheaded passion the unquestioning response it had never crossed his mind that she hadnt been with anyone else he ran his hands over his face rubbing hard he hadnt seen because he was a fool the innocence had been there in her eyes for any man to see whod had the brains to look he hadnt looked perhaps because he hadnt wanted to see now hed hurt her however careless however callous he had been with women in the past hed never hurt one because the women hed chosen before had known the rules burke reminded himself not erin no one had ever taught them to her searching for a way to apologize he touched her hair erin only drew herself closer together she wouldnt cry she squeezed her eyes tight and swore it she was humiliated enough without tears what a fool he must think her sniffling like a baby but how could she have known loving would be all heat and no heart the hell of it was he was lousy at words burke reached down to the foot of the bed and drew a cover over her as he tried to sort through and pick the best ones he continued to stroke her hair erin im sorry by god he was lousy with words if those were the pick of the litter dont apologize i cant bear it she turned her face into the pillow and prayed he wouldnt do so again all right i only want to say that i shouldnt have what wanted her taken her i shouldnt have been careless with you that was beautiful he thought detesting himself i hadnt realized that you hadnt that tonight was your first time if id known i would have run for cover she suggested pushing herself up before she could climb out of the bed he had her arm he felt her withdrawal like a blade in the gut youve every right to be angry with me with you she turned her head and made herself look at him he was hardly more than a silhouette in the dark they had loved in the dark she thought unable to see unable to share perhaps it was best it was dark still so that he couldnt see the devastation why should i be angry with you its myself im angry with if youd told me told you she sniffed again but this time there was more than a little derision in it of course i should have told you while we were rolling around on the bed naked as the day we were born i might have said oh by the way burke you might be interested in knowing ive never done this before that would have put a cap on it he was amazed to find himself smiling even as he reached for her hair again and she jerked her head away maybe the timing could have been a bit better than that its done so theres no sense pining over it i want to go home now before i humiliate myself again dont dont what dont go that was a tough one he hadnt known hed had it in him to ask what happened wasnt wrong it was just done badly and thats my fault he caught her chin in his hand as she started to turn away look im not good at asking but id like you to let me make it up to you theres no need she wasnt aware that it was the gentleness in his voice that was calming her i told you im not angry with you its true it was my first time but im not a child i came here of my own free will now im asking you to stay he took her hand and turning it palm up pressed his lips to the center when he looked up at her again she was staring her lips parted in surprise he cursed himself again ill draw you a bath youll what draw you a bath he said snapping off the words youll feel better when he disappeared into the adjoining room erin simply continued to stare after him what in the world had gotten into him she wondered she gathered the blanket around her and stood as burke came back in he was wearing a robe tied loosely at the waist the light from the bath angled out onto the floor she could hear the sound of water running and sensed but surely she was mistaken a hesitation in him go ahead in and relax do you want something tea mutely she shook her head take your time then ill be back in a few minutes not a little baffled erin walked in and lowered herself into the tub the water was steaming so that she felt the tension and the ache begin to diminish almost immediately sinking down she closed her eyes she wished she had another woman to talk to another woman to ask if this was all there was to lovemaking she wished there was someone she could talk to about her feelings she loved burke yet she felt no fulfillment after being with him it had been exciting the way he had touched her the way his body had felt against hers made her tremble and ache but there had been no glorious glow no beautiful colors no feeling of lightness and contentment she was probably a fool for imagining there would be after all it was the poets and dreamers who promised more pretty words pretty images she was a practical woman after all but burke had been right the bath had made her feel better there was no reason for humiliation or for regret if she was no longer innocent she had brought about the change herself willingly one thing her parents had always told her was to follow what was in your heart and to blame no one steadier she stepped from the bath she would face burke now no tears no blushes no recriminations seeing no other cover she wrapped the towel securely around her and stepped into the bedroom hed lighted candles dozens of them erin stood in the doorway staring at the soft light there was music too something quiet and romantic that seemed to heighten the scent of wax and flowers the sheets on the bed were fresh and neatly turned down erin stared at them as all the confidence shed newly built up began to crumble he saw her glance at the bed and saw the quick unmistakable flash of panic that went with the look it brought him guilt and a determination to erase it there were other ways better ways tonight he would show both of them rising he went to her and offered a rose hed just picked in the solarium feel better aye erin took the rose but her fingers nearly bit through the stem you said you didnt want tea so i brought up some wine thats nice but i the words jammed in her throat as he lifted her into his arms burke relax he pressed a kiss to her temple i wont hurt you he carried her to the bed and laid her against the pillows taking two glasses already filled with pale wine he offered her one happy st patricks day with a half smile he touched his glass to hers erin managed a nod before she sipped this is a fine room she began lamely i didnt notice before it was dark he slipped an arm around her shoulders and settled back even as she tensed aye ive ah wondered what the other rooms were like you could have looked i didnt want to pry she sipped a little more wine and unconsciously brushed the rose over her cheek its petals were soft and just on the verge of opening it seems like a big place for one man i only use one room at a time she moistened her lips what was this music she wondered cullen would know it was so lovely and romantic i heard double bluff won his last race travis said he beat durnams colt by a length everybodys talking about the kentucky derby already and how your horse is favored when she realized her head was resting against his shoulder she cleared her throat she would have shifted away but he was stroking her hair you must be pleased its hard not to be pleased when youre winning and tonight at the party lloyd told me that bluff was the horse to beat i didnt tell you how wonderful you looked tonight the dress dee gave it to me it made my heart stop she was able to chuckle at that what blarney then again you managed to stop it wearing overalls she slanted a look up at him aye now im sure theres some irish in you i discovered i had a weakness for women taking in the wash id say its more a matter of a weakness for women in general has been but just lately ive preferred them with freckles erin rubbed rueful fingers over her nose if youre trying to flirt with me you ought to be able to do better works both ways lifting the hand that still held the rose he kissed her fingers you could say something nice about me erin caught her lip between her teeth and waited until he glanced up im thinking she said then laughed when his teeth nipped her knuckle well i suppose i like your face well enough im overwhelmed oh im picky i am so you should be flattered and though you havent traviss build im partial to the wiry type does dee know youve had your eye on her husband erin laughed into her glass surely theres no harm in looking then look here tilting her face up to his he kissed her his lips lingered softly more a whisper than a shout theres the way you do that too she murmured do what make my insides curl all up with his lips still hovering over hers he took the glass from her and set it aside is that good i dont know but id like you to do it again with a hand to her cheek he nuzzled drawing on a tenderness he hadnt known he possessed wailing for her lips to warm and soften beneath his she hesitantly touched a hand to his shoulder she knew his strength now what it was capable of and yet and yet his mouth was so patient so sweet so beautifully gentle when he increased the pressure her fingers tensed immediately he drew back to nibble again until he felt her begin to relax he wanted to take care and not just for her he realized but for himself he wanted to savor to explore to open doors for both of them hed never been a man to bother with candlelight and music had never looked for the romance of it now he found himself as soothed and seduced by it as she was the scent of her bath was on her skin fresh clean on her his soap seemed feminine somehow mysterious her skin was smooth but not frail beneath it were firm muscles honed by an unpampered life he would never have found frailty as appealing still he could feel the nerves jangle inside her now he would treat her as though shed never been touched where there was innocence there should be compassion where there was trust there should be respect and somehow wonderingly he felt as though it was his own initiation she heard the rustle of the sheets as he shifted her body hammered with need even while her fears held her back it was natural she reminded herself and now that she wasnt expecting she wouldnt be disappointed then her breath caught as a new thrill coursed over her skin confused she brought a hand to his chest i wont hurt you again he drew away from her to brush the hair from her face his fingers werent steady god he had to be steady now he warned himself he couldnt afford to lose control to lose himself a second time i promise i wont hurt you she didnt believe him even as she opened her arms in acceptance he saw she didnt believe him so he lowered his mouth to hers again and thought only of erin hed never been a selfish lover but hed never been a selfless one either now he found himself ignoring his own needs for hers when he touched her it wasnt to fulfill his own desire but to bring her whatever passion he was able he felt the change in her start slowly a gradual relaxation of the limbs a dreamy murmuring of his name shed waited braced for the speed the pressure the pain instead he gave her languidness indulgence and pure pleasure he moved his hands over her freely as he had before but this time there was a difference he stroked caressed lingered until she felt as though she was floating the sensation of vulnerability returned but without the panic light and sweet he brought his mouth to her breast to nibble and suckle so that she felt the response deep inside a pull a tug a warmth that spread to her fingertips with a moan she wrapped her arms around him no longer simply accepting but welcoming my god she was sweet with his lips rubbing over her skin he discovered she had a taste like no other a taste he would never be able to do without again her body was so completely responsive under his that he knew he could have her now and satisfy them both but he was greedy in a different way this time greedy to give reaching for her hand he linked his fingers with hers even that just that was the most intimate gesture hed ever made in the candlelight he saw her face glow with pleasure the soft silky kind that could last for hours so he came back to her mouth to give them both time she tasted the wine just a hint of it on his tongue then she felt his lips move against hers with words she heard only in her heart here was the glow shed once imagined and all the bright beautiful colors the poets had promised here was music flowing gently and light soft as heaven here was everything a woman whod given her heart could ask in return shed loved him before but now experiencing the compassion the completeness she fell deeper slowly carefully he began to show her more finding all the pleasure he could want from her response her body shuddered and strained toward him without hesitation without restrictions when he nudged her over the first peak he saw her eyes fly open with shock and dark delight breathless she clung to him it felt as though her mind was racing to keep pace with her body and still he urged her on in ways shed never dreamed existed the next wave struck with a force that had her rearing up there couldnt be more the colors were almost too bright to bear now and need and pleasure had mixed to a point that was both sharp and sweet she held him moaning out his name there couldnt be more but he filled her and showed her there was she was trembling again but she wasnt curled away from him this time she was turned to him her face pressed against his shoulder her arms holding tight because he was more than a little dazed himself he kept her close and said nothing he was no novice at this game burke reminded himself so why did he feel as though someone had just changed the rules the candlelight flickered its shadows around the room so that he shook his head it looked as if hed changed them himself soft light soft music soft words that wasnt his style but it felt so damn right he was used to living hard loving hard and moving on win lose or draw now he felt as though he could go happily to the grave if he never moved beyond this spot as long as erin stayed with him that thought had several small shock waves moving through him stayed with him since when had he started thinking along those lines since hed laid eyes on her he realized and let out a long nonetoosteady breath good god he was in love with her hed gone through his life without taking more than a passing interest in any woman then someone had opened the chute and hed fallen face first in love with a woman who hadnt had time to test the waters he didnt have time for this his life was unsettled the way he wanted it his days his decisions his moves were his own he had plans places to go he had nothing he thought absolutely nothing without her closing his eyes he tried to talk himself out of it it was crazy he was crazy how did he know what it meant to love someone there had only been one person hed loved in his life and that was long ago he was a drifter a hustler if hed stayed in one place a little too long it was only becausebecause there hadnt been a better game that was all but he knew it was a lie he should do them both a favor and take that trip to monte carlo he should leave first thing in the morning the hell with the farm the responsibilities hed just pick up and go the way he always had nothing was keeping him but her hand was resting on his heart he wasnt going anywhere but maybe it was time he upped the stakes and played out his hand you okay he asked her erin nodded then lifted her face to look into his i feel youll think im foolish probably how do you feel beautiful then she laughed and threw her arms around his neck i feel like the most beautiful woman in the world youll do he murmured and knew in that moment that no matter how hard he struggled he was already caught i never want to feel any different than this she drew him closer to press kisses along his jawline and throat you will but theres no reason you cant feel like this as often as possible well bring your things over tomorrow what things still smiling her arms still around his neck she drew back whatever things you have theres no reason to bother moving tonight tomorrows soon enough moving slowly she unwound her arms burke i told you once before i wont live here with you things have changed he said simply reaching for the wine he wished it was whiskey aye but that hasnt what happened tonight had been beautiful the most beautiful experience of her life and she didnt want it spoiled by talk of sharing a life with him that wouldnt be a true one i want to remember it id like to think that there may be a time when we might when we might love each other this way again but that doesnt mean ill toss my beliefs aside and move in as your mistress lover the label doesnt really matter she started to move away but he grabbed her shoulders the glass tilted to the floor and shattered i want you damn it dont you understand not just once i dont want to have to drag you away from the grants every time i want an hour with you youll drag me nowhere the afterglow of love was replaced by angry pride do you think ill move in here so itll be convenient for you when you have an urge to wrestle in bed well i wont be a convenience to you or any man the hell with you burke logan she pushed away and had swung her legs off the bed when she went tumbling backward to find herself pinned under him im getting tired of you wishing me to hell well get used to it now take your hands off me im going home no youre not her eyes narrowed youll not keep me here whatever it takes then she twisted under him before he realized her intent her teeth were sunk into his hand he swore and they rolled from one end of the bed to the other before he managed to pin her again ill draw blood next time i swear it now let me go shut up you crazy irish hothead namecalling is it erin sucked the breath between her teeth the words she uttered now were gaelic this was hardly the time to be amused he reminded himself but there was no help for it what was that a curse some say my granny was a witch if youre lucky youll die fast and leave you a widow not a chance maybe youll live but in such pain youll wish what did you say were getting married because her mouth went slack and her bones limp he released her to suck on his wounded hand its a relief to know youve got good teeth he reached to the bedside table for a cigar nothing to say irish getting married thats right we could fly to vegas tomorrow but then dee would give me grief i figure we can get a license and do it here in a few days a few days she shook her head to clear it then sat up i think the wines gone to my head or he had she thought i dont understand i want you he lit the cigar then spoke practically deciding it was the style shed relate to best you want me but you wont live with me it seems like the logical solution solution calmly as if his life wasnt on the line he blew out smoke are you going to spend the rest of the night repeating everything i say again she shook her head trying to keep calm she watched him looking for any sign but his eyes were shuttered and his face was closed hed played too many hands to give away the most important cards hed ever held why do you want marriage i dont know ive never been married before he blew out another stream of smoke and i dont intend to make a habit of it i figure once should do me i dont think this is something you can take lightly im not taking it lightly burke studied the end of his cigar then leaned over to tap it out ive never asked another woman to marry me never wanted one to im asking you do you love me she wanted to ask but she couldnt whatever answer he gave wouldnt be the right one because shed posed the question do you really think that what we had here is enough for marriage no but were good together we understand each other youll make me laugh keep me on my toes and youll be faithful i cant ask for more than that and didnt dare ill give you what youve always wanted a nice home a comfortable living and youll be the most important person in my life she lifted her head at that it could be enough if she was indeed important to him do you mean that i rarely say what i dont mean because he needed to he reached for her hand lifes a gamble irish remember i remember most marriages dont make it because people go into them thinking that in time theyll change the other person i dont want to change you i like you the way you are he took her fingers to his lips and her heart simply spoke louder than her head then i guess ill have to take you the way you are as well chapter this is all happening so fast dee sat in erins bedroom where even now a dressmaker was pinning and tucking a white satin gown on her cousin are you sure you dont want a little more time for what erin stared out the window wondering whether if one of the dressmakers pins slipped and pierced her skin she would discover it was all a dream to catch your breath think things through i could have another six months and still not catch my breath she lifted a hand to her bodice and felt the symphony of tiny freshwater pearls who would have thought shed ever have such a dress in another two days she would put it on to become burkes wife wife a chill ran up her spine and at her quick shudder the dressmaker murmured an apology have a look miss mckinnon i think youll be pleased with the length if i do say so myself the dress is perfect for you not every woman can wear this line holding her breath erin turned to the cheval mirror the dress was the real dream she thought thousands of pearls glimmered against the satin making it shimmer in the lateafternoon light she thought it was something a medieval princess would wear with its snug sleeves coming to points over her hands and its miles of snowy skirts its beautiful mrs viceroy adelia put in when her cousin only continued to stare and its a miracle indeed that you could have it ready for us in such a short time were beholden to you you know youve only to ask mrs grant she eyed erin as she continued to stare into the glass is there something youd like altered miss mckinnon no no not a stitch she touched the skirt gingerly just a fingertip as if she was afraid it would dissolve under her hand im sorry mrs viceroy its only that its the most beautiful thing ive ever seen more than placated mrs viceroy began to fuss with the hem i think your new husband will be pleased now let me help you out of it erin surrendered the dress and stood in the plain cotton slip burke had once unhooked from the clothesline as the wedding gown was packed away she slipped into her shirtwaist and thought she understood what cinderella must have felt like at midnight if i might suggest the dressmaker continued the dress and veil would be most effective with the hair swept up something very simple and oldfashioned im sure youre right dee murmured as she continued to watch her cousin erin was staring out the window as if she was looking at a blank wall and naturally jewelry should be kept to the bare minimum shell have my pearl earrings for something borrowed what a sweet thought thank you again mrs viceroy dee said rising ill show you out no need for you to go up and down those stairs in your condition i know the way the dress will be delivered by ten day after tomorrow day after tomorrow erin thought and felt the chill come back to her skin would it always be now or never when it came to burke a lovely lady dee said after she closed the bedroom door it was kind of her to come here kind is one thing business another since the weight of the twins seemed to grow heavier every day she sat again she would hardly pass up the opportunity to please the future mrs burke logan erin im happy for you of course oh i feel like a mother hen are you sure this is what you want im not sure of anything erin blurted out then sank onto the bed im scared witless and i keep thinking ill wake up and find myself back on the farm and this all something i dreamed up its real dee squeezed her hand you have to understand that everything happening now is as real as anything can be i do and that only scares me more but i love him i wish i knew him better i wish hed talk to me about his family about himself i wish ma was here and my father and the rest of them but but dee coaxed as she moved over to sit beside her but i love him its enough isnt it enough to start she remembered that in the beginning all shed had was a blind desperate love for travis time had given her the rest hes not an easy man to know but you like him ive always had a soft spot for burke hes got a kind heart though hed rather no one noticed hes a tough one but i believe hed do his best not to hurt someone he loved i dont know if he loves me whats this it doesnt matter erin said quickly and rose to pace because i love him enough for the two of us why would he want to marry you if he didnt love you he wants me better to face it now headon she told herself as she turned back to dee i see and because she did she chose her words with care marriage is a mighty big step for a man to take only for a want a bigger step yet for a man like burke if the words are hard to come by it might be that he hasnt learned how to say them it doesnt matter i dont need words of course you do aye youre right she turned back with a sigh but they can wait sometimes a person needs to feel safe before he can speak whats in his heart youre good for me erin reached out both hands and grasped dees im happy and despite the both of us im going to make him happy brave words aside when she stood at the top of the staircase two days later clinging to paddys arm erin wasnt sure she could walk as far as the atrium where the ceremony would take place the music had begun in truth she could hear nothing else she took one step and stopped then she felt paddys comforting pat on her hand come now lass you look beautiful your father would be proud of you today she nodded took two slow easy breaths then descended burke thought the tux would strangle him if hed had his way they would have walked into the courthouse said a few words and walked out again mission accomplished it had been dee who had browbeaten him into a wedding just a simple one shed said burke thought with a grimace a woman was entitled to white lace and flowers once in her life she herself hadnt been given the choice but she wanted it for erin hed relented because hed been certain she couldnt pull it off in the two weeks hed given her of course she had the simple wedding shed promised had swelled into what he considered a sideshow with two hundred people eager to watch him juggle the house was full of white and pink roses and hed been forced to pull himself into a tux shed ordered a fivetiered wedding cake and enough champagne to fill his pool wasnt it enough that he was about to make a lifetime commitment without having a trio of violins behind him burke stood with his hands at his side and his face carefully blank and wondered what in the hell he was doing then he saw her her hair was glowing warm and vibrant under layers of white tulle she seemed pale but her eyes met his without hesitation how was it hed never noticed how small she was how delicate until now when she was about to become a permanent part of his life permanent he felt the quick sliver of panic then she smiled slowly almost questioningly he held out a hand her fingers were icy it was a relief to find his equally cold she held tight and turned to face the priest it didnt take long to change lives a few moments a few words she felt the ring slip onto her finger but she was looking at him her hand was steady when she took the gold band from dee and placed it on burkes finger and it was done he lifted the veil and touched the warm skin beneath he brought his lips to hers lightly then more strongly with a laugh erin threw her arms around his neck and held him and it was sealed then almost from the moment she became his wife she was spun away to be congratulated complimented and envied it became like a dream full of music and strangers and frothy wine she was toasted and fussed over cameras flashed there was caviar and elegant little hors doeuvres and sugared fruit that sparkled like diamonds under the lights erin found herself answering questions smiling and wishing herself a hundred miles away then she was dancing with burke and the world snapped back into focus this didnt seem real until now she rested her cheek against his and sighed i always dreamed of a day like this are we really married or am i still imagining he lifted her hand running a finger over her ring looks real to me smiling she looked down then caught her breath oh burke its beautiful stunned she turned her hand so that the layers of diamonds and sapphires glittered i never expected anything like this youve had it on for an hour havent you looked no it was foolish to cry now but she felt the tears sting her eyes thank you she was grateful the music stopped while she still had control ill be back in just a minute youd better be ill be damned if ill deal with this crowd alone she tucked her thumb into her fist so that she could run it along the ring as she hurried upstairs she just needed a minute erin told herself to compose to adjust to believe stepping inside the bedroom she leaned back against the door and caught her breath tonight she thought this would be her room just as burke would be was her husband she would sleep in this bed wake in it tidy the sheets fuss with the curtains and one day it would become usual no she thought with a laugh and hugged herself it would never become usual she wouldnt let it from this day on her life would be special because she loved and belonged touching her cheeks to be certain they were cool and dry she started to open the door a trio of women were passing on their way downstairs why for his money of course this from a woman erin recognized from adelias party one with beautiful white hair and a wateredsilk suit after all she hardly knew the man why else would she marry him you dont think she came all the way from ireland to settle for keeping his books it seems strange that burke would marry her a nobody when he could have had his pick of some of the most acceptable women in the area the leggy blonde from the party fussed with the snap of her purse i thought they made a lovely couple the third woman merely shrugged as the whitehaired matron looked down her nose really dorothy a man hardly marries without reason no doubt shes got a few tricks up her sleeve its one thing to get a man into bed after all and another to get him to the altar men are charmed easily enough and bore just as easily i imagine hell be finished with her in a year if shes as smart as i think she is shell tuck away a nice settlement starting with that ring he gave her ordered it from cartiers you know ten thousand not a bad start for a little farm girl from nowhere the blonde fussed with her hair as they approached the head of the stairs it should be interesting to see her struggle to climb the social ladder in the next few months shes not one of us the whitehaired woman announced with a flick of the wrist erin stood with her hand on the knob and watched them descend the stairs not one of them through the first shock came the tremble of anger well damned if she wanted to be they were nothing but a bunch of gossiping old broody hens with nothing better to do than make cruel remarks and speculate on the feelings of others for his money did everyone really believe shed married burke for his money did he she wondered with a sudden and very new shock anger drained as she let her hand slip off the knob oh sweet god did he was that what hed meant when hed said he could give her what she wanted she put her hands to her cheeks again but they were no longer cool could he believe that her feelings were tied up in what he had instead of what he was she hadnt done anything to show him otherwise erin realized with a sinking heart but she would lifting her head she started out of the room she would show him she would prove to him that it was the man she had married not his fine house or his rich farm and to hell with the rest of them when she descended the steps this time she didnt look like the pale innocent bride her color was high her eyes dark she might not be one of them she thought but she would find a way to fit in she would make burke proud of her forcing a smile she walked directly to the woman in watered silk im so glad you could come today the woman gave erin a gracious nod as she sipped champagne wouldnt have missed it my dear you do make a lovely bride thank you but a womans only a bride for a day and a wife for a lifetime if youll excuse me she crossed the room her dress billowing magnificently though burke was surrounded she moved directly to him and putting her arms around him kissed him until the people around them began to murmur and chuckle i love you burke she said simply and i always will he hadnt known he could be moved by words at least not such wellused ones but he felt something shift inside him as she smiled is that a conclusion you just came to no but i thought it past time i told you he thought hed never nudge the last guest out the door no one loved a party and free champagne like the privileged class erin stood in the center of the atrium with her hands clasped together its going to take an army to put this place to rights no ones walking through that door for twentyfour hours she smiled but the fatigue and nerves were beginning to show i should go up and change in a minute before she could move he took both her hands i should have told you how beautiful you are i cant remember ever being as nervous as i was when i stood down here waiting for you were you her smile came fully now as she pressed against him oh i was scared to death i nearly picked up my skirts and bolted id have caught you i hope so because theres no place i want to be but here with you he framed her face with his hands you havent had much chance to compare it doesnt matter but he wondered he was the only man shed ever known now hed done his best to be certain he was the only one she ever would selfish yes but a desperate man takes desperate measures he kissed her again and then while his lips were on hers lifted her into his arms theres no threshold to carry you over her eyes laughed at him theres one in the bedroom i told you that you were a woman after my heart he said and carried her up the stairs rosa had champagne chilling in a bucket and two glasses waiting burke i wonder would you mind giving me ten minutes whos going to help you out of that dress i can manage im sure its bad luck for the bridegroom to do so just ten she repeated when he set her down ill be quick with a shrug he pulled a robe out of his closet i suppose i can get out of this straitjacket somewhere else thank you he didnt give her a minute more than that but she was ready she was still in white but this gown was like a cloud wisping down shifting with each breath she took her hair was loose over the shoulders fire against snow he closed the door quietly behind him and looked his fill i didnt think you could be more beautiful than you were this afternoon i wanted tonight to be special i know weve already weve already been together but this is the first time ill make love to my wife aye she held out her hands and i want you to love me i want you more now than i did before if you could it was foolish to blush now she was a married woman if you could teach me what to do erin he didnt know what to say he simply didnt have the words but he took her hand and pressed a kiss to her brow i have something for you when he took a box out of his pocket and handed it to her she moistened her lips burke i dont want you to feel obliged to buy me things if i dont how am i going to please myself by looking at you wear them so he opened the box himself inside was a rope of diamonds holding one perfect sapphire oh burke she wanted to cry because it was so lovely she wanted to cry because she was afraid he thought she required it it matches my ring she managed that was the idea but he was watching her frowning at the look in her eyes dont you like it of course i do its like something out of a palace i think im afraid to wear it he laughed at that and turned her toward the mirror dont be silly its made to be worn see he held it up around her throat the sapphire gleamed dark against her skin and the wink of diamonds what good are pretty stones if a woman doesnt wear them youll need more than this before its done we can pick up some things on our honeymoon he kissed the curve of her throat where do you want to go paris aruba ireland she thought but was afraid hed laugh at her i was thinking maybe we should wait awhile for that after all this is one of the busiest times of year for you with the derby coming up could we wait a few months before we go away if you like he placed the necklace back in the box before turning her to face him erin whats wrong nothing its just all so new and burke i swear to you i wont do anything to cause you shame what the hell is this patience gone he took her by the arm and set her on the bed i want to know what youve got into your head and how it got there its nothing she said furious with herself that she was always an open book to him while she could never dig beneath the top layer its just that i realized today that i dont really fit in with your people and lifestyle my people his laugh wasnt amused and had her tensing you dont know anything about my people irish and you can consider yourself fortunate if you mean the people who were here today twothirds of them arent worth the snap of your fingers but i thought you liked them youve friends among them and associates associates for the most part and that can change at any time we can go to parties and you can join any clubs or committees you like but if you want to thumb your nose at the lot of them it wouldnt matter to me youre part of the racing world she insisted and married to you so am i i wont have anyone saying you married some little nobody who cant fit in and someone did he murmured she didnt have to confirm with words what he could see so clearly in her eyes you listen to me it only matters what we think i married you because you were what i wanted im going to be she lifted her hands to his face i swear to you she brought her mouth to his with all the passion love and longing she had she wanted the night to be special but that meant more than champagne and white lace it meant showing him what was in her heart what she was just beginning to understand for herself that she loved him unrestrictedly with her arms around him her mouth on his she lowered onto the bed their marriage bed he had shown her what loving could be now she hoped she could give some of that beauty back to him since experience wasnt hers she could only act on what was in her heart she had no idea if a man could feel more than need and satisfaction but she wanted to try to give him some of the sweetness some of the comfort he had given to her hesitant unsure she pressed her lips to his throat his taste was darker there potent and she could feel the beat of his pulse beneath her mouth its rhythm quickened she smiled against his skin yes she could give him something she liked the way he felt under her hands the muscles that bunched and flowed as she moved her fingers over them tentatively she parted his robe when she felt him tense she retreated immediately an apology forming on her lips no with a half laugh he took her hand and brought it back to him i want you to touch me he kept his own hands gentle though each hesitant stroke of her fingertips drove him mad he was already caught in the innocence and passion of her in her willingness to be taught her eagerness to please and be pleased so they loved slowly taking time to teach to learn there was no shyness on her part when he drew the lace from her shoulders but rather a wonder that he found her so desirable in answer she slipped his robe away and let herself marvel at the strength and beauty that was her husband perhaps it didnt make sense but it was more exciting now that he belonged to her the hard fist of need hadnt lessened the trembles of anticipation and anxiety were just as sharp but now along with desire was the simple joy that the man who held her was the man who would hold her night after night this was only the beginning she thought laughing she rolled over him something funny he managed he felt as though his body was stretched beyond the breaking point im happy she brought her mouth down hard on his then incredibly felt her bones liquefy with a soft moan she took him into her when the whirlwind started she could only hold her breath and grip his hands tight her body took control now moving with his instinctively as pleasure built and crested and built again her head was thrown back he thought she looked like a goddess red hair streaming over white shoulders her slender body strong and agile as it merged with his he wanted to hold her like this to see her like this again and again in his minds eye then the pleasure was so complete that it blinded him erin woke on her first day as mrs logan to a gray morning lashed by spring rain she thought it was beautiful smiling she shifted over to reach for burke and found him gone terrified shed dreamed it all she sat straight up do you always wake up like that across the room burke hooked his belt and watched her no i thought it wasnt a dream of course it wasnt she laughed at herself and shook her head never mind where are you going down to the stables so early its seven seven she rubbed her hands over her eyes as she struggled up ill fix your breakfast rosall see to it you should get some more sleep but i she wanted to fix his breakfast it was one of the small and very vital things a wife could do for her husband she wanted to sit in the kitchen with him talking of the day to come and remembering the night that had passed but he was already pulling on his boots im not tired i could go down and start on the books youve gotten them in good enough shape to take a couple of days off in fact we havent talked about it but you dont have to continue with that if you dont like well of course ill continue with it thats why i came here he lifted a brow as she tugged on a robe things have changed i dont want my wife to have to close herself up in an office all day if its all the same to you id like to work uncomfortable she began to tug on the sheets if you dont want me to be doing your books anymore ill find another job i dont care if you work on them or not i just want you to know you have a choice what are you doing im making the bed of course crossing over he caught her hand in his rosa takes care of the bedmaking as well theres certainly no need for her to make mine ours thats her job he kissed her brow then changed his mind and drew her close against him good morning he murmured against her lips hers curved just slightly good morning ill be back in a few hours why dont you take a swim when the door closed behind him erin crossed her arms take a swim on her first day as a wife she wasnt supposed to cook breakfast or make a bed but to take a swim walking over to the mirror she stared at herself she didnt look so very different but feelings didnt always show wasnt it odd that shed refused to be burkes mistress but now she was feeling more like that than a wife married him for his money erin pushed away from the mirror the hell with that it was past seven and she had work to do rosa wasnt any more cooperative than burke there was no reason for the senora to do that there was no reason for the senora to do this perhaps the senora would like to take a book into the solarium in other words erin thought youre of no use here that was going to change she decided she threw herself into her paperwork when burke didnt return for lunch erin took matters into her own hands filling a pail with hot water and detergent she took it and a mop to the atrium glasses and plates had already been cleared away but rosa hadnt yet gotten to the tiles erin felt a stab of satisfaction at having beaten her to it this is my house she told herself as she sloshed out soapy water my floor and ill damn well wash it if i like burke strode through the streaming rain thinking that the horse he had entered at charles town that night would have an edge on the muddy track his second thought was that erin might get a kick out of taking the trip to west virginia to see the run it would give him a chance to show her off a bit god shed looked beautiful that morning all heavyeyed and dewyskinned he was far from certain hed done the right thing for her by rushing her into marriage but he was more certain than ever that hed done the right thing for himself he couldnt remember ever being at peace before or ever feeling as though each day had a solid purpose to it he could give her the things in life shed always wanted the money didnt matter to him so he didnt give a hang how she spent it in turn she was giving him a solid base something he hadnt known hed wanted inside he shook the rain out of his hair and went to look for her when he entered the atrium he stopped she was on her hands and knees scrubbing even as she heard his steps and glanced up he was dragging her to her feet what in hell are you doing why im washing the floor it took a beating yesterday youd be amazed what people can drop and what they dont bother to pick up again burke youre hurting my arm i dont ever want to see you down on your knees again understand no studying him she rubbed her arm she knew real anger when she looked it in the face no i dont my wife doesnt scrub floors now wait a minute as he turned on his heel she caught him shell scrub them if she pleases and she wont be called my wife as though she were something shiny to be kept in a box whats the matter with you i didnt marry you so you could scrub floors no nor that i could cook your breakfast or make the bed thats plain just why did you marry me then i thought id made that clear aye she dropped her hand from his arm i suppose you did so im to be your mistress after all its just a matter of being a legal one he made an effort an enormous one to block off the anger it didnt work dont be a fool and leave that damn bucket where it is youll remember the word in the ceremony was changed from obey to cherish scowling at him she gave the bucket a kick and sent soapy water pouring over the tiles but ill be happy to leave it just where it is where the hell are you going i dont know she said over her shoulder surely i can walk through the house even though im not allowed to touch anything in it stop it he caught her as she stormed down the hall but she only shook him off and kept going damn it erin you can touch whatever you like just dont clean it i can see its time we had the rules straight she pushed through the doors into the solarium the heat was like a wall and suited her mood perfectly touching and looking are allowed stop acting like an idiot me she turned on him and nearly upset a pot of geraniums its me whos an idiot is it out there its a fool i am and in here an idiot well it wasnt me who went into a rage because the floor was getting washed i thought you came here to get away from that because you wanted more out of life than washing dishes slowly she nodded aye i came to america for that but its not why i married you maybe i can handle others thinking i married you because of your money and your fine house but not you i told you yesterday that i loved you dont you believe me i dont know he ran a hand over his face and struggled for calm for clear thinking for the kind of controlled logic that had always brought him out on top of any game he chose why does it matter she had to turn away because it hurt too much to face him i didnt lie when i said it but you can think whatever you like it doesnt matter at all very deliberately she picked up a pottery bowl and sent it crashing to the tiles you neednt worry i wont clean it up are you finished i havent decided crossing her arms she stared at the clear water of the pool he put his hand on her shoulder perhaps she did love him a little it would take a bigger fool than he to push her away my mother spent more than half of her life on her knees scrubbing other peoples floors she was barely forty when she died i dont want you on your knees for anyone erin when he started to draw his hand away she clasped it in her own thats the first thing youve trusted me with she turned to put her arms around him dont you see youll drive me mad if you shut me out you agreed to take me for what i am i have i will i do love you burke then let me see you enjoy yourself but i am tilting her head back she grinned at him i like to fight he ran a finger down her nose then im glad to oblige you did you take that swim no i had the books and then i argued with rosa for awhile busy day lets take one now i cant more arguing to do no ive done with that but i dont want to swim cant you her chin angled as hed expected of course i can but i dont have a suit thats okay lifting her up he walked to the edge as she giggled and shoved against him you wouldnt and if you try by god youll go in with me i never intended it any other way they went in together fully dressed chapter before she had been married a full month erin had taken trips to new york and kentucky and back to florida she grew used to the look and feel of the racetracks whether they were earthy or glamorous she grew used to but never less fascinated by the people who inhabited them from the young grooms still shiny with ambition to the older hands who lived from race to race and bet to bet the contrasts were a constant curiosity from her box she could watch the other owners their families and friends seersucker suits and picture hats while against the rail elbow to elbow were the masses who came for the fun or the money she learned that wagering had its own scent often a desperate one always a little sweaty away from the stands were the horses the scales the tack and the riders only a few who watched knew the thrill and the anxiety of ownership in lexington she visited horse farms with burke and saw stables grander than she had ever thought any house could be she saw the races of the thoroughbred world grew to know the people whose lives were tied to them and she learned at cocktail parties dinner parties and small celebrations she listened to discussions on breeding on training on strategy she grew to understand that owners often thought of their horses as possessions while trainers more often than not thought of a horse in their care as an athlete to be disciplined and pampered in the peculiar way of the sportsman but above all the horse was the focus for envy or for pride after a time she drew together the courage to go as far as the paddocks where she could watch the horses being examined and saddled for the races though the scent and sounds of horses still disturbed her she was determined that burkes associates would never twitter about his wife being afraid she grew more accustomed to the parties the lavish ones that only the successful and the privileged could attend the talk there was of horses and the people who owned them not so different from skibbereen she began to think certainly this life was more glamorous but at home the talk had often been just as narrow she studied poring over books on thoroughbreds racing and the history of both she learned that every thoroughbred descended from three arabian studs and that the most expensive horseflesh in the world was to be found in ireland at the irish national stud shed had to smile at that not only from home pride but because two such horses were in burkes stables she learned to wager wisely and to win a skill that never failed to amuse her husband hed been right when hed said she would make him laugh erin found more pleasure in that than in all the pretty stones he bought her or the new clothes that hung in her closet shed discovered something in a month of marriage the things shed thought shed always wanted werent important after all and she was pregnant the knowledge both thrilled and terrified her she was carrying a child burkes child one that had been conceived on their first night together in a matter of months they would no longer be just husband and wife but a family she couldnt wait to tell him she was afraid of what he would say theyd never discussed children but then there had been time to discuss little she hardly knew more of him now than she had when shed married him true she had come to understand that unlike many of his associates his horses were neither possessions nor pets nor were they the game of chance he claimed them to be they had his pride and his affection and erin came to see that they had his admiration for simply being what they were it wasnt just the winning but the heart that made champions there was this and little more she had learned of him hed never spoken of his mother or his family again though shed tried to question him gently hed simply ignored her not evaded erin thought now just ignored it didnt matter she told herself as she went to find him shed seen him with dees children and hed been gentle and kind and caring surely he would be only more so with a child of his own she would tell him and he would hold her tight and tell her how happy he was they would laugh and she would show him all the pamphlets the doctor had given her on childbearing classes and diet then they would plan the nursery all pinks and blues like a sunrise she found him in the library and had to bite back an impatient oath when she saw he was on the phone im not interested in selling he said as he gestured her in no not at that price not at any if you want to get back to me in a few years and talk stud fees yes thats a firm no tell durnam none of my stocks for sale at the moment yeah youll be the first to know he hung up and pulled a hand through his hair problems erin crossed over to kiss his cheek no charlie durnams interested in buying one of the new foals makes me think hes the one with problems so what did you buy buy you said you were going shopping oh yes i didnt buy anything she rested her cheek against his hair a moment burke ive something i want to tell you in a minute sit down erin it was the tone that had her retreating he used that odd flat voice when shed annoyed him whats wrong ive had a letter from your father from da she was up again almost before she sat is something wrong is someone sick no nothings wrong sit down he swiveled in his chair and for the first time in a month she felt as though they were back on terms of business he wrote to welcome me into the family and to express what i suppose is fatherly concern that i take good care of you what nonsense he knows very well i can take care of myself she relaxed again unconsciously resting a hand low on her stomach was that all he also thanked me for the money youve been sending over he says its been a great help burke paused a moment as he flipped through the papers on his desk why didnt you tell me youve been sending more than half your money over to ireland i never thought of it she began then she stopped how do you know how much im sending you keep excellent and very clear books erin he pushed away from the desk to pace to the window i dont understand why youre angry the moneys mine after all its yours he murmured damn it erin theres a checkbook in the office if youd felt the need to send money home why didnt you just take what you wanted and be done with it theres more than enough out of my wages youre my wife damn it and that entitles you to whatever you want youre past the point where you have to draw wages she was silent a moment and when she spoke she spoke carefully thats it isnt it you still believe that im here because of your fat checkbook he didnt know what he thought burke admitted as he stared out of the window she was perfect warm loving and the longer she was with him the more he was certain there had to be a catch no one gave unconditionally no one gave without wanting something back not entirely he said after a moment but i dont believe youd have married me if i didnt have one i told you before it doesnt matter we suit well enough do we the point is the moneys there and you may as well make use of it you never know how long itll last with a half smile he lit a cigar thats a bridge well cross when we come to it enjoy it irish its all part of the bargain she thought of the child inside her and could have wept instead she stood is there anything else i want you to go write out a check for whatever your family needs all right thank you well be leaving for kentucky in a few days the bluegrass stakes and the derby he turned and leaned back against the sill you should enjoy it its quite a show im sure its wonderful she took a long breath and watched him carefully its a pity dees too far along to travel so she and travis wont be there thats the price you pay for having a family he shrugged and moved back to his desk aye she said quietly but the light had gone out of her eyes ill let you get back to work wasnt there something you wanted to tell me no it was nothing erin closed the door behind her then covered her face with her hands hadnt she told him she loved him hadnt she showed him in every way she knew and now she was carrying physical proof of her feelings but none of it mattered to him then it would have to matter to her even more erin straightened her shoulders and walked away from the door unaware that burke stood on the other side hesitating his hand on the knob he hadnt meant to be angry shed looked so happy when shed come into the room shed smiled at him as though as though she loved him why couldnt he get past the block and just accept because he didnt believe in that kind of love not even when he felt it himself he did believe that she would stay with him happily enough as long as he continued to provide her with what she needed when hed met her hed recognized the hunger for more he himself had always felt hed recognized the need to see new things climb new mountains and win it was just fortunate for both of them that he was in a position to show her those things to provide her with the means to taste and hear and see the fantasies shed had she could love him for that and that he could understand but what about the man who had come from nothing what about the man who could be back to nothing at the toss of the dice what would her feelings be for him he couldnt afford to find out because the man who thought love only existed for convenience was desperately in love with his wife she was far from aware of it as erin walked into the kitchen she was certain burke only wanted her as long as she did nothing to upset the balance of his lifestyle sooner or later he would be aware that together they already had rosa was washing crystal in the sink but stopped the moment erin walked in the room is there something you want senora im just going to fix some tea ill heat the water i can do it myself erin snapped as she slammed the kettle onto the stove as you like senora erin leaned her palms against the stove im sorry rosa denada as rosa went back to her crystal erin found a cup and saucer what kind of wife was it she wondered who didnt even know which cupboard held her dishes how could she be so happy and so unhappy at the same time rosa how long have you worked for mr logan many years senora before he came here to this house before that like pulling teeth she thought determined to pull harder where did you work with him before that in another house erin turned from the stove where rosa she saw the housekeepers lips tighten in nevada in the west what did he do there he had much business you should ask mr logan yourself its you im asking rosa dont you think i have a right to know who my husband is she saw the brief hesitation before rosa began to polish glasses its not my place senora i need something with an angry flick of her wrist she shut off the flame i dont care what he did what he was if hes done something wrong it doesnt matter how can i get through to him if i dont understand him senora carefully rosa set down the first glass and picked up another im not sure you would understand even if you knew tell me and let me try some things are better left alone no she wanted to throw something anything but managed to hold the need back rosa look at me i love him when the housekeeper turned erin spoke again i love him and i cant stand being kept apart from who he is i want to make him happy rosa stood silently a moment her eyes were very dark and very clear for a moment erin felt a stab of recognition then it passed i believe you its burke who needs to believe for some believing such things doesnt come easily why why for burke do you know what its like to be hungry truly hungry for food for knowledge for love no he grew up with nothing less than nothing when there was work he worked when there was not he stole she moved her shoulders and picked up the next glass not such a bad life for some hell for others he never knew his father his mother was not married you understand yes erin sat and made no objection when rosa moved over to the stove to fix her tea his mother worked very hard though she was never well but in such places a person always owes much more than they could ever have at times he went to school but more often he worked in the fields on a farm she asked remembering the way burke had looked over hers si he lived on one for awhile so that he could give his mother his pay i see and she was beginning to he hated the life the dirt and the stench of it rosa how did you know him when he was a child she set the tea down in front of erin we had the same father erin stared then when rosa would have walked away she grabbed her arm youre burkes sister half sister my father took me to new mexico when i was six he met burkes mother she was pretty frail and very innocent after burke was born he left me with her promising to send for us all when he had a job he never did something might have happened to him he might she stopped when she saw the look in rosas eyes burkes mother discovered hed met another woman in utah that was his way so she worked washing up other peoples dirt for twenty years then she died she had done her best for him but burke was always wild and restless the day she was buried he left it was five years before i saw him again he found you no i found him rosa went back to her glasses burke is not a man who looks for anyone he owned part of a casino in reno because i wouldnt take the money he offered i went to work for him hes never been comfortable with it but he doesnt send me away he couldnt youre his sister not to him because to him our father never existed there is no family in burkes life no roots no home that can change only burke can change it aye nodding she stood thank you rosa she didnt tell him about the baby over the next few days she fretted over the secret but didnt speak it there were races to prepare for important ones now as she watched burke handle his business and deal with his horses she watched from a different perspective how had his early life shaped him she took note of the way he treated those who worked for him he was firm and demanding but never unreasonable not once had she heard him raise his voice to any of his men because he knew what it was like to be abused by an employer she wondered because he understood how it felt to be dependent for your existence on another he loved the horses she wasnt sure he was aware of it himself but she could see it in the way he watched them take to the track the way he supervised their grooming perhaps it was true that when hed won the farm it had been only another game but hed made a life out of it whether he realized it or not that alone gave erin hope the time came for them to fly to kentucky erin vowed she would tell him about the baby when they returned there was something different about her burke thought as he fixed himself a drink in the parlor of their hotel suite he just couldnt quite put his finger on it her moods were like a roller coaster up down and sideways as quick as a wink not that he didnt find them interesting hed never been one who wanted to settle in too comfortably and a man would hardly do that with a wife who was raging one minute and smiling sweetly the next she was always doing the unexpected these days cuddling up against him and falling into long thoughtful silences or racing down to the stables to drag him back for a picnic under the willow she was the same in public playing the dignified wife one moment and a flirtatious woman the next and she didnt always flirt with only him he couldnt deny it made him jealous but he was fully aware that was her intent he found her daydreaming one minute and rushing around talking about redecorating the next at times he worried that she was becoming restless again but then she would reach for him at night and no one had ever seemed so content hed noticed she seemed to have lost her taste for champagne though they attended the spring parties with regularity shed taken to sipping plain juice and discussing bloodlines and the pros and cons of certain tracks then there had been the day hed given her the earrings sapphires to match her necklace she had opened the box burst into tears and fled only to come back an hour later to gather him close and thank him the woman was driving him crazy and he was enjoying every minute of it are you almost ready or do you want to be fashionably late he asked as he strolled toward the bedroom almost ready since were going to win the race tomorrow i thought i should look my best for the pictures theyll be taking tonight ive never known people with such love for taking pictures at parties you didnt complain about having yours in the paper he began then stopped to stand in the doorway she smiled when she saw him and turned a slow circle shed chosen the dress carefully knowing that before too many more weeks she would be showing and wouldnt feel proper wearing something daring the midnight blue was shot through with silver threads so that she shimmered even standing still it left her shoulders bare then slithered down her body without drape or fold without the slit up the skirt she wasnt sure she could have moved in it well do you like it mrs viceroy said i should have something to show off my necklace whos going to notice the necklace he came to her and in the way he had of making her heart stop took both her hands to kiss them irish youre gorgeous its sinful for me to want the other women to be jealous isnt it probably but i do i want them to look at you and think hes the most wonderful man here and she has him laughing she spun another circle then i can just look at them and smile sort of pitying its a shame i wont be able to notice because i wont be able to take my eyes off you she turned back to touch his cheek you know when you say things like that it still makes my insides curl up burke she wanted to tell him she loved him but she knew he would only smile and kiss her forehead then her heart would break a little because he wasnt able to give the words back to her did you ever think these parties are a little slow i thought you liked them well i do she moved closer to run a finger down his lapel but sometimes sometimes i find myself in the mood for something that takes a little more energy she smiled as she looked up at him under her lashes a lot more energy you smell very nice thanks he lifted a brow as she loosened his tie are you trying to start something and what if i am she pushed his jacket off his shoulders just checking he murmured while she unbuttoned his shirt this isnt going to make all those women jealous with a laugh she ran her hands up his chest thats what you think grinning she shoved him onto the bed and jumped in after him for the first time since shed fainted erin insisted on going down to the stables with burke she told him it was a matter of pride and it was pride in him she wasnt able to bring herself to go in but urged him to as she stood in the sun and watched the people a long way from skibbereen indeed she thought the air was warm with springtime and flowers were already in bloom trainers and exercise boys shed come to know by sight nodded or tipped their hats as they passed her and greeted her as mrs logan there was excitement in the air as well the kind that hummed before an important race before long it would be the race the derby but for now everyones attention was on today and the bluegrass stakes a win here added to double bluffs record would make him the favorite erin smiled as she thought that would lower the odds but odds didnt matter she wanted burke to win today and at churchill downs she could almost taste the satisfaction of having double bluff named horse of the year more than shed wanted anything she wanted that for burke for him to know hed done something special something only the best could accomplish good day to you mrs logan paddy pleased to see him erin opened her arms for a hug oh its a fine day isnt it hows dee right as right and mean as a bear she told me to tell you if traviss apollo doesnt win burkes double bluff better and who are you betting on now who do you think i trained apollo myself but if i was hedging my bets id lay some money on the colt out of three aces a smart man would put his money down on charlies pride durnam came up behind them and slapped paddy on the shoulder well now its a fine colt you have there mr durnam and thats the truth but i think ill stick with my own thats your choice hello there mrs logan youre looking as pretty as ever thank you good luck to you today you dont need luck when youve got the best he pulled at the brim of his straw hat and moved on well see whos the best erin said under her breath got the fever do you chuckling paddy slipped an arm around her shoulders theres a powerful competition in this business cant be otherwise when money and prestige change hands in a matter of minutes how do you know when youve got a winner well now theres breeding and training and a matter of attitude theres feed and grooming theres the jockey that sits on top and finding the right man for the right mount but what it comes down to darling is blood its in the blood or it isnt just like with people aye the blood she looked toward the stables and thought of burke so you think that someone could be denied the proper care and feeding the training and still be a winner we talking horses or people does it matter not much he gave her shoulder a quick squeeze its in the blood and its in the heart ive got to tend to my boy now ill wave to you from the winners circle paddy cunnane she called after him you sound sure of yourself burke commented as he crossed to her sure of you she gripped his hands as they headed for the stands you dont have to walk me up i know you want to stay to see your jockey weighed in and watch double bluff saddled the last time i didnt go with you i found you surrounded by reporters i know how to handle them now besides i did like seeing my picture in the paper youre a vain woman irish aye and why not she brushed a finger over his creamcolored shirt and found herself pleased he didnt go in for the seersucker of his associates whether its pride or vanity i find it exciting to see my picture on the society page did you know mr logan youre a very important man is that so ayetis so and so im told often enough then by rights i have to be an important woman you could pass for one today he decided taking a quick study of her pale blue suit and pearls shed added a plain widebrimmed straw hat then had tilted it at an angle so it could no longer be called demure i decided the day called for dignified then she laughed and touched the brim of her hat sort of burke ill be fine really i know you want to stay close to the horse id rather stay close to you mind no she hooked her arm through his and grinned why dont i buy you a beer she thought it was a perfect day the most perfect day of her life the sky was cloudless a soft spring blue that made her smile just to look at it she noticed the woman from her wedding as she stepped into the box and made sure she tilted her head and smiled coolly in greeting why do i feel youre always sticking pins in dorothy gainsfield because i am darling she stood on tiptoe and kissed him long sharp ones i didnt know until the other day that the skinny blonde who was hanging all over you on st patricks day was mrs gainsfields favorite niece she laughed again figuring it meant another day in purgatory life can be sweet youll have to fill me in on all this later in ten or twenty years perhaps look burke television cameras can you imagine delighted with the world in general she took her seat now and then she spotted someone she knew and waved to lloyd pentel to honoria louis to the elderly mrs bingham do you know ive met as many people in a months time as ive known all of my life its an odd and wonderful feeling she turned to see he was smiling at her why do you look at me like that its an education to watch you in a place like this soaking it all up storing it away i wonder what youll look like when we go to paris or rio probably stand around with my mouth hanging open the whole time and humiliate you theres that he only laughed when she jabbed him with her elbow try to behave yourself its almost post time oh lord save us so it is and i havent bet i bet for you while you were buying my beer and trying to decide if you were going to eat a cheeseburger or two hot dogs living in americas improved your appetite it wasnt only that that was increasing her appetite she thought and wondered when she would work up the nerve to tell him it wasnt my fault we missed breakfast she reminded him wheres my ticket watching the horses being led to the starting gate he reached in his pocket erin took the stub and was about to tuck it away when she noticed the amount a thousand dollars her voice squeaked so that a few interested heads turned burke where would i be getting a thousand dollars to bet on a horse dont be ridiculous he didnt spare her a glance his trainer had moved to double bluffs head as the colt reared and danced seems a little more wired than usual he murmured as two grooms stepped up to help but burke a thousand dollars afraid youll lose no she stopped then closing the ticket tight in her hand she said a quick prayer no of course not the bell sounded the gate was released the horses plunged forward she recognized the pentel colt in the lead he was a fast starter she remembered but he didnt have stamina with the ticket still clutched in her hand she put a fist to her breast the pack was hardly more than a blur but she could see the greenandwhite silks of burkes jockey rounding the first turn he was in fourth with traviss colt on his left the crowd was already shouting so that she could no longer hear the announcer it didnt matter with her free hand she gripped the sleeve of burkes linen shirt and held on hes making his move burke murmured she saw the whiz of crops the strain of speed as the jockeys leaned low double bluff moved to the outside his stride lengthened eating up distance it seemed that before her eyes he grew bigger his coat glossier his legs longer a champion she thought again was in the heart hers was with the colt it was more than a race she knew more than prestige and certainly more than money it was burkes pride she understood what it was like to come from little then to have a chance for everything the pentel colt began to lag as they came down the stretch it was a race between three leaving the pack behind charlies pride held first with traviss colt and double bluff vying for second she could see the dirt flying and the sweat all around her there was one huge bellowing roar hes going to do it she didnt even realize she was shouting as she watched double bluff gain on charlies pride they were nose to nose for what seemed forever and then he was ahead by a neck by half a length by a length with his speed only increasing he was two lengths ahead at the wire oh burke he did it you did it she hadnt been aware of standing but found herself on her feet as she turned to throw her arms around him sure and hes the most beautiful horse ever born im so proud of you i wasnt racing she drew back to caress his cheek yes you were maybe i was he murmured as he kissed the tip of her nose he continued to watch as his jockey took the horse around for the victory lap can you manage to stand in the winners circle with me i think so people were congratulating them and though erin acknowledged them her thoughts were already moving forward to standing beside burke as he accepted the win her arms were still around him when the official winner was declared charlies pride double bluff had been disqualified disqualified what do they mean well find out taking her hand burke moved out of the stands the murmurs had already started burke they cant say he didnt win for heavens sake i saw it with my own eyes he was well in the lead theres a mistake wait here leaving her he walked over to the paddock area where double bluff was being held she saw a bald man in a suit approach burke then two other men join them it looked so official she thought the bald man was talking calmly pointing to the horse then to a piece of paper as he spoke both the jockey and the trainer began to argue furiously but burke simply stood listening she began to feel the heat as she stood there so she moved over into the shade it was a mistake of course she told herself as she removed her hat to stir air into her face no one would take away what burke had earned what he needed what she needed for him what is it she demanded as burke strode back amphetamines someone gave the horse amphetamines drugs but thats ridiculous apparently not his eyes were narrowed as he looked over at the paddock someone wanted him to win very badly or to lose chapter what do you mean youre sending me home im not a package to be wrapped and stamped erin rushed after burke as he strode from the parlor to the bedroom of the suite youve barely said a word to me since we left the track and now all you can say is youre sending me home theres nothing else to say not at the moment nothing to say because she was breathless after struggling to keep pace with him she sat double bluff was just disqualified from one of the most important races of the year because someone gave him drugs thats plenty to talk about to start its not your concern he pulled a suitcase out of the closet then set it open on the bed pack she kept her seat and just barely her temper but her eyes narrowed oh i see so this is one more thing im not to touch pausing only a moment burke studied her he could see the temper beginning to brew as far as he was concerned she was better off angry than dealing with the tempest of the next few days hed never considered himself a man of great virtues but hed protect his wife you can look at it that way or any other way you like ive got some calls to make pack your things ill see that your flights changed just one bloody minute she was up and after him again as he walked into the next room im sick to death of orders from you almost as sick as i am of talking to your back if you dont put down that phone burke logan itll pleasure me to wrap the cord around your neck erin ive got enough to deal with at the moment without you adding one of your tantrums tantrums her hands clenched into fists as she walked toward him oh ive a flash for you i do you havent seen a tantrum yet now sit taking both hands she shoved him into a chair and its time you unplugged your ears and listened for a change he could have risen again and struck back with his own temper he decided against it in the same way he might have decided to bluff his way to a pot with a pair of deuces the quickest way to have her out and on her way was to show disinterest is this going to take long as long as needs be then would you mind if i had a drink seething she went behind the bar and grabbed a bottle and a glass she slammed them down on the table beside him go ahead have the whole bottle drown yourself in it just onell do he poured two fingers then lifted the glass in a half salute say whats on your mind irish i have a few things to see to before your flight if i said half what was on it your ears would be ringing from now till gabriel blew his horn answer me this are you going to take this business lying down he lifted the glass and sipped watching her steadily over the rim what do you think i think youre going to fight and i think you wont be resting until you find out whos behind this then i think youre going to carve them up in little pieces he toasted her again then downed the rest of the whiskey that about covers it and im not going home to twiddle my thumbs while youre about it thats exactly what youre going to do did it ever occur to you that i could help i dont want your help or need it erin no you dont need anyone she swung away to pace the room wishing she knew a better way than shouting to handle an argument all you need are a few paid servants to deal with the little details while you go on your merry way you certainly dont need a wife a partner to tend to your shirts or hold your hand when theres trouble the urge to get up to hold on to her was so strong he had to press his fingers into the glass until his knuckles whitened because she was wrong she was very very wrong about what and whom he needed i didnt marry you to do my laundry no you married me to sleep with and i know it well enough but you got more than you bargained for because im not running back home like some weakhearted whiny female who cant face a spot of trouble pride he thought and nearly laughed it always seemed to be his pride or hers on the line no ones insulting your valor erin it would simply make things easier if i didnt have you to deal with you wont have to deal with me in private ill stay out of your way and you can do your business however you please but in public im going to be there the loyal and trusting wife whats wrong with that nothing he sat back determined to study her calmly she looked like a comet about to go into orbit it matters to you what these people think what they say and why shouldnt it why shouldnt it indeed he thought as he stared into his empty glass she was worried about her position and hers walked hand in glove with his own have it your way then i can hardly drag you to a plane and tie you on but i warn you it wont be pretty youve said you understand me almost from the first moment we met you said it and i believed you now i see that you really dont understand me at all there was no more anger it had been smothered by a rising despair if theyd really been married in the true sense they would have been able to talk about what had happened they would have been able to fight together rage together instead of at each other you can make your calls im going for a walk but he didnt pick up the phone when she left it was more than being unused to having someone stand beside him more than his own penchant for handling his own in his own way hed wanted her to go away from the murmurs and sly looks he didnt want her to be a part of the suspicion that had already fallen over him and his shed never even asked burke scrubbed his hands over his face and tried to get beyond his own fury it wasnt losing the purse or the race so much as knowing that someone had violated what was his and shed never asked if hed arranged it himself could she really believe so blindly in him or was it a matter of her not caring how he won however she felt he couldnt shield her from the gossip and gossip there would be he thought grimly once she had a taste of it he figured shed be happy enough to go back to the quiet of three aces in the meantime he was going to find out whod messed with him pushing the bottle aside burke picked up the phone the action moved to churchill downs and derby week erin made certain she attended each function and every qualifying race she held her head up and when she heard a whisper only held it higher not everyone seemed inclined to believe that burke had had a hand in the drugging of his horse for every snub and murmur there was someone else to offer support but the only one who mattered had closed himself off from her she didnt try to break through the barrier it took all the energy she had to hold up the pretense of an united couple the strain was taking its toll all the more because she worked hard to make sure burke didnt see it he rose early so she rose early he went to the track to oversee double bluffs morning exercise so she spent her mornings at the track there were days when by noon she was so weary she wanted to crawl off into a corner and sleep but there were races and luncheons and functions often backtoback she refused to miss even one erin mckinnon logan wasnt hiding in some dim corner until the trouble passed she would face it shoulders straight and dare even one person to look her in the eye and make an accusation it was hard and grew harder so that every day she had to force herself to put in an appearance there were whispers and knowing looks behind smiles there were eyes that turned away rather than meet hers and there were a few who preferred to cloak their insults in manners she dressed carefully for a formal dinner party near the end of derby week erin had always felt that a strong outer appearance helped tap the inner strength attending alone was only more difficult but burke had been called to a meeting at the last minute she could have stayed at the hotel just as burke had asked the truth was that a quiet evening a tray in bed and a good book was exactly what she would have preferred but that would have been cowardly so she wore her midnightblue silk and hung her sapphire around her neck like a badge while others sipped cocktails she nursed orange juice and made conversation more than ever she was grateful for paddy he stayed close keeping her spirits up and her mind busy with stories of ireland but he couldnt shield her from everything nor from everyone my dear what a pretty dress dorothy gainsfield swept toward her her eyes as cold as her diamonds good evening mrs gainsfield tell me are you enjoying your first derby week it is your first isnt it aye its my first if erin had learned one thing it was how to return a meaningless smile im sure youve been coming here for many years indeed she said repressively refusing to be insulted by one so beneath her station i dont see your husband he couldnt make it thats understandable isnt it erin felt paddy start forward and laid a hand on his arm with the race only a couple of days away burke is busy im sure he is the older woman gave a dry laugh and sipped her champagne you know im rather surprised hes being allowed to enter after that mishap shall we say at the bluegrass stakes the racing commission feels double bluffs record speaks for itself and for burke once the investigations complete that too will speak for itself oh i dont doubt it my dear not for a minute it isnt unusual for someone to get a bit too enthusiastic about winning this wouldnt be the first time the methods been used to lower the odds burke doesnt cheat he doesnt have to im sure youre right mrs gainsfield smiled again but then i wasnt speaking of your husband mrs logan satisfied with the dig mrs gainsfield moved away that doughfaced old cow paddy began as he fired up ill give her a piece of my mind no again erin put a hand on his arm shes not worth it erin watched her mingle with the crowd when double bluff wins itll be enough erin was determined that by the end of the week they would have discovered who was responsible for double bluffs disqualification and the cloud on burkes reputation would be gone she was even more determined that on sunday when churchill downs opened for the derby burke would win what was rightfully his once that was done she would face the cracks and scars on her marriage perhaps burke had been wrong when hed said most marriages didnt work because one person tried to change the other she knew now that if changes werent made in both of them their marriage would never survive she watched him now as he stood near the oval with his trainer it was barely dawn with a light so sweet and fragile that it turned the white steeples pink the air was cool quiet enough to carry voices to her if not the words all around her the stands were empty in twentyfour hours they would be filling section by section until they and the infield grass were packed with bodies the race would last only a matter of minutes but for those few minutes every square inch would be crammed with excitement with pumping hearts and with hope it has its own magic this time of day travis erin was up and swinging her arms around him she hadnt realized until that moment how badly shed needed someone to hold on to oh its so glad i am to see you but you shouldnt be here she drew away just as quickly what about dee is she all right all right enough to throw me out she told me she could use a couple of days without my hovering over her thats nonsense and i know it but im grateful to both of you she looked beyond his shoulder to her husband he needs his friends now how about you she gave a quick laugh and a shake of her head oh he doesnt seem to need me i dont believe that but it isnt what i meant how are you holding up im tough enough to get through a few rough spots yet youre a bit pale he murmured then took her chin in his hand more than a bit im fine really could use a bit more sleep thats all then she swayed against him before she could pull herself back he was settling her into a seat just sit back ill get burke no she gripped his hand and held hard ill be all right in a second i just need to close my eyes erin if youre ill im not ill she laughed and unconsciously laid a hand on the child that was growing inside her i promise you he lifted his brow as he studied her then congratulations erin opened her eyes slowly youre a sharp one ive been through it a few times he stroked her hand until a hint of color returned to her face how does burke feel about starting a family he doesnt know steadier she sat up and was relieved to see burkes back was still to them he has enough to worry about right now dont you think this would more than balance the scales no letting out a sigh she faced travis again no i dont because im not sure he wants children at all and right now he doesnt want anything more than for me to leave him alone youre underestimating him youre his friend and yours then stand up with him until this is over let me tell him about the baby when the times right all right if you promise to take better care of yourself she smiled and kissed his cheek after tomorrow ill sleep for a week travis burke slipped under the rail i didnt expect to see you down here hate to miss a derby how are things going burke glanced over his shoulder to where the horse was being walked and cooled the colts in top form you can say were both ready to put things right the investigation slow that was true at least of the official one his own was moving quite a bit faster now that travis was here he would have someone he could trust to listen to his theory though he wore his tinted glasses erin felt his eyes on her with a nod of acknowledgment she rose ill leave you to discuss business shes worried about you travis murmured as erin walked away from the stands id prefer she didnt what id prefer is that she went back to the three aces until this is cleared up if youd wanted a quiet obedient wife you shouldnt have picked an irish one burke pulled out a cigar and contemplated it how many times have you been tempted to throttle dee in the last seven years or in the last week for the first time in days burke smiled and meant it never mind do me a favor and keep an eye on her will you i dont think shes feeling well you could try talking to her yourself im not much good at talk id like you to take her back with you after the race tomorrow arent you coming back i might have to stay in kentucky a few more days got a lead a hunch he lit the cigar and blew out smoke trouble is the racing commission likes proof want to talk about it he hesitated only because it still seemed unnatural to confide in another yeah you got a few minutes erin wasnt sure why she felt the sudden need but she walked toward the stables maybe if she could prove to herself that she was strong and capable burke would begin to believe it shed faced the gossip shed stood tall against the innuendos shed held her own but there was one thing shed yet to face one fear shed yet to vanquish so she would do it then tomorrow she would walk easily beside burke into double bluffs stall and she would stand beside him without a quiver in the winners circle three yards from the stables she stopped to give herself another lecture it was foolish to be afraid after all this time it was useless to cling to a feeling that had been caused years before by an accident shed been around animals all her life married to burke she would continue to be around them and the child she rested a hand on her stomach her child would be raised without fear of his inheritance she would walk in alone then tomorrow even if burke wished her to hell and back she would walk in beside him she went closer the scents were there the hay the sweet smell of grain the pungent smell of horse and sweat the sounds too hooves scraping over concrete harness jingling the sighs and lazy whinnies of horses at rest shed be quiet and go carefully remembering that each step was one step closer the light changed almost from the moment she stepped inside it was dimmer softer and now there was the scent of leather as well most of the horses had already been exercised and the grooms were indulging in their own breakfasts before it came time to brush and rub and wrap shed chosen this time the least busy time so that if she bolted no one would see but she didnt bolt one of the horses dipped its head over the gate and she jumped a little but she stood her ground she could touch him erin told herself the gate was latched she could lay her hand on him just as easily as she had with burkes foal her fingers trembled a little but she laid them gingerly against the horses cheek he eyed her but when he shifted his weight she jerked back ill have to do better than that she muttered then laid her hand more firmly on his neck her palm was damp and she didnt move a muscle but she felt a little thrill of victory he was a finelooking animal she told herself as she made her hand move just a little over his neck it was the pentel colt one shed seen race nearly as often as shed seen bluff there now she managed with a sigh its not so bad my hearts thumping but im here im here she repeated silently and im coming back every day each time it would be a little easier she drew her hand back then made herself reach out again and it was easier just as it would become easier to face and overcome her insecurities with burke she wasnt going to go through life being cowed and miserable because her husband was too stubborn to accept her love and her support she might have taken him the way he was but there would be some changes made and soon when she heard voices she drew her hand back again embarrassed she didnt want one of the grooms wandering in to find her she didnt think she was quite ready to stand in the stables and hold a conversation erin wiped her damp palm on her slacks and fixed a casual smile on her face shed started out when the tone of the voices stopped her there was anger in them and though they remained quiet more than a little desperation because she hesitated she had time to recognize one of them if you want your money youll find a way i tell you the horse isnt alone for five minutes logans got him locked up like the crown jewels erins lips parted then firmed she took a step back into the shadows and listened youve got a job to do one youre paid well for if you cant get to the horse get to his feed i want him out of the running for tomorrow i aint poisoning no horse and im tired of taking all the risks you didnt have any qualms about using a hypodermic or taking ten percent of the purse from the bluegrass stakes amphetamines is one thing cyanides another that horse dies and logans not going to rest until somebody hangs for it it aint going to be me then use the drugs the voice was impatient dismissive erin found her hands balled into fists find a way or you wont see a penny if the colts found drugged in the derby hes out for the season i need this race and she needed to get to burke erin stayed still and waited for them to pass on but luck wasnt with her as she saw the two figures enter the stables she straightened her shoulders and moved forward it was a gamble but the best she could hope for was a bluff good day to you mr durnam she made her lips curve even when she saw the shock come into his eyes she glanced at the groom too one of the new ones burkes trainer had hired mrs logan durnam smiled in return but was already calculating we didnt see you in the stables just thought id look over the competition if youll excuse me burkes waiting i think not he took her arm as she tried to pass because shed been half expecting it erin was already primed to scream with surprising speed his hand clamped over her mouth good god almighty what are you doing the groom demanded loganll have your head hell have yours as well if she goes to him and blabs she heard everything you idiot because erins struggles were making him pant durnam thrust her at the groom hold on to her let me think weve got to get the hell out of here if someone comes in shut up just shut up durnams face was already sheened with sweat he took out a white handkerchief and mopped it he was a desperate man who had already taken desperate measures now it was time to take another well put her in the van until the race is over tomorrow by then ill have thought of something taking the handkerchief he pulled it around her mouth as an extra precaution he took the grooms grimy bandanna and tied it over her eyes get some rope hurry tie her hands and feet erin choked on the gag and struggled against both of them but she was already aware shed lose on a desperate impulse she worked her wedding ring off her hand and let it fall to the ground then ropes bit into her wrist and she was smothered inside a blanket she felt herself being lifted but could do no more than squirm even that was futile as the more she resisted the harder it was to breathe she heard a door open just before she was lifted up and set inside on a hard floor what the hell are we going to do with her the groom demanded as he stared down at the heap inside the blanket the minute we let her go shell talk then we wont let her go durnam leaned against the side of the van and this time mopped his brow with his sleeve everything was going to go his way he told himself hed come too far risked too much to have one woman destroy it i aint having no part in murdering a woman durnam dropped his arm and gave the groom a long narrow look you just take care of the horse and leave the woman to me they were going to kill her erin struggled to work the blanket from her face as she heard them shut the van door and walk away shed heard that in his voice even if hed promised the groom that hed cause her no harm she would have known whatever had pushed durnam to this point he wouldnt hesitate to do away with any obstacle her baby with a half sob erin twisted her wrists and fought against the rope mother of mercy she had to protect her baby and burke the panic welled up and for a moment she lost herself in it completely before shed regained control her wrists were raw and her shoulders bruised panting erin lay quiet in the dark and tried to think if she could get up somehow and find the door she might find a way of forcing it open she inched her way over to the wall then using it as a brace she managed to get to her knees she was soaked with sweat by the time shed struggled to her feet keeping her back to the wall she slid along it groping with her fingers she almost wept when she found the knob she twisted straining on her toes before she could fit her fingers around it locked she had to shake her head to keep the tears from coming of course it was locked durnam might be a brute but he wasnt a fool she tried thudding against the door hoping to draw some attention but trussed up tightly she was unable to get the momentum to make more than a quiet bump erin slid to the floor again and closing her mind to both panic and pain continued to work at the ropes have you seen erin travis continued to run his hands down his colts leg as he looked up at burke not since this morning i assumed shed gone back to the hotel maybe she could have taken a cab it was logical burke reminded himself there was no reason for the sick feeling in his stomach we came in together this morning she usually waits she was looking a little tired travis straightened she could have gone back to get some rest before tonight yeah it made sense she was probably soaking in a hot tub right now thinking about the party that night i think ill drive back and check on her ask her if shell take pity on a lonely man and save a few dances for me sure burke yeah something wrong his hands were cold icecold no nothing see you in a couple hours they stayed cold as he drove from the track toward the hotel it wasnt like erin to simply go off without a word but then they hadnt been exchanging a great many words lately his fault he accepted that with a shrug he didnt feel right about her being there and he hated seeing her brace herself against the gossip that would certainly swell before it diminished if she wasnt so damn stubborn about maintaining a social position but then that was one of the things hed promised her when theyd married he couldnt help but be grateful that she was sticking by him whatever her reasons but with gratitude came only more guilt and responsibility he was no fonder of responsibility now than hed ever been maybe it would be a relief to head the car west and keep going to start from scratch as hed done so many times before nothing had ever held him back before but then there hadnt been an erin before once the race and the scandal were behind them they would talk the air had to be cleared the rules had to be reset maybe just maybe after it was all done hed tell her about his past the way hed grown up the things hed filled his life with it was better to have it out to make it clean now and let her walk away than to continue waiting for her to find out for herself hed never thought of his past as anything to be ashamed of that was something else shed done to him shed forced him to look back at his past a little too hard and he didnt like what he saw his mood hadnt improved by the time he reached the hotel he knew it was ridiculous for him to be angry with her for leaving the track when hed demanded she leave altogether but damn it shed made him depend on her the days were easier to get through when he knew he could look around and see her he didnt care for that either by the time he walked into their suite he was primed for a fight it had been too long since theyd developed a polite veneer and no substance he was going to shout at her and let her shout back then theyd both vent the rest of their frustrations in bed erin he slammed the door behind him but had gone no farther than the center of the parlor before he knew she wasnt there and his hands were cold again cursing himself he walked into the bedroom had she left him had he pushed her away far enough consistently enough that shed decided to take that final step he didnt want to lose her that admission left him shaken as she reached for the closet door no he didnt want to lose her any more than he wanted to need her he had to make himself pull open the door of the closet and was nearly dizzy with relief when he saw her clothes undisturbed shed gone shopping he told himself or to have her hair done but those thoughts didnt relieve his mind as he closed the closet door he was pacing the suite nearly thirty minutes later when the phone rang burke pounced on it ready to rail at her no matter what her explanation burke its travis yeah is erin back at the hotel no and now his mouth was dry why lloyd pentel just brought me her wedding ring he found it on the floor in the stables what the stables he was lowering himself into a chair unaware that hed moved at all thats not right she wouldnt go in the stables shes afraid of horses burke travis kept his voice calm has she been back to the hotel no she hasnt been here i want to talk to pentel i already have he hasnt seen her burke we may be jumping the gun but i think you should call the police shed lost track of the time once shed thought the ropes had loosened but had had to accept it as wishful thinking more than her wrists hurt now there were bumps and bruises all over from a fall shed taken while trying to maneuver standing up because the fall had scared her badly with the thought of what might have happened to the baby she no longer tried to stand for a time she closed herself off and thought of burke as if she could will him to find her would he be worried had enough time passed that he would begin to wonder where she was would he care she may have prayed then slept a little while dreaming first of ireland and the farm why had she wanted to leave so badly what had been safe and secure then she dreamed of burke and knew that part of the answer was that shed been meant for him mrs logan her body jackknifed as a hand touched her shoulder the blindfold was loosened and she had to blink and struggle to focus in the dim light she made out the face of the groom and panic flooded back hed come to kill her and her baby i brought you some food you gotta promise to be quiet durnam would have my hide for coming in here like this if you promise not to scream ill take the gag off so you can eat if you make noise i put it back and you get nothing she nodded then drew in fresh air when her mouth was free it wasnt easy to smother the instinct to cry out but she could still taste the gag hed pulled from her mouth please why are you doing this if its money you want you can have it im in too deep he had a sandwich that was rapidly going stale eat some or youll get sick what difference does it make just the smell of the meat between the bread made her stomach turn youre going to kill me anyway now i dont have nothing to do with that she saw the panic in his eyes and the sweat beading on his lip he was as afraid as she was if she could use that she might yet have a chance you know what durnams going to do he cant let me go he just wants to win thats all he needs to got himself in some financial trouble and his stable isnt as good as it was charlies pride is his best shot but logans colt is better thats why he had me hire on at three aces so i could keep an eye on things and make sure the race went wrong but thats it he added glancing around he was talking too much he always talked too much when he got nervous and he wanted a drink the saliva in his mouth had dried to nothing i just sweetened the horse some thats what durnam wanted he just needs to put him out of the running you gotta understand this is business just business youre talking about races im talking about murder i dont want to hear about it i got nothing to do with that now you eat mr i dont know your name its berley maam tom berley ridiculous as it was he lifted his fingers to his cap mr berley im begging you for my life and not just for mine but for the baby im carrying you cant let him kill my baby now youll only be in trouble about the horse but this is murder an innocent child mr berley im not going to hear no more talk about killing his voice had roughened but his hands werent steady when they pulled the gag up again he no longer wanted a drink he needed one desperately he started to replace the blindfold but the look in her eyes had him hesitating there was nothing for her to see anyway he told himself the back of the van was windowless and the cab was blocked off by a wooden partition you dont want to eat thats your business ive got my own to see to he stuffed the sandwich in his pocket erin saw him look both ways before he stepped out the door again and left her in the dark chapter id prefer if youd go out and look for my wife lieutenant rather than sitting here asking me questions lieutenant hallinger was nearly sixty and after thirtyseven years on the force he figured hed seen it all and heard twice as much hed certainly experienced more than his share of frustrated and angry spouses it seemed to him that the man in front of him was both mr logan we have an apb out on your wife right now and several officers are asking questions at the track though he envied burke his cigar he didnt mention it it would help clear things up and give us a better chance of locating your wife if youd fill me in ive already told you erin hasnt come back to the hotel no ones seen her since this morning and her wedding ring was found at the stables at churchill downs some people are careless with jewelry mr logan some people what the hell was this business about some people they were talking about erin his erin where the hell was she he looked back at hallinger again and spoke precisely not erin and not with her wedding ring umhmm he made a notation in his book mr logan occasionally this sort of thing comes down to a simple misunderstanding he could have written a book hallinger thought yeah he couldve written a book on misunderstandings alone did you and your wife quarrel this morning no its possible she rented a car and decided to do a little sightseeing thats ridiculous he glanced up as travis handed him a cup of coffee burke accepted it but set it aside if erin had wanted to go for a drive she would have taken the car weve already rented she would have told me she was leaving and she would have been back two hours ago we had plans for this evening hed had plans himself which had included a nice quiet evening with his own wife and a footbath hallinger wriggled his aching toes inside his shoes derby week can be chaotic it might have slipped her mind erins the most responsible person i know if shes not here its because she cant get here he thought again of the hateful and terrifying calls hed already made to the hospitals because someones keeping her from getting here mr logan kidnapping usually prompts a ransom call youre a wealthy man yet you tell me you havent been contacted no i havent been contacted but he still broke out in a sweat every time the phone rang look lieutenant ive told you everything i know and im damn sick of going over the same ground when you should be out doing your job id go out and look myself but i feel its more important for me to stay here and wait endlessly hallinger glanced over his notes he was a thin man with small aching feet and a quiet voice he was a man who took his appearance as seriously as he took his job it was possible for him to admire burkes casually expensive shoes while noting his nerves and anxiety mr logan you had some trouble at the bluegrass stakes how did your wife feel about that she was upset naturally crushing out his cigar he rose to pace upset enough to want to avoid the crowds tonight and tomorrow upset enough to want to escape from it and you there was a flat and dangerous look in burkes eyes when he turned erin wouldnt run from anything or anyone the fact is i asked her to go back home until this thing was settled she wouldnt do it she insisted on staying and seeing it through youre a fortunate man im aware of that now why dont you get the hell out of here and find my wife hallinger simply made a note in his book and turned to travis mr grant youre the last person we know of who spoke with mrs logan this morning what was her mood she was anxious about the race about burke a little tired she told me she intended to sleep a week when the derby was over the last thing on her mind was missing the race or leaving her husband shes only been married a few weeks and shes very much in love umhmm the lieutenant said again with maddening calm her ring was found in the stables you tell me she didnt go in the stables mr logan yet she was seen walking toward them early this morning to prove a point to herself maybe i cant be sure his patience was stretching thinner by the second if shed waited for him to go with her if shed asked him to take her in stand with her hed been the one whod pulled away far enough that shed stopped asking him for anything what sort of point mr logan what patience was an integral part of hallingers job you said she might have gone inside the stables to prove a point she had an accident a few years ago and was afraid of horses over the past few weeks shes been trying to win out over it damn it what difference does it make why she went in she was there and now shes missing i work better with details when the phone rang burke jumped his face was gray with strain when he lifted the receiver yes with a muttered oath he offered it to hallinger its for you theyre going to find her burke travis touched a hand to burkes shoulder as he passed youve got to hold on to that its wrong its very wrong i can feel it it was welling up inside him beyond the first panic beyond the lingering fear was a dread a certainty if they dont find her soon its going to be too late ive got to get out of here will you stay in case a call comes in sure hallinger watched burke walk to the door and simply gestured for one of his men to follow she must have slept erin woke from the nightmare soaked with sweat and shivering with cold she murmured for burke and tried to reach out but her arms wouldnt move it wasnt just a dream she realized as she closed her eyes and took deep breaths to stem another wave of panic how long oh god how long perhaps they were just going to leave her here to go mad or slowly starve to death she wouldnt go mad because she would think of burke she would close her eyes and remember how it felt to lie beside him at night with the moonlight coming through the windows and his body warm against hers she would think about the way he would kiss her in that way he had that slow devastating way that made her bones melt and her mind go dim she could taste him even now she could taste him and feel the way his hand felt as he brushed it over her cheek and into her hair he had such wonderful hands so strong and hard they were always so steady always so sure sometimes at night shed reach for his hand and hold it against her cheek just to have it there she didnt think he ever knew if she concentrated hard enough she could almost feel his hand against her cheek now she could hold it there as long as she wanted when her eyes grew accustomed to the dark she could see his head on the pillow beside hers his profile was such a handsome one with its firm jaw and the sharp planes of his cheeks she liked it when it was shadowed just a bit with beard had she ever told him that he was such a pleasure to look at and if she was careful she could cuddle close not waking him the scent of his skin would lull her to sleep he always smelled as shed thought a man should without the sweetening of colognes so she could cuddle close and sometimes he would shift closer his arm stretching lazily over her waist those were the best times when she could murmur that she loved him shed told herself that if he heard it enough times in his sleep he would begin to believe it so erin kept her eyes closed and thought only of burke after a time she slept again it was nearly three but burke sat in the same chair hed gone out for only an hour driving to the track with some wild hope that he would find erin waiting for him hed prowled the stables and badgered the stable boys and grooms with the same questions the police had already asked but there was no erin nor any sign of her so hed come back to pace the parlor haunt the bedroom and ignore the coffee that travis poured for him for the past hour hed sat unmoving staring at the phone hed told travis to go to get some sleep and had been ignored it reminded him that there had only been one other person in his life who had stuck by him if he lost her he couldnt think of that he knew that luck could change could turn cruel like a change in the wind but not with erin she hadnt had her chance yet not a real one to see everything there was maybe hed been wrong to lock her in so quickly to bind her to him but she still had so much life so much energy why was it he couldnt get past that one sick thought that whatever was happening to her now was because of him when the phone rang he grabbed the receiver with both hands logan the voice in his ear was thick with liquor but he understood and his heart began to thud where is she i dont want no trouble spiking the horse was one thing but i dont want no trouble fine tell me where she is he glanced up to see travis beside him waiting i didnt want no part of it hell kill me if he finds out im talking to you just tell me where she is and ill take care of it kept her at the track in the van i dont know what hes going to do kill her maybe what van what van damn it i aint having no part in murder when the phone went dead burke simply dropped it and rose shes at the track theyre holding her in a van ill call the police and be right behind you he drove like a maniac ignoring red lights and speed limits kill her maybe those three words drummed in his head over and over so that he didnt notice the speedometer hovering at a hundred and ten the streets were deserted people were asleep anticipating the race tomorrow some would already be camped on the infield grass he prayed that erin was asleep as well and when she woke he would be there gravel spit from under the tires as he braked behind the stables vans were parked there for trainers for owners who preferred to stay close to their horses for grooms and hands who could afford a little luxury he only needed to find one he started across the lot when he heard steps behind him fists clenched and murder on his mind he whirled easy lad paddy told him travis called me he nodded briefly though in the moonlight he could see that the old man hadnt slept either durnams van which is it durnam travis said you didnt know which call it a hunch which one is durnams the big black one there paddy turned as he heard the whine of sirens the police are coming but burke was already racing to the black van erin the door held fast for a moment he thought he could tear it off with his bare hands use this paddy handed him a crowbar when travis called and filled me in i thought wed have use for it without hesitation burke began to pry the door open all the time calling to her he wanted her to know it was him he couldnt stand the thought of her having one more instant of fear the metal groaned fought back then gave burke gripped the crowbar like a weapon as he jumped inside he shoved away the plywood partition that separated the back of the van from the cab erin there was no answer no sound what if he was too late burke turned the crowbar in his hands wiping sweat on metal erin its all right ive come to take you out of here he cursed the lack of light and dropped to his hands and knees he saw her then curled in a corner in the rear he was with her in an instant but he was almost afraid to touch her his hand went to her cheek first so cold so still erin in a fit of rage he tore the gag away when her eyes fluttered open he nearly wept with relief erin its all right but when he reached for her she cringed making small sounds in her throat its all right he murmured im not going to let anyone hurt you its burke darling its okay now burke her eyes were still glazed with shock but she said his name thats right and im going to take you out of here he shifted her cursing under his breath each time she whimpered her trembles became shudders that none of his soothing words could halt he found the ropes but when he started to loosen them she cried out im sorry i have to get them off i dont want to hurt you can you stay very still she simply turned her face to the wall the van shook as men entered and she pressed back in the corner i need a knife he looked up and saw lieutenant hallinger give me a damn knife then get out shes terrified hallinger reached in his pocket with one hand and signaled his men back with the other just hold on irish its all over now he hurt her he could feel each jerk and tremble inside his own body as he cut through the bonds both his skin and hers were damp before he had freed her feet as well im going to pick you up and carry you out just stay still my arms she bit her lip as even the gentlest touch sent the pain throbbing i know as carefully as he could he lifted her up she moaned and pressed her face against his shoulder when they stepped outside the lot was bright with lights erin squeezed her burning eyes shut she couldnt think beyond the pain and fear and concentrated on the sound of burkes voice you stay the hell away from her he said very quietly his eyes on hallinger i called an ambulance travis stepped between burke and the police its here now paddy and i will follow you as if in a dream erin felt herself laid down the light was still too bright so she kept her eyes closed there were voices too many voices but she focused in on the only one that mattered she jolted as she felt something cool over the raw skin of her wrist but burke stroked her hair and never stopped talking to her he didnt know what he said promises vows nonsense but he could see the dried blood on her wrists and ankles and the bruises that ran up her arms each time she winced he thought of durnam and how he would kill him in the stables she murmured i heard them in the stables talking about drugging the horse it doesnt matter burke kept stroking her hair in the stables she repeated in a voice that was thin and tended to float i couldnt get away i tried youre safe now just lie still they wouldnt let him go with her erin was wheeled away the moment they reached the hospital and burke was left helpless and hurting in the hallway shes going to be all right travis laid a hand on his shoulder burke nodded the ambulance attendants had already assured him of that her wrists were the worst of her physical injuries they would heal just as the bruises would fade but no one knew how badly shed been scarred emotionally stay with her theres something i have to do burke youll do her more good here and yourself just stay with her he repeated then strode out through the wide glass doors he kept his mind carefully blank as he drove out to durnams farm the rage was there but he held it knowing it would cloud his thinking so he thought of nothing and his mind stayed as cool as the earlymorning air the thirtyminute drive took him fifteen but still the police were faster burke slammed out of his car in front of durnams palatial stone house and faced hallinger once again thought id see you here tonight hallinger lit one of the five cigarettes he allowed himself which was five more than his wife knew about figured a sharp man like you would have already put it together that durnam was the one who had your horse drugged yeah i put that together where is he hes my guest tonight hallinger blew out smoke then leaned against the hood of burkes car if the footbath didnt work he was going to have to go see the damned podiatrist you know sometimes cops have brains too we were here questioning durnam when the call came in that you were on your way to the track to get your wife why well assuming that your wifes disappearance had something to do with the trouble last week which was a big assumption i had to figure out who had the most to gain that would be durnam i take it youd already worked that out i had everything but proof weve got that now too the man was already on the edge our call coming in was all it took to push him over hed cleaned out his bank account what was left of it knew that did you yeah i knew that had his bags packed but he wasnt going to miss that race tomorrow today hallinger corrected with a glance up at the lightening sky he wanted that derby win bad funny how people can set their minds on one thing and forget about the consequences hows your wife shes hurt where are you keeping him thats police business now mr logan he examined his cigarette thoughtfully before taking another drag i know how you feel burke cut him off with a look you dont know how i feel hallinger nodded slowly youre right and i doubt youre in the mood for advice but here it is you havent been a boy scout logan he smiled a little sourly when burke only continued to stare at him i make it my business to check details youve had a few scrapes in your time some bad luck and some good right now id say youve got yourself a good woman and a chance to make things click dont blow it on something as pitiful as charles durnam he lost a hell of a lot more than a horse race isnt that enough no burke pulled open the door of his car then paused to turn back he gets out in a year in twenty years hes dead with some regret hallinger flipped the butt of his cigarette away ill keep that in mind when erin awoke she opened her eyes cautiously the hospital the wave of relief came as it did every time she awoke to find herself safe the light beside her bed was still burning shed hated to be weak but had insisted the nurse leave it on even when the sun was coming up burke hadnt been there shed fretted and asked for him but theyd wheeled her to a private room and tucked her into bed promising hed be with her soon she was to sleep to relax she wasnt to worry but she wanted him listless she turned her head there were already flowers in the room she imagined travis or paddy had seen to that theyd been so kind but she wanted burke shifting in search of comfort she pushed herself up in bed and she saw him he was standing by the window his back to her everything fled but the pleasure of knowing he was there with her burke he turned immediately his first thought was that she was sitting up and her cheeks were no longer pale his second thought was that if it hadnt been for him she wouldnt be in a hospital bed with bandages on her wrists because she was holding out a hand he went to her and touched it lightly youre looking better he said inadequately im feeling better i didnt know you were here ive been around awhile do you want anything i could eat she smiled and reached for his hand again but his was in his pocket ill get the nurse burke she stopped him as he reached the door it can wait look at you you havent slept busy night she tried another smile aye it was all of that im sorry his eyes went hard and flat dont ill get the nurse alone erin lay back on the pillows maybe she was still confused and disoriented he couldnt really be angry with her with a half sigh she closed her eyes of course he could there was no telling with men and with burke in particular whether it was her fault or not shed put him through hell and now she was tying him to a hospital room on the most important day of his life when the door opened again she made sure her smile was cheerful and her voice though her throat still tended to ache mirrored it you should be at the track i had no idea it was so late did anyone think to bring me a change of clothes i can be ready in ten minutes youre not going anywhere you dont expect me to miss my first derby i know what the doctor said but then youll know youre not getting up from that bed for twentyfour hours dont be stupid she opened her mouth then firmly shut it again she wouldnt argue with him shed been close to death and that made a person think about how much time was wasted on pettiness youre right of course ill just sit here and be pampered while i watch on television why didnt he come to her why didnt he hold her erin kept her lips curved as he turned again to stare out of the window youd better be on your way where to the track of course its nearly noon youve already missed the morning im staying here her heart did a quick flip but she shook her head dont be silly you cant miss this if im to be shut up here its bad enough at least i can have the pleasure of watching you step into the winners circle theres nothing for you to do here he thought of how helpless hed felt through the night of how helpless he felt now no i suppose there isnt then off with you she told him forcing her voice to be light yeah he rubbed his hands over his face and i dont want to see you back here until youve had some rest she lifted her face for a kiss but his lips only brushed over her brow see you later burke he was already out of reach youre going to win with a nod he closed the door behind him he leaned against the wall almost too exhausted to stand far too exhausted to think he didnt give a damn about the derby or any other race all he could see playing over and over in his mind was erin curled in the corner of that van cringing away from him shed bounced back smiling and talking as though nothing had happened but he could still see the white bandages on her wrists he was afraid to touch her afraid shed cringe away again or if she didnt that hed hurt her he was afraid to look at her too long because hed see that glazed shock in her eyes again he was afraid that if he didnt gather her close keep her close that shed slip away from him that he would lose her as hed nearly lost her only hours before but she was urging him to go telling him she didnt need him beside her all she needed was a win a blanket of red roses and a trophy hed damn well give them to her she hadnt realized she would be nervous but even watching the preliminaries the interviews the discussions on television kept her pulse racing when she saw burke caught by the cameras as he stepped out of the stables she laughed and hugged her pillow oh if she could just be there with him holding on but he avoided the reporter leaving erin disappointed shed wanted to hear him to see his face on the screen so that they could laugh about it later then it was the reporter facing the camera recounting the story that had unfolded since the bluegrass stakes it pleased her to hear that burkes name had been cleared absolutely and that double bluff was considered the favorite in the run for the roses she listened trying to be dispassionate as he talked about her kidnapping and durnams arrest the groom had been picked up sleeping off a bottle in a stall apparently it hadnt taken much encouragement for him to spill the entire story there were pictures of the van with its broken door and police barriers that she had to force herself to look at it almost amused her to be told that she was resting comfortably somehow the reporter made it all sound like a grand adventure something out of a mystery novel the lady in distress the villain and the hero she wrinkled her nose however much she might consider burke a hero she didnt care to think of herself as a lady in distress she let it pass as she watched the horses being spotlighted as they were led from the paddock there was double bluff as big and as handsome as ever double bluff the threeyearold from three aces owners burke and erin logan she smiled at that though of course it was burkes horse and the news people had made a mistake it still gave her a good feeling to see her name flash on the screen with burkes she laughed at herself again because her palms were getting sweaty the track was just as shed known it would be filled to capacity the camera panned over dorothy gainsfield erin gave herself the satisfaction of sticking out her tongue then it focused on burke and her heart broke a little he looked so tired worn to the bone that was why hed been so distant before the man was exhausted when hed rested and had time to get his bearings things would be right again i love you burke she told him rubbing her cheek against the pillow loving you is what got me through then the screen flashed back to the horses it was nearly post time there was the blare of the trumpet and the roar of the crowd again erin found herself tempted to jump out of bed and hurry to the track if it hadnt been for the baby she would have ignored the doctor and done just that instead she forced herself to be patient well go to our first derby together she murmured as she placed a hand on her stomach next year the three of us will go the bell sounded and for the next two minutes she didnt take her eyes off the screen it seemed to her that double bluff was running with a vengeance and perhaps he was perhaps burke had transformed some of his emotions to the horse for the colt ran like fury when he broke from the pack early erin held her breath it was too soon she knew the jockey had been instructed to hold him back the first half mile there was no holding back today her first concern evaporated in pure excitement as she watched him run he was glorious angry and unstoppable it was as if the horse himself wanted vindication and perhaps revenge he clung to the rail taking the turns hard and close traviss apollo held back by a length the pentel colt under a new rider was coming up fast on the outside and the crowd was on its feet erin was shouting but was unaware of it even after the nurse came in as he came down the backstretch he poured on more speed impossibly more so that even the announcers voice cracked with excitement two lengths then three then three and a half he went under the wire as if he was alone on the oval he never gave up the lead erin brushed her palms over her cheeks to dry them not once congratulations mrs logan id say youve just had some of the best medicine on the market the very best but her fingers curled into the sheets as she waited for the official announcement in her mind she could picture it the weighing in the certification it seemed to take forever but then the numbers flashed on the board the very very best theres burke she gripped the nurses hand hes worked so hard for this waited so long oh i wish i could be with him she watched the cameramen and reporters vie for angles as burke and his trainer grouped in the winners circle why wasnt he smiling she wondered as she wiped another tear away she saw him reach up and shake his jockeys hand but couldnt hear whatever it was he said its a good day for three aces a reporter stuck a microphone in burkes face this must make up for the disqualification last week mr logan it doesnt begin to make up for it he patted the colts neck i think double bluff proved himself a champion here today and proved my trust in his team but this race was run for my wife he pulled a rose from the blanket covering his horse excuse me that was a lovely thing to say the nurse murmured aye still as erin watched the jockey hold the cup over his head she wondered why she felt so lost chapter they flew home as soon as erin was released from the hospital but she didnt feel like celebrating everything should have been right burkes reputation had been cleared his prize colt had won the derby with a track record and she was safe so why was it everything was wrong she knew burke could be aloof that he could be arrogant and hardheaded those were three ridiculous reasons to love a man but they were reasons none the less what she hadnt known was that he could be both withdrawn and distant he never touched her in fact as the first few days passed erin realized he was going out of his way to avoid any opportunity to touch her he came to bed late and rose early he spent a great deal more time out of the house and away than he spent at home she tried to tell herself he was just gearing up for the preakness the second jewel of the triple crown but she knew it wasnt true with too much time left to herself to think she began to remember the words shed heard on her wedding day men are easily charmed and just as easily bored was that it was he bored with her trying to find the answer she took stock of herself her face was the same maybe she was a little holloweyed but those things came with worry and restless nights her body was still firm though she knew that would change in a matter of weeks and what then she wondered when she told him about the baby would he turn away completely no she couldnt believe that of him burke would never turn his back on his own child but on her if he was tired of her now how would he feel when she began to round and swell she wanted to look forward to the changes in her body to the signs that her baby was growing and healthy but would those same changes push burke only farther away how could they not if they didnt reestablish their intimacy since the physical change couldnt be avoided erin decided shed better do something about seducing her husband now she chose the wine herself that was something she was pleased to have developed a knack for she wouldnt do any more than play at drinking it herself but it was the atmosphere that mattered and candles she set dozens of them around the bedroom lighting them so that their scent would be as much a part of the mood as the flames she chose the same gown shed worn on her wedding night the white lace that made her feel like a bride hed thought her lovely once desirable once he would again she picked the chopin hed played on their first night together and wondered if he would remember tonight would be another first another beginning when theyd loved each other when theyd finally come back together as they were meant to be she would tell him about the baby then they would talk about the future hed taken himself to the wire before he climbed the stairs burke found it easiest to wear himself out before he slipped into bed beside her that way it wasnt as difficult to stop himself from pulling her against him it wasnt as difficult to ignore the fact that she was right there next to him soft and lovely and incredibly sweet it wasnt as difficult to will himself to sleep and pretend he didnt want her but it was all a lie it was killing him to be with her and yet not to be with her still he knew no other way to wean her away to give her time to make a choice she had secrets she was keeping from him he could see them in her eyes there were times he wanted to take her by the shoulders and shake her until she told him then he would remember what she had gone through because of him and he didnt touch her at all shed been the perfect wife since theyd come back never demanding never questioning never arguing he wanted erin back then he stepped into the bedroom and his limbs went weak i thought youd never come up she crossed to him holding out a hand youre working too hard theres a lot to be done when he didnt take her hand she curled her fingers into her palm but made herself take the final step theres more to living than horses and the next race involuntarily he reached up to touch her hair i thought youd gone to bed ive been waiting for you she brought a hand to his cheek as she rose on her toes to kiss him ive missed you missed being alone with you come to bed burke make love with me i havent finished downstairs it can wait smiling she began to unbutton his shirt she was sure almost sure that she felt his response his need we havent had an evening alone in a long time it only took the feel of her bandages rubbing against his skin im sorry i only came up to see if you were all right you should get some rest the rejection stung her and she stepped back even as he did you dont want me anymore do you not want her he was nearly eaten up with wanting i want you to take care of yourself thats all youve been through a lot of strain aye and you thats why we need some time together he touched his fingers lightly to her cheek get some sleep she stared at the closed door before turning away blindly to blow out the candles erin closed herself in the office and buried herself in columns of figures those at least she could understand with numbers when you added two and two you could be assured of a logical answer life shed discovered and burke in particular wasnt quite that simple when the call came from travis that dee was in labor she found herself not only pleased for her cousin but for herself and the diversion scribbling a hasty note she left it on her desk if burke bothered to look for her hed find it if he didnt then it didnt matter where she was shed learned something else about marriage both husband and wife should stand on their own in the best of worlds this was offset by an interdependence a sharing a love of each other and a contentment in each others company in the notsobest it simply meant survival she was and always had been a survivor still she watched the house retreat as she drove toward the main road such a special place it was the kind shed always dreamed of living in the grass was green now and the flowers were in bloom it was hard to believe she could finally have something so beautiful and still be unhappy but it could be so much more than a place to live she thought just as her marriage could be so much more than an agreement between two logical adults in time burke would have to decide how much more he would permit it to be he was dealing with his own devils when he came into the house all morning and half the afternoon hed been unable to erase from his mind how lovely erin had looked the night before how hard it had been to walk away from her and from his own feelings he was no longer sure he was doing her a favor and he knew for a fact he was killing himself maybe the time had come for them to talk plain words plain thinking he didnt believe himself capable of much else it hadnt taken him long to realize he was useless without her how that had come to be and why didnt seem to matter it simply was but nagging at him gnawing at him was the question of what she would be without him hed never given her a chance to find out so theyd face off that was something he understood now was as good a time as any he glanced in her office and finding it empty passed it by in the atrium rosa was watering geraniums he paused there wishing he didnt continually find himself uncomfortable when he caught her going about her household duties rosa is erin upstairs rosa glanced up but continued her watering the senora went out a few hours ago out the panic was absurd so he told himself even as it choked him where she didnt tell me did she take her car i believe so when he swore and turned away rosa moved to a pot of asters burke yes she smiled a little and set down her watering can you have little more patience now than you did when you were ten i dont want her left alone yet you do so continually she lifted her brow at his look its difficult to pretend not to see whats under my nose your wifes unhappy so are you erins fine and so am i you would say the same when you came home with a black eye that was a long time ago its foolish to think either of us have forgotten to have a future its necessary to face the past whats the point in this rosa she did something she hadnt done since theyd been children crossing to him she touched a hand to his face shes stronger than you think my brother and you you arent nearly as tough im not ten anymore rosa no but in some ways you were easier then i was never easy it was the life that wasnt easy youve changed that maybe your mother would be proud of you she would rosa insisted when he started to back away she never had a chance no but you do and you gave one to me he made a quick gesture of dismissal i gave you a job and the first decent home ive ever known rosa added before you go answer one question why do you let me stay the truth burke he didnt want to answer but shed always had a way of looking straight and waiting for as long as it took maybe he owed her the truth maybe he owed it to himself because she cared about you and so do i she smiled then went back to watering your wife wont wait as long for an answer shes impatient like you rosa why do you stay she fluffed the leaves of a fern because i love you so does your wife if you dont mind i would like to pick some flowers for the sitting room yeah sure he left rosa there watering plants and went back to erins office it was the first time hed asked himself or allowed himself to ask why hed permitted rosa to stay why hed provided her with a job in order that she could keep her pride she was family it was just that simple and just that hard to accept shed been right too when shed said that erin wouldnt wait so long for an answer he wanted erin there where they could sit down together there where he could talk to her about his feelings that would be a first he admitted restless he began to push through the papers on her desk she was a hell of a bookkeeper he thought ruefully everything in neat little piles all the figures in tidy rows a man could hardly complain about having a conscientious wife it certainly shouldnt make him want to gather up all the books and papers and dump them in the trash it was the doctor bill that made him frown all medical expenses from her stay in kentucky should have been addressed to him yet this one was clearly marked to her annoyed he picked it up with the intention of dealing with it himself he wanted her to have no reminders but the doctors address wasnt in kentucky it was in maryland and the doctor was an obstetrician obstetrician burke lowered himself very carefully in her chair the words pregnancy test seemed to jump out at him pregnant erin was pregnant that couldnt be because he would have known she would have told him yet he had the paper in his hand the paper stated positive clearly enough and the test was dated almost a month earlier erin was pregnant and she hadnt told him what else hadnt she told him he sprang up again to push through the other papers as if hed find the answers there it was then he found her note hastily scribbled burke ive gone to the hospital i dont know how long it will take as he stared at the note he felt all the blood drain out of his face oh i dont see how dee can be so calm and patient paddy turned a page in the magazine he was pretending to read you cant hurry babies into the world it seems to be taking forever erin paced the waiting room again my palms are sweating and she looked like she could take a walk in the park its scary having babies he chuckled a little and sneaked a peek at his watch while erin wasnt looking dees an old hand at this erin laid a hand on her stomach was she this way when she had the first one i mean the first one would be the scariest its like taking everything on faith that nothings going to go wrong dees a trouper aye she prayed she would be as well when her time came it must make a difference having travis with her through it all shed seen the way hed been with dee standing beside the bed holding her hand talking making her laugh timing her contractions total support total commitment i wonder paddy do you think most men would do that would burke id say when a man loves a woman the way travis loves dee he wouldnt be anywhere else right now lass youre going to wear a rut in the floor i cant sit still she muttered im going to go downstairs and see if i can buy some flowers have them waiting for her thats a fine idea i could bring you some tea you do that wont be long now he waited until she was out of sight to get up and pace himself downstairs burke burst into the hospital like a man possessed in seconds he had pounced on the admissions clerk wheres my wife the clerk swiveled her chair over to her computer name logan erin logan when was she admitted i dont know a couple of hours ago the clerk began to punch buttons for what purpose i he wasnt sure he could deal with the purpose shes pregnant maternity the clerk continued to punch im sorry mr logan we dont have your wife i know shes here damn it where continuing to swear he pulled the paper out of his pocket dr morgan i want to see dr morgan dr morgans in delivery with another patient you can check at the nurses station on the fifth floor but she shrugged when burke raced away expectant fathers she thought they were always crazy burke jammed a fist against the elevator button he hated hospitals hed lost his mother in one only days before hed watched erin lie in one and now burke i didnt expect you he turned to see erin walking toward him with a huge arrangement of rosebuds and babys breath her hair was pulled back and her cheeks were glowing the flowers nearly tipped to the floor when he grabbed her shoulders what the hell are you doing he demanded burke youre crushing them ill crush more than a bunch of flowers i want you to tell me what youre doing im taking them upstairs if they survive i think dee will appreciate them more if theyre not mangled dee he shook his head but didnt manage to clear it what are you talking about what are you talking about she countered it doesnt seem so strange to me to buy flowers for someone whos having babies dee you came here because dees delivering well of course didnt you see my note i saw your note he muttered taking her arm he pulled her into the elevator it wasnt very clear i was in a hurry i wish theyd had more roses she murmured seems when youre having twins you should have twice as many flowers she buried her face in them a moment then smiled at him im glad you came itll mean a lot to dee struggling for calm he stepped out when the doors opened again how is she shes perfect paddy and i are a wreck but shes perfect you shouldnt be on your feet he took the flowers because he was abruptly afraid for her to carry anything you shouldnt be getting yourself worked up dont be silly she turned into the waiting room not to find paddy pacing but to find him dancing one of each he shouted to both of them shes gone and had one of each oh paddy laughing she flung herself at him and let him whirl her around shes all right and the babies everyones all right everyones fit as a fiddle so the nurse told me theyll be bringing them all out in a minute so we can have a peek a fine day to you burke a fine fine day paddy erin why dont you sit down sit she shook her head with another laugh and hooked her arm through paddys i couldnt sit if my legs fell off paddy and i are going dancing arent we paddy that we are he put his chin up and began to hum recognizing the tune erin joined in as their feet began to move burke stood holding a bushel of roses and watched them he hadnt heard her laugh like that for too long he hadnt seen her smile just that way he wanted to toss the flowers aside and gather her up snatch her away take her home hold her for hours here she is paddy did another quick jig as dee was wheeled out heres my little girl look at this he had to pull out his handkerchief and wipe his eyes theyre beautiful lass just like you what am i travis wanted to know chopped liver you did a fine job erin moved over to kiss his cheek a boy and a girl she looked down at the two bundles beside her cousin and so tiny theyll grow quick enough dee turned her head to the right then the left to nuzzle them the doctor said they have everything they should have lord they came out squalling both of them didnt they travis they have their mothers disposition its lucky you are ive my hands full burke its good of you to come this is the best time to have family around are you okay he felt both foolish and awkward as he passed the flowers to travis is there anything you want a ham sandwich she said with a sigh a huge one but im afraid theyll make me wait just a little while yet im sorry well have to take mrs grant now evening visiting hours start at seven paddy bring the children back tonight no children under twelve are allowed mrs grant the nurse said as she began to push her away dee merely smiled and mouthed the request again she looked wonderful didnt she erin mused shes a thoroughbred my dee always has been paddy stuffed his handkerchief back in his pocket well id better get home and think up a way to smuggle that brood in here tonight let me know if you need any help that i will lass he kissed both her cheeks as he walked down the hall he jumped up and clicked his heels youve been on your feet long enough burke said tersely ill drive you home ive got my car leave it he took her arm again thats silly ill just leave it he repeated pulling her into the elevator fine she bit the word off since youre sure you can bear to be in the same car with me she crossed her arms and stared at the doors burke stuck his hands in his pockets and scowled neither of them spoke again until erin stormed into the atrium if its all the same to you im going upstairs and you you can take your foul mood out to the stables with the rest of the dumb animals he wondered that her neck didnt break from holding her head that high burke gave himself thirty seconds to calm down when it didnt work he strode up the stairs after her sit down he spit out the order as he slammed the bedroom door behind him erin simply narrowed her eyes and crossed her arms i said sit down and i say to hell with you that was all it took before she could evade him he had scooped her up and plunked her down on the bed all right now im sitting dont tell me you actually want to have a conversation with me she tossed her hair back then slowly crossed her legs im all aflutter she saw his hand close into a fist and angled her chin go ahead pop me one youve been wanting to for days dont tempt me it was quite clear last night i couldnt even do that she pulled her shoes off and tossed them aside if youre so fired up to talk to me then talk yeah i want to talk to you and i want some straight answers but instead of asking he shoved his hands back into his pockets and circled the room where to start he wondered his fingers brushed over the ring hed carried for days perhaps that was the best place burke pulled it out and held it in the palm of his hand you found it erins first burst of pleasure was almost blanked out by the look in his eyes you didnt tell me you didnt ask no i didnt because i was sick about it dropping it in the stables was stupid why did you because i couldnt think of anything else i knew i couldnt get away from them they were already tying my hands she was looking at her ring and didnt see him wince i guess i thought someone would find it and take it to you and youd know though i dont know what i expected you could do about it why havent you given it back to me because i wanted to give you time to decide if you wanted it or not he took her hand and dropped the ring in it its your choice always was she said slowly but she didnt put the ring on youre still angry with me because of what happened i was never angry with you because of what happened youve been giving a champion imitation of it then it was my fault he turned to her then and for the first time began to let go of the rage twenty hours you lay in the dark for twenty hours because of me the words could still bring on a cold flash but she was more intrigued by burkes reaction i thought it was because of durnam youve never seemed willing to talk it through to let me explain to you exactly what happened if youd you could have died there was really nothing else but that no explanations no calm recounting could change that one fact i sat in that damn hotel room waiting for the phone to ring terrified that it would and there was nothing nothing i could do when i found you saw what theyd done to you your wrists theyre healing she stood to reach out to him but he withdrew immediately why do you do this why do you keep pulling away from me even at the hospital you werent there you couldnt even stay with me i went to kill durnam oh burke no i was too late for that the bitterness was still there simmering with a foul taste hed almost grown used to they had him by then where i couldnt get to him all i could do was stand in that hospital room and watch you and think of how close id come to losing you the longer i stood there the more i thought about the way id dragged you in with me right from the beginning never giving you a choice never letting you know what kind of man you were tied to thats enough do you really believe im some weakminded female who cant say yes or no i had a choice and i chose you and not for your bloody money it was her turn to rage around the room im sick to death of having to find ways to prove that i love you ill not be denying that i wanted more out of life than a few acres of dirt and someone elses dishes to wash and im not ashamed of it but hear this burke logan id have found a way to get it for myself i never doubted it you think i married you for this house she threw up her arms as if to encompass every room well set a match to it then it doesnt matter to me you think its for all those fine stocks and bonds take them all take every last scrap of paper and put it on one spin of the wheel whether you win or lose makes no difference to me and these she pulled open her dresser and yanked out boxes of jewelry these pretty shiny things well take them to hell with you i love you god himself knows why you thickheaded miserable excuse for a man not know what kind of man i married is it she tossed the jewelry aside and stormed around the room i know well enough who and what you are more fool i am for not giving a damn and loving you anyway you dont know anything he said quietly but if youd sit down ill tell you you wont tell me anything i dont know do you think i care you grew up poor without a father oh you dont need to look that way rosa told me weeks ago do you think i care if you lied or cheated or stole i know what it is to be poor to need but i had my family cant i feel sorry for the boy without thinking less of the man i dont know she rocked him but then it seemed she never failed to do so sit down erin please im sick to death of sitting just like im sick to death of walking on eggs with you i did nearly die i thought i was going to die and all i could think was how much time wed wasted being at odds i swore if we were back together thered be no more fighting now for days ive held my temper ive said nothing when you turn away from me but no more if youve any more questions burke logan youd best out with them because ive plenty more to say myself why didnt you tell me you were pregnant that stopped her cold her mouth fell open and for all her talk about not sitting she lowered herself onto the bed how do you know burke drew out the paper hed found and handed it to her youve known for a month aye didnt you intend to tell me or were you just going to take care of it yourself i meant to tell you but what do you mean take care of it myself i could hardly keep it a secret when she stopped again as the realization hit like a wall thats what you thought id gone to the hospital for today you thought id gone there to see that there would be no baby she let the paper slip to the floor as she rose again you are a bastard burke logan that you could think that of me what the hell was i supposed to think youve had a month to tell me id have told you the day i found out i came to tell you i could hardly wait to get the words out but you started in on me about the money and the letter from my father it always came down to the money i put my heart on a platter for you time after time and you keep handing it back to me no more of that either she was ashamed of the tears but more ashamed to wipe them away ill go back to ireland and have the baby there then neither of us will be in your way before she could storm out of the room he asked you want the baby damn you for a fool of course i want the baby its our baby we made it our first night together in this bed i loved you then with my whole heart with everything i had but i dont now i detest you i hate you for letting me love you this way and never giving it back to me never once taking me in your arms and telling me you loved me erin no dont you dare touch me now not now that ive made as big a fool of myself as any woman could shed thrown up both hands to ward him off she couldnt bear to have his pity i was afraid you wouldnt want the baby and me with it when you found out that wasnt part of the bargain was it you wouldnt be so free and easy to come and go if there was a baby to think of he remembered the day shed come to tell him about the baby and the look in her eyes just as he remembered the look in her eyes when shed left without telling him he chose his words carefully now knowing hed already made enough mistakes six months ago youd have been right maybe even six weeks ago but not now its time we stopped moving in circles irish and do what its not easy for me to say what i feel its not easy for me to feel it he approached her cautiously and when she didnt back away he rested his hands on her shoulders i want you and i want the baby she closed her fingers tightly over the ring she still had in her hand why i didnt think i wanted a family i swore when i was a kid that id never let anyone hurt me the way my mother had been hurt id never let anyone mean so much that the life went out of me when they left then i went to ireland and i met you id still be there if you hadnt come back with me you asked me to come here to keep your books it was as good an excuse as any for both of us i didnt want to care about you i didnt want to need to see you just to get through the day but thats the way it was i pulled you into marriage so fast because i didnt want to give you a chance to look around and find someone better seems to me id had chance enough youd never even been with a man before do you think i married you because you had a talent in bed he had to laugh at that how would you know i doubt a woman has to bounce around between lovers to know when shes found the right one sex is as sorry an excuse to marry someone as money maybe weve both been fools me for thinking you married me for the first and you for thinking i married you for the second ive told you why i married you burke dont you think its time you told me i was afraid youd get away she sighed and tried to make herself accept that all right then thatll do she held her wedding ring out to him this belongs on my finger you should remember which one he took it and her hand the choice had been given to her and to him it wasnt every day a man was given a second chance i love you erin he saw her eyes fill and cursed himself for holding that away from both of them for so long say it again she demanded until you get used to it the ring slipped easily onto her finger i love you erin and i always will when he gathered her into his arms he felt all the gears of his life click into place you mean everything to me everything their lips met and clung it was just as sweet just as powerful as the first time were going to put
