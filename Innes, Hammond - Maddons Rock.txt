hammond innes maddons rock chapter one we sailed from murmansk the story of the trikkala is a strange one she was a greek ship taken over by britain in and operated by the kelt steamship company on behalf of the ministry of war transport until th march at hours on that march morning her career officially ended a single paragraph in a trade paper records her end the ss trikkala a freighter of tons was mined and sunk on th march with the loss of twentythree lives she was in convoy and her position at the time of the sinking was approximately miles northwest of tromso yet on the th of may just over a year later the naval w t station loch ewe near oban picked up an sos from a vessel describing herself as the trikkala shortly afterwards this vessel radioed information that left no doubt as to her identity it was the trikkala in view of the importance of her cargo an admiralty tug was sent out to bring her in and for two days there was hardly a person in the country who was not speculating on the mystery of her dramatic reappearance suppose i know more about the trikkalas story than anyone still living except perhaps bert cook who was with me i was one of the survivors of the sinking in march and it was i who sent out the sos from the trikkala in may accordingly i have set out here the full story as i saw it beginning from the night before she sailed from murmansk it was the nd of march bert and i were awaiting repatriation to england murmansk was bitterly cold the wind ran shrieking through the great wooden shed of a warehouse in which we were billeted it tore the cardboard packing from the broken window panes it ripped in under the eaves and up through the cracks between the floorboards and with it came a powdery drift of snow that sifted along the floor like sand across a desert the vast storage floor of the shed was packed with red army men vague dosshouse shapes huddled in blankets that were whitened with snow there were eight of us awaiting repatriation and we had been allocated a room to ourselves that had once been an office it had a calendar and a brazier that was all the furniture most of us were huddled around the brazier for warmth that night twentytwo days were marked off on the calendar we had been waiting for a ship all that time i remember thinking how in england the blackthorn would be out and there would be a smell of spring in the air but in murmansk the trees were black and the world was still in the grip of winter there was ice everywhere and a heavy blanket of snow muffled all sound so that even the great red army supply wagons with their ironshod wheels moved through the streets without a sound murmansk will always be to me a memory of intense cold of mens faces ruddy in the glow of a brazier and of the neverceasing noise of the wind above the clatter and whistle of the trains and the singing of the russian soldiers an extra heavy gust of wind beat against the windows one of the cardboard panes blew out and an icy blast shivered through the room cor stone the crows bert cook muttered ark at that awful wind as if life aint miserable enough but it as ter blow a blizzard an its me berfday tomorrer nice berfday im goin ter ave i dont fink he looked round the bare wooden room cluttered with kit and then leaned closer to the brazier he had a little monkeylike face it was creased by laughter and the lined almost leathery skin was reddened by the glow of the hot coals he had had all his teeth out just before leaving england and his cheeks had fallen in around the empty gums like the cheeks of an old crone sppose the ruskies aint got no glass poor devils he went on but they might board the winders up cardboard aint no good in this sort of wevver he got up then and fitted the bit of cardboard back into the window he leaned a rifle against it to keep it in place then he came back to the fire reminds me of the free fevvers dan st pancras way this place does always was a draughty pub he grinned at the others and spread his dirtstained hands to the blaze i liked bert he was the sort of man that makes four years in the ranks seem worth while nothing ever really got him down he was a cockney his home was in islington but islington or murmansk it didnt worry him id met up with him at a russian ordnance depot near leningrad i had been sent over to assist in the maintenance of certain predictors and bert was there with a gunnery team demonstrating the drill for a new gun britain had recently sent to russia bert was gazing round the group of faces huddled close to the brazier help what a country he muttered no wonder jerry couldnt stick it his face brightened to a grin i got arf a bottle of vodka in me kitbag i was savin it fer termorrer but well knock it back when were in the ol scratcher thatll help liven up the cockles and he rubbed his hands over the blaze then his face clouded but when i fink of the ol woman all alone wiv the kids in islington he added it fair makes me blood boil a munfs disembarkation leave we got waitin fer us when we land an were stuck in this dump look at that calendar free whole weeks we bin hincarcerated in this warease the job finished guns all ready ter bang away at berlin an a nice word o praise from a rusky colonel an wot do we get free weeks in this ell ole dartmoor aint got nuffink on this place got any fags left corp i opened my case gawd he said only four left an roosian at that better save em ter smoke wiv the firewater wheres mister bloomin warrant officer ternight warrant officer rankin was the senior occupant of the room he was large and fat with a smooth face and a soft voice blue eyes peered at you over little pouches of white flesh and his hands which pawed eagerly at the shoulder of any subordinate who was sufficiently servile were podgy and neatly manicured when angry his soft voice became highpitched he stood very much on the dignity of his rank and one felt that without that advantage of rank his voice might easily deteriorate into a whine he had been sent over to do a technical job for the navy and was temporarily in charge of some naval stores the same place as he was last night i told bert in answer to his question and the night before and every night since weve been here he gave an evil cackle displaying his toothless gums calls it learnin roosian thats a joke that is when es in china e learns chinese an when es in sigypore he learns whatever the native lingo is there i bet its the same words e learns everywhere e goes the faces round the brazier cracked with laughter they all hated rankins guts wheres e get the dough from anyway bert demanded oh i said hes in some racket or other started with watches you know how crazy the russians are for anything that ticks he managed to smuggle some out with him told me so the other night and then hes in charge of stores thats always a help to a man like rankin and hes chummed up with that little political commissar who speaks english dyer mean the freshfaced boy wots spposed ter keep tabs on the local commandant bert scowled into the fire i seen im yesterday struttin alongside of is boss fit ter burst a ligyment smart as a new pin e looked a sly little chit if you ask me ever bin in that place dan on molotov street corp noi told him wish i ad as much dough as rankins got he went on i was only halflistening i sppose ell be drunk again ternight when e comes back chuckin is weight abat as usual gettin poor little sills ter make is bed fer im es a fair swine and at that moment we heard rankins voice in the corridor outside it was angry and slurred why the hell cant we go aboard in the morning we heard him ask and another voice replied special duty ltcommander selby insisted that youd got to be there by hours thats why i had to rout you out then the door opened and rankin stood there with a piece of paper in his hand he wasnt drunk but there were two hectic spots in the smooth white of his cheeks and his eyes were bright with him was a naval writer from noics office that was the office of the naval officer in charge murmansk rankin leaned his bulk against the doorpost pushed his cap on to the back of his head and said who wants to go home he had a sadistic little smile on his lips as he watched our faces he knew that we were all fed to the teeth with murmansk he watched the rustle of expectation that ran through the faces round the brazier thinks es rafflin tickets for a passage ome in the queen mary muttered bert and the others grinned rankin heard the remark but the smile didnt leave his face i see you and i are going to get on well together cook then he turned to the clerk whats the time he asked seventhirty was the reply if i have em paraded at eightthirty and get down to the quay about nine that all right as long as youre on board before ten mr rankin was the reply good then he turned to me corporal vardy yes i said youll parade with the others detailed on this list at eightthirty sharp outside and see that its a smart turnout sills get my kit packed and ready with that he handed me the paper and went out an eager crowd of faces peered at it over my shoulder we read it by the light of the brazier the following personnel awaiting repatriation will embark on the ss trikkala no berth lenin quay not later than hours nd march warrant officer l r rankin corporal j l vardy private p sills gunner h b cook dress for army personnel f s m o kitbags will be carried warrant officer rankin will be in charge of the party throughout the voyage he will report to captain halsey master of the trikkala on arrival on board he will hold himself and his party at captain halseys disposal for special duties during the voyage we drank berts vodka then and there and two hours later were trudging through the snowcarpeted streets towards the river and the lights of the dock the trikkala was not a beautiful ship she hadnt even the utility lines of the american liberty boat berthed astern of her she was like an angular old spinster with her single tall funnel high bridge and clutter of deckhousings she had a threeinch gun perched on her high bows and another aft boats hung in their davits either side of the bridge and there was a third at the stern rafts clung precariously to their fittings above the after deckhousing but we werent worrying about her looks as we climbed the gangway wed have cheerfully embarked in a north sea trawler if it had been going to england the trikkala was loading as we went aboard her holds were open and into them was being poured load after load of ironore she had her derricks working and the clatter of the donkey engines and the roar of the ore pouring into the ship was deafening fore and aft the holds smoked like volcanoes as the ore dust billowed up into the dazzle of the loading lights the thick mantle of snow that covered her decks was no longer white but a dirty reddish brown halt your men there corporal rankin ordered ill go and see the captain we halted at the top of the gangway and stood waiting whilst the bitter wind blew choking clouds of ore dust in our faces had we known then what fate had in store for us no military order ever devised would have sent us across that gangway on to the deck of the trikkala but we didnt know we just stood there numbed and cold watching without curiosity as rankin climbed the ladder to the bridge where captain halsey paced to and fro we knew nothing then of the nature of the man or of the thoughts that were racing through his mind as he walked the bridge of his ship captain halseys dead now but he still haunts me in my dreams a little violent man with a black beard and black hair and black little button eyes to match eyes that were wild and greedy and cruel a madman full of dramatic gestures and long shakespearean speeches that he plucked from his memory to suit his mood a madman but there was method in his madness my god yes there was method in it the devil himself in a peaked cap and a blue serge uniform with little gilt buttons couldnt have plotted the damnation of a platoon of human souls with an easier conscience than halsey planned the coldblooded murder of a like number of human beings and whilst we stood on that frozen deck the rock was waiting for us out there in the barents sea maddons rock i shall never forget that place miltons blind eyes had never seen the desolation of those seas when he described his hell torrent fire dire hail perpetual storms and parching air yes but out there lit through the eternal night by the cold groping fingers of the northern lights is my idea of hell a restless tumult of waves tumbling in thunderous cascades across the reefs climbing the cliffs of the rock and pouring green along its flanks and the rock itself living rock as much a part of our earth as a green hill or a moss grown bank but here an island thrust up out of the wrack of ocean grey bleak sheened with ice and polished by the waters so that it is as smooth as the skull of a dead man but we knew nothing of all this as we waited for rankin on the trikkalas frozen deck in five minutes he was back with the first mate a dour lanky scot named hendrik with restless eyes and a scar that ran from the tip of his left ear to the point of his jaw come along corporal rankin said and ill show you your quarters i followed them to the afterdeckhousing just aft of the engineroom hatches on the port side was a wide steel door the mate threw off the clips and slid it back then he switched on the lights to reveal a bare room about twenty feet by ten there were no portholes and no fittings of any sort the walls and roof were of steel and steel deck plates formed the floor it smelt of stale grease there ye are mr rankin said the mate theyll live here wi the cargo rankin turned to me get your men settled in corporal he said a special cargo will be coming on board tonight it will be stowed here you and your men will act as guard then to the mate any idea what this cargo is mr hendrik the mates eyes flicked to rankins face and he said no but it was said a little too emphatically rankin looked at the empty space of the room cant be a very big cargo if its to go in here he murmured what was the place used for mr hendrik messroom for the afterdeck hendrik replied we shifted em oot this morning queer having a messroom right on deck said rankin aye but it wasna designed for a messroom the trikkalas clydeside built to greek specifications i fancy the greeks used this as a handy place for stowing passengers baggage and odd bits of cargo that couldna be stowed away in the hold of her rankin seemed to have lost interest he turned to me and said get your men settled in now corporal mr hendrik here will have blankets and hammocks sent up ill let you have your guard orders as soon as the cargo arrives as i turned i heard him say to the mate the captain mentioned that there was a spare cabin i could use ayehendrik replied well chum wots the griff bert asked as i returned to the two figures standing forlornly by the gangway youll see i said and took them aft to our new quarters even sills a little uncomplaining north countryman said its goin ter be beastly cold laike oop ere bert looked at me and said wots the idea corp i was speakin ter one of the seamen an e said there was bunks to spare dan in the focstle i sppose because were in the darned army they fink well be appy ter kip dan in a perishin spot like this i said were here because theres some sort of a special cargo coming on board and were detailed for guard duties throughout the voyage guard dooties bert flung his kit into one corner they would fink up somefink like that why cant we be repatriated peacefullike same as if we was decent citizens wheres that mr rankin dont see his kit around sppose ell be feedin wiv the officers dan in a nice cosy messroom while were freezin ter death up ere i can just ear mm saying to the capting him a warrant officer of the royal navy him not accustomed ter feedin wiv the men he slipped his pack on to the floor and his tin hat clattered on the steel deckplating nice trip this is goin ter be didnt you raise a squeal for better quarters corp couldnt very well i said you saw the movement order detailed for special duties during the voyage gawd he said and sat himself down morosely on his kitbag half an hour later as i stood on deck watching the loading of the ship four russian lorries came lumbering along the dockside and stopped opposite the trikkala they were open trucks and they were loaded with big square packing cases there were three red army guards on each truck a british naval officer came on board and went up to the bridge shortly afterwards one of the derricks was swung out towards the leading truck and the work of swinging the packing cases on board began it was our special cargo the cases were marked hurricane engines for replacement first time i ever heard of a special guard being placed on dud aero engines bert grumbled id never seen him in this sort of mood before he was usually so cheerful when all were stowed safely the naval officer with rankin and the skipper of the trikkala and a russian official of some sort came in and counted the cases then a sheaf of papers was produced and everybody signed when that was done the naval officer turned to the trikkalas skipper and said well its your responsibility now captain halsey then to rankin see that you keep a strict guard mr rankin then they went out all but rankin who called me over and handed me a typewritten sheet those are your guard orders corporal he said two hours on four hours off night and day guard on duty will be properly dressed and armed hell stand or march up and down outside this door he leaned closer to me and his breath reeked of drink as he added and if i find any slackness the guard not on duty or not dressed correctly youll be in trouble corporal and so will the man on duty bert stood up and came towards us two on an four off he said aint yer goin ter do guard dooty wiv us then mr rankin for a moment rankin appeared too surprised to speak he gave a little intake of breath and then said stiffly and with suave menace a warrant officer of the royal navy cook doesnt do guard duties so we as ter do it for you eh that aint fair yer know were all in the same boat in a manner o speakin if we ad a sergeant wiv us nah instead of a ruddy warrant officer hed muck in like any decent bloke would rankin literally shook with anger a warrant officer is not a sergeant he said and his voice was pitched a shade higher than usual any more lip from you cook and ill have you up before the captain bert gave a toothless grin an do me guard dooty for me whilst im in irons i dont fink im not as simple as that replied rankin smoothly youre expecting some leave when you get in arent you gosh i should ope so bert answered four munfs in roosia aint i earned it rankins voice suddenly sharpened whether youve earned it or not my lad you just watch your step all of you he added his eyes glancing quickly from one to the other of us or you wont get any leave then he turned to me with a little sneering smile i hear youre going for a commission corporal and when i didnt say anything he said well are you or arent you yes i said good he smiled and turned to go at the door he stopped you see this guard runs smoothly then corporal or ill give you a report thatll send you running back to your unit with your tail between your legs now get your sentry posted when he had gone bert turned to me why dont yer stand up to im he said its you wots got the stripes not me and when i said nothing he turned away with a look of disgust and i heard him mutter to sills going for a commission fine feeble awfficer hell make i posted him as sentry and then went forard for a stroll round the ship loading appeared to have ceased the derricks were still and the holds were just dark craters in the ships decks the arc lights for our berth had been switched off the liberty boat behind us was still loading the clatter of her donkeyengines split the night like pneumatic drills and across the river the arc lights blazed above the wharfs and the temporary wooden sheds where roofs were weighed down with snow the sound of loading came loud and clear through the frozen night but the trikkala seemed to have settled to sleep in her little pool of shadow only the deck lights swung their dim yellow globes in the wind casting dark moving shadows across the deck on the bridge the muffled figures of the watch paced to and fro the wind was from the east it came roaring over the huddle of dockside sheds and made strange noises in the trikkalas superstructure it was bitterly cold and already the snow had a crisp crust of ice that crunched beneath my feet i got to windward of the bridge on the starboard side and leaned my back against the sheltering ironwork the noise of the docks was now no more than a distant clatter there were no arc lights to dazzle the night i had a clear view down the black waters of the tuloma river to kola bay distant buoy lights danced with their reflections like willothewisps down the estuary far far to the north the horizon showed as a black line against the cold changing colours of the northern lights i lit a cigarette i felt depressed i cursed rankin for letting slip that i was going for a commission and i was angry with betty for forcing my hand instead of a months disembarkation leave i was due to report immediately to deepcut for preoctu training besides i wasnt cut out for an army officers job the navy yes ive been sailing very nearly since i could walk at sea ive plenty of confidence but the navy had turned me down on eyesight and in the army id always felt like a fish out of water a light suddenly shone out from a porthole just to the left of where i was standing the porthole was open a voice said come in mr hendrik come in it was a soft gentle voice with a strangely vibrant quality a door closed and there was the sound of a cork being drawn out of a bottle now what about this guard hendriks voice answered well its nae more than we expected a guard no but we expected soldiers not a naval warrant officer that might make it awkward know anything about this fellow rankin mr hendrik aye i met him in weel i met him the other nicht i ve an idea that if theres any deefficulty wi him he could be made to see reason hes no short o cash if ye like ill away and see kalinsky in the mornin itd be kalinsky hed be dealing wi they all do as for the corporal and the other two soldiers well no have any trouble and that was all i heard of the conversation for the porthole suddenly closed and the little circle of light was blotted out as it was battened down from inside i stood there for a moment watching the glowing tip of my cigarette and trying to make sense out of the fragment of conversation i had heard hendrik had been speaking to the captain i realised that but just what the significance of it was i could not determine puzzled i walked slowly back to our quarters bert was pacing up and down outside the door he had his rifle slung on his shoulder and he swung his arms to keep himself warm his face looked pinched and cold in the light that swung above the engineroom hatches any luck corp he asked as i came up about whati asked why the blankets and ammocks thort that was wot youd gawn off ter see abat havent they been sent up i asked not a sign of em he replied ill go down and see rankin about them i said good an when yer see mm corp give im my love and tell im id like ter ring is stupid neck i can just see mm sticking it fer two long hours at in this beastly wind ask mm why we cant do our guard dooties inside all right bert i said there was a companionway in the afterdeckhousing i went down this and found myself in a long corridor it was warm and smelt of engine oil and stale food grease the only sound in that empty steellined corridor was the steady hum of the dynamos i hesitated and at that moment a door opened and a man in gumboots went aft the sound of mens voices drifted through the lighted doorway i went down the corridor knocked and entered it was the crews mess room three men were seated at one of the scrubbed deal tables they took no notice of me one of them a welshman was saying but i tell you man hes not sane this very morning it was up forard where the russians were fixing that plate the door of number two bulkhead was open and i in went through to see what was going on the captain was there with mr hendrik watching the russians they were and as soon as he sees me he says davies he says what are you doing here so i tells him i just stepped through to see what all the racket was about well get out man he says and then out damned spot out i say and with that he starts roaring with laughter goon davies he says back to your work man the other two men laughed and one of them said you dont want to worry about that mate hes always like that captain halsey is youre new to the ship but we bin with him four trips now aint we ernie shakespeare shakespeare shakespeare hell stand on the bridge and spout sheakespeare by the hour and when you pass his cabin youll often hear im ranting and raving inside aint that so ernie the man referred to as ernie nodded and took his pipe out of his mouth aye thats right he said an when you take a message to him up on the bridge you never know whether its the ghost of banquo or one of king richards bastards youre talking to gave me the willies at first but i got used to it now and theres some fine speeches he makes too youll find half the crewve got pocket editions of shakespeare in their ditty boxes just for the fun of imitatin the old man he looked up then and saw me standing in the doorway hullo chum he said what do you want can you tell me which is mr rankins cabin i asked the navy feller eh reckn hes got the one next door to mr cousins here ill show you he got to his feet and led me along the corridor but when we found rankins cabin it was empty does he drink the man called ernie asked me in a whisper i nodded oh well then hell be in the chiefs cabin he knocked at the door of a cabin farther forard and a slurred voice mumbled come in he opened the door and peered in okay chum there you are he said i thanked him and went in the chief engineer was lying on his bunk bloodshot little eyes peered at me above florid cheeks the naked electric light bulb beat down upon his bald head bottles of beer lay about the floor and on a chest of drawers stood two opened bottles of whisky the room was thick with smoke and the stale smell of drink rankin sat on the foot of the chiefs bunk he was in his shirt sleeves and his collar was undone they were playing cribbage the cards were laid out on the blankets of the bed wot dyou want asked rankin weve no blankets and no hammocks i said he gave a sneering laugh and turned to the chief did you hear him chief he said no blankets and no hammocks he belched and scratched his head youre a corporal aint you going to be an officer wheres your initiative man go and find the ships storeman hes the man to give you blankets and hammocks not me and then as i did not move he said well what are you waiting for theres another thing i said but i stopped then his little pale blue eyes like baby oysters swimming in their own mucus were watching me closely he knew what i was going to say he knew that it was unnecessary for the guard to be outside and he was waiting for me to say it so that he could sneer at my ability to carry out orders this was the sort of man for whom the protection of rank meant the pleasures of despotism it doesnt matter i said and closed the door it was the sailors in the crews messroom who produced blankets and hammocks for me bert met me at the top of the companionway and relieved me of some of my burden did yer see rankin he asked yesi said any chance of us doing the guards inside no his little monkey face peered up at me from his balaclava yer did ast im didnt yer no i said he was drunk and he was just waiting for the opportunity to get at me it wasnt any use bert slid the door of the storage room back with his shoulder and flung the handful of blankets he had taken from me on to the floor between the packing cases blimey he said if you was a rooky yer couldnt be more spineless and he turned away to continue his guard i hesitated but i only said ill relieve you at one then i went inside and slid the door to sills and i slung the hammocks between the packing cases it was past midnight before wed got them fixed i climbed into mine and tried to get some sleep before i went out to do my turn but i couldnt sleep i felt angry with myself and depressed about the present and the future even the thought of being back in england didnt cheer me but for the fact that it would be the end of things between betty and myself i knew i should have thrown up the idea of going for a commission when i went out to relieve bert an hour later loading seemed to have stopped throughout the docks the arc lights had all been switched off and a peace had descended on the place the snowcovered roofs of the dock sheds glimmered faintly in the light from the deck lights beyond lay a vague huddle of ships and sheds the northern lights lay right across the northern sky pulsing coldly in their light the snow muffled town looked chill as ice winds droppin a bit bert said i offered him a cigarette there were only two left he looked up at me quickly and then took one we lit up and stood leaning against the rail for a while without speaking suddenly bert said sorry i lost me temper this evenin corp must abin the wevver i felt fair braned off i did its all right berti said we stood there in silence for a time and then he said good night and left me alone to the cold and my thoughts it was seven oclock when i came out on deck for my second spell of duty and in the dull morning light there was an air of bustle about the ship the hatches were being battened down over the holds fore and aft and billows of black smoke pouring out of the funnel showed that we were getting up steam as the light strengthened the port seemed to come to life tugs hurried back and forth across the river hooting and occasionally the deep note of a ships siren sounded a destroyer lay farther down the estuary a dirty white ensign just visible in the drifting smoke of her funnels shortly after sills relieved me two corvettes slipped down to join her and the three steamed slowly out of sight round a bend think well sail this morning corp sills asked there was a strange longing in his voice he was not more than twenty probably this was the first time hed been out of england looks as though theres a convoy forming i said theres two boats over there being towed out from their moorings ten minutes later the liberty boat in the next berth to us slipped her moorings and with much hooting was hauled out into the open river by a diminutive tug that fussed around churning the cold slate surface of the water to a muddy brown i took a stroll round the ship there was no doubt about it we were getting ready to sail and i began to feel that sense of excitement that is inevitable with the thought of putting to sea as i came abreast of the gangway i saw the figure of the first mate hurrying across the quayside he walked quickly up the gangway and disappeared below the bridge in the direction of the captains cabin i was reminded then of the conversation i had overheard the previous night i leaned against the rail staring down unseeingly at the bustle of the docks trying to figure out what had been meant when rankins voice interrupted my thoughts get your bedding all right corporal vardy he asked i turned his face looked grey above the blueclothed bulk of his body and the little oyster eyes were bloodshot yes i said i got them all right and then without stopping to think i said does the name kalinsky mean anything to you mr rankin he took a little breath and his eyes narrowed you trying to be funny corporal he asked endeavouring to cover that momentary shock no i said i just happened to hear two people mention your name in connection with kalinsky who were they he asked i turned to go but he caught me by the shoulder and spun me round who were they he hissed angrily the bloodshot little eyes were staring at me over their pouches of flesh and there was a flicker of something i couldnt make out for a moment and then i realised that he was frightened who were they he repeated the captain and the first mate i said he let me go then and i left him standing slightly dazed at the top of the gangway it was warmer now and the heat of the boilers was melting the snow round the engineroom hatches several ships had moved out into the harbour and there was an air of expectancy over the ship and the port that it was impossible to ignore i went below for a shave the crews washrooms were primitive but there was plenty of hot water the cook was standing in the open doorway of the galley a fat greasy man with a wart on his lower lip and little twinkling brown eyes he produced a tin mug full of steaming cocoa for me with the conspiratorial air of an amateur producing a rabbit out of a hat i stood chatting with him as i drank gratefully sweating in the warmth of his roaring galley fires hed been in almost every port on the globe this was his fourth visit to murmansk ever heard of a man called kalinsky in murmansk i asked on molotov street wot used to be st peters street he asked maybe i said what sort of a bloke is he well he aint a slav and he aint a jew and he aint a turk neither nor a greek he said but i guess hes a mixture of every race that ever set up shop to barter the pants off of an honest seaman hes wot wed call in england a fence why you aint in trouble with him are you no i said ive got nothing to barter except my rifle his round little tummy heaved with laughter kalinsky aint above buying rifles he said hes doing a good trade just at the moment in rifles and sabres with the yanks as souvenirs of russia swears theyre cossack but they range from lee enfields to italian carabinieri carbines the whole thing fell into place now rankin had been in charge of some naval stores and kalinsky was a receiver no wonder rankin had had plenty of money but what puzzled me was why the captain and his first mate wanted a hold over rankin it was past eleven when i went up on deck again and bert was on duty any signs of our pushing off i asked him not a sign the gangway was still down but the captain was up on the bridge pacing to and fro his black pointed beard darting aggressively about him as he surveyed his ship the quayside was practically empty a solitary girl walked through the churnedup snow she was dressed in a khaki greatcoat a black beret was pulled over her dark curls and she carried a kitbag she was looking up at the name of the ship her face white in the dull light then she made for the gangway and began to struggle up it trailing the kitbag behind her blimey theres a girl comin on board bert said catching hold of my sleeve dont look all that strong neither why dont yer go an give her a and wiv er kit then as i didnt say anything he pushed his rifle into my hand ere ang on to that mate an pretend yer on guard if you aint goin ter be a little gentleman i sppose ill ave ter show yer that its a board school edication wots the best its incredible to think that i let bert go and help her up the gangway instead of going myself was it because i was too busy gazing at that white strained face it was a sad face and yet it looked as though it should have been gay i wondered about her nationality and why she was coming aboard a ship bound for england some stray emerging from warshattered europe a pole perhaps or a czech or possibly a frenchwoman i watched bert shoulder her kitbag saw the sudden flash of a smile on that wan face and then a voice at my elbow said have ye seen warrant officer rankin corporal it was hendrik not for the last hour i told him why the old man wants him if ye see him tell him to be gude enough to step up to the bridge he went forard and i stood there looking down at the empty quayside the ice in the snow ruts ruled black lines beside the sheds a tug hooted close by and a voice from the bridge hendriks voice called through a megaphone stand by to catch that line jukes bert suddenly materialised from the companionway his leathery little face puckered in a grin well i said as he took his rifle what was she like as nice a kid as i met in me natural he replied an believe it or not mate shes english name of jennifer sorrel seen it on the label of er kitbag gawd knows wot shes doin in this dump didnt ast er but she looks as though shes ad a pretty thin time of it face as white as the snow on that roof over there and the skin sort of transparentlike and dark rings under the eyes but a lady i could tell that he began

to his question the trikkalas siren blared forth a feather of white steam blew at the funnel head the tug gave a single answering hoot captain halsey appeared on the bridge a megaphone in his hand let go forard he called the second officer mr cousins waved his arm from the bows a russian on the quayside lifted the heavy loop of the line from its bollard it splashed in the water as the bows began to swing away from the quay the gap between the ships side and the quay steadily widened the black refusescattered water lapped at the piers let go aft and as the line hit the water the engineroom telegraph rang twice the engines suddenly sprang to life under the hatches close beside us the ships shuddered the filth of the river bottom was churned to the surface then as we slipped our tow the trikkala under her own steam swung in a great arc across the river and made downstream round the bend and out into kola bay where the convoy was forming it was one oclock before all the ships of the convoy were gathered in the mouth of the estuary and at onefifteen we sailed when i came off duty at three the murman coast was just a dirty white smudge between the leaden grey of the sky and the restless grey of the sea according to the gossip of the ship we were bound for leith in the firth of forth and i reckoned that it would take us about five days i mentioned this to bert when i relieved him again at seven that evening he said christ have we got five days of this the wind was getting up and it was freezing cold out there on the blackedout deckid like ter know what the ells in them cases youd fink it was the bank of england we was guarding if its aero engines i reckn its a ruddy disgrace why should we ave ter stand abart ere catching our death for nuffink them cases aint goin ter get up an walk overboard i cant help it i said the orders are that a guard has to be mounted on them and thats all there is to it it aint your fault corp but it do seem ruddy silly dont it well sppose i may as well turn into the ol scratcher an git a bit o shuteye before i come on dooty again goo night corp goodnight i said he disappeared and i was left alone in the dark by leaning over the rail i could make out the white line of our wake and forard were the dimmed navigation lights of the ship ahead riding above the white path she carved through the sea an occasional burst of sparks trailed from our funnel the superstructure of the deck was a vague dark silhouette against luminous clouds behind which flickered the northern lights the steady throbbing of the engines and the sound of water swirling back from the trikkalas bows filled the night with sound i was alone there save for the officer of the watch on the bridge and my blood thrilled to the feel of the ship live under my feet as she trod the dark waters skirting the top of norway at ten to nine by my watch i slid back the door a fraction to call bert what the hell are you two up to i cried and stepped quickly inside pulling the door to for they had the lights on and there was only a piece of sacking for blackout bert and sills both had their bayonets in their hands and the fools were busy ripping the top off one of the packing cases we aint doin no arm corp bert said just avin a looksee to find at just wot it is we spend all day out there in the miserable cold guardin sorry mate we planned to ave everything put back nice and tidy like before you came orf guard but these cases is stronger than we expected well get to work right away hammering it down again i said if anyone sees theyve been tampered with therell be trouble ere nark it corp look we just abat got this one open put yer baynit in there sills he said pointing to a corner of the case they had been working on now up she comes with a squeak of nails being drawn out of wood they prised the lid up inside were smaller boxes packed tight together well whatever it is it aint aero engines like it saysontheatside bert said you fools i said for all you know this may be some sort of a secret weapona dangerous chemical anything how do you expect me to explain that case being opened orl right corp orl right bert said taking out one of the smaller boxes which measured about eighteen inches by nine keep yer shirt on well fix it so as nobody wont notice he got the box between his knees and i heard the top of it come open then bert whistled softly through his gums cor knock me for a row of little green apples he exclaimed take a look at this corp he thrust the box towards me silver thats wot it is mate tons and tons of it no wonder they put a guard on it it was silver all right four bars snug in their little wooden box winked brightly in the light of the naked electric light bulb gawd wot couldnt i do wiv one o them bert muttered id like ter see the of womans face when i dumped one of em on the kitchen table casual like as though it were a bar of soap he stopped then for there was the sound of boots on the deck outside look at someones comin he and sills whipped the box out of sight as the door swung back and rankin entered whys there no guard outside rankin asked his face was flushed with drink and his little eyes blinked in the glare of the light i just came in to call my relief i said you should train your men to relieve you automatically he said get to your post just because its dark i suppose you think you wont be seen sneaking in out of the wind fine officer youll make i came to tell you that if we have boatdrill our boat is number two on the port side then he saw the bayonet in berts hand what are you up to cook he asked i aint doin nuffink mr rankin honest berts expression was one of injured innocence whyve you got that bayonet in your hand rankin persisted i was just cleaning it cleaning it rankin sneered youve never cleaned anything in your life that you werent ordered to clean lets see what youve been up to he moved farther into the room and then he saw the opened packing case so youve been opening one of these cases have you when we dock cook youll find yourself ere alf a mo mr warrant officer bert interrupted him aint yer got no curiosity we wasnt doin no arm we was just curious thats all do you know wots in them boxes of course i do rankin replied now get that case done up again bert chuckled bet you fink its aero engines same as wot it says on the atside well ave a dekko at this and he kicked the box of silver bars across the floor rankins eyelids opened in surprise my god he said in an awed voice silver then he turned to bert and his voice was angry and a little scared you fool cook this is bullion see there was a seal on that box youve broken it my god therell be trouble over this as soon as we dock youll be under arrest so will you corporal he added turning to me and get back to your post i was moving to the door when berts voice stopped me nah look ere mister rankin he said i aint goin on no fizzer see soon as we dock im going on leave ter see the missis an kids if theres any fizzin ter to be done it wont be me wot fries what do you mean rankin asked i mean that its you wots in charge o this guard he said an its you wots responsible for the correct beaviour of your guard get me the best thing for all of us is ter pack this little treasure box up an no more said wot you say mr rankin rankin hesitated all right he said at length tack it up ill have to make a report to the captain and itll be up to him whether any action is taken or not you cant hide that broken seal and the treasury officials at the other end will want to know how it happened i went back to my post then and a few minutes later rankin came out that man cook needs watching corporal he said and disappeared into the dark hulk of the bridge structure chapter two the explosion the discovery that we were guarding a cargo of silver bullion made a profound impression on me but i cant say that i felt in any way uneasy as i paced along in the gloom of the deck listening to the throb of the engines i and the swish of the water swirling along the ships sides i had none of that sense of suspicion and doubt that developed later but i suspect that it was the sense of responsibility that sharpened my wits and then again i was at sea now i was in an element i understood all the frustration and acceptance of authority engendered by four years in the army was blown away with the deck alive under my feet and the sting of the salt spray in my face i felt more assured more confident than i had felt for four years as i stood there in the dark against the port rails with the icy east wind cutting my face the mechanical voice of a distant loudhailer blared at us across the water ahoy trikkala ahoy it called scorpion calling trikkala the bridge answered the voice muffled by a megaphone ahoy scorpion trikkala answering go ahead at first i could see nothing then the white of a bow wave showed in the darkness off our port quarter and as the loudhailer blared out again i made out the sleek shadow of a destroyer coming up alongside us gale warning trikkala said the loudhailer gale warning close american merchant close american merchant and keep closed okay scorpion the bridge answered the engineroom telegraph rang and the beat of the engine took up a faster rhythm the destroyers bow wave creamed to a white plume and the vague shadow of the warship sheered away from us and was swallowed in the darkness sills came out to relieve me we nailed oop cases corporal he said but we couldnt do aught about seals inside the guardroom i found bert sitting on one of the cases rolling a cigarette we had got an issue of tobacco out of the ships canteen for such a cocky little man he looked almost crestfallen sorry mate he said reckn i put me foot in it proper this time but i didnt see them seals anyway ow was i ter know we was sitting on the blessed bank of england itll sort itself out bert i said and i went below for a mug of cocoa the cook was seated in front of the red glow of his fire his hands clasped across his stomach and a pair of steelrimmed spectacles on the end of his nose a book lay open on a pile of choppedup meat on the table at his elbow and a tortoiseshell cat lay curled up in his lap he had been dozing he took off his glasses as i entered the galley and rubbed his eyes help yourself he said the dixie of cocoa stood in its usual place i dipped my mug into it my body absorbed gratefully the warmth of the galley and the thick liquid scalded my throat as i drank he began gently stroking the cat it woke blinked its green eyes and stretched then it began to purr the sound blending into the roar of the galley stove and the distant pulsing of the ships engines the cook tilted his chair back and fetched down a bottle of whisky from a shelf theres a couple of tooth glasses over there corporal he said he poured out two stiff tots and began to talk he had a deep rich voice and its mellow tones took me on a cooks tour of the world hed been twentytwo years at sea always cooking shifting from ship to ship as the fancy took him hed a wife in sydney and another in hull and claimed a nodding acquaintance with the population of practically every port in the seven seas half an hour of listening to him left me with the impression of a dirtyminded old rapscallion whod gone his own way through life and had got a lot of fun out of it when he paused for a time staring into the fire his thick fleshy fingers automatically stroking the back of the purring cat i said have you done many trips with captain halsey whats he like i was still thinking of rankins decision to report the opening of that case to the captain five trips ive done with him he replied still staring into the fire but i wouldnt say i know much about him i never seen him before i shipped on the trikkala in the only men on this ship who really know im are hendrik the first mate a seaman called jukes and a little welsh stoker by the name of evans they were all with him when he skippered the old penang in the china sea but they dont talk much an i dont blame em whyi asked well its only hearsay so dont you go opening yer trap saying i bin telling you things he turned his sharp little brown eyes on me but i heard things sove others who bin out in china ports mind you i aint saying theyre true but i never known port gossip that hadnt some truth in it well what was the gossip i asked as he fell to staring at the fire again oh its a long story he said but to put it briefly it was piracy and then he swung quickly round on me again look here me lad he said you keep your mouth shut see im a garrulous old fool to be telling you anything at all but i dont talk to me shipmates about it i aint aimin to start any trouble but youre different youre only a visitor so to speak he turned to the fire again then and after a moment he said it was in shanghai i first heard of captain halsey and i never thought then to be serving on a ship of which he was captain piracy did i say piracy and murder thats what i heard of him in shanghai have you ever heard him rantin and ravin no i dont reckon you bin on board long enough but you will you will ive heard he declaims long speeches from shakespeare i said is that what you mean thats it shakespeare its is bible hes at it all day long rantin and ravin up on the bridge down in his cabin flings quotations at his crew all mixed up with the orders so that a newcomer to the ship dont know whether hes coming or going but you listen to the passages he picks ive read shakespeare i take one around with me cos its a good fat meaty book to read when the companys dull an the voyage a long one well you just listen and youll find its always the bits about murders and wrong uns that he quotes and another thing he picks his passages to suit is moods now this morning he was hamlet you know what hamlet was a ditherer well when hes hamlet you dont need to worry and when hes in a merry mood hell quote falstaff at you but you watch your step when hes macbeth or falconbridge or one of those men of action like as not hell heave anything that comes handy at you a maniac thats wot he is a rantin ravin lunatic but a fine sailor and a man that knows how to run a ship never had any complaints about the grub since i joined this ship the men takes wot theyre given an no bolshie nonsense he leaned forward and raked at the fire they say he was an actor once and grew his beard to hide his identity i dont know about that but what i heard in shanghai was that he picked up the old penang in a typhoon off the marianas which were jap islands in the pacific he had a trading schooner in those days and finding the penang deserted went aboard and got the pumps working and sailed her hack to shanghai she wasnt insured and the owners couldnt pay salvage and by some wangle he got her for nothing that was how he started and accordin to the gossip it were about it was all in the papers im told but wot followed aint in the papers he patched her up and began sailing her for a firm of chinese merchants with as pretty a bunch of scallywags for crew as you could meet in them parts it was legitimate trade all right though i wont say there wasnt some smuggling on the side theres few doing coastal trade in the south china sea that dont indulge in a little smuggling but it werent smuggling wot got the old penang her reputation no it were the fact that she was too often in the neighbourhood of ships wot went down with all hands in a storm it were piracy that they began to talk about in the ports that strikes you as pretty incredible dont it but out there it aint the same as england to begin with the ships concerned hadnt got no wireless and then again theres lots of queer things happen out there and when the japs invaded china well there was plenty of scope for a man without scruples who was in with the right people at all events old blackbeard thats wot they called him sold the penang to the japs for a tidy sum around and retired to the philippines where hed bought himself a nice little property but there its all gossip aint a shadow of evidence an dont you tell nobody wot i been saying i certainly wont i said but why did you tell me he laughed and poured more whisky when you been at sea as long as i have me lad you come to be a bit of a gossip when a new shipmate comes aboard first thing i does if i likes the look of im is to ask im into the galley for a yarn not many ports left that i aint visited an its nice to hear news of them theres plenty of wot you might call characters knocking around up an down the ports and it sort of gives you an interest in life to hear about em the skippers particlarly they most of em get a bit queer one way and another its a lonely life a skippers and it takes em different ways with some its drink with others its religion and with capn halsey its shakespeare i bin on the trikkala now five voyages a total of twentysix months one of em was to tewfik by way of the cape see an all the time i bin bottlin this bit of gossip up inside o me till i were fair bustin to tell someone it was you mentioning kalinsky wot started me off now kalinskys the only man so far as i know that the penang ever rescued out of a dozen or more ships that went down in her vicinity and he set up business in canton and they say he was pretty thick with the crew of the penang but there as i say its all gossip but the way i look at it there aint no smoke haze round a mans name without theres a fire burning somewhere this cat now you wouldnt reckon there to be gossip about a cat would you but shes thought to be a lucky cat and the story goes that she saved a ship well ill tell you how that story got around i dont know to this day what the cooks name was he was drowned with the rest of them but talk he could talk for hours so long as hed got a drink and someone to listen but im afraid i was a disappointing audience forthe story about the cat my mind was puzzling over the conversation i had heard between the captain and his first mate and what the reference to kalinsky and rankin had meant i was still thinking about this when i went up on deck again i strolled forard filling my pipe as i went i passed the bridge skirted the donkeyengines and the hatch covers of number one hold and then stepping over the anchor chains went right up past the threeinch gun to the bows the wind had shifted to the norwest and was beginning to blow the clouds had thickened so that they were no longer luminous with the cold glare of the northern lights the night was thick with a snowhaze so that though we were close in the wake of the ship ahead the american merchant i could barely make her out the sea was getting up i could feel the pitch of the bows under my feet and each time they bit into a wave a cascade of spray whipped away on either side of her like a ghostly veil blown through the darkness of the night i bent down in the lee of the bulwarks to light my pipe as i struck the match a girls voice said oh you frightened me i shaded the match and saw the white oval of a girls face above a khaki greatcoat she was seated on a coil of rope her back to the iron plates of the bows the match flickered and died sorry i said i didnt know anyone was here i just dived down to light my pipe are you miss sorrel yes she said she had a soft pleasant voice with just the trace of an accent which was difficult to place its so dark i said i cant see you at all i shouldnt have seen you if you hadnt struck that match now youre just the glow of a pipe how did you know my name im the corporal of the guard they put on board i said one of my men helped you with your kit when you came on board oh that nice little cockney she laughed youve no idea how homely it was to hear his voice what are you guarding the suddenness of her question took me by surprise i hesitated then i said oh just some stores sorry she said i shouldnt have asked that should i we were silent then crouched there i could feel the dip and swoop of the bows the shudder of the plates as they took the shock of the next wave and the live throb of the engines it was bitterly cold even under the lee of the bulwarks you ought to be in your cabin on a night like this i said but she said no its so small i dont like being shut in but arent you cold i asked yes i suppose i am she answered but im used to the cold besides i like to hear the sea ive sailed all my life ive got my own boat at home my brother and i were always sailing her voice trailed off then he was killed at st nazaire she said im sorry i said i love sailing too again a short silence fell between us but i sensed that she wanted to talk so i asked her where her home was scotland she replied the western highlands near oban theres good sailing there i murmured and then as she had fallen silent again i said you mentioned that you were used to the cold does that mean youve been in russia a long time no she said in germany or rather poland i was staggered at her answer poland i exclaimed you mean you were a prisoner yes nearly three years it seemed incredible that this frail slip of a girl should have come alive out of poland to finish up at murmansk but how i asked i mean three years you couldnt have been there when war broke out no her voice was toneless flat they caught me in france i used to go over to contact people my mother was french you see i knew a lot of useful people it was my third trip that they caught me i was in rouen after a time they sent me to a concentration camp near warsaw she gave a little dry mirthless laugh that is why i dont feel the cold her voice changed to a lighter tone but dont lets talk about me i am so tired of myself she was speaking english very correctly as though she were not sure of the language tell me what you have been doing with yourself during the war and what youre going to do and all about yourself i felt embarrassed ive done nothing much i said i understand the mechanism of predictors thats about all they sent us over to russia to get some gunnery equipment of ours ready for action now im on my way back to england and when you reach england what will you do she sighed almost luxuriously oh isnt it lovely to be saying england and feel that with every beat of the ships engines were getting nearer england england isnt it a lovely sounding word there was a fierce longing in her voice that gave it a strange quality they used to talk about england in that camp she went on quietly all those people whose countries had been overrun they spoke of it the way an arab might speak of mecca her voice changed again as she leaned towards me and said and when you get to england youll have leave i suppose youll go off to your home and your wife will be waiting for you youve no idea what a wonderful thing it is to think of families still in existence not broken up but whole and real its something solid that i thought was lost for ever yes but im not married you know i said with a laugh well your family the things that make up a home people clustered about the fire at christmas she hesitated a faraway look in her eyes as she remembered the things she had missed for so long to go home its so wonderful just to be able to say to myself im going home as she turned away to hide her tears i heard sills voice calling my name what is it i called back he came forward then mr rankin wants you corporal youre to see the captain right away i felt suddenly like i did as a small boy when called to the headmasters study it sounded like trouble im afraid ill have to go i said to my invisible companion will you be here when i come back no she said i think its getting too cold and then without thinking i found myself saying meet me on the deck sometime tomorrow will you all right she said good night good night i said and went aft with sills my mind strangely disturbed at the thought of meeting the man the old cook had gossiped about rankin was waiting for me in the guardroom he was seated on one of the cases of bullion his white fingers methodically breaking a match into a geometric pattern he started up as i entered his face looked puffy in the hard electric light he was undoubtedly nervous but i got the impression that he was frightened too we went forard to the officers quarters rankin left me in the passage and went into the messroom i heard him say ive got the corporal with me and then hendriks voice replied gude captn halseys waitin for ye there was the sound of a chair being pushed back and then rankin came out followed by the mate we cut across by the wash place to the starboard side and stopped outside the captains door a voice was speaking inside the cabin faintly through the door i caught hamlets words and my two schoolfellows whom i will trust as i will adders fangd they bear the mandate they must sweep my way and marshal me to knavery och its hamlet he is again the nicht said hendrik and knocked on the door the drone of the voice ceased come in this sharp and decisive when i went in i found myself looking at a pair of black sharp little eyes set in sockets that were yellowed and lined with the sun of the tropics the features were difficult to determine beneath the thick beard which had been black but was now showing streaks of grey wiry hair thick and inclined to curl was brushed straight back from the broad deeplylined forehead it matched the beard and so did the thick beetling eyebrows captain halsey was quite short in stature and very neat in appearance but i scarcely noticed anything of this at that first meeting my impression was of a man of violent personality and restless energy and all i noticed about him were his eyes they were almost unnaturally bright and hard like onyx shut the door mr hendrik his voice was soft almost gentle he was standing by a desk and his dark lean fingers drummed on the leather top of it are you the corporal of the guard he asked me yes sir i replied i understand your men have opened one of the cases and now know the nature of the cargo they are guarding his voice was still soft and gentle but his little black eyes watched me without blinking yes sir i replied you see theyd no idea i dont require your views on their action corporal still the soft voice but there was a strange quality about it that made it almost menacing it had the patient softness of a cat purring after its prey i find it most disturbing that you should have allowed this to happen those cases contain just over half a million in silver bullion it represents some payment by the russian government for arms we have sent them the cargo had to be delivered to treasury officials when we dock at leith and they will not be pleased to find some of the seals broken the nature of my report on the matter will depend on the behaviour of you and your guard during the remainder of the voyage the only people who know the nature of that cargo are the four of us here in this cabin and your two soldiers he leaned suddenly and swiftly forward across the desk it is imperative corporal that they do not talk his voice was no longer soft it was hard and crisp is there any likelihood of their having mentioned it to any of the crew im sure they havent i said good in wartime you cant pick and choose your crews ive nearly a dozen men on board whove never sailed with me before this trip i dont want them to know that we carry bullion understand im holding you responsible corporal that it doesnt get around the afterdeck upon that one thing will depend what sort of a report i make to the authorities on the matter is that clearly understood yes sir i said he grunted and his eyes shifted to rankin the interview was over the others at his invitation stayed i went aft and communicated the result to bert and sills they both gave me their solemn word that they would not mention it to a soul but i wondered about rankin ever since he came on board he had been drinking and playing cards with the chief engineer it was just after eleven then and i turned in to get some sleep before relieving bert at one it is difficult now after all this time to remember exactly what i felt about things at that moment i remember i could not sleep my mind was a kaleidoscope of impressions impressions of personalities i think more than of events there was the captain with his quiet voice and magnetic eyes his dour mate with the livid white of that scar running down his weatherbeaten cheek that rascally old gossip of a cook and jennifer sorrel with her pleasant rather sad voice and strange history and as background to my thoughts the steady throb of the ships engines as she rolled slowly along the southern edge of the barents sea towards leith i dont think even then i had any real sense of uneasiness the reason i could not sleep was just that my mind was full of so many things my hammock swung with the movement of the ship my stomach recorded each swoop i felt the slight shudder as the bows struck the next wave and then my back pressed hard on the canvas of my hammock as we rose sills suddenly tumbled out of his hammock and was sick in a bucket behind one of the cases his face was green and shining with sweat as he sat with his head in his hands on one of the cases moaning slightly the air became foully sweet and nauseating at twelvethirty i got up and went outside just going for a stroll round before i relieve you i told bert sills has been sick i went forard and stood for a moment in the lee of the bridge structure the wind was nearing gale force and a biggish sea was running whitecaps went hissing past in the dark dimly seen blurs of white that gave a frightening picture of black angry water footsteps sounded on the iron plating of the bridge over my head i heard the captains voice say the glass is still falling and hendrik replied aye itll be a dirty day tomorrow suits us eh they spoke quietly and only the fact that i was standing directly beneath them as they leaned on the canvas windbreaker of the bridge enabled me to overhear their conversation well make it tomorrow night halsey went on have you switched the watches aye jukes will be at the wheel from two till four tomorrow night hendrik replied good then well make halseys voice was lost to me as he turned away their footsteps faded slowly over my head as they paced back to the other wing of the bridge i did not move my mind had fastened on one point in that scrap of conversation they had switched the watches and jukes would be at the wheel between two and four the next night jukes according to the cooks gossip he was a seaman who had been with halsey on the penang theyd a right to switch watches jukes was a seaman no reason why he shouldnt be on duty at the wheel but why had halsey said that it suited them to have a dirty day tomorrow had there been a uboat warning there were a dozen explanations for the scrap of conversation i had overheard yet it is from that moment that i can definitely say i had a sense of uneasiness i dont know how long i stood there under the port wing of the bridge it must have been some time for when i became conscious of my surroundings again i felt wretchedly cold i walked briskly round the deck and the flying whitecaps hissing past us through the darkness seemed to surround the ship with vague menace when i relieved bert he said you bin for a long stroll corp thort youd fallen overboard he leaned his rifle against the afterdeckhousing and lit a cigarette hiding the glowing tip of it in his cupped palm the way you learn to in the army he leaned against the rail watching the great whalebacked waves slide under our keel we didnt speak for a while but at length he said yer very silent ternight corp not worried abat them seals being broke on that case are yer not particularly i said gosh you dont alf sound miserable wots on yer mind for a moment i was tempted to tell him all the little bits of gossip and scraps of conversation and halftoned suspicions that were wandering in a tangled melee through my mind i wanted to talk it over with somebody and have them reassure me that it was all nonsense but in the end i said nothing thinkin of yer girl are yer bert persisted then he asked you ave got a girl aint yer corp never seen no photograph up over yer bed yes ive got a girl i told him well cheer up for gawds sake he encouraged we aint doin time then after a moments hesitation he said you aint in trouble wiv yer girl are you i mean she aint got tired o waitin or anyfink like that my mind switched to betty she was so sane and practical she would have cleared my mind of uneasiness in a moment no not exactly i said glad of the opportunity to talk about something else but its she who insisted on my going for this commission i dont want to the truth is bert im not cut out for it not in the army if id been able to get into the navy it would have been different but in the army but her family is regular army and shes been badgering me to go for a commission ever since i was called up a few weeks back she wrote saying either i took a commission or shed break off our engagement well so you oughter take a commission eddicated bloke like you bert gave vent to a cackle of laughter cheer up mate he said it aint as bad as you fink being a jolly awfficer wish i could shout at in the morning private iggins wheres me boots but my mind had gone back to the conversation i had so recently overheard bert i said have you had a chat with any of the crew since weve been on board e i ave he replied dont we mess wiv em im practically a life member why know a seaman called jukes i asked jukes cant say i remember the name but then i knows em mostly as jim or ernie or bob or evansi asked evans a little welshman wot never stops talking theres two of em dan there evans an a bloke called davies talk abat laugh theyre like a couple of comics why do you ask point jukes out to me next time hes on deck will you i said okay he drifted off to bed shortly afterwards at three oclock i called sills he looked weak and ill but i thought the fresh air would do him good and left him vomiting over the rail next morning the th of march dawned grey and cold the cloud was practically down to sea level and a thin driving sleet reduced visibility to a few hundred yards the wind was at gale strength out of the nornorwest and the ship staggered and corkscrewed her way through giant waves burrowing her bows into their green bellies and tossing the stinging spray across her decks from end to end just ahead of us and yet on the edge of visibility the blunt stern of the american merchant a liberty ship wallowed through a welter of shaggy whitecaps an ugly slug of a ship half hidden in spray two vague shapes pitched in the sleetgrey void to the south of us and across the starboard rail just visible was the sleek outline of the destroyer scorpion rolling crazily with the sea washing in a smother of foam across her decks behind us was nothing but the white path of our wake obliterated almost instantly by the raging waters we were the last ship in the northern lane of the convoy i remember feeling thankful as i went on duty that we were no longer at the height of the uboat campaign and that there was little likelihood of our having to take to the boats it was a vicious sea with the wind whipping the spume off the breaking wave tops like white curtains of steam twice during the morning the destroyer came alongside to order us to close the american merchant each time she thrashed off into the grey sleet to speak to other ships like a fussy little hen overburdened with a brood of ugly ducklings about two oclock in the afternoon jennifer sorrel came and chatted to me she looked wan and cold her skin had an ivory transparency that made her look as though she had the beginnings of jaundice she talked of her home near oban her yacht the eilean mor which had been requisitioned by the navy in of her father her dark hair blew about her face and her teeth flashed gaily in the dull daylit misery of our surroundings her lips were almost bloodless and she bemoaned her inability to obtain any lipstick in murmansk as though that were the greatest of all the misfortunes that had befallen her i asked her if she was comfortable she made a wry face the cabins all right she said but i dont like the officers oh cousins is all right hes the young second officer but captain halsey terrifies me and that drunken beast of a chief engineer im having my meals served in my cabin now why i asked it was the chief engineer i couldnt stand him ogling me across the table he was drunk of course as usual i thought id got used to that sort of thing but somehow you dont expect it in your own race what about rankin i said feeling unaccountably angry hes always with the chief does he annoy you oh no she said with a little laugh hes not interested in women surely you realised that we then got on the subject of sailing we exchanged notes on all the various types of boats wed sailed about twothirty she said she felt cold and went below sills relieved me at three his face was dead white but he swore he felt better i went below for a mug of cocoa and took it into the crews messroom bert was in there cracking jokes with five or six of the crew i sat down beside him and after a moment he leaned towards me and whispered you was mentioning evans last night well thats im long at the end o the table there the man bert pointed out to me was a little fellow in dirty blue overalls with a thin crafty face and dark oily hair he was talking to a man next to him who had a broken nose and the lobe of his right ear missing as i sat there drinking my cocoa and watching his crafty little face i began to wonder how he would react if i mentioned the name penang the man next to bert suddenly pulled out his watch four oclock he said come on me lads two others scrambled to their feet when they had gone it left only evans the man with the broken nose and a pintsized old fellow with a tubercular cough evans was telling the man with the broken nose about a tanker hed sailed in that had run hashish for an alexandrian greek he spoke very fast in an excitable welsh singsong and he had a queer way of moving his arms to emphasise a point i tell you man he said at the end that was the daftest ship i ever sailed in i couldnt resist it what about the penang i said his head jerked round in my direction eyes narrowed what did you say he asked his companion was staring at me too the penang i said you were talking about queer ships i should have thought she was the queerest what do you know about the penang growled the man with the broken nose just gossip i said quickly they were both watching me closely bodies taut as though about to spring on me i live in falmouth i added sailors back from the china seas used to talk about her evans leaned towards me and what makes you think i was ever on the penang he asked captain halsey was the skipper and hendrik the first mate i explained i heard that you and a man named jukes my names jukes growled the man with the broken nose go on snapped evans i didnt like the look of it jukes brown hand had slowly clenched as it lay there on the table the index finger was missing but even so his fist looked like a sledgehammer i heard you had sailed with halsey before and naturally i thought you must have been with him on the penang well we wasnt see snarled jukes my mistake i said and then to bert come on time sills was relieved jukes thrust his chair back and started to his feet as we began to move but evans restrained him wots up wiv em bert asked as we got outside you mentionin that ship seemed to get em proper scared i dont know yet i said another thing happened that evening bert relieved sills an hour before midnight i was in my hammock half asleep when sills came in you awake corporal he asked what is iti asked is it all right if i go and kip down in one of the boats he asked bit stooffy laike in here an id feel more comfortable int fresh air its against regulations to get into the boats i said but its none of my business where you sleep he went off and i settled myself to sleep in less than ten minutes he was back again and jerking at my shoulder to wake me what is it now i asked have you got a torch he whispered he was excited and a bit scared no i said why whats up well its laike this corp he said i got int boat and was just settlin down naice an comfy when i felt boards give under me i felt around with me and and i could move em you come an have a look i climbed out of my hammock got my boots on and went forard with him the boat hed climbed into was the one on the port side number two boat he climbed underneath and felt around on the seaward side of the keel there he said feel that the wood was wet with spray i felt the ribs of the planks under my fingers i pressed against them they were solid enough i moved my hand further out up the port side of the boat and suddenly one of the planks moved the next one moved and the next altogether five of them were loose it was only a slight movement one or two of the screws had probably rusted without a torch it was impossible to estimate the extent of the damage but it was the boat to which we had been assigned if anything happened and i didnt like the thought of those loose planks ill go down and have a word with mr rankin i said rankin was in the chief engineers cabin as usual the place looked just the same as that first night wed come on board the chief was lying on his bunk rankin sitting on the end of it and the cards between them the place was littered with bottles and thick with cigarette smoke well what is it corporal rankin asked ive come to report number two boat unseaworthy i said i think captain halsey should be informed what the devil are you talking about he cried your job is to run a guard not to go nosing round the ship nevertheless i said some of the planks are loose in the boat and the captain should know about it how do you know about it sills discovered it i told him he climbed into the boat to get some sleep in the fresh air he reported to me that good god rankin interrupted me flinging his cards down on the bed havent you more sense than to let your men go sleeping in the boats thats not the point i said i was beginning to feel angry i went and had a look at the boat myself five planks are loose and my view is that shes in no fit state to take the sea if the necessity arose your view he sneered my god anybodyd think you were one of their lordships instead of a bloody little corporal what the hell do you know about boats you wouldnt know the difference between a cutter and a sieve now get back to your guard ive been sailing all my life i told him sharply and i know as much about small craft as any man on this ship that boat is the one allocated to us in the event of boat stations and im reporting to you the fact that its not seaworthy i insist that you pass on my report rankin looked at me for a minute he wasnt sure of himself he turned to the chief engineer how often are the boats inspected he asked oh about every week the other replied in fact hendrik and one of the men were working on em while we were in murmansk i thought so he turned back to me did you hear that vardy now perhaps youll stop getting panicky i dont care when mr hendrik was working on them i said that boats unseaworthy at the moment come up and see for yourself he hesitated then he said ill have a look at it in the morning if theres anything in what you say ill report it to captain halsey there will that satisfy you id rather you came and looked at it now i told him thats out of the question he said the ships blacked out anyway if there were anything the matter with the boat nothing could be done about it till daylight and with that i had to be content almost i was convinced that sills and i must have been mistaken down here in the solid bowels of the ship the slight movement i had felt in the planks of the boat seemed unreal and not very important but one little fact rattled uneasily round my mind hendrik and one of the men had been working on the boats in murmansk i turned into the galley for a chat with the cook and casually in the course of the conversation i said did you notice mr hendrik and one of the men working on the boats when the trikkala was in murmansk i believe they were doing something to them he said sleepily stroking the cat which purred contentedly on his lap what was wrong with them i asked no idea he replied who was working with him there was no suspicion in my mind as i put the question i asked simply because i thought it might be one of the crew i knew and i could then find out what work they had been doing on the boat but the cooks reply shattered my peace of mind jukes he said and the cat purred jukes jukes at the wheel in the small hours of the morning jukes working on the boats with hendrik jukes sullen and suspicious at the mention of the penang i went up on deck and paced the ship in the mad flurry of wind and driving spray my mind a turmoil of halfformed suspicions doubts and uncertainty at one oclock i relieved bert at one oclock on the th of march he was cold and tired turned at nice again he said with an effort at cheeriness the door of our quarters slid to on the muttered goodnight and i was alone with my uneasy thoughts in the menacing darkness even when my eyes got accustomed to the darkness i could see nothing not a glimmer of light not even the shadowy bulk of the afterdeckhousing behind me i was alone in utter darkness and the only thing my eyes could see was the glimmer of foaming wave tops as they thundered past the ship occasionally i leaned over the rail and looked forard along the ships side far away in the black turmoil of the sea two little pinpoints of light glimmered faintly the american merchant not properly blacked out they seemed the only friendly things in that nightmare darkness under my feet the steel deck plates vibrated steadily to the roar of the engines that percolated through the closed hatches but louder than the engines was the sound of the wind howling through the trikkalas superstructure and the intermittent thump of the bows as they buried themselves in a wave followed by the inevitable splatter of spray as it hit the decks i was partly protected by the bridge for the wind was off the starboard bow by walking forard a little i could see a white glimmer of surf pouring across the forepeak and against it the dim outline of the port wing of the bridge on the extreme end of the bridge wing i could just discern the faint red glow cast by the port navigation light the time slipped slowly by and my thoughts revolved endlessly around the little things that in themselves were insignificant but the sum of which had left me uneasy two oclock came and went jukes would be at the wheel by now why had the watches been switched what had halsey meant when he had said it suits us i paced up and down each time i turned into the wind spray stung my face salting my lips twofifteen i went to the rail and leaned out to look for the friendly pinpoints of light from the american merchant i gazed forard along the line of the ship there was not a sign of them all around us was empty darkness shot here and there by the hissing white of the broken wave tops i went forard towards the bridge i saw the black bulk of it against the ghostly glimmer of the surf pouring across her bows but there was no sign of the warm glow of the port navigation light and then a great sheet of heavy spray struck me stinging the left side of my face i knew then that we had altered course that was why i could no longer see the navigation lights of the american merchant a uboat warning it was common for convoys to zigzag if there was a warning of a uboat in the neighbourhood but id heard no depth charges being dropped in any case for the navy to order the whole convoy to alter course at night would mean breaking radio silence footsteps clattered down the iron bridge ladder i saw the figure of a man standing below the port wing of the bridge he was outlined against the surf breaking across the bows he was joined by the man from the bridge and they both disappeared into the black bulk of the bridge accommodation i looked at the luminous dial of my wrist watch twotwenty forty minutes to go before sills relieved me i paced up and down conscious of the position of the wind waiting for the ship to swing on to the next leg of the zigzag probably they had orders to change course at certain times it hadnt happened the night before but perhaps the skipper had received orders to that effect during the day at twothirty i noticed that the port navigation light was again visible against the steel plates of the bridge six minutes later the ship staggered under a terrific explosion chapter three abandon ship i was standing almost exactly amidships when the explosion occurred i remember i had just looked up a chink of light from the door to the bridge accommodation shone out on the vague bulk of the funnel beside me i had looked up to see a trailer of sparks float aft in a billow of smoke then i looked forard again watching for the two figures i had seen emerge i saw the bows dip and the water cream across them as she wallowed into the next wave i saw them lift and the surf begin to cascade over the side then it happened shock sound sight all seemed to come on the instant the shock threw the ship sideways and i was flung against the rail the sound was heavy and muffled like the sound of a depth charge and yet less solid as though the explosion had been at no great depth as i hit the rail the top of a wave that was boiling white and seemed almost level with the deck close under the bridge blossomed like a great white mushroom and then flung itself in a roaring curtain of water at the clouds at the instant my body hit the rail and i grasped the cold wet iron in my fingers the white blur of upflung water hovered motionless over the ship then it came down it hit the deck with a crash the weight of the water was crushing i fought upwards through it as though i were being smothered then suddenly it was over save for the sluicing of the water in the scuppers it was as though nothing had happened the pulsing of the engines continued the wind howled through the superstructure the waves went hissing past us in the night for a whole minute it seemed the ship held its breath in stunned surprise there was a sort of shocked normality then somebody shouted the engineroom telegraph rang twice the bell sharp and urgent in the galeridden night it rang again the sound of the engines died and from below decks a murmur of voices rose louder and louder shouts queries the rush of feet orders as though the engineroom telegraph had rung the curtain up the trikkala shook off her instants stupefaction and came to life i found myself still gripping the rail as the crew tumbled on to the deck vague shadows that ran and collided with each other and swore and asked the world what the hell had happened i found my rifle which i had dropped halseys voice thundered out from the bridge he used a megaphone but even so i remember thinking what a terrific compass his voice had boat stations he shouted get to your boat stations and then stand by the deck lights were suddenly switched on men stopped in their rush towards the boats blinking sleepily some were only half dressed others had forgotten their life jackets i saw one man limping along a boot on his left foot the other in his hand dangling by its laces a man called out to him where did it hit us george and he replied number one hold you can hear the water pouring in amongst that ironore cargo lucky it aint rice like we was carrying last time somebody said threw me right at o me hammick it did torpedo thats wot it was get away wi ye how would a uboat be after torpedoing us on a night like this its a mine i tell ye scraps of excited talk were flung in my ears by the wind and the ship looked strangely normal in the bright glare of her deck lights there was no sign of damage to her superstructure she had no list but with her engines slopped she was swinging broadside to the wind and rolling drunkenly hendrik appeared out of the bridge accommodation with him was the little welshman evans halseys voice boomed out again through his megaphone quiet he shouted theres no need to panic go quickly to your boat stations mr cousins get number two boat swung out and then stand by chief get number one swung out mr hendrik go below and ascertain the damage take evans with you hes right beside you the normal appearance of the ship had calmed the men they went quietly to their stations some dived back down below for clothes or forgotten life jackets they clawed their way along the decks as the ship rolled drunkenly the engines began pulsing again and below the sound of the wind and the seas breaking aboard i heard the roar of the pumps working i clawed my way back to our quarters clutching the rail each time the ship rolled into a trough the next wave broke inboard at times i was up to my waist in water as i reached our quarters the door was slid back and bert and sills pitched out against the rail their faces looked very white wots up guvnor bert gasped as he got his breath hit a mine forard i said get your life jackets on i dived into our quarters and struggled into mine i helped the other two on with theirs when i went out on deck again the starboard boat had been swung out some of the men were getting into it thats our boat number two on the port side i said bert grabbed my arm thats the one wots got those loose planks aint it sills told me his voice sounded scared id forgotten all about it until he mentioned it i felt a sudden surge of panic grip me by the guts i made no comment get to your boat stations i said as we started off along the deck i fancied she was already getting heavy in the bows hendrik suddenly materialised almost at my elbow evans was with him they both hurried forard somebody called out to the welshman hey evans didnt you go down with mr hendrik yes i didhe called back how bad is it bad as it could be man he called back it caught that weak plate we had strengthened at murmansk theres a hole about a mile wide in number one and the waters pouring through like niagara falls his excitable highpitched voice carried round the deck hendrik ran up the bridge ladder everyone was watching as he reported to the captain then halsey turned with the megaphone to his lips mr cousins get the men embarked in the boats call a roll report when each boats complement is complete the ships settling by the head weve got about ten minutes before she goes down a shocked murmur ran through the crew cor lumme bert said in my ear bang goes alf a million quids worf o the old bright an shinin we were just under the bridge now by our boat station i heard captain halsey call to hendrik to see that all hands were out of the engineroom mr cousins he shouted cupping his hands and leaning over the side of the bridge get number two boat swung out look sharp there are the bulkheads holding sir cousins asked number two bulkheads gone the captain shouted down at him mr hendrik expects number three to go any minute come on jump to it aye aye sircousins answered a sailor standing near me said thats funny number two were still olding when i come up aint yer goin ter do nuffink corp bert asked me fin were being unshipped it looked crowded and frail i thought of the planks that had shifted under the pressure of my fingers i looked aft to where the two rafts still hung in their fixtures above the afterdeckhousing ill take a chance on one of the rafts i told rankin youll do as youre told corporal he replied sharply give him his due he didnt seem scared and almost i obeyed the habit of obedience was not easily shaken off but the sound of the sea was all about me and suddenly my mind was made up remember what i told you about the state of that boat i said im taking one of the rafts i advise you to do the same im wiv yer corp bert said i aint hembarking in a ruddy sieve rankin hesitated but at that moment halseys voice shouted down at us mr rankin get yourself and your men into that boat aye aye sir rankins naval training reasserted itself now in you get both of you he said thats an order sills sills moved towards the boat now you cook rankin ordered im going wiv the corp bert said and there was an obstinate expression on his face coom on lad sills said to him youll only get yourself in trouble for nothing maybe the planks aint as bad as they seemed corporal rankin ordered im taking a raft i reiterated rankins hand gripped my arm his voice was excited corporal vardy ill give you one last chance get into that boat i shook him off im taking a raft i shouted at him why the hell didnt you pass on my report to the captain captain halseys voice sounded from just above us i looked up he was leaning over the bridge his beard glistened with salt spray his eyes were excited and wild looking mr rankin he roared im ordering you to get yourself and those two men into that boat whats the trouble they refuse to embark sir rankin replied refuse to embark he screamed report to me on the bridge he disappeared from view and from the other end of the bridge i heard him ordering number one boat away there was a confused medley of orders then the boat disappeared from view in a lull in the wind i heard the falls whistle as they slid through the blocks at that moment jennifer sorrel was escorted on to the deck she looked white and almost fragile in her khaki greatcoat and the cumbersome bulk of her cork lifejacket hendrik was with her he handed her over to cousins the second officer had got all the men embarked sills was up there too his thin damp face looked white in the lights he was scared the cook was hugging the cat which was struggling and clawing at him in a frenzy i suddenly found jennifer sorrel standing beside me cousins was about to help her into the boat the trikkala rolled heavily once again the port rail disappeared in a welter of swirling water then we were clear the girl was right beside me at the rail miss sorrel i said dont go in that boat im convinced its not safe how do you mean she said the planks are loose in her i said cousins overheard me stop that nonsense soldier he said angrily hurry please miss sorrel we ought to be clear by now suddenly i felt at all costs i must stop her going on that boat please i said take one of the rafts itll be cold but itll float what the hell are you talking about cousins hand gripped my shoulder and spun me round the boats all right i went over it only a week ago myself his right fist was clenched yes but you didnt inspect it last night i told him watching for his fist i did miss sorrel i said pleadingly over my shoulder please believe me youd be safer on the raft listen you cousins shouted if youre scared to get into a boat in a rough sea ill have to make you there was an ugly glint in his eye and his youthful face was set hard bert suddenly stepped forward and gripped the wrist of his clenched hand the corps right mister he said i felt them planks meself theyre loose andont you start nuffink see then he turned to the girl you take my tip miss an do as the corp says youll be safer wiv us the men were murmuring at the delay the trikkala was beginning to feel sluggish at the bows and though it was impossible to be sure in that turmoil she seemed to have a definite slant forard halseys voice suddenly shouted above our heads mr cousins clear that boat will you aye aye sir cousins answered he threw bert off come on miss sorrel please weve got to get clear i saw her hesitate her eyes searched mine suddenly she turned to cousins and said ill take a chance on one of the rafts my instructions are to take you in this boat was cousins reply come on now ive no more time to waste and he made as though to pick her up leave go of me she cried and wriggled away from him clear that boat will you mr cousins halsey screamed he sounded beside himself with rage for the last time miss are you coming cousins asked no ill take a raft was her reply at that he shrugged his shoulders and climbed into the boat he gave an order as the trikkala rolled to port they let go the falls when the wave top was almost touching her keel as she hit the water something jumped out of the boat and an instant later i saw the cooks tortoiseshell cat clinging to the trailing falls the water swirled away from us and the boat slid out of sight into the inky trough i went to the rail the trikkala reached the height of her roll and then i felt myself swinging down into the sea again cousins boat came up to meet me the oars were out and they were fending off for dear life she looked dry enough mr cousins i yelled as the boat came almost level with the rail to which i clung im cutting the port raft into the water have your boat stand by it till you know whether its seaworthy or not he gave no sign of acknowledgement i dont know whether he heard me but it was all i could do bert i called give me a hand with that raft well use the starboard one we scrambled aft as fast as we could and as i slithered along the deck the tortoiseshell cat shot ahead of me and disappeared down the aftercompanionway towards the galley i was to see that cat again but in very different circumstances i reached the raft and began hacking at the lower ropes with my clasp knife bert swarmed up on to the deckhousing and began slashing at the upper ties suddenly halseys voice cut through the almost deserted ship mr hendrik mr rankin he roared through his megaphone stop those men cutting that raft clear i heard them coming at us along the deck as i cut the last of the lower ropes they were shouting at us i stood back the mate was leading he had picked up an iron bar and his eyes gleamed viciously the scar on his cheek showed white in the swinging lights the ship rolled i saw jennifer sorrel clutch a rail by the bridge halsey was hurrying down the bridge ladder the tall shaft of the funnel the mast the rusty bulk of the bridge all swung in a dizzy arc hendrik clutched at a storm rope then as the ship rolled back he came on again there was murder in his eyes i slipped my rifle from my shoulder why didnt they want the raft cut clear the question flashed through my brain to justify my action stand back i ordered and gripped my rifle in both hands the mate still came on i thumbed forward the safety catch and worked the bolt halt or i fire i ordered he stopped then so did rankin there was a frightened look on his white face surely he had reported the condition of that boat to the captain go on bert i called cut her a way okay corp he answered im on the last rope here she comes there was a grating sound over my head i looked up the raft had begun to move and then with a roar it was away a heavy burst of spray told us that it was in the sea as the trikkala dipped to port i saw it floating like a dark platform in the boiling crest of a wave then it vanished there was no sign of the boat halsey was level with his mate now he stopped corporal you realise this ship is sinking he said youre endangering the lives clearing that raft wasnt endangering lives captain halsey i said number two boat was unseaworthy surely rankin told you that the boat was all right halsey said mr hendrik went over all the boats whilst we were in murmansk there were five planks loose i said thats a lie hendrik shouted but his eyes were shifty and his face was as white in the deck lights as the scar that ran from his ear to his chin evans had come up and was standing beside hendrik jukes i could see over by the starboard rail suddenly it as clear to me the whole monstrous plot i was staggered by the horror of it come on put your gun up halsey said you have committed an act of mutiny corporal try to understand what that means and what you have done i answered i dont think until that moment that i had quite appreciated the significance of my action but now i didnt care i saw poor little sills frightened face and the cook with his cat clawing desperately free of him the cat had known those men in the boats i cried my voice was hoarse i hardly recognised it you meant those planks to be loose thats what hendrik was doing to them in murmansk the mate started to come at me then the iron bar swinging in his hand i raised my rifle i would have shot him dead he knew that and he stopped he was scared you must be mad corporal halsey said mad i cried who was working on the boats in murmansk hendrik and jukes both men who served with you on the penang i saw halsey start whos left on the ship now just the four of you just the four who ran the penang in the china sea whats your game halsey i asked why have you murdered the crew of the trikkala is this another act of piracy halsey gave a little quick nod of the head and at the same moment bert shouted look at i swung round jukes was close behind me as i turned he had his fist drawn back i saw his thick powerful body lean towards me the face with its broken nose and small eyes was set and hard then he hit me the next thing i knew was a dizzy sensation of rising and falling in infinite darkness and the sound of water all about me very faint i heard berts voice say es comin rand miss then nearer you orl right corp i felt sick and my head hurt i lay still my eyes closed and all the time i had that horrible dizzy feeling of being lifted up high as a church steeple and then shot down again as though in an express lift i struggled with a dark nausea i was soaked to the skin and shivering the sound of water persisted the angry hiss and roar of waves breaking i struggled to sit upright somebody supported my back what happened i mumbled my jaw was almost too painful to open something hit me ill say it did berts voice answered that fellow jukes it was crep up behind yer an then when the capting nodded e auled off an socked yer ow yer feeling bit dizzy thats all i said i opened my eyes i could see nothing all was inky darkness for a moment i panicked at the thought that i had been blinded then as we shot skyward i saw a blur of white all round us the white of breaking waves then we plummeted down again somebodys hand was stroking my head gently whos that i asked i cant see a thing its me replied a girls voice and i realised with a shock that they had put jennifer sorrel on to the raft after all oh god i said im sorry you aint got nuffink to be sorry abat corp bert said shes safer ere than wot she would be in that boat i sat up and looked about me there were just the three of us on the raft vague shadows only visible against the boiling white of a wave crest wheres rankin i asked he stayed beind captings orders alsey was most apologetic to miss sorrel but said e couldnt risk er stayin on board the trikkala till e left in is boat promised to pick er up in the mornin when it was light on the top of a wave i saw a line of lights is that the trikkala i asked thats er mate bert answered capting told us to shove orf e was afraid we wouldnt be clear when she went dan the winds carried us well clear of er jennifer sorrel suddenly spoke we were in the trough of a wave and it was strangely silent funny she said our whole world has dwindled to a dark cold seething mass of water and yet over there there are cabins and hot water and food and lights thats right miss bert put in an alf a million quids worf of silver all band for the ruddy bottom we rose the raft slanting crazily then the water boiled all about us the wind cut through our wet clothes and out there in the darkness were the lights of the trikkala the raft tilted we raced down the back of the wave all was quiet for a moment there was no wind then suddenly we seemed lifted skyward by unseen hands and we were on top again of a raging torrent of water the lights of the trikkala showed for an instant and then were suddenly gone leaving just a blank empty darkness for a moment i thought we had dropped to a trough again but the water still boiled all round us and then the raft tilted and raced down the back of the wave when we rose again there was no flicker of light listen i said i thought i heard the sound of her engines just a trick of the wind mate bert said shes gone and i was convinced he was right the trikkala had gone to the bottom we were alone on a raft in the barents sea the captain said hed pick us up in the morning jennifer sorrel said i lay back and closed my eyes trying to think all those accusations i had made i had been so sure of them in the heat of the moment but what reason could they possibly have had for tampering with the boats they couldnt have known they would hit a mine and if it was the silver they were after they wouldnt get much of it away in an open boat i felt id made a fool of myself and yet there followed hours of terrible darkness on the wave crests the wind cut through our soaked clothing like a knife the water surged around the raft sometimes it broke right over us the rolled canvascovered bulwarks became coated with ice we hung on to the ropes with frozen fingers in the troughs it was comparatively warm it was a dizzy nightmare of violent movement i was shivering violently i felt ill and dazed we huddled close against each other for warmth as though by common consent we didnt talk of what had happened bert began to sing and for what seemed hours we sang old army favourites going over and over again our limited repertoire and when we could think of nothing more jennifer suddenly began to sing arias from operas boheme rigoletto tosca the barber and others that i did not know she had a clear sweet voice the gayer songs sounded strange in that wretched welter of foam and wind and dizzy movement so we passed the time waiting for dawn we dared not sleep though we were all half dead with tiredness and cold we were none of us sick the movement was too violent it numbed our frozen guts the time went slowly by in a leaden daze and when at last a faint ight crept into the sky it made the wretchedness of our state more apparent it is difficult to imagine what it is like on a raft in a gale in those northern waters the awful sense of loneliness the deadly fear that you are simply waiting for the end in a living death in twentyfour hours we should be dead from the cold we could not possibly survive another night we were soaked and shivering and frozen and all around us was that grey mercilessly windtorn sea not a sign of the trikkala no boats nothing but stormtossed water surging restlessly and the sky leaden with the promise of snow bert voiced my thoughts gawd he said fair beast of a mornin aint it yer know corp i was appier in the dark couldnt see them waves then fair vicious they look this one for instance you cant hardly believe well make the top of it can yer we were in a trough at the moment and high above us towered a green mountain of a wave its crest curling wickedly in a surge of windwhipped spray it looked as though it were tumbling down on top of us bent on crushing our frail craft it didnt seem possible that we could survive yet the raft tilted quickly and was borne aloft in an instant to be almost submerged in that foaming surf and so it went on until we took it for granted that we should make it each time i tried standing up for the instant that we were poised on the crest bert gripping my legs at the knees but i could see nothing no sign of the trikkalas boats nothing visibility was barely a mile a cold haze hung over that desolate sea jennifer was shivering her face was dead white with strain and there were dark rings under her eyes i thought of all she must have been through and now this and only a few hours ago she had been talking rapturously of england she no longer sang she just sat there patient exhausted resigned to the inevitable the spirit which showed in the strong formation of her face was crushed out of her with this final blow once when i stood up i caught sight of something dark in the sea near us the wind drove us quite close to it a wave crest hit it so that it turned over and swooped down into a trough with us it was a wooden seat for a moment the word trikkala stared at us from the water then it was gone swept away in the break of another wave it was one of the seats that had been fixed below the trikkalas bridge shortly afterwards an oar drifted alongside bert leaned out and made a grab for it he missed and only the united efforts of jennifer and myself saved him from going in next instant the oar was thrown right against the raft and we took it on board there was nothing to tell us definitely that it was an oar from one of the trikkalas boats but bert and i exchanged a glance and he said poor devils strangely enough my watch though soaked with water still continued to function at nineforty standing up for a quick look round as the raft steadied itself on a wave top i saw the dim shadow of what looked like a ship on the edge of visibility i tried again on the top of the next wave but i could see nothing i kept on trying though fearing that my eyes had deceived me and the fourth time i really saw it a corvette rolling drunkenly on the top of a wave and halfhidden in spray i reckoned shed pass within about half a mile of us i told the others and when we hit the next wave top we could all see it quite plainly half drowned in water which streamed off her as she rose from the trough we must wave something bert said on this oar got anyfink coloured corp khaki aint no good i shook my head then jennifer said ive got a red jumper on if you two boys will just turn the other way no i said youll get cold she suddenly smiled it was the first time id seen her smile that morning it lit her whole face it was like a ray of sunlight i cant be colder she said anyway i dont mind if it means a hot drink and bed afterwards bert said go on miss urry up if that ship dont see us weve ad it shes eadin up into the wind back towards the convoy a moment later a red jumper swung from the top of the upraised oar it hung limp for a moment in the trough and then bellied out as the wind tore through it so that it looked like the trunk of some strange scarlet spectre its arms outstretched in mute appeal each time we hit a wave top we swung the oar back and forth our eyes watching the sleek halfsmothered outline of the warship she was abreast of us now there was no doubt about it she was headed back to the convoy the water creamed from her dripping bows as she made what speed she could in the teeth of the wind our hearts sank a squall of sleet came down and for a time she was blotted out when we saw her again she was past us we could begin to see her stern we looked at each other as we lay for a second in a trough berts lined monkeylike face was set in desperation jennifers was blank hopeless the next wave top showed the corvette farther off it was the end soon she would vanish into the curtain of the mist and yet when we rose again she still seemed just as near she presented no more of her stern it was as though time had stood still up again and there she was still but broadside on to us and when we rose again it dawned on us we cheered wildly a thin ragged sound in that waste of water she was turning in a wide circle towards us a few moments later and her small knifesharp bows were pointed straight at us she looked like a toy the slim hull of her pitching violently her mast and funnel like matchsticks waving in the wind within half an hour bert and i lay in bunks in borrowed pyjamas in the corvettes little sickbay each of us with two hotwater bottles pressed against us and a tot of rum in hot cocoa inside us i never slept so solidly in all my life next morning the skipper came to see us he was a lieutenant a youngster of about twentythree his voice had the fatherly tone of a man who had been brought up to treat all men as his children it was from him i learned that we were the only survivors of the trikkala the it trikkalas wireless operator had contacted the escort ships of the convoy and the corvette bravado had been ordered to stand by till dawn to pick up survivors she had seen a good deal of wreckage which had been identified as belonging to the trikkala but there was no sign of the boats i was staggered all the wild thoughts i had had about the trikkala and her skipper crumbled away the accusations i had hurled at him seemed like the ravings of a delirium the third boat halseys boat had gone down with the rest a medical orderly treated my jaw which was swollen and painful my temperature was normal i felt tired and stiff otherwise all right but bert was running a bit of a fever and starting to cough his face was unnaturally flushed and his eyes bright the orderly told him hed have to stay in bed i could get up when i liked i asked him how miss sorrel was he told me she was fine shortly after eleven there was a cry of up spirits the orderly brought us each our tot of rum he was a pleasant longfaced rather serious boy with carroty hair and ears that flared out from either side of his head looks as though es goin ter take off any minute bert said in an effort at cheeriness i lay in bed all morning berts breathing became heavy and the cough more noticeable i didnt like the sound of it i tried to read but it wasnt easy the cabin swayed and tossed the sea thundered against the closed ports the noise of it drowning the rhythmic roar of the engines which vibrated through the whole ship we were making good speed in a heavy sea and it sounded like it after lunch i got up dressed and went on deck when i say i went on deck all i mean is that i slipped up a wet companionway and took a quick look round it was a grey dingy sight the sea was just as it had been the previous morning the corvette was awash from stem to stern the mast with a torn white ensign flying swayed alarmingly the ship was flinging herself through the waves i went below again the orderly was in the sickbay i asked him whether it would be all right for me to see miss sorrel he took me forard along a narrow steel passageway that swayed and dipped wildly he indicated the door of a cabin and left me i knocked i found myself strangely nervous as she called come in i found her propped up in a bunk wearing a mans white sweater with the colours of some team knitted into it her face still looked tired but it lit up with a smile when she saw who it was i sat with her for quite a while i dont know what we talked about i only know that i enjoyed talking with her she was natural friendly easy to talk to we had the love of the sea in common shortly after midday the corvette rejoined the convoy the gale had blown itself out and the sea was falling when i went on deck after lunch a watery gleam of sunshine picked out the white flecks of the windbroken sea we were passing along the southern fringe of the convoy the merchant ships wallowed slowly in the remnants of the gale like a flotilla of ungainly ducks ahead of us the slim grey lines of the destroyer scorpion patrolled in a smother of spray i returned to the sick bay shortly afterwards came the faint sound of the loudhailer the skipper of the bravado was reporting to the commander of the scorpion i wondered how he felt poor devil losing the one ship in the convoy that carried a valuable cargo for the british treasury bert got steadily worse during the day he didnt cough much but fever burned in his eyes and by the evening his temperature was up to he still tried to crack an occasional joke but his voice was weak and he lay in a semicoma the medical orderly suspected pneumonia i had tried to comfort him with the thought that in about thirtysix hours we would be in leith and a doctor would come on board but when i went up on deck the next morning for a blow before breakfast there was no sign of the convoy and the corvette was hurrying north i asked one of the crew why this was were we making for scapa he said no iceland the old mans had orders to pick up a couple of yankee freighters at reykjavik and escort them down to meet a westbound atlantic convoy back in the sick bay berts feverbright eyes looked up at me over the bedclothes are we nearly there corp he whispered no bert i replied weve left the convoy were bound for iceland he gave a little grunt and closed his eyes i thought he had gone off to sleep again but in a moment he said just the job iceland get me silly temperature dan and his face cracked into a tired grin jennifer came to visit him in the afternoon her red jumper freshly washed was a gay splash of colour in the little sickbay her face looked bright and cheerful the dark rings under her eyes had gone and her skin had more colour in it there was even a gleam of laughter in her grey eyes it wasnt until she had been in the room several minutes that it dawned on me why she looked so gay youve got hold of some lipstick i said wherever did you find that on a warship she laughed the skipper hes a dear when he lent me that sweater of his he rather shyly produced some powder and lipstick last port he was in was calais and hed bought cosmetics for his girl friends and his sister he said he was sure his sister wouldnt mind for some reason i felt sullen and angry when the medical orderly came in she took him on one side and questioned him it seems she knew all about pneumonia i suppose there was plenty of it in the concentration camps anyway she was constantly in and out of the sickbay after that in the capacity of selfappointed nurse she confirmed that bert had pneumonia but she said hed be all right he hadnt got it badly the next night he was over the worst by the time we reached reykjavik he was sitting up in bed cracking jokes and demanding his arrears of rum ration pity the army dont cotton on ter this ere rum abit aint it mate was his comment altogether we were nearly three weeks on board the bravado ill always remember that as one of the happiest times i spent in the army the weather turned fine we were given very little to do and as nobody fell sick the skipper left us quartered in the sickbay which was a good deal more comfortable than the afterdeck and every day i saw jennifer mostly we talked of sailing id done a months sailing among some of the islands off the west coast of scotland i knew oban and mull and the kyle of lochalsh she told me the story of the ladys rock and about the race that runs between the rock and the lighthouse on eilean musdile of the seals on the islands off lismore of lobster breeding of the story of duart castle she told me of the trips she had done with her brother on her ton ketch the eilean mor and i in my turn told her of voyages made from my home town of falmouth i was with a firm of architects and the junior partner a fairly wealthy young man had owned a gaffrigged cutter with another fellow and myself as crew wed done trips to france and even spain wed taken her into most of the ports of britains west coast at one time or another so the time passed in a timeless haze of chatting reading and lazing we were a week at reykjavik and left in glorious sunshine with two american liberty boats we tacked them on to their convoy some twelve hundred miles from new york and then turned homeward the rumour got around the ship that we would dock at falmouth i stopped the skipper one day and asked him whether it was true you see its my home town i said and its nearly a year now since i saw my family he smiled and nodded quite true he said well dock at falmouth on the th all being well at ten oclock on the th we steamed past zose point and slid into the anchorage beyond the ferry a line of naval patrol boats mls and mtbs were moored close to the foreshore and there was a destroyer and two corvettes at anchor all about me were old familiar things that i had not seen for a long time the little pier where id fallen into the water as a kid was still there just as it had always been in my lifetime it was as though id never been away bert and i stood against the rail looking out on to the town i was so busy pointing out places to him that i didnt hear jenny come up id been calling her that for several days now well jim she said im afraid its goodbye now she was wearing the khaki greatcoat and little black beret that i had seen her in that first time when she struggled up the gangway of the trikkala i hadnt given this moment a thought and i felt a sudden emptiness are you going ashore now i asked yes she said theyre just lowering a boat for me i stared at her she was going ashore she was walking right out of my life when id come to take her presence almost for granted i suddenly felt i was losing hold of something precious to me ill ill see you ashore wont i but she shook her head im leaving right away for scotland she said i havent seen daddy for over three years i expect he thinks im dead you see we couldnt write im not going to phone him im just going to walk right in on him and give him the surprise of his life a rating came up boats alongside miss sorrel goodbye then jim she held out her hand i took it i thought her face looked sad i hoped the parting meant as much to her as it did to me then she removed her hand and shook berts goodbye bert dont do too much youll feel a bit depressed if you do goodbye miss sorrel he said you must come for annuvver trip wiv us sometime the corp an i is thinking of startin a little company to run trips ter davy jones an back fer people like you wot asnt ad enough hexcitement in their lives she laughed and then with a little wave she was gone she never looked back i leaned over the side watching the boat pull away for the shore she sat staring straight in front of her she never once turned her head it was as though she had turned her back on all that section of her life she was going home the coxswain touched me on the arm captains orders corporal and you an cook is to report to the sickbay and remain there until youre sent for that brought me back to earth with a jolt the trip was over jenny had gone we were back in the army again we went below for two hours we remained in that little sickbay nobody came twice i got up with the intention of trying to see the skipper it was infuriating to be sitting there with my home just across the anchorage held up by some wretched little bit of red tape but each time i sat down again the skipper was bound to be busy hed been very decent to us he knew my home was in falmouth hed send us ashore as soon as he could we were called for food and finally at twothirty a rating poked his head round the door wanted on deck corporal he said you an yer mate shall we bring our kit i asked he said wed better he stood in the doorway watching us curiously as we gathered our things together my eyes blinked in the sunlight as we came out on deck a launch was lying alongside and standing by the rail close under the bridge was a military police sergeant ullo ullo wots this bert said beastly red cap an a sergeant too looks like trouble mate you corporal vardy the sergeant asked as we came up he looked down at a piece of paper he had in his hand corporal jl vardy yes i said gunner hb cook he asked bert thats me sarge the sergeant folded the piece of paper up and put it in his pocket i have orders to place you both under close arrest he said for a moment i think i just gaped at him i couldnt believe id heard correctly place us under arrest i said blimey muttered bert fine omecoming this is then he looked up belligerently ere wot are we supposed to ave done he asked yes i said whats the charge sergeant mutiny he replied come on now get into the boat and look sharp about it i never saw my family and bert never got up to london to see his missis we were driven straight from the docks at falmouth to a military camp near plymouth occupied by number holding company there we were locked in a small room at the rear of the guard post which we shared with a frightened little medical fellow waiting to go before a civilian court for assault this room acted as a temporary cell the permanent cells being all occupied and here we spent wretched weeks of waiting chapter four the courtmartial the morning after our arrival at the camp we were taken before the adjutant and remanded the charge was confirmed as one of mutiny i asked who had made the charge the answer was a warrant officer of the royal navy rankin the adjutant then informed us that a summary of evidence would be taken and the camp commandant would then decide whether he would send us for courtmartial that the charge had been made by rankin was the first indication we had that we were not the only survivors of the trikkala and if rankin had survived then halsey and the others in the captains boat had probably survived as well i remember as i stood at attention in that drab wooden office with the spring sunshine cutting a broad shaft through the curling tobacco smoke i was troubled again by all the doubts and uneasiness that had been in my mind during those last few hours on board the trikkala the loose planks the scraps of overheard conversation the cooks story of the penang jukes clenched fist when i mentioned the ships name captain halseys sharp black eyes his whispered it suits us the ships alteration of course jukes at the wheel when the explosion took place it all flooded back into my mind as i stood there staring stiffly at the three polished brass pips on the adjutants service dress and i cursed myself for not having mentioned any of these things in my report to the skipper of the bravado the whole structure of my suspicions had collapsed like a pack of cards as soon as i heard that we were the only survivors there had been no point in voicing suspicions that i no longer believed to have any foundation now they were all revived back in our quarters i talked it over with bert youd think the silly fool would ave bin willin ter let bygones be bygones wouldnt yer bert said just you wait till i get me ands on that rotten warrant awfficer i went over the whole thing with bert time and time again the conversations the feel of those planks shifting under our fingers the events of that night which had ended with the three of us on the raft we listed everything wed heard about halsey and hendrik and jukes and evans but we got no further vague suspicions that was all nobody to corroborate our evidence except jenny and she knew very little but what i had told her we needed some supporting evidence of a member of the crew perhaps there had been other survivors if cousins boat had gone number one boat might still have been picked up even so we were in a spot there was no question of our guilt we had refused to obey the orders of our superior officer and i at any rate had threatened him and a ships officer with my rifle what we had to prove was justification and my heart sank at the thought of trying to put across my frail suspicions as justification to a bench of hardbitten regulars sitting in judgment at a courtmartial i suppose i had been pacing the room a long time when bert said fer gawds sake why dont yer sit dan mate aint no use worryin and then on a sudden note of anger these guardrooms they give me the willies if we was civvies na theyd allow us out on bail then we could at least dran our sorrows in a drop of the ol pigs ear i sat down then i felt depressed and utterly wretched i cant forgive myself for getting you into this mess bert i said he suddenly grinned come on nark it he said if you adnt done wot yer did id ve got into that boat an where should i ave bin na feedin the little fishes thats where like poor little sills dyer reckn the planks was loose in both the boats jim i shrugged my shoulders speculation seemed so hopeless now i dont know i replied i dont know what to think one thing im certain of now that is that the planks were loose in the one we examined remember it was sills who discovered it then he did what he was told and got into the boat poor devil i remembered his pinched frightened little face as he sat there in the bows i remembered the cat clawing free of the cook and jumping on to the deck had the cat known what was going to happen if only that second officer cousins had stood by the raft after we had cut it into the water i was thinking aloud going over in my mind all the circumstances as i had been doing all that morning some of them might have been saved then i suppose they couldnt see it it was dark as pitch i looked across at bert what i dont understand i said is why the captain didnt want that raft cleared i suppose i shouldnt have insisted it was his responsibility i just acted on the spur of the moment but i dont understand that rankin had reported to the bridge he must have told halsey the reason we wouldnt get into the boat yet he ordered hendrik to stop us cutting the raft clear mebbe he wanted the boats to sink bert said he said it casually not jokingly but without thinking his words echoed my thoughts for an instant i think i actually believed that that was the truth of it then my thoughts came down to earth it wasnt possible it just wasnt possible what had he to gain anyway the trikkala was sunk at that moment the sergeant of the guard came in here you are he said letter for each of you registered one for you corporal he held out a book for me to sign blimey said bert a letter from me ol trouble thanks sarge i put the registered envelope down on the scrubbed deal table top the neat linen paper with the blue lines of its registration was as impersonal as a legal document i did not need to open it i knew what would be inside the address was in bettys neat precise writing i sat there staring at it in dumb misery bert had opened his letter gosh he said listen to the op woman this is wot she says just like you bert ter get yerself in trouble when yer doo for a munfs leave an i was reckoning on you ter do the washing up an look after the kids however as you says better alive an in trouble than at the bottom of the sea like that other poor fellow though i dont know wot the neighbours will fink he looked up angrily who on earth cares wot the neighbours fink he cried thats the trouble wiv the ol woman always worryin wot the stupid neighbours fink i had opened the envelope now the little platinum circle with the rubies and diamonds had rolled out on to the table it lay there glittering brightly accusingly i read the letter and then tore it up i couldnt blame her wots that you got there bert asked suddenly blimey a ring does that mean yer girls bin an thrown you over on account o this i nodded it was her father made her do it i said i wasnt angry just wretchedly depressed remember i told you it was her idea that i went for a commission well instead of going for a commission im under arrest her family is regular army to her its as bad as if id been jailed as a common thief but strewf bert exclaimed she dont know whether youre guilty or not yet she dont know the circumstances oh yes she does i replied look at it from her point of view her familys friends are all retired service people it was bad enough when she had to admit to being engaged to a corporal this places her in an impossible position he didnt say a word and i just sat staring down at the ring wondering what to do with it wish i had a girl that wrote to me like your missis does bert i hesitated a sense of desperate loneliness was closing in on me would you read me some more of your letter bert i asked it sounded so so friendly he didnt answer for a moment just sat there his brown eyes watching me sympathetically i was suddenly very glad bert was with me okay he said he gave a little forced grin but the ol girl aint very ot at expressing erself he said she aint got the grammaktical flair wot i as he turned to the letter again where was i oh yes wot the neighbours will fink if you let me know when the trial is an where id like ter come along so as i can give their lordships a piece of me mind if they dont acquit you bert i could park the brats wiv mrs jackson thats the ol lady wots moved into the rooms up above us but would they let me in the court i ad a word wiv young alf wot assists in the grocers shop dan below es the one i told yer copped a packet at salerno an got is ticket cos e was minus an arm an e said e didnt fink civilians was allowed in military courts not that es ever bin courtmartialled e made that point very plain whereupon e said there were several pages of it written in a straggling illeducated scrawl but friendly sympathetic practical he finished and i sat for a moment staring at that ridiculous ring the red and white stones sparkled as though with devilish laughter i suddenly picked up the bauble in a fury i dont know what i was going to do with it i only knew i wanted to be rid of it i think i was going to throw it through the barred window but instead i turned to bert will you do something for me i asked course he said wot is it mate i want you to send this ring to your missis bert i said tell her no dont tell her anything say you picked it up say anything you like about it but send it to her here catch the stones twinkled he caught it and stared down at the glittering stones as they lay in his dirty wrinkled palm ere wots the idea his tone was offended suspicious i dont want it bert i said id like your missis to have it but look ere mate he said i cant do that wouldnt be right worf quite a bit these days an wotd she do wiv it she aint never ad nothing like this before thats why id like her to have it i said ere take it he said his voice seemed almost scared i dont want it i aint never taken nuffink from nobody i flared up angrily cant you understand i cried i dont want it i never want to see that wretched ring again but i cant just throw it out of the window the outburst was over id like her to have it bert i said quietly please send it to her tell her to sell it itll help pay her rail fare to come down and see you id like to meet your wife bert i think i think she must be a lovely person bert suddenly laughed blimey ill tell er that itll tickle er no end he looked down at the ring as fer this well talk abat that later he said and slipped it into a little notecase in which he kept photographs of his wife and kids that afternoon my family came over it was an awkward meeting i was their only child the people they fi knew were mostly connected with the navy my father had been in the diplomatic service before he returned to falmouth to take over the management of the familys quarry business at his fathers death mutiny was a charge more startling to them than murder they were kind but i saw that all their hopes which had been centred on me were shattered after that time drifted by slowly timelessly i had written to jenny just to warn her that i might have to call on her as a witness for the defence she filled my thoughts more and more but the days drifted by and no word came our routine was easy bert and i helped the medical fellow clean out the guardroom in the mornings we had half an hours exercise each day otherwise we were left to ourselves there were two smaller cell rooms attached to the guardroom the assault case was moved into one of these i persuaded them to leave bert and me together berts companionship became more and more my only hold on life i persuaded him after long arguments to send the ring to his wife i still have the letter she wrote me the hours of thought it had taken her to compose it were painfully obvious in every line and yet through it i got a glimpse of a woman whose bitter struggle through life had given her a wonderful sense of sympathy she said she wouldnt accept it but shed keep it until i had recovered from the blow and she could hand it back without upsetting me when we had been in the guardroom a week a summary of evidence was taken a lieutenant soames took it the delay had been caused by the necessity of waiting for statements to arrive supporting the charges he read me a statement by rankin and another by captain halsey they were quite correct in their facts in my statement i explained all the cumulation of little things that had gone to build up my sense of uneasiness i stressed the discovery of the loose planks in number two boat rankins refusal to report the matter to the captain that night and captain halseys inexplicable attitude over the clearing of the raft after rankin had reported to him the reason we had refused to enter the boat the lieutenant wrote it all down laboriously in longhand i read it through and signed it the taking of the summary of evidence took all morning and part of the afternoon we returned to our quarters shortly after three reckn theyll send us for courtmartial bert asked theyve no alternative i said theres a clear case against us but somehow weve got to convince the courtmartial that we were justified fat chance we got o doing that bert said i know a bit abat courtmartials there aint no such thing as justicification you either obeyed the order or you didnt if yer didnt then gawd elp yer didnt a bloke write a poem once somefink abat theirs not ter reason why theirs but ter do an die no amount of explaining will get us at o this oh well wots it matter six munfs a year bettern being dead like sills thats how i felt our situation was hopeless next morning we heard the guard outside clatter raggedly to attention bit early for the orderly awfficer aint it bert said boots sounded on the bare boards of the corridor outside then the door was flung open and the sergeants voice bawled out prisoners prisoners shun we sprang to attention and a captain came in all right he said sit down both of you we relaxed he seated himself on the table and took off his hat he had dark hair and a blue determined chin his voice was sharp precise but not unfriendly ive come to tell you he said that the camp commandant colonel ellison has decided on the summary of evidence taken that your case be remanded for trial by field general courtmartial you will be formally remanded by him later today in the meantime there is the question of your defence you can brief a professional lawyer or you can have any particular officer you wish to defend you provided he is available alternatively i am willing to act as defending officer my name is captain jennings im a solicitor in civilian life he looked quickly from one to the other of us perhaps youd like to think it over i hesitated i liked the look of him his quick precise manner of speech inspired confidence to get a lawyer would mean calling on my family for finances the only officer i would really have liked a barrister who had been sailing with us several times was overseas as far as im concerned sir i said id be glad if youd act forme he glanced across at bert an id be glad if yerd do the same fer me sir thats fine he said we can get down to business right away the tone in which he said this suggested a man mentally rolling up his sleeves it was almost as though he were really interested in the case indeed i never had any cause to regret that our case was in his hands ive had a look at the summary of evidence he said in it you both admit your guilt what we have to decide now is the line we are going to take for your defence vardy suppose you tell me exactly what happened and why you took the action you did just go through the whole thing as you remember it i want to know what your thoughts were from the time you boarded the trikkala to the time she was mined just relax and give me a chance to understand the thing from your point of view there was not much i could add to what i had said in the statement to lieutenant soames but i went through it all explaining my growing uneasiness the discovery that the planks were loose i tried to make him understand why we had taken the action we did at the end he turned to bert have you anything to add to that cook bert shook his head its just as the corporal said he replied we was quite pally yer see an we talked things over i didnt ave no esitation in followin is line of action just one point said captain jennings did you actually test the planks yourself or did you merely take the corporals word for it no bert replied i felt em meself it was sills wot discovered they was loose i was on guard at the time but e told me all abat it and when the corporal relieved me i got im ter take me forard to ave a look for meself well we couldnt see em of course but i put me and up underneath the boat an as i recollect there was five of em loose they didnt move much but enough ter make me doubt wevver the boat was seaworthy yer could move em abat a quarter of an inch i see he sat for a moment swinging his leg interesting case he spoke more to himself than to us then he looked at me it amounts to this corporal you both intend to stick to the statements you have already made well its the truth sir i said i acted hastily but what else could i do hm it makes it very difficult he murmured then in a coldly matteroffact voice you see a courtmartial always has the question of discipline at the back of its mind you refused to obey an order not only that but you took upon yourself a decision that only the captain had a right to make and when ordered to stop cutting the raft clear you threatened those who tried to stop you with your rifle to clear yourselves of such a serious charge of mutiny you would have to prove that the boat was in fact unseaworthy and that knowing this the captain was deliberately trying to prevent the men being given the added safety of a raft in other words you would have to convince the court that the captain had some sinister motive and was deliberately sending the boat away in an unseaworthy condition which is clearly fantastic we neednt bring it up but you yourself admit that the second officer cousins was convinced the boat was seaworthy having recently inspected it himself its going to be difficult you know he added and i must warn you right away that theres not much chance of getting an acquittal about all i can hope to do is get you off with light sentences by emphasizing your previous good record and pleading that whether you were in fact justified or not you were acting in good faith in that you felt justified at the time im not sure it wouldnt be best for you to plead guilty would you be prepared to plead guilty corporal yes i said if it would look better that way i certainly am guilty of the charges but i added im convinced i was justified in what i did i know it doesnt sound like that from a disciplinary point of view but the more i think about it the more convinced i am that there was something wrong somewhere my uneasiness wasnt all just imagination im sure of that but i cant prove anything i cant even say what i suspect i dont know but im still convinced there was something wrong he looked at me for a moment probingly i could see he was trying to make up his mind whether he should believe what i had said at length he said you made a statement on board the bravado presumably yes sir did you refer to your suspicions in that no sir you see when i heard we were the only survivors i thought my suspicions had been groundless he nodded pity he said a board of trade inquiry might have helped your case a lot and now that you know there were other survivors your suspicions have been revived yes sir and then i asked just who was picked up sir have you a list of survivors yes he said i know who the survivors are again that searching look who would you expect to be amongst the survivors my answer was prompt captain halsey i said hendrik the first officer warrant officer rankin jukes and evans anyone else he asked noi said in other words all those who were left on board after the two boats had got away i nodded after a moment he put another question to me who exactly did you know to be on board after the main body had abandoned ship who did you actually see on board rankin and halsey of course hendrik who got the raft alongside jukes who hit you what about evans did you actually see him no i said but you think he would be one of the men to go with the captain in his boat yes sir its extraordinary he said youre quite right vardy the list of survivors is exactly as you said halsey hendrik rankin jukes and evans they were picked up by a minesweeper not far from the faroes on the th of march twentyone days after the trikkala went down he sat there swinging his leg for a long time at length he slid his body off the table and picked up his hat well he said ill go and sleep on it ill come and see you both tomorrow evening and well have another talk i about it in the meantime go over the whole thing again and see if there isnt something youve missed that we could bring out the refusal of the warrant officer to pass on that report of yours about the state of the boat thats the sort of point that tells he left then seems a decent sort bert said as the guard was brought to attention in the guardroom yes i said but that wont get us out of this jam boots sounded in the corridor the door was thrown open corporal vardy it was the sergeant yes i said theres a young lady here been waiting nearly an hour she had a word with the orderly officer and he said she could see you a young lady i exclaimed yeah good looker too he gave a wink he was a friendly sort ill send her in shall i i was a little dazed surely betty hadnt changed her mind a great hope surged through me yes i said yes send her in would you tings is lookin up bert said with a grin reckn shes come ter get er ring back he began whistling daisy daisy give me your answer do through his gums the sergeants footsteps returned beside his heavy boots i heard the quick patter of a girls shoes then the door opened and jenny entered i was so amazed i just sat there gaping as she crossed the room towards me and the sergeant closed the door behind her i just couldnt believe my eyes and she seemed so different instead of the shapeless khaki greatcoat she was wearing a smart tailormade and the beret had been replaced by some ridiculous little bit of nonsense that gave her a gay jaunty appearance she looked gay and sparkling and bright and very lovely in that drab room i stumbled awkwardly to my feet she took both my hands in hers her eyes were looking straight into mine i felt such a surge of desperate joy that i nearly kissed her jenny i cried whatever brought you here i thought you were in scotland she let go of my hands then and sat herself on the table so i was but i got your letter and well here i am and hows my bert she asked all right thanks miss bert replied with a shy grin but whatever made you come all the way down herei asked curiosity she said laughing i wanted to find out what all this business about being arrested for mutiny was i also wanted to see you both and well i came as soon as i could but you shouldnt have come all this way jenny i said i mean youve only just got home and your father dont be silly jim she interrupted me of course i came and daddy expected me to after all the travelling ive done through europe in the last few months oban to falmouth wasnt such a very long trip now she said what is all this nonsense its not nonsense im afraid i told her bert began edging his way to the door look chum he said ill slip at an ave a chat wiv the boys in the guardroom dont be silly i said i dont know why but i didnt want him to go whats the idea bert jenny asked come and sit over here i want to hear all about this business orl right miss bert had the door open now ill be back in a jiffy but i got an idea theres some char comin up usually does abat this time bet you could do wiv a cup couldnt you and with that he went out closing the door behind him jenny suddenly laughed it was a happy carefree laugh jim she said the way berts behaving youd think he regarded us as lovers or something i i dont know i said i think he just thought wed like to talk alone for a bit she looked up at me and then looked quickly away there was a moments silence and then she said hes a pet anyway im glad youve got him for company hes such a friendly person she looked at me then hows your fiancee taken this she asked have you heard yet id told her all about betty and how shed forced me to go for a commission yes i said ive heard well she said she wasnt looking at me she was staring down at the neatly shod little foot she was swinging to and fro its finished i said finished she looked up at me incredulously yes i said she wrote to me and enclosed my ring didnt she even come to see you i shook my head i i thought for a moment when the sergeant said there was a lady to see me that well that it might be her oh jim she rested her hand lightly on my arm for a second and it was only me im sorry i looked at her then the sight of her warm friendly look made me feel suddenly happy dont be i said im so very very glad to see you it it just never occurred to me that it might be you that day when you left the ship you never looked round or waved i thought i should never see you again she offered me a cigarette and we smoked in silence for a moment then i said tell me what youve been doing since you got back oh seeing friends she replied helping daddy with his stamps doing things that needed to be done to the house and seeing about the refitting of the eilean mor the navy derequisitioned her about four months ago shes in quite good shape i had her out the other day went as far as ardmore point at the tip of mull and back now macpherson hes our old boatman has got the engine down in a few months ill have her in fine condition again she got down off the table then jim she said whos defending you at the courtmartial there will be a courtmartial wont there yes i said a fellow called captain jennings has offered to defend us hes a solicitor in private life and seems quite competent she had fallen to pacing the room you know she said its a strange thing but i met the skipper of the minesweeper that picked up captain halsey and the others it was at a party in oban as soon as he learned that i was one of the survivors of the trikkala he said thats funny i landed the skipper of the trikkala and several other members of the trikkalas crew here in oban about a week ago hed picked them up about miles northeast of the faroes i think he said it was on the th of last month i know he said it was twentyone days after the trikkala went down he was a bit puzzled at finding them in that position he says that according to reports hed had of the weather in the area through which they must have sailed it was fair with a moderate sea and the wind mainly from the north his point was that sailing from the point where the trikkala went down he would have expected them to have been in the neighbourhood of the dogger bank in a weeks sailing instead he found them northeast of the faroes after twentyone days did he question halsey about it i asked yes halseys reply was that the wind had been changeable as often as not blowing from almost due south and he believed what halsey told him she shrugged her shoulders naturally his weather reports had only been gathered from vessels he had spoken to after all halsey was hardly likely to prolong a voyage in an open boat unnecessarily what was their condition when he picked them up i asked not good she replied but better than he would have expected after twentyone days in an open boat at that time of the year she suddenly stopped pacing and looked at me her forehead puckered in a frown i cant unerstand it she said halsey promised hed pick the raft up at dawn when i thought we were the only survivors i presumed he had failed to get clear of the ship in time and that he and the others must have gone down with it but now that i know he got his boat clear in time i just cant understand why he didnt wait to pick us up its almost oh i dont know almost what i asked well she hesitated its almost as though he had some reason for not waiting in that area i know it was blowing a gale and visibility was bad its quite possible for him to have missed us but well i began remembering all your suspicions and wondering whether there was some truth in them jenny i said you were in the officers quarters on the trikkala you must have heard them conversing did anything strike you as strange not at the time of course but now ever since i got your letter to say youd been arrested she replied ive been racking my brains for any scrap of conversation that would help but im afraid ive not been very successful the relations between the various officers seemed reasonably normal the chief engineer was a detestable drunk and as far as i could see was generally ignored except by rankin the second officer cousins seemed a likeable and efficient young man hendrik was little more than the captains shadow he was dour and brusque i should say efficient too he was often in the captains cabin and it was outside that cabin that i overheard the only piece of conversation that i can remember as being at all unusual it was the afternoon we sailed i was going up on deck and i stopped to fix my greatcoat it was outside the captains cabin and i suppose the door must been ajar hendrik was just making a remark i didnt hear what he said but i heard captain halseys reply it was yes ill think up something to cover that then he gave a sharp chuckle and quoted henceforth my thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth i didnt pay much attention to it the first part might have referred to anything as for the quotation well he was always quoting shakespeare as you know you could hear him almost any time you passed the cabin she looked across at me do you think he might be a bit mental she asked no i said i didnt know what to think but i was certain halsey was not a mental case or if he was there was some sort of twisted method in his madness there was a gentle knock at the door and i saidcome in it was bert only me chum he said ere we are free mugs o the ol rosie lea he put the mugs of thick brown liquid on the table well done bert i said and handed one of the mugs to jenny im afraid it wont taste much like tea but its wet and warm jenny stayed chatting until our lunch arrived as she prepared to go i said will i see you again she shook her head no she said im catching the afternoon train to london there are things ive got to do there but ill come down for the trial and if you need me as a witness i think we probably shall i said were going to be a bit short of witnesses for the defence by the look of it thank you for promising to come for the trial it itll help a lot knowing youre there even if we cant speak to each other i hesitated jenny i said will you do something for me before you leave the camp of course she answered at once will you have a word with captain jennings tell him what you can i think hes inclined to believe my story if you spoke to him well i suddenly laughed with that ridiculous little hat youd convince him of anything she smiled is it only the hat she asked in mild disappointment no i said you look bewitching enough to bias anyone oh you want him bewitched do you well ill do my best she said goodbye then as she shut the door behind her the drab wooden walls of the room closed in on us again when i next saw jenny three weeks had passed it was outside the hut in which the courtmartial was being held she was standing amongst a little group of people some civilians others in khaki she smiled at us as we were marched in captain halsey was also there so was hendrik and jukes and evans and rankin the courtmartial was held at a camp just outside exeter it was due to start at ninethirty we left our quarters at eight in a military police threetonner one of those cumbersome trucks with a postoffice grille at the back that they use for rounding up drunks it was a glorious day the sun shone out of a blue sky and the roadside was bright with spring flowers the primroses were thick on the hedge banks and the woods were carpeted with bluebells makes yer wish you was a nipper again dont it bert said as the tyres of the threetonner hummed on the tarmac i didnt say anything i felt wretched but the sight of jenny cheered me immensely it was so wonderful to feel that someone cared about what happened to us cared enough to come all the way down from scotland she was standing next to an elderly greyhaired man with a little moustache and sharp bright eyes i guessed it to be her father she had written to say that he would be coming down with herwe were marched straight into the hut and put into a small room of our own a military police corporal remained with us as the door closed on us bert said did yer see my missis he was excited he hadnt seen her for a long time she was standin on er own by that tree no he said with a grin i reckn youd only have eyes for miss jennifer nice of er ter come down was that er father wiv er i think it must have been i said we didnt talk much after that it was like a dentists waitingroom we heard the shuffle of people going into the courtroom a sergeant came in and asked if we were the prisoners i had got accustomed to being referred to as a prisoner prisoners prisoners shun it had happened every day as the orderly officer came round to make the formal request of any complaints but now it seemed to have a special significance we were in the grip of the military legal machine we were no longer individuals we were just the days quota of prisoners to be tried by courtmartial the sergeant read from a sheet of paper number corporal james landon vardy thats you is it corporal i said yes sergeant he checked berts identity then he went out a broad shaft of spring sunlight stretched from window to floor dust specks sparkled in it every time we moved lorries lumbered by on the road outside once a tank clattered past and all the time a blackbird sang in a tree directly above the hut at last we were called give me your hats said the military policeman bareheaded we were marched into the courtroom we were told to sit facing the plain trestle table at which our judges were seated the atmosphere of the court gripped me the moment i entered it was cold impersonal a place for the weighing of facts and the facts were all against us the very impermanence of the surroundings the wooden benches the trestle tables the blackboard on the wall behind the judges the plain matchboard walls all emphasised the emergency conditions of the country the windows were closed to block out the sounds of the normal world outside the sunlight made bright patterns on faces uniforms and freshscrubbed floor the judge advocate rose and read the convening order when he had finished he turned to us do you object to being tried by either the president or any of the court you have just heard read we saidno he faced the court again and in his cold precise voice said everybody will stand uncovered whilst the oath is being administered the courtroom clattered to its feet he turned his alert eyes on the president now sir will you repeat after me the clear precise voice followed by the gruffer tones of the president patterned the hushed room with sound i swear by almighty god that i will well and truly try the accused before the court according to the evidence and i will administer justice according to the army act now in force without partiality favour or affection after the president the various officers of the court and finally the witnesses were sworn in and whilst this was going on i had an opportunity to look around facing me were the five officers who sat in judgement the president a guards officer with the crown and two pips of a colonel in the centre he had a heavy commanding face the red tabs on his lapels were bright daubs of colour against the drab khaki of his service dress his sharp eyes roved restlessly over the court he had a habit of massaging the left side of his jaw with the fingers of his left hand a gold signet ring glittered on his little finger the officers on either side of him were younger on the table in front of them lay white clean sheets of foolscap on fresh pads of pink blotting paper there were five pads and a pen and an inkpot beside each pad to the left of us was the prosecuting officer there was a pile of papers and a briefcase on the table in front of him captain jennings was on our right near him were two other officers i gathered afterwards that they were under instruction at the back of the courtroom the witnesses stood taking the oath jenny was standing next to her father she caught my eye as i turned just behind her were the four trikkala men and rankin strange every single survivor of the trikkala was gathered in this stuffy little courtroom the swearingin was finished the witnesses were ushered out the court settled in its seats think we got a chance bert whispered as we sat down god knows i answered the courtroom was full of nervous little coughs a tank rumbled by the sound of its tracks muffled like the distant tattoo of a drum the blackbirds song was a faint unreal echo of spring the judge advocate was on his feet again he had a sheet of buff paper in his hands number corporal james landon vardy raoc attached number holding company is that your correct name and description he asked me i nodded yes sir then he turned to bert number gunner herbert cook ra attached number holding company is that your correct name and description bert said yes sir the judge advocate put the paper down on the table and looked across at us you are charged with joining in a mutiny in his majestys forces his voice was cold impersonal contrary to section subsection of the army act and the particulars are that you on board the trikkala on the th march joined in a mutiny by combining among yourselves to resist and offer violence to your superior officers in the execution of their duty his eyes fixed on me corporal vardy are you guilty or not guilty not guilty i replied he turned to bert gunner cook not guilty bert answered the judge advocate went on then do you wish to apply for an adjournment on the ground that any of the rules relating to procedure before the trial have not been complied with and that you have been prejudiced thereby or that you have not had sufficient opportunity of preparing your defence before trial corporal vardy no sir gunner cook no sir then finally the proceedings opened the prosecuting officer rose and began to put his case i dont remember his speech in detail but i shall always remember his opening words he addressed the president and in a sharp vibrant voice said may it please the court the two accused are charged with joining in a mutiny which is one of the most serious offences known to military law and for which the maximum penalty is death those words the maximum penalty is death rang in my ears throughout his speech i turned to jennings trying to see in the lines of his face some flicker of hope but he sat impassive almost disinterested watching the prosecution rankin was called as first witness for the prosecution he seemed nervous his large round face was white and puffy i noticed for the first time that his dark hair was flecked with grey at the temples the gilt buttons of his navy blue uniform looked dull beside the gleaming brass of the officers ranged behind the trestle table rankins eyes flicked once in my direction there was no sign of recognition he looked at me with the cold appraisal of a man looking at some object known by a lot number that was up for auction he straightened the dark blue tie in his spotless white collar he gave his evidence in a dull voice without inflection the sort of official voice that policemen use when giving evidence my heart sank it was so coldly factual the way he said it and his facts were correct i felt there was no more to be said that all the court had to do was to decide on the length of the sentence i looked across at captain jennings he was sitting back comfortably in his chair the paper in front of him was white in the sunlight unmarked he was watching rankins face the prosecuting officer began to emphasise the points of the evidence by asking questions the president took it all down in the form of notes the prosecuting officer had a little ginger moustache and a freckled face out of which blue eyes peered as though he were in a state of perpetual surprise his voice was sharp and quick not a pleasant voice but a voice that impressed itself on the ear so that the points he made were easily remembered now he was hammering home the point that rankin had given us every opportunity to obey his orders mr rankin he said i want the court to understand this point clearly you say you ordered the corporal into the boat three times thats correct sir rankin was more assured now he even had an air of smugness as though he were enjoying his own performance and on the second occasion did you make it clear to all three soldiers that it was an order yes sir rankin turned towards the president but the corporal still insisted on taking a raft and cook said hed go with him did all three of them understand that it was a military order you were giving them yes sir that was when sills said hed get into the boat and he advised the other two to do the same to avoid trouble i told the corporal id give him one last chance i then ordered him again into the boat but he still said hed take the raft cook stayed with him i reported to the captain on the bridge was it whilst you were on the bridge that the corporal persuaded miss sorrell not to get into the boat yes sir that boat was cleared then and as you left the bridge you saw the two soldiers cutting the raft clear was that when captain halsey ordered you to stop them cutting the raft clear yes sir the order was given to myself and mr hendrik the first mate why did you think they were cutting the raft clear the corporal had said he intended taking a raft rankin answered i presumed they were clearing it for their own use what did the corporal do then he ordered mr hendrik and myself to stand back he unslung his rifle and held it at the ready the prosecuting officer leaned forward i want you to be very careful on this point was the rifle cocked yes rankin answered i distinctly saw the corporal work the bolt of his rifle there was a little murmur in the courtroom the president of the court looked up and then made a note rankin smiled he reminded me of a fat white cat that has just found the cream the swine was enjoying himself the prosecuting officer nodded in a satisfied way thank you he said that is all the judge advocate looked across at captain jennings captain jennings do you desire to crossexamine he asked jennings rose to his feet he had a rather bored offhand manner we had talked it all over with him he was going to try to show that we had no confidence in rankin but in the face of that evidence i felt he had been given an impossible task his manner almost suggested that he felt it too there are just one or two points he said in a mild rather tired voice then as the president nodded his permission he turned to rankin mr rankin you were in charge of this guard thats right sir did you do guard duties yourself no sir its not customary for a warrant officer in the royal navy to do guard duties bert nudged me i could almost hear him imitating rankins voice quite so jennings agreed but this was an unusually small guard that made no difference as far as you were concerned no sir i see but naturally you slept with the cargo you were guarding and were there most of the time no sir rankins hands fluttered up to his tie they were very white against the dark blue of his uniform they looked soft and wellcared for like a womans the captain gave me a cabin i messed with the ships officers oh jennings voice was mildly surprised you didnt think that your duties were such as to necessitate your being with the cargo a cargo which had been described to you on your own statement as a special cargo no sir rankin answered jennings was clearly not pressing the point the corporal was there i had given him written orders and i inspected the guard regularly how regularly the question was put mildly almost without interest well at different times of the day sir so they wouldnt get slack and then suddenly jennings voice became sharp precise how many times a day well sir i dont know exactlysudden nervousness had crept into rankins voice jennings seemed to relax well just roughly he encouraged the witness about ten or twelve times a day or more often i dont remember rankin answered woodenly would it be right to say that you did not visit the guard more than four times from the moment the trikkala sailed until she was sunk jennings asked rankin saw the trap opening before his eyes i couldnt say sir he replied then jennings struck he leaned forward you couldnt say he repeated in a tone of amazement and then with damning emphasis you mean you dont want to say i suggest that you took a very light view of your duties he turned to the court i shall later bring a witness to show that mr rankin spent most of his time playing cards and drinking and that on two occasions two occasions in just over fortyeight hours he was drunk jennings took off his glasses polishing them abstractedly the slight stoop of his tall rather scholarly figure seemed more pronounced than ever he put his glasses on again and looked at the witness now he said and his voice was quite mild again i am going to put a question to you and i want you to answer it very carefully did you know what it was that you were guarding you had been told i understand that it was a special cargo but did you know what it actually was no sir rankin had recovered himself but his little eyes looked at his questioner warily like a hedgehog wondering whether to curl up not at the beginning he added quickly later i found gunner cook in the presence of the corporal had prised open one of the cases and that was when you realised that it was silver bullion yes sir and what special precautions did you take when you discovered the nature of your charge rankins tongue flicked across his lips i i told the corporal to ensure that his guard his guard captain jennings voice was sharp again surely you mean your guard he turned to the court again later i am going to show that all the warrant officer did on discovering that he was responsible for a huge quantity of silver bullion was to go to the chief engineers cabin and get drunk over a game of cards at that the prosecuting officer jumped to his feet sir he said addressing the president i object mr rankin is giving evidence the president stroked the left side of his cheek the gold of the signet ring flashed in the sunshine he glanced at the judge advocate who said i agree jennings hurried on i am trying to show the background to this affair to show the court that the two accused had no confidence in their superior officer and felt themselves justified therefore in taking the action they did i he turned to rankin the warrant officers face was white as white as the spotless collar he wore his eyes were restless as though they were scared of meeting the gaze of any of those present mr rankin jennings continued leaning forward with both hands on the table top i suggest that knowing you were guarding a very valuable cargo of bullion you still considered that the corporal should bear full responsibility for the task you had been given he had full instructions for his guard sir i see jennings looked down at some notes he had uncovered now mrrankin we come to the night of the sinking the trikkala was struck i understand at hours on th march did corporal vardy come to you at about hours on th march to report that number two boat was unseaworthy rankin hesitated yes sir and then hurriedly he came to me with some story about loose planks sills the third member of the guard had apparently got into the boat for shelter i told him that sills had no right in the just a minute jennings interrupted him what were you doing when the corporal made this report to you i was playing cards sir anything else i dont follow sir rankin was nervous again what i am trying to discover jennings said is whether you had been drinking well me and the chief wed had one or two sir but we werent you werent drunk is what you were going to say i suppose jennings put in and he added quietly the person concerned is not always the best judge of that well wed only he was interrupted again by we you mean you and the chief engineer yes sir were you often with the chief engineer we got on well sir and we both liked cards and drink eh jennings was wiping his glasses again and peering at him through shortsighted eyes then he put on his glasses and turned to the court sir i should like to say that i shall be calling another witness miss sorrel a passenger on the trikkala to show that the chief engineer was known as a drunk among his fellow officers and in fact was the cause of miss sorrel requesting that her meals be served in her cabin then to rankin now back to the matter of the boats he said brusquely what action did you take on the corporals report i didnt take it very seriously rankin answered but he was unsure of himself the corporal was hardly likely to know as much about boats as the ships officers he hurried on the chief told me they were inspected regularly however i said id have a look at the boat in the morning when it was light did the chief tell you that mr hendrik the first mate had been working on the boats with one of the seamen whilst the trikkala was in murmansk i believe he did rankins voice sounded surprised jennings nodded i shall refer to that point with another witness he told the court then to rankin you didnt think it worth while reporting this matter to the captain right away no sir do you remember corporal vardy saying hed been sailing all his life and knew as much about small craft as any man on the ship he said something of the kind but you still did not think it worth while investigating his report at once rankin was twisting one of the buttons of his jacket it was dark he said but you had a torch jennings was leaning forward again i suggest that you were too blind to your responsibilities to pause in your card playing and your drinking had you taken your duties less lightly it is possible that the lives of a dozen men perhaps more might have been saved and your corporal might have retained some vestige of confidence in you he gave a quick nod that is all he sat down rankin was told he could stand down he manoeuvred his big body awkwardly through the huddle of seats to the door he was like a whipped cur he did not know where to look his eyes trying desperately to avoid everyones gaze he passed quite close to me and i swear he was trembling certainly his broad white forehead glistened with sweat i saw it shine in a patch of sunlight i got the impression that he was scared i looked at jennings his long face with the rather aquiline nose was bent over the table as he glanced through some notes he had a confident air we were lucky to have got such a good defending officer he knew his stuff and he knew how to crossexamine the way he had handled rankin had impressed the whole courtroom i sensed a stir of excitement all round me bert nudged me and surreptitiously raised a thumb his brown eyes gleamed and he was grinning for the first time since we had been arrested i felt we had a chance chapter five dartmoor prison all that morning the court sat i thought the case would never end as witness after witness was called by the prosecution halsey hendrik jukes my mind was in a daze i remember the details of rankins crossexamination because i disliked him personally and i was excited and therefore more receptive by jennings handling of him of the other witnesses for the prosecution i only remember the highlights of their crossexamination this chiefly because it did little to help our case though jennings worked hard enough he was endeavouring to build up something that was essentially insubstantial whereas the prosecution dealt in fact all the time and as the evidence of each fresh witness corroborated previous evidence for the prosecution i felt our chances fading halsey for instance jennings made little impression on the stocky bearded captain the man was solid as a rock immovable and his personality dominated that dreary courtroom his little black eyes darted from officer to officer not uncertainly and restlessly like rankins but meeting each fresh gaze with sharp aggressive mien he had the confidence of a man accustomed to command that confidence impressed itself on everyone even i think on jennings i remember jennings tried to make a point out of the fact that halsey had heard from rankin that i had discovered loose planks in number two boat before he gave the order to stop me from having the raft cut adrift captain halsey jennings said would you tell the court why you did not want that raft cleared halseys black eyes looked sharply at his questioner certainly he said and then he turned and addressed his reply to the court in an emergency there can only be one man in charge of an operation otherwise all is confusion you as experienced officers will appreciate that his voice was mild but forceful those rafts were for use in emergencies i needed them in reserve in case one of other of the boats was dashed to pieces but at this particular time surely both boats had been cleared jennings said they were both in the water halsey replied but not necessarily clear of the ship i see jennings looked down at his notes number two boat had just been launched thats correct isnt it yes now supposing you had been informed that it was not seaworthy would that have affected your action halsey met jennings gaze across the courtroom there was no question of that he said one of my officers inspected the boats daily usually mr hendrik quite jennings said in a soothing voice but i am asking you for your opinion if you had suddenly heard that number two boat was not seaworthy wouldnt you have encouraged rather than tried to prevent cook and vardy clearing that raft i cannot reply to that halsey replied shortly actions in an emergency are taken on the spot it is impossible to say what one would or would not have done had the circumstances been different i could see jennings was a little nettled by halseys obstinacy on this point but he persisted captain halsey i put it to you that had you been aware of the state of that boat as vardy and cook were or thought they were you would have encouraged them to cut the raft clear in an endeavour to break the captains confidence jennings said perhaps your reluctance to express an opinion which would have been helpful to the prisoners case arises out of the fact that at the time you ordered them to stop cutting the raft clear you did know that the boat was unseaworthy when you were informed by warrant officer rankin that the prisoners had refused to enter the boat you told him to report to the bridge correct yes captain halseys black eyes watched his questioner warily what reason did he give for their refusal was the next question halsey did not hesitate he said they thought it was unseaworthy he replied the members of the court exchanged glances but you paid no attention to that jennings went on no halsey answered a lot of men not accustomed to the sea get panicky when told to get into the boats you must remember there was a gale blowing and a fairly big sea running did the warrant officer say whether he believed what the corporal had told him i did not inquire did he tell you they preferred a raft i believe so jennings leaned forward did you stop to consider that if those boys were afraid to embark in a boat it was strange that they should be willing to take a raft surely that must have struck you as strange i didnt consider it halsey glanced at the court you must remember he said and his voice was quiet and reasonable that the ship was settling and i had a lot on my mind i had no time to worry about two men who were getting panicky i told the warrant officer that boat or raft he was to get them off the ship jennings left it at that to halsey we were just a couple of soldiers who were getting panicky his view was impressing itself on the court he was after all the master of the trikkala he had appealed to the court as experienced officers and they could understand his point of view jennings asked him why he had taken rankin in his boat and made miss sorrel go in the raft again his answer was reasonable it was her choice not mine there were things to be done before i could leave the ship i saw no reason to endanger her life by having her wait for me i knew she would be perfectly safe on the raft though perhaps not very comfortable i expected to be able to pick her up in the morning when it was light as regards rankin he pointed out that as he was a naval warrant officer he had no hesitation in having him wait on board jennings then asked him why it was that he had failed to pick miss sorrel up in the morning its hard to say halsey replied some freak of the gale maybe we were being driven in a northerly direction for a time i believe the raft was being blown in a southeasterly direction that happens sometimes also visibility that morning was bad we could have been within a mile or two of the raft and not seen either it or the corvette that picked it up i have reports here from the admiralty jennings went on that suggest that the wind to the south of the barents sea between the time you took to your boat and the time you were picked up off the faroes three weeks later was mainly northerly this would suggest that by using your sails you could have been in the neighbourhood of the dogger bank within a week of the trikkala being sunk halsey shrugged his shoulders whatever the admiralty may say about the winds at that time all i can say is that we experienced varied winds at one time we were as far south as latitude and then we were blown as far north as the seventies you are surely not suggesting that we enjoyed staying in an open boat half frozen and with insufficient food i saw that the president of the court was no longer taking notes once or twice he looked at his watch he was getting restive jennings put a question about the chief engineer warrant officer rankin spent a lot of time in his cabin playing cards would you describe your chief engineer as a drunk halsey replied a lot of sailors drink all i can say is that he was an efficient officer and he muttered god rest his soul that was the first time in the course of the evidence that i knew that halsey was lying but lying to save the reputation of a dead officer if jennings had proved that point it would not have helped us i have only two more questions jennings said at about midnight on the first day out you were on the bridge with your first officer mr hendrik hendrik said it would be dirty the following day do you remember what you replied no halsey answered conversations about the weather occur too frequently on board a ship for one to remember them i will refresh your memory then you said it suits us would you explain why dirty weather suited you halsey leaned a little forward i dont understand the point of this question one of the prisoners i suppose has been listening with too much interest to conversations which have nothing to do with him however i can answer your question easily enough the russian convoy route passes a little too close for comfort to the northern tip of norway where germany has bases dirty weather is quite a good protection again uboat attacks you said well make it tomorrow night jennings went on and you then asked mr hendrik whether he had switched the watches so that jukes was at the wheel between two and four it was between those times and on that night that the trikkala was mined the suggestion behind your question is offensive sir halsey said sharply he turned to the court have i got to explain every scrap of conversation overheard by people who could not understand what i was talking about the watches were switched because we were shorthanded my remark about making it the next night referred if i remember rightly to the necessity for switching over duties so that the men would not be unduly taxed i am merely trying to show the effect of a scrap of conversation upon the mind of corporal vardy knowing that he was in charge of a very important cargo jennings pointed out i have one other point i would like cleared up and let me say in advance that this conversation was overheard by miss sorrel and not by either of the prisoners shortly after you sailed from murmansk captain halsey you said to mr hendrik ill think up some reason to cover that what did you mean by that i cant say i remember the conversation halsey replied but if that is what i said i was no doubt referring to some stores wed wangled from a naval vessel and he gave a slight chuckle the court also chuckled they understood the point immediately afterwards jennings continued you quoted a passage from shakespeare from hamlet you said henceforth my thoughts be bloody or be nothing worth why i often quote shakespeare halsey replied shortly two little spots of colour appearing in his sallow cheeks so i understand jennings answered quickly i am also given to understand that you choose your characters to fit your mood that morning you were hamlet and hamlet in a mood contemplating violent action and that i submit is an important point when you consider that had you known about the loose planks in number two boat a lot of lives might have been saved one more question jennings hurried on before halsey could protest were you by any chance the owner and master of a ship called the penang in the china sea before the war it was then that halseys black eyes flashed with unmistakable anger anger and something else that something else i realised later was fear but i didnt know him so well then as i came to know him later and whilst halsey hesitated uncertainly the prosecuting officer came belatedly to his rescue i protest he cried these questions have no bearing on the case i agree the judge advocate said i will show that they have later was jennings reply and he sat down with hendrik who was the prosecutions next witness jennings had more success he questioned him about the same scraps of conversation hendrik with his shifty eyes and white scar was not the type of man to impress the court but he was not easily put out and though his replies differed from his captains the difference was not great and then jennings sprang on him the question about the penang and the scar became a livid streak in his ashen face is it true jennings rapped out that in the china sea the penang had a reputation for being in the neighbourhood of several ships that sank with the loss of all hands whilst hendrik was still searching confusedy for an answer and before anyone had time to protest he said i understand mr hendrik that you were working on number two boat with one of the crew whilst the trikkala was in murmansk what was the work that had to be done to the boat on the captains instructions i was carrying out a general overhaul of all boats was the answer there was nothing definite that needed repairing no just a general overhaul who was the member of the crew who was working with you jukes sir that was all he asked hendrik the next witness was jukes as soon as jennings came to crossexamine him he said you worked on the boats with mr hendrik whilst you were in murmansk didnt you thats right jukes replied was your watch switched so that you were at the wheel at the time the explosion took place yes jukes said but he was beginning to look worried then jennings suddenly leaned towards him were you a member of the crew of the penang by any chance there was no doubt about it this time jukes was scared he was the type of man that is scared in any court of law his broken nose tough features with missing ear lobe were not calculated to impress a court he was clearly a man who gravitated by nature to the shadier quarters of the ports he shipped in and out of he had not expected to be questioned about the penang and he was frightened but jennings had made his point he had too little to go on to press it home he let it go at that evans was never calledthe case for the prosecution being closed jennings opened for the defence after a short speech he had me give evidence on oath under his guidance i took the court through the whole story of those two days from my point of view i kept nothing back i told of my suspicions my growing sense of uneasiness what the cook had told me of the penang how i had actually felt the looseness of the planks of that boat here the judge advocate interrupted me to ask whether it was dark and if i had inspected them with a torch when i had finished jennings called bert to corroborate my story and finally he called jenny to show that my attitude to embarking in the boat had been so strong that she had felt convinced that a raft was safer that concluded the case for the defence there followed the final speeches of defence and prosecution and then the judge advocate gave his summing up finally at twelvefifteen the court was closed for consideration of the finding the only people who were allowed to remain in the courtroom whilst this was happening were the two officers under instruction back in the little waitingroom bert rubbed his hands together and grinned at me cor i wouldntve missed that for anyfink did yer see their faces each time capting jennings mentioned the penang bet yer it was piracy they was up ter and miss jennifer she impressed em i nodded it had been exciting whilst jennings had been crossexamining the witnesses for the prosecution but all i could think of was the cold factual summing up of the judge advocate and now back in this dreary waitingroom with the military policeman at the door all elation was stripped from me jennings had done his best hed tried to show the state of suspicion and uneasiness that had prompted our actions but this wasnt a civil court there was no jury to impress the men who were sitting in judgment on us were army officers concerned primarily with the maintenance of discipline in a civilian army at the end of a long war and against our frail case was the solid factual statements of witnesses reporting what had actually occurred jennings had warned us not to expect an acquittal and now that the case had been presented and we were out of the courtroom i realised how thin were our chances come on mate ave a fag bert said in a chirpy voice you look as though we was hincarcerated in the beastly glassase already i know the ruddy prosecution didnt mince is words in is final speech an the summing up of that judge advycate bloke that wont ave elped us much oh it was fair enough i said well i reckon we got a chance see jennings made rankin look pretty cheap wot dyou fink he was holding a packet of cigarettes out i took one i didnt want to damp his cheerfulness so i said nothing oh well he said maybe theyll ave ter find us guilty fer the sake of appearances but i reckn the sentencesil be light well i said we wont know what the sentences are for some time if were found not guilty they tell us right away but if were guilty were not told anything now we smoked in silence for a moment then the door opened and jenny and her father came in with them was berts missis i dont know what we talked about anything but the trial jennys father was a gentlevoiced man with bright twinkling blue eyes and white hair he was a scot he had great charm though they were not in the least like each other physically he and jenny had much in common the same trick of looking constantly surprised with the world the same easy almost childish delight in things the same soft musical voice but where her fathers enthusiasm for life merely twinkled hers sparkled gaily they were an odd contrast to mrs bert who was a solidly built angular woman with a rollicking sense of humour that shook the walls of that woodlined room she might have been a barmaid or kept a winkle stall in her youth but now there was only the faintest trace of the buxom cockney beauty she had once been she was worn with work and cares but beneath the wrinkled skin and faded clothes was a warmth that did me good it was the warmth of a friendly nature that seemed to expect the worst from a hard world accepted it and triumphed over it so that you felt in her that flood of goodneighbourliness that is the spring of happiness time passed slowly conversation was not easy it was like waiting for a train to go out at a quarter to one our visitors were ushered out and we were marched back into the courtroom nothing seemed to have changed everyone was seated in the same places but there was a subtle difference and the difference was in the attitude of the five officers of the court their faces were no longer receptive they had made up their minds their eyes watched impersonally as the courtroom settled itself i suspect they were impatient for their lunch no doubt there were more cases to be dealt with and ours had taken longer than they expected i felt a chill void inside me as we were ordered to stand to hear the sentence of the court tobacco smoke drifted in a splash of sunlight they had relaxed smoking whilst deciding our fate the voice of the president was cold and impersonal as he addressed us the court has no announcement to make the signet ring flashed in the sunlight as he massaged his jaw the findings of the court being subject to confirmation will be promulgated in due course the courtroom stirred restlessly i felt cold and numb as though nothing could hurt me any more the judge advocate turned to the prosecuting officer and asked have you any statement to make with regard to the accused the prosecuting officer produced our army records jennings made a speech of mitigation stressing our excellent record and the fact that our actions had been prompted by good intentions once again the court was closed this time for consideration of sentence ten minutes later we were taken in again this time we were told the sentence of the court being subject for confirmation will be promulgated later and then the president glanced round the room and therefore the proceedings now in open court are accordingly terminated a buzz of conversation swept through the room chairs scraped i found myself being marched out i remember a brief glimpse of jenny smiling brightly and then we were behind the wire cage of the threetonner and roaring back along the road we had come two weeks later the sentences were promulgated i shall never forget the shock i experienced when i stood before the camp commandant and heard him say corporal vardy at your trial which took place at exeter on th april when you were charged with mutiny you were found guilty and sentenced to be discharged the service with ignominy and to serve four years penal servitude that sentence has been confirmed by the confirming authority and findings and sentence are accordingly promulgated bert got three years i dont think we really believed our ears for the moment it took time for the harsh reality of it to sink in but during the evening we went through a process of mental readjustment which was frighteningly humiliating we had to accustom ourselves to the idea that we should be cut off from the world as we knew it for three and four years it seemed like eternity next morning we were packed into the same threetonner with the wirecaged back and driven off where dyer reckon well serve our time bert asked all the cheerfulness had been beaten out of him god knows i said we skirted plymouth and drove inland through yelverton we turned right there and began climbing it was sunny with cotton wool clouds and the plain below us a patchwork of cloud and sun the earth looked warm and glowing a tor with an rdf mast on the top of it appeared away to our left as we sat looking down the winding road to the flat country of the tamar and suddenly an awful fear gripped me for i knew where i was i knew this part of the country several times i had stayed with a friend of mine at his familys place at dartmeet this was the moor and the road we were on led to princetown i had heard some talk about longterm military prisoners being imprisoned there i hadnt thought much about it but now that rumour gripped at me like a stomach ulcer i looked at bert blissfully unconscious of his whereabouts he caught my eye and grinned wanly turned at nice again aint it he said then he shook his head the kidsd like this sort of country dyer know they aint never seen the country bin in ruddy islington all their lives the eldest is only four the missus was kind o lonely an i reckond id soon be going overseas thats why we started raisin a family poor little chaps all they seen o the world is bombs an rubble an dirty tenements they aint never seen street lights after dark nor eaten bananas but the eldest already e knows the difference between a spitfire and a p can tell a bomb from a vl an knows the barrage balloons by is own pet names an now when the stupid wars nearly over an i reckoned ter be able ter show em the sea an a spot o country like this on me demobilisation leave this appens its just dammable he added savagely i put my hand on his shoulder there was nothing i could say thank god i had no family but i felt id let him down i ought not to have acted so hastily i ought i to have thought of the consequences and yet if wed obeyed rankin we should have got into that boat and we should not have been alive now i thought then what irony of fate it was that rankin who had brought the charges against us owed his life to me he too would have been in that boat if i hadnt refused to obey his orders the truck had reached the top of the long climb out of the plain we were in the moors now and all about us were fireblackened hills here and there patches of gorse that had escaped the flames blazed golden in the sunlight the road snaked out behind our humming wheels curving like a white ribbon over the shoulder of a rockcrested tor behind the tor the sky was dark with smoke away to our left the moors rolled endlessly to the skyline and everywhere smoke curled up from the warm peaty earth in a valley close below the road men with flaming brands were setting fire to grass and gorse the flames crackling merrily in a great curve that the wind had made they were burning the moors over to improve the grazing swaling they call it they do it every spring they were not supposed to do it during the war because of the blackout but they did it all the same beating the flames out at night we picked up the railway and a few minutes later drove into princetown i waited with my heart in my mouth if we turned left in the market square the truck slowed and then turned i suddenly felt frightened to suspect the worst is one thing to see your suspicions confirmed is another this meant solitary cells and the coldest dampest most horrible prison in the whole of britain cold little stone houses bristled at the road edge they were warders houses then a high bleak wall beat back the sound of our engine the truck stopped and the horn was blown voices and then the heavy sound of bolts being withdrawn i looked quickly at bert surprising a dumb hurt look in his eyes as he stared with horror at that blank wall i looked away a voice called out okay the truck ground forward in bottom gear and bumped noisily between great ironstudded gates that had been thrown back as we went down the slope into the prison the gap in the wall through which we had entered closed on us as the two great doors were swung to and bolted the truck stopped our escort came and unlocked the wire cage there was a warder with him come on you two out you get the warder ordered and then added automatically come on look sharp now bert and i jumped out we were in a kind of v formed by two of the many wings of the prison the wings were ugly rectangular blocks built of solid granite from the nearby quarries the roofs were of grey slate rising to a shallow crest each prison block was punctured by rows of neat little barred squares cell windows rows and rows of them like square portholes in grim ageold prison hulks a round brick chimney dominated the prison belching smoke in the sunlight bert looked about him dismayed and awed by those sombre granite blocks he turned to the warder his voice sounded husky as he said whats the place mate the warder grinned for goodness sake where are we bert repeated dartmoor the warder answered it took a moment for this to sink in the warder didnt hustle us bert gazed about him an expression of surprise and horror on his face then he turned to the warder again come orf it chum youre kiddin thats the place they used ter send the ol lags to the ones wot were sentenced ter long stretches he turned quickly on me es kiddin aint e jim no bert i said this is dartmoor all right ive often seen it from the outside i dartmoor berts tone was one of utter disgust blimey give me the merry glassase any day come on stop that talking the warder bawled out with sudden impatience then he marched us away out of the sunlit compound between the granite blocks into the cold dark interior of the prison with its clanging doors and the sound of ironshod boots ringing hollow on stonefloored passages we were inspected interviewed docketed clothed and finally marched to our cells as the iron door clanged shut and i was alone i realised at last that we had been absorbed into the souldestroying machinery of the prison the walls closed in on me the ceiling clamped down on my head the barred square of light that was the window seemed to recede until it was barely wide enough to put my hand through a sudden panic seized me i felt crushed by the smallness of that rectangular cubicle six paces long four wide steel bars at the door steel bars at the window pencil scribbles on the walls initials and dates cut deep into the stone the dingy carbolic cleanliness of it clamped down against my brain so that i wanted to scream and ahead of me streamed the years i was to spend there four years say just over three if i got full remission for good conduct one thousand one hundred and twentysix days no i should still be here in and was a leap year one thousand one hundred and twentyseven twentyseven thousand and twentyfour hours one million six hundred and twentyone thousand four hundred and forty minutes and i had calculated all that in a minute just one minute and more than a million and a half minutes to go i suddenly felt i wanted to scream footsteps sounded in the empty corridor keys jangled i sat down on the bed i must get a grip on myself then somebody began tapping on the wall i replied thank god for my basic training i knew morse and realised suddenly that even in the confines of my cell i was not alone i could talk the jail telegraph was morse the message tapped on the wall above my bed was passed on from bert and told me that he was in the next cell but one the knowledge that bert was there even if i couldnt see him or talk to him was a great comfort to me i am not going to dwell on the time i spent in dartmoor it is only an interlude in the story and has no real bearing on what happened later save that it toughened me mentally and physically i doubt whether without that period in dartmoor i should ever have had the guts or desperation to do what i eventually did it was sheer desperation that drove me to maddons rock on one of the wildest sea enterprises it is possible to conjure up even in a dream it was dartmoor the damp grim granite awfulness of dartmoor that gave me the courage now as i look back on the year i spent in that wretched prison it seems like some frightful nightmare so faded and veiled are its memories by more recent happenings the dread of solitude however has never really left me i hated that cell with a bitter loathing it crowded in on me it symbolised my isolation from the rest of the world it was the thing above all that seemed bent on destroying me utterly crushing my spirit and warping my brain to madness i have always had a tendencey to claustrophobia a dread of being alone in small enclosed spaces and a morbid curiosity in any cave or shaft that took me into the bowels of the earth the result was that i was happiest sweating my guts out in that damned quarry which had provided the stone to build the prison or labouring on the prison farm i didnt mind the cleaning the discipline the work so long as i was in the company of other human beings even now i cannot read accounts of men who suffered solitary confinement in german concentration camps without feeling panic seizing at me i think if that had happened to me i should have gone mad but as long as i had plenty of hard work during the day and a book to read at night i managed to stave off the feeling of loneliness that i dreaded more than anything else there were about three hundred military prisoners in dartmoor at the time of these only about a third were in for military crimes for which they had been sentenced like bert and myself by courtmartial the rest were soldiers who had committed civil offences for which they had been tried and sentenced by civilian courts their crimes covered the whole gamut of civil offences assault theft arson burglary manslaughter looting some of them were pretty tough hardbitten diehard criminals from londons east end sly characters from the racecourses tough little men from the gorbals district of glasgow men to whom razors came more readily to their hands than a rifle men without any social conscience bullies liars cheats habitual criminals murderers men with minds so warped by their upbringing that they took it for granted that the world and everyone they met in it was against them all the riffraff hooliganism abnormality that the army had swept up in the maw of conscription and had been unable to digest and a few like bert and myself who seemed to have landed up there by mistake ill never have a better schooling in world misfits than i had there sometimes it made me hate my own kind i was so disgusted and sometimes i wanted to burst into tears at some example of kindliness exhibited by a man who looked tough enough to kick his best friend to death if he should so much as trip over a curb and be temporarily at his mercy all the time i was in dartmoor i never really ceased to be conscious of the grim history of the place you couldnt escape it there were initials everywhere jbn july i always remember that it was deeply etched into the wall above my bed i often wondered about jbn for i had been born on the day he entered dartmoor and by the time he was out i was a boy of fourteen the cells the prison yards the workshops the kitchens the laundry everywhere the ghosts of these men who had been forced to live out long stretches of their life in this place clung to walls and tables and benches in the form of initials and dates but these ghosts of the past were not obtrusive they were too numerous the walls had seen too much misery and wretchedness and hopelessness to retain any impression of individual cases only there was a general atmosphere of wretchedness imprisoned in those dampstreaming walls its a strange irony that this prison which had been built for french and american prisoners of war at the beginning of the nineteenth century and had been a horrible home office ashcan for the countrys human refuse for almost a century should now hold british soldiers but we werent the only occupants of dartmoor ours was a world apart an almost military world with prison discipline but there was another world within those walls the world of borstal why the authorities turned over part of this most disreputable of all our prisons to be a home for borstal boys god knows but they did and the boys shared the moor with us it was not an easy marriage their world was a softer pleasanter world than ours they were divided into houses like a school they were allowed a number of little privileges which made our own lot harder to bear and the easier discipline gave rise to riotous outbreaks for which there was no cure for these boys were only boys in the eyes of the authorities their ages were anything up to twentythree or so and many of them were hardened criminals all these impressions came slowly at first i was too dazed and too absorbed in the task of adjusting myself to the life to absorb much of the atmosphere but gradually i came to take the background for granted and then when i had time to think and take stock that was when i began to feel frightened but i got over it i established a routine for myself so that i would never have time to think i always made certain i had something to busy myself with in the evenings in my cell i caught up with the days and kept a calendar but i never allowed myself to think of the months stretching endlessly ahead of me i tried not to think of what had brought me here to kick against the pricks and to count the days to release that would bring no satisfaction i no longer tried to sort out the mystery of whether there really had been something wrong with the trikkalas boats or what captain halsey had been up to during the twentyone days he had been sailing in an open boat in the barents sea i accepted it all and that way got some peace of mind i tried not to think about myself at all but abstract things geography history crossword puzzles anything but myself i wrote to my family to tell them where i was it was not an easy letter to write i knew how hard they would be hit by the news that their son was in dartmoor but after that my correspondence with them was easier for it became entirely impersonal but letters to jenny were more difficult we fell into a regular correspondence and whilst i looked forward with the excitement of a school kid to a letter from her keeping it in my pocket unopened for days trying to make it bridge the gap to the next they were a weakness in the armour of acceptance and indifference i was building to my condition for she wrote to me of the highlands of hunting of sailing in the lochs she sent me plans of the eilean mor took me all through her reconditioning almost plank by plank it was hard because she wrote of things i loved which were out of my reach but her letters were a real contact with the outside world they were my one form of dissipation in the routine of forgetfulness that i had planned they made me think of the future of what i should do at the end of my three years they made me unhappy and yet i loved them as the one bright thing to look forward to from day to day so the spring warmed into summer ve day came and went then vj day the leaves turned on the trees behind the church and blew in gay clusters around our marching feet as we turned in at the prison gates then winter clamped down hard and black the moors became thick with mists in november a drift of powdery snow stung our faces on an early parade the walls of our cells streamed with damp our clothes never seemed dry the moors so pleasant to summer visitors stopping for tea in their cars became a mysterious frightening void the mists closed down on the prison for days at a time so that the great rocky battlements of the surrounding tors were seen as dim glimpses through fleeting gaps in the murk all this time bert and i were in constant contact messages passed back and forth between us through the intermediary of a burglar who occupied the cell between us this burglar had been on the moor before he was a hardened criminal a mixture of scot and irish with a small bullet head and a wicked temper he had been in reme till he burgled the till of a naafi canteen in a big military camp near carlisle he was always planning escape he never did anything about it but hed work it out to the last detail and then pass it on to bert and myself it was his way of passing the time he might just as well have done crossword puzzles sometimes bert and i managed to talk to each other i remember one day he was in a great state of excitement we were in the same work party and he kept on catching my eye his face all agrin as we fell in to march back to the cells he pushed his way alongside and whispered i seen the dentist mate theyre goin ter give me me denchers i looked at him quickly id got so used to him without them that i couldnt visualise him with teeth the screw in charge of the party told us to stop talking then one day about a month later i met bert on our cell landing while on the way to empty some slops and barely recognised him the wizened little monkey face was gone his mouth was full of teeth they grinned at me like horses teeth it was as though he had filled his mouth with some white pebbles and was afraid of swallowing them it made him look grotesquely young id never thought about his age before but now i realised suddenly that he could not be more than thirtyfive the teeth moved up and down as he spoke however i think i got used to them quicker than he did scotty our burglar chum spent hours relaying to me berts comments on those teeth bert came in for a lot of chaff but he gave as good as he got he was popular with everybody with or without his teeth he continued to grin and crack jokes christmas came and the snow began to pile up on the moors for a week in january we seemed to do nothing but clear the snow shovelling a way through the drifts to keep the roads open huming snowploughs thats all we is bert grumbled but i enjoyed those days out in the snow it was warm working and if we made good progress discipline was relaxed and we were able to talk and sing then suddenly the snow was gone and the moors glowed a warm golden brown in crisp sunshine life began to stir even on those bleak hills an occasional bird began to sing the men became restive they smashed up their cells fights became more frequent the borstal boys started organised rioting i was infected by the general spring malaise the limitations of my cell began to irk me more and more i wanted to smash it up but i was scared scared of chokey i couldnt face solitary confinement i had fits of terrible depression violent longings to get out and walk in freedom across the moors i found my thoughts becoming dominated by memories of shady walks in summer woods meadows of buttercups beside a river and the sparkle of water in sunlight as my sailing dinghy trod the wavelets in cornish estuaries and all these longings began to focus on jenny i started counting the days to each letter getting miserable and angry when they were late or what i chose to consider as late i found myself upbraiding her in my letters and then tearing them up and then one day i woke up to the realisation that i had fallen in love with her i cursed myself for a fool i was a prisoner in dartmoor disowned by my fiancee a failure to my parents what future could i possibly have what could i possibly offer her in a fiendish debauch of mental masochism i didnt write to her for three weeks so that she wrote to me asking why i hadnt written was i sick should she come down and see me i hated myself then hated myself even more when i wrote a dull impersonal letter in reply and then suddenly the world changed and my cloak of misery and frustration fell away from me in the eager burst of enthusiasm with which i concentrated all my thoughts on one single idea it happened this way i got hold of papers whenever i could one of the screws a jailer named sandy was a decent sort and used to slip me one now and then i read them avidly they gave me great satisfaction it was an impersonal contact with the outside world they produced the illusory feeling that i was sitting by my own fireside on the th of march it was th march i managed to see a copy of the previous days issue of one of the london dailies i was glancing through it with the pleasant absorption that went with the illusion that i was part of the world about which i was reading when my eye was caught by the single word trikkala it was the second head to a downcolumn story on the front page it was quite short a paragraph or two but it started my brain racing with a thousand halfdigested thoughts and suspicions i tore the story out and the worn fragment of newsprint lies on my desk as i write this is what it said first postwar underwater treasure hunt trikkalas master to salvage bullion newcastle tuesday captain theodore halsey master of the kelt steamship companys ton freighter trikkala at the time she was sunk plans to salvage the halfmillion pounds worth of silver bullion that went down with the ship some miles north west of tromso he and several other survivors of the trikkala have pooled their resources to form a limited company called trikkala recovery they have purchased an exadmiralty tug and are equipping it in a tyneside dockyard with all the latest deepsea diving equipment it is already fitted with asdic which will be used to locate the wreck when i met captain halsey on the bridge of the tug which has been christened the tempest he said im glad youve come along today for it is exactly a year now since the trikkala was mined and sunk captain halsey is short and stocky with a neat black beard and sharp restless eyes his movements are quick and decisive his manner is confident i dont think there is any secret now in the fact that the trikkala carried a valuable cargo of silver bullion i intend to lift that bullion i know where she went down it happens to be in an area where the depth is reduced by a wide shelf of rock i believe she lies on that shelf if i am right then i am convinced that with the help of the improvements in diving equipment and methods achieved during the war we shall be able to raise the bullion he described the expedition as the first postwar underwater treasure hunt he introduced me to his officers both trikkala survivors pat hendrik a scot had been first officer he looked tough and competent lionel rankin had just come out of the navy after fourteen years he was a warrant officer two other trikkala survivors are among the crew all are in the syndicate we feel that those who had the misfortune to be on board the trikkala when she was hit and who survived a three weeks voyage in an open boat in winter should be the ones to claim salvage on the recovery of the bullion captain halsey said tome and i think well do it we aim to leave on nd april all being well he refused to reveal who was backing the expedition merely repeating that the five survivors had a financial interest god knows how many times i read that story through i went over it word by word and all the time something at the back of my mind kept fidgeting my brain with the thought that there was something phoney about it for the first time since i had been in prison i let my mind roam over the events and conversations on board the trikkala and all the time the thought rattling round my mind was why are all these survivors together halsey hendrik rankin jukes and evans they were together on the deck of the trikkala when we were put on the raft they were together in the open boat that was twentyone days afloat in the barents sea before being picked up they were together at our courtmartial and here they were together again on board a tug going in search of the trikkalas bullion rankin had even got out of the navy to be on the tug they must be very sure of recovering the bullion and why hadnt some of them got jobs that halsey and hendrik should be together in the venture was reasonable but jukes and evans might have been expected to ship on other boats and be at the other end of the world was it chance that brought them all to england at the same time to ship with halsey or was it something else suppose they were afraid of each other suppose they shared some awful knowledge suppose the boats had been tampered with thoughts like these shot like electrons through my brain and out of the chaos emerged one decisive view there was some compelling force outside of the natural desire to hunt for treasure that kept these five men bound irrevocably to each other of that i became convinced and all my subsequent reasoning was based on that assumption the name penang began to stand out in my mind as large as trikkala i began to recall the details of that story the old cook drifted into my cell his apron floating in water his hair like short strings of seaweed and his lips framing the word piracy then he was gone and my mind grasped at the straw my imagination had produced the money for the purchase of the tug where had that come from what would it cost to purchase and equip a salvage tug ј ј halsey had refused to say who his backer was suppose it was captain halsey of the penang who was backing it jewels fetch high prices now jewels are a cash transaction in many places in london jewels might well have financed this expedition i communicated the contents of the paragraph to bert we spent the rest of the evening discussing it through the medium of our burglar chum next day i remember it was bright and clear the moors lay all about the prison warm and brown and friendly the tors were no longer black mysterious battlements but sunwarmed rock cresting the hills the sky was blue it was on that day i decided to escape at what moment i made the decision i cannot recall it was an idea that grew within me and the focal point of my idea was rankin i dont think i had any feeling about halsey or hendrik certainly not about jukes or evans but rankin had grown in my imagination to the size of an ogre the long winter of captivity had taught me to hate and though by my effort of will i had suppressed all conscious thought of these men or the events on the trikkala yet when the flood tide of recollection was released from my pentup brain by the story of the salvage attempt i found myself with a violent hatred for rankin his heavy body soft hands white face and little eyes seemed stamped in my memory together with every action every gesture so that i felt him to be the embodiment of everything unhealthy he wandered in and out of my brain like a big white maggot and because i knew he would be afraid of me if i suddenly accosted him when he thought me safe in dartmoor i became feverishly excited with the idea of doing just that from him i would get the truth and i would get it before the tempest sailed if i had to smash every bone in his body dartmoor had done that for me it had toughened me mentally as well as physically i felt there was nothing i would not dare nothing i would not do to come at the truth which had forced me to spend almost a year in the dismal place it was typical of my frame of mind that at first i thought only of what i would do after i had escaped not of how i was going to escape all that evening i planned i would make for newcastle i would find the tug rankin would be on board or if he had not yet taken up his quarters on board he would be in the vicinity probably at one of the hotels in newcastle i would lie in wait for him and then when he gave me the chance of a lonely spot id wring the truth out of him i visualised it all so clearly i never stopped in my dreaming to consider the snags that might arise to prevent my reaching him or to wonder if the truth might not be just as they had stated and all my suspicions and uneasiness the imagination of an overwrought mind but next morning dawned cold and chill with the moors hidden in a thick mist the cold damp of the grim stone blocks pressed upon my spirits and i suddenly began to have doubts how was i going to get out id need money and clothes as we went out on the parade ground the great prison wall seemed to mock at my plans how was i going to get over it how was i to get clear of the moors i knew the prison routine for escapes too well the tolling of the great prison bell the patrol cars the warders out beating across the moors and the dogs there had been several borstal escapes quite recently theyd got caught in the end and i knew what happened outside id seen it on holidays before the war all the towns around dartmoor warned the few roads through it patrolled police checks at every road exit an escaped prisoner had to walk off the moors and at night i knew enough about the moors to reckon the chances of succeeding pretty slim i began to feel depressed and then something happened that made me feel as though fate were on my side half a dozen of us were detailed for a painting job we were taken to a shed on the east side of the prison inside it were paint pots brushes carpentry tools and ladders i walked out of that shed supporting one end of a long green ladder and the prison wall was right above me when we brought the ladders back in the evening i managed to slip some putty into my pocket this i transferred to a tobacco tin i happened to have in my cell to keep it moist that night i tapped a message to scotty in the next cell being a reme engineer he was employed in one of the workshops ifi gave him a putty impression of a key could he cut it for me in the workshops back came the answer yes two days later i got my opportunity we were painting the outside of one of the blocks and the screw in charge suddenly discovered that we had no turps i should say perhaps that i was regarded quite favourably by most of the staff anyway the warder turned to me and told me to run over to the shed for the turps and he tossed the key across to me i remember staring down at it in my hand hardly daring to believe my eyes come on look sharp vardy he said i made off then before he changed his mind next morning when we were cleaning out our cells i slipped scotty the tin with the putty impression of the key bert was close beside me at the time wot you bribing im for jim he asked he thought i had handed over a tin of tobacco i told him then what i planned to do hed a right to know for if i succeeded in getting anything out of rankin it might well lead to a revision of our sentences ive never seen a man come to life with excitement the way bert did i realised then that below all his cheerfulness and wisecracking he was pretty wretched youll let me come wiv yer jim he whispered youd never make it on yer own like i said dont be a fool bert youve served at least a third of your sentence allowing for good conduct remission nark ithe saidthat aint got nuffink ter do wiv it if youre makin a break im comin wiv yer i know wot youre up to its on account o that story in the paper abat those brutes going after the trikkalas bullion you fink theres somefink phoney an so do i youll make for newcastle wont yer i nodded well he said i dont aim ter be in stir while youre beating the living daylights at o that little tyke rankin yer can count me in wot abat makin it friday theres a rumour goin arand that the borstal boys is goin ter stage another riot on friday zero hour is planned for eight oclock in the evening look bert i said and then i stopped for one of the jailers was approaching us that evening bert was telegraphing to me madly i was surprised at his insistence i thought at first that he wanted to come out of sheer good nature i was already feeling a little scared at the thought of doing the whole thing on my own with no one to brace up my spirits but as message after message was relayed to me demanding to come with me i began to realise that it was something more bert wanted to come wanted to come for the sake of the chance in a million of getting clean away i warned him again and again what it meant if we discovered there was nothing phoney about the trikkala salvage attempt if halsey and the rest of his gang were on the level he would be a fugitive for the rest of his life unable to live with his wife and kids unable to have any sort of a normal job that was if we got clear if we were caught it meant a severe increase in his sentence just when he was getting to the time when he could begin to think of the future to all his pleadings i replied no finally his messages ceased and i thought he had accepted the situation but next day he reopened the matter over a bin of potatoes we were on spud peeling it was one of those wretched jobs that crop up from time to time he manoeuvred himself next to me and i found myself alone with him in a corner of the shed our heads close together across the bin when dyou aim to make the break jimhe asked i dont know i said first opportunity i get when scotty gives me the key if opportunity offered i think id choose just before eight on friday as you suggested if the borstal boys start rioting everything will be so confused it may mean longer before they find out ive escaped he nodded his hands working busily at the potatoes ow dyer aim ter get up ter newcastle he asked then theres money and clothes ter be got the police checks ter be avoided an dont ferget them beastly dawgs you dont want ter be lying at on the moors this time o the year fer long look wot appened ter them two borstal kids wot got away christmas time free days at on the moors an sufferin from frostbite when they was brought in well its warmer now i whispered as for clothes and money remember i told you id stayed with a friend of mine at his peoples place at dartmeet when i was a kid well they still live there hes dead killed at alamein i wrote to him some months back thought he might come up and see me it was his father who replied a nice kindly letter i think i might be able to get clothes and money there as for getting off the moors well thatll depend on luck as much as anything else he said nothing for a moment and we went on peeling potatoes in silence suddenly he stopped and looked up at melisten jim he said we bin pals aint we you an me we bin through all this business together we aint done nuffink wrong we aint crooked or rotten or anyfink we aint deserted or got scared in a scrap an run at on our pals we dont belong in this dump an if youre goin ter take a chance on gettin at well i aim ter come wivyer his brown eyes were watching me anxiously he wasnt pleading now he was stating his decision i thought of his missis and the kids he hadnt seen much of and the fact that hed probably little over two years to go dont be a fool i said weve been over all this last night in just over a year youll be out im comin wiv yer he repeated obstinately we bin in on this together from the start well see it fru tergether you fool i said look the odds are i never get as far as newcastle its not easy getting off the moors if youre caught theres a nice little sentence added on well wot abat you he said youre takin the risk aint yer in my case its different i told him even allowing for good conduct ive got at least two years more to serve and thats a hell of a slice out of ones life besides unless i can get evidence thatll reverse the decision of that court what sort of future do you think ive got well wot abat me aint i got no pride dyer think i want people sayin oh bert cook es the bloke wot done three years on the moor fer mutiny i got me selfrespec no if you makes a break you takes me along wiv yer an if we gets caught well we gets caught thats all now i know where rankin is i aims ter be arand when e gets is horrid dial bashed in e aint the type ter take a thrashin an old is tongue if theres anyfink ter spill ell spill it i was beginning to argue when he caught my arm suddenly in a fierce grip his hand was trembling he was wrought up to a sudden nervous pitch listen jim he said i wouldnt ave stuck this place if it adnt bin fer you as long as you were in it wiv me it was all right i saw you stickin it an i thought if e can stick it at bert then so can you but dont leave me jim fer goodness sakes dont leave me i wouldnt stand it honest i wouldnt he was all worked up and his eyes had no laughter in them now they were wide and scared you saved my life he went on in a quick flood of words but you done more than that youve kep me from doin somefink foolish i couldnt stand it ere on my own i got some good pals arand but theyre crooks an scum they aint my type o crony nah jist you resign yerself ter the fact that im comin wiv yer okay i started to tell him it was impossible stupid but he stopped me with a fierce gesture i was watching his face it was atwitch with anxiety he was so tensed up that i was convinced he meant what he said it seemed stupid for him to run the risk but i held out my hand if thats the way you feel about it bert i said ill be glad to have your company well make it somehow he gripped my hand eagerly his face was suddenly full of a bright grin well ave a jolly good try anyway mate he said so it was agreed next morning scotty slipped me the key he had made to fit my putty impression am no guaranteeing itll work he said but onyway gude luck to ye that was on the thursday that evening we were able to confirm that the borstal riot was scheduled to begin at eight oclock the following night it would be dark then we decided to make the attempt at a quarter of an hour before the riot the one problem was how to be legitimately out of our cells at that hour and it was here that scotty who knew all about our plans gave us a hand hed made so many escape plans that the organisation of a small detail like this came quite easily to him he tapped through to me that he and a pal of his were detailed for a coal fatigue the following day after the evening meal he reckoned the fatigue would take about one and a half to two hours his idea was that we went on that fatigue and answered to their names when the roll was called if we kept in the background the screw in charge wouldnt notice that wed changed places he and his pal would return to their cells feign sickness and say they couldnt do the fatigue but that we had replaced them that would account for our being absent from our cells the rest was up to us it was the best plan we could hit on accordingly we reported with about twenty other men for coal fatigue at oclock on the friday evening we kept in the background and the warder calling the work party roll never glanced up from the list of the detail as he called the names five minutes later bert and i and the rest of the work party were loading coal into sacks got the key mate he whispered as i shovelled coal into the mouth of the sack which he held open for me yesi said we didnt talk after that i think we were both too busy with our own thoughts there was a slight drizzle falling the light slowly faded from the leaden sky the clouds were very low every now and then grey wisps curled about the eaves of the ugly prison blocks the weather was with us in half an hour it would be pitch dark i looked at my watch it was just past seven three quarters of an hour to go chapter six escape from dartmoor i think that must have been the longest three quarters of an hour i have ever lived through when we had filled the sacks we loaded them on to a lorry and began distributing them round the blocks i kept on glancing at my watch slowly the light faded the drizzle showed like a thin silver veil against the light of an open doorway for five minutes i was busy stacking coal in a bunker beside one of the furnaces when i came out to the truck again it was dark the mist seemed to have come down like an impenetrable blanket i suddenly felt panicky that we should lose our way the truck moved slowly out into the parade ground the lights of the prison showed all about us the mist was not as thick as it had seemed i got my bearings again bert plucked at my sleeve aint it time yet mate he asked i showed him my watch the luminous dial showed twenty to eight keep close by me now i whispered first opportunity we get well slide off the truck turned up beside another block we piled out and began unloading more sacks the warder in charge went inside the boiler house to supervise the stacking of the coal okay bert i whispered slip your boots off a minute later we were gliding along under the shadow of the towering bulk of the block at the end we paused behind us the headlights of the lorry blazed against a granite wall above us cell windows glimmered faintly ahead there was nothing but impenetrable darkness the ground struck cold through my prison socks my knees were trembling we listened no sound of footsteps disturbed the silence of the darkness come on i said i took berts arm and we plunged out into the open our stockinged feet made no sound twice i paused to glance back at the lights of the prison i had tried to memorise the position of the blocks in relation to the paint shed but it was the wall we struck and not the shed we turned left feeling our way along i was hoping to get the building in which the ladders were housed in silhouette against the lights of the prison blocks we went fifty yards before we hit up against an entirely different building and i realised we had come the wrong way we hurried back it was ten to eight incredible how fast the time went now i was scared that the borstal riot might start early once that started the authorities might train searchlights on to the walls my heart was racing as i saw the sheds we were looking for i took the key out of my pocket as we felt our way along the side of the building and found the paint shed door everything depended on whether the key fitted i fumbled for the keyhole my hand was trembling violently the key slipped in i tried to turn it panic seized at me as i found it would not turn i pulled the key out and inserted it again it was sticking somewhere it would not go right home wots upbert asked key doesnt fit i said i pressed hard against it and tried again it wouldnt move i tried to pull it out but it wouldnt budge it was jammed bert tried at length he whispered well ave to ammer it in chum okay yes i said we listened there was not a sound i glanced at my watch five to eight i could just see bert grasp one of his boots then he was hammering at the end of the key the sound seemed to shatter the stillness i felt they must hear it i thought theyd coming running from all directions the hammering stopped bert gave a grunt the key rasped in the lock and we were in the shed it was the work of a moment to get the long green ladder out we shut the door but the key was firmly wedged we had to leave it there a dumb witness to our escape it seemed an age that we walked with that ladder between us but at last we were at the wall we put our boots on and then upended the ladder a moment later we were standing on the top of the wall and pulling the ladder up after us the lights of the prison stood out so clearly that i felt we must be seen but the dark backcloth of the moors hid us we tipped the ladder over the wall and set it up on the far side in an instant we were down we carried the ladder well clear of the wall and set it down in longish grass and then we began to run wed no compass unfortunately but i knew the district too well to go wrong at this stage we made downhill to the road that joins the tavistock road to the exeter road at two bridges bypassing princetown and as we ran all hell let loose behind us the silent prison seemed to flare into a mushroom of sound it was a deep angry roar that grew in volume till it seemed to fill the night air the borstal riot had started we made the road crossed it and plunged up the slope beyond bearing away to the right glancing back over my shoulder i saw an orange glow near the roof of one of the blocks looks like they set fire to somefink bert panted well i hope to goodness they dont need the ladders from that paintshed to get the hoses up there i said gawd i hope not as if in answer the great prison bell began to toll drowning the roar of the riot with its deep tongue dyer reckon thats fer us or on acant o the riot i dont know i said the going became rougher now we were no longer running we were stumbling along once i pitched forward on my face i scrambled to my feet without waiting to see what it was id fallen over cant we let up a minute jim bert said i got the stitch not until were on the far side of the exeterprincetown road i told him wots them lights dan there he gasped thatll be two bridges i answered theres a pub there the road to dartmeet branches off on the hill right above it dont alf look nice dan there he grunted i could jist do wiv a nice pint o wallop right nah dont reckn i can go much furver chum well save your breath i said the headlights of a car lit the hill crest ahead of us then they swung in an arc and the car roared down the hill the beam of the lights illuminating the hotel and the bridges the water gleamed silver for an instant and then the car was a red light soaring up towards princetown bert suddenly stopped let me get me bref a moment he gasped i looked back towards the prison lights were blazing the headlights of several cars swung out of the main gates and turned towards princetown come on bert i said give me your arm weve got to get across that road before those patrol cars get through princetown and down to two bridges okay he said then as we stumbled forward again dyer reckon we got a chance jim i didnt reply i had counted on an hour or two at least before our break was discovered but now i thought our chances very slender but we werent far from the road now if we could cross that we might still have a chance wot say we pinch one o them cars atside that pub bert said theres free of em you can see their sidelights people dont leave their ignition keys in their cars these days i said bert suddenly stopped again listen he said wots that dyer hear it his voice was scared faint behind us came the baying of dogs oh my gawd bert cried and he started to run again his breath coming in sobs the baying followed us as we ran audible above the uproar of the prison it was a horrible sound we reached the crest of the hill the going became easier the lights of another car beat back the night as it drove towards princetown we were quite close to the road now when were across the road i panted well make for the river thatll put the dogs off and then i stopped clutching berts arm the headlights of the car were swinging across the face of the hotel and a man was coming out of the entrance he was making straight for one of the parked cars bert i said are you willing to take a risk wot dyer fink im doin at ere he demanded with a flash of his old humour okay i said watch that car hes on his own if he turns up this way get out in the road and lie down just where it tops the rise there he wont have time to notice your prison clothes then lie as though youd been hit by a car if he stops call out to him for assistance ill look after the rest watch theres nothing coming the other way okay he said look hes movin off nan the car still with only its sidelights on was beginning to move it climbed slowly up to the road and hesitated the headlights were switched on then they swung in a great arc of light till they were blazing straight up at us the car began to gather way up the hill towards us bert dived for the road i crossed it and plunged down in the wet grass at the verge the headlights blazed in the night as the car ground up the hill bert was half lying half crouching in the road i no longer heard the baying of the dogs or the tolling of the bell or the uproar in the prison all i heard was the engine of the car propelling it up the hill towards us i felt quite cool the lights topped the rise pointing skywards then as the car reached the top of the hill the headlights dropped to show bert sprawled in the road the fork with the signpost that pointed to dartmeet behind him bert waved his arm feebly the car slowed and stopped bert called the door opened and the driver got out he was within a few feet of me as i rose from the grass verge he only saw me in time to turn his head so that my fist hit him right on the chin okay bert i said as i staggered under the weight of the dazed man bert was already up i glanced back towards the hotel at the bridge all was quiet but beyond the bridge the hill crest was ablaze with the lights of cars our margin of time was as narrow as that we bundled the driver into the back of the car bert dived in with him i jumped into the driving seat and we were off i took the right hand fork the car was old but she could do fifty all right i kept the accelerator pedal right down all the time in ten minutes we were pelting down the long hill into dartmeet i crossed the little humpbacked bridge and swung on to a track to the left that ran beside the babbling waters i parked the car on the greensward among some tall gorse bushes bert had already got the drivers hands bound and his mouth gagged he was busy tying the poor fellows feet ill try not to be long i said fifteen minutes at the outside actually i was less than that it was a long time since henry mantons father had seen me but he recognised me at once i felt horribly illatease as i told him what i wanted he shook his head sadly but he made no comment simply asking about my friends size he left me standing in the hall i heard a car roar past in a few minutes he was back with a pile of clothes and some shoes there was a suit of henrys his son i knew was about my size for bert he had included an old suit of his own shirts collars ties hats and raincoats hed missed out nothing and as i bundled the clothes over my arm he pressed a roll of notes into my hand theres eighteen pounds there he said im sorry its not more but thats all i have in the house i tried to thank him but he pushed me towards the door henry was fond of you he said quietly and i would not like henry to feel that his was a fairweather friendship he put his hand on my shoulder good luck my boy he said but i fear its a hard road youve started on dont worry about returning either the clothes or the money and whilst i was still trying to thank him he pushed me gently out into the night and closed the door he understood my need for haste that gesture of trust from a man i had not seen for several years warmed me i hurried back to the car and we changed down there by the dart sinking our prison clothes with a stone in the dark swiftflowing waters of the river then i got the car back on to the road and continued south towards totnes but i didnt go far below the village of postgate the road crosses the dart again by a narrow humpbacked bridge that marked virtually the southern limit of dartmoor and i guessed that if the police had yet set up check points it would be on that bridge just beyond postgate therefore at the top of the hill leading down to the bridge i parked the car out of sight among the bushes the poor wretched owner had been too scared i think to struggle at any time during the drive his eyes stared widely up at me as i bent over him to apologise for the rough handling hed had we left him then firmly trussed up on the back seat of his car and hurried down the slope of the hill towards the river we could hear talking to the stones in the valley bottom the slope was steep and strewn with rocks the night was unutterably black there was no sound save the babble of the dart hurrying over the rocks of the river bed our feet seemed to make a great deal of noise scrambling against the rocks or brushing through the dry heather twigs gradually we approached the river but we could not see it we could see nothing beyond a few yards a light drizzle damped our faces and out of it bush and rock would suddenly materialise as a vague shadowy bulk in the night an unearthly scream suddenly disturbed the peaceful pattern of sound made by the water it was high pitched shrill as a bat we stopped i listened imagination galloping wildly the outline of a bush showed like a crouching woman just in front of us it seemed to move there was a scuffling sound at its feet then something slid away quietly into the night gor love old iron bert muttered didnt half give me a fright wot dyer reckon it was jim fox maybe i said and we went on we were close to the river now the water slipped noisily among the rocks drowning all other sounds we entered a little belt of dwarfed trees and as soon as we were among them they closed about us as though there were no such thing as open moorland dead vegetation collapsed beneath our feet below this decayed carpet was rock no earth or grass just a jumbled heap of mossgrown rocks tumbled there by the river when this had been its bed they were smooth and round they moved under our feet it was a dangerous spot to come scrambling in the dark it took us nearly twenty minutes to reach the water through that devilish patch of wood but at last we reached a slab of rock and the air was cold and damp with the smell of water we clambered down this slab and then we were in a jumble of black rocks with the water pouring past our feet loud and insistent whispering perpetually with a voice that seemed as slight as the rustle of wind through a patch of reeds yet it drowned all other sound we stood there for a moment looking down at that rush of water we could just see it it creamed white round the vague shapes of the rocks between these white chattering frills we sensed rather than saw the sleek black swirl of the water as it slid between the rocks i dont like the look of it bert said why dont we go up and ave a look at the bridge didnt see no sign o lights as we came dan mebbe there aint no police check there even if we get through this were goin ter look pretty peculiar specimens till we dry i hesitated with the water swirling wickedly among the rocks in front of me i was greatly tempted and yet it was a risk if we were caught that way wed kick ourselves at any rate we could go up near the bridge and when a car comes down we could see whether there was a check bert added that seemed reasonable all right i said and we turned along a path that ran close beside the river soon we were out of the wood the path was no longer rock and mud but grass we were in the open and though we could see nothing yet it seemed vaguely lighter i began to be worried lest we should come upon the bridge without knowing it the river was not so noisy here and i had the impression that it was wider and consequently less deep i suddenly stopped i didnt like being out in the open like this beyond the river i knew there were woods once among the trees we would be clear of the moors and on our way to ashburton and totnes well cross here i told bert he accepted my decision without question i think he was getting worried too we grasped each others hands and stepped off the bank into the swiftflowing river the water was icy cold it came just above our knees sweeping against our legs with a steady pressure pebbles and small rocks moved under our feet we waded out keeping the flow of the water on our right gradually it deepened until the water was up to our loins making us gasp with the shock of its cold touch we must have been about halfway across when berts hand tightened on mine and he half swung me round so that i was facing upstream the hills were a black hump in silhouette against the lights of a car coming from postgate in a moment they would top the crest and as the car started on the descent into the valley the headlights would swing across us without a word we plunged forward but before we had reached the further bank the car had reached the top of the hills the twin beams of the headlights dipped towards us i suddenly ducked my body into the water pulling bert with me we crouched there in the middle of the stream with the water swirling round our necks gasping for breath as the icy current seeped through our clothes the headlights dipped we saw the wood we had padded through as a huddle of brightlylit trees and deep shadows leaning towards the river as though charging pell mell into the rocktorn stream the lights swept across the further bank it was bare of cover a pleasant greensward running up to the line of woods that clothed the further hillside they illumined for an instant the dark smooth surface of the water where we crouched the branch of a tree swept past my face i saw the shadow of my head move across the surface of the water i turned to look at bert and caught a glimpse of his teeth chattering with the cold and then the headlights swept on and the bridge stood clear before my eyes it was an old humpbacked bridge of mellow lichencovered stone two black recesses marked the spans as they bridged the river and standing by the parapet was a man in a blue peaked cap that bridge was scarcely forty paces upstream from where we crouched in the water it was only a momentary glimpse i had then the headlights swung away and all was darkness again i glanced at the hillside behind us it streamed with light as the car came diagonally down it on the road to the bridge quick i whispered in berts ear and we began scrambling for the bank we reached it and pulled ourselves out on to the short turf our clothes were heavy with water it was wretchedly cold for the first time i realised that there was a breeze it cut like a knife through our soggy clothes i looked back as we lay gasping for breath as i did so the car swung on a bend keep still i whispered to bert the headlights were full on us our shadows lay on the grass two black and shapeless humps the shadows moved and lengthened the cars headlights swung away the bridge stood out again clear as in an etching the man in the peaked cap was waving a torch the car halted on the bridge we could hear voices a vague sound just topping the smooth hustle of the river all about us was a diffused light a ponys droppings looked like a huge dunghill so close was my face buried to the ground here and there were low bushes of gorse and bramble and fifty yards up the slope of the hill the fringe of the woods mocked us the car moved on its headlights were swallowed up in the woods the red taillight disappeared all was black again a torch flashed by the bridge footsteps sounded sharp and frosty on the macadam of the roadway we got up then and made for the woods a voice suddenly called out headlights instantly flashed on bathing all the open space in which we ran with a bright artificial light we flung ourselves to the ground scarcely daring to breathe surely they must have us why the shout had they been waiting for us we lay motionless two frightened wretched heaps of sodden clothing in a prickle of gorse that went unnoticed in our sudden scare a car engine purred the headlights swung away from us and the police car disappeared up the road through the woods darkness again and silence cautiously we got to our feet my face and hands were scratched with gorse and bramble but we were out of trouble for the moment we hurried then into the shelter of the woods ten minutes later we were standing in a clearing high up on the wooded hillside we were panting and our clothes clung to us like wood pulp the heat of our exertions rose in a thick steam but i dont think in that moment we gave a thought to our dilapidated condition we were looking downhill across the clearing to where the tree tops on the further side stood etched against an orange glow that flared up into the night it shone on the low bellies of the drizzleladen clouds so that they glared redly like a backcloth in berliozs damnation of faust its a fire thats wot it is bert said he suddenly gave a cackling laugh strewf he chuckled thats two fires in one day canting the one the borstal fellers started in the prison i aint ad such a riotous evenin since i was a nipper an saw a pub in islington a shop in the grays inn road an a tramcar at kings cross all free of em on fire the same night gosh i wouldnt mind warmin meself at that blaze wot dyer reckon it is a rick i dont know i said its quite a blaze by the look of it and then a sudden idea swept through my mind bert i said i believe its a hotel on fire i remember theres one in these woods somewhere listen if it is a hotel therell be a fire engine there now suppose we go down and mingle with the firefighters that would account for our being soaked through a few black smudges on our necks would cover up our prison haircut wed get warm and with a bit of luck we might get a lift anyway the police would never think of looking for us amongst a crowd of people helping to put out a fire come on i said suddenly excited by the idea he clapped his hand on my shoulder blimey he said you oughterve bin in the resistance movement you ought and i suddenly felt lighthearted almost confident the woods ran right down to the blaze it was the hotel all right we came out of the trees amongst some outbuildings the fire had not extended to these but the main building appeared to be a sheet of flame the red paintwork and gleaming brass of a fire engine shone in the light of the flames twenty yards from the blaze we felt the heat of it two silver jets of water hissed into the crackling mass of flame steam hung over the wrecked building like a cloud some men were removing furniture from a side of the building that had not yet been engulfed we joined them we got as close to the flames as we dared i have never been so glad about somebody elses misfortune the heat of the fire had our clothes steaming as though they were in a quickservice cleaners our grateful bodies absorbed the warmth i could feel my clothes drying on me stiffening and getting hot now and then sparks fell and the pungent smell of singed cloth filled the air i suppose the fire lasted about an hour from the time we arrived gradually the weight of water subdued the flames and then quite suddenly it seemed the glow and heat was gone and all that remained was the brick shell of the building crammed with a twisted heap of broken and blackened timber all this time we had kept out of the way parked close beside the fire engine was a squad car two policemen in blue peaked caps one a sergeant stood by the fire chief i wondered whether this was the police car that had given us such a scare at the bridge below postgate probably the driver of the car they had stopped had told them he could see the glow of a fire from the top of the opposite hill it would certainly have been visible from there the fire was out now the firemen were packing up the only light was the spotlights of the fire engine bert i whispered what about getting a lift on the fire engine nark it guvnor he said quickly theyd want to know why we was ere an sppose they asked us for our hidentity cards i hesitated but i was convinced this was our chance i was too excited by the idea to be warned off it listen bert i said in his ear thats a totnes engine i asked one of the firemen just now and totnes is on the main line to london once in totnes wed be clear its too far from the moors for them to have a police check on the railway station not on the night of the escape at any rate if we could get a lift on that engine wed be clear no police check would think of stopping a fire engine to search for escaped prisoners okay said bert a little doubtfully dyer really fink theyll give us a lift then suddenly he gripped my arm wot abat waitin till that patrol car moves off the firemen wouldnt ave card abat us but them coppers ave they only came dan ter look at the fire its us theyre after really no well do it now i said and just to make certain they do give us a lift well ask the police sergeant here nark it bert exclaimed in alarm i aint talkin ter no coppers you dont have to i answered just keep in the background ill do the talking i crossed the gravel drive bert following reluctantly at my heels excuse me officer i said the police sergeant turned he was a big bull of a man with sharp eyes sunk deep in a ruddy face and a little clipped moustache i wonder if you could help us i said quickly i tried to control the nervousness in my voice my friend and i are in a bit of a jam we were waiting for the bus up on the road when we saw the flames and came down to give a hand now were in a pretty filthy state and weve missed the bus i was wondering if it would be possible for us to ride back on the fire engine it is the totnes engine isnt it thats right sir his sharp eyes inspected us critically well i know its against regulations and all that i hurried on but i thought perhaps in the circumstances you see were staying in totnes and i dont know how well get back otherwise i thought if you were to have a word with the fire chief he nodded i will that sir id give ee a lift meself only were going up on to the moors two of em blasted prisoners as broken out hang on a minute sir ill avea word with mr mason ere he went over to the officer in charge of the firemen they were looking at us all the time they were talking the fire engine suddenly switched on its headlights i felt sure they would see what we were in that bright glare bert coughed nervously and began to back out of the glare my knees felt weak i cursed myself for this bit of bravado i wanted to run but instead i found myself saying to bert stand still and pretend to be talking to me as though you didnt mind being in the glare of the headlights okay he said wot shall we talk about his eyes were wide in the lamplit glare about the weather anything i said but for gods sake dont look so scared i cant elp it mate he answered i feel like a doll wots got a ok in the knee joints fru which the sawdust is seepin at the police sergeant suddenly nodded then he came deliberately towards me i braced myself for the grip of his hand on my shoulder thats all right sir he said in his friendly devonian voice just op in the back youd best look sharp cos theyre just leaving thank you very much indeed officer it was an effort to get it out good night i added as we moved towards the fire engine good night he replied and began talking again with the constable you got a good nerve bert whispered the tone of admiration in his voice was like a tonic to my weak legs i nearly did an overreach i whispered back if theyd been going the other way wed have been riding into totnes in that patrol car a figure emerged from behind the glare of the headlights you the two gentlemen that want a lift a voice asked thats right i replied jump up on the back then were just off a fireman gave us a hand up on to the platform beside the escape ladder the two policemen got into their car and drove off we could see their headlights dancing through the trees that bordered the drive climbing up to the road high in the woods above the hotel their lights showed like a fastmoving lantern as they turned back towards the bridge below postgate the motor of the fire engine suddenly revved the bell clanged and we moved off into the sweetsmelling night away from the acrid smoke of smouldering wood our clothes i discovered were still damp it was a bitterly cold drive but i didnt really notice it my heart was singing within me for with each minute of that biting wind the humming wheels of the engine were carrying us farther from dartmoor it was shortly after one that the fire engine dropped us outside our hotel in totnes or what we said was our hotel we stood on the pavement until the red taillight of the engine had disappeared and then cut down a side alley the alley led into another street it was dark and deserted our footsteps clattered noisily on the pavements we were as conspicuous at that hour of the night as we should have been with a spotlight trained on us we stopped in the shadow of a shop doorway to consider our next move there was no question of going to a hotel the story of the fire would explain the state of our clothes and our late arrival but the porter would almost certainly ask for our identity cards the hotels would most probably be full anyway to hang about either in the town or the station would be suicide remember passin a pullin as we came into the town bert asked it was a petrol station and there was a couple o lorries there we might get a lift or a bite to eat i could just do wiv a bite i remembered the place it was about a mile out of the town we did not meet a soul as we walked through the unlighted streets we kept out of sight when cars passed us there were three lorries in the pullin we had sandwiches and thick coffee essence we told how wed helped to put out a fire and ridden in on the fire engine trouble is we missed our train bert said where yer makin fer asked the man behind the coffee counter when i told him london he said stick arand one of the regular london boys will be in ill get you a lift at that a little fellow in the corner coughed selfconsciously and said in a croaking voice im goin ter london give yer a lift if yer like but its fish we didnt stop to think what it would be like lying on a toad of mackerel for miles so anxious were we to get on our way ill never regret that we took that lift but i wouldnt want to do it again it was a hard bed and the smell seemed to impregnate itself into our clothes but we got to london it was just after eight as we dropped off outside charing cross station i bought a morning paper it was full of the borstal riot at dartmoor and two prisoners that had escaped our names and descriptions stared back at us from the printed page fortunately there was no picture we got ourselves cleaned up bought a few things we needed had a slapup feed and caught the first train to newcastle i had the devil of a job to restrain bert from going up to islington to see his missis he knew i was right but he looked wretched about it i had no plan when i got on to that train i was dazed with the desire for sleep and theres little i can remember about the journey and when we got off the train at newcastle i still had not the faintest idea how i intended to get the information i wanted out of rankin it was raining night was falling and the wet streets reflected the glare of street and shop lights i felt crumpled and dirty my brain was muzzy with sleep but i was no longer tired we got a wash at the station and then went to the nearest pub for a drink by the time wed fed it was nearly eight and we went down to the docks to get news of the tug we had no difficulty in finding her everybody seemed to know about captain halseys expedition to recover the trikkalas bullion the tug was moored against one of the tyneside wharfs her squat funnel was dwarfed by a litter of cranes and dingy warehouses the wharf looked dark and deserted the water lapped dolefully against the wooden piles a clutter of crates was piled before one of the warehouses like a childs wooden building blocks the air was still and full of the damp smell of water and that strange odour of decaying vegetation and oil that hangs about the waters of a port we managed to get quite close to the tempest without fear of being seen a short gangplank spanned the gap between the ship and wharf above the gangplank a naked light bulb swung on a wire a radio blared from somewhere in the focstle wots the bettin rankins at rand the boozers bert whispered i didnt reply for at that moment hendrik appeared on deck it was strange to see that tall looseknit powerful figure again such an infinity of time seemed to have passed since i had watched him nervously giving evidence against us evans followed close at his heels the little welshman seemed arguing with him about something at the top of the gangway hendrik suddenly turned i could see the scar on his cheek the light of the naked bulb fell full on it weel its the capns orders he snapped somebodys got to stay on board and see that he doesna go ashore i stayed on board last night the capn the night before its your turn tonight he can have all the drink in the world but on board but i tell you man ive got a date the little welshman cried why could you not tell me i was to jolly well stay on board yesterday because i thought jukes would be on board hendrik snarled but the capns sent jukes over to jarrow so yell jist have to do wioot yer lassie fer the nicht and with that he crossed the gangway and went quickly down the wharf evans stood on the gangway mouthing curses at his officer his little eyes looked quickly about him then he disappeared below thats halsey hendrik and jukes off the tug bert whispered to me dyer sppose its rankin they was talkin abat i think so i replied hendrik said he could have all the drink in the world but on board it looks as though hes on the bottle in a big way and they dont trust him ashore e always was a horrible drunk bert muttered vindictively evans suddenly appeared on deck he had a hat pulled rakishly over one eye and hed put a collar and tie on he looked neat and dapper as he glanced warily up and down the wharf then he crossed the gangplank and hurried towards the lights of the town blimey bit o luck that mate bert whispered come on wot you waitin for aint nobody on board cept mr rankin i dont know why i hesitated as bert said it was a bit of luck but from the very first day in dartmoor that i had begun to plan escape i had always thought in terms of getting rankin ashore once we went aboard the tempest we ran the risk of being trapped there bert tugged at my sleeve come on fer gawds sake he said nahs our chance the wharf was deserted the gangplank shone white in the windswung light money is the root of all evil a girl crooned in a huskysweet voice over the blaring radio the water pattered loquaciously against the piles we slid out of the shelter of the crates the gangplank sounded hollow under our feet then we were on the rusty deckplating of the tug we went forard to the bridge accommodation i paused in the entrance to look back the wharf was just as it had appeared when we were concealed behind the crates it did not seem to have noticed that we had slipped on board the tempest we made straight for the sound of the radio i flung open the cabin door it was rankin all right his heavy body lolled on the bunk the muscles slack the hands drooping listlessly from the wrists the neck of his shirt was unbuttoned to the waist showing a white hairless chest and the first folds of his stomach his face was white save for two hectic spots on either cheek his eyes were moist and bloodshot his forehead glistened the bowl on an electric heater glared redly on a table beside the bunk stood a bottle of whisky a cracked china jug of water and a tooth glass come in he mumbled come in what dyou want he was drunk he didnt recognise us i motioned bert to close the door close the porthole and switch the radio up i told him i picked up the jug of water and flung it in rankins face the sight of him sprawled there brought a years suppressed anger bubbling to the surface his larded face gasped at the shock of the water and the little oyster eyes opened wide i know you he squealed his voice was pitched high and there was fear in it probably thats why he was on the bottle why halsey didnt trust him ashore he was scared i seized him by the collar of his jacket and pulled him towards me you remember us eh i cried do you know where weve been dartmoor we escaped last night weve come here to get the truth out of you the truth do you hear he seemed too terrified to speak i slapped him across the face do you hear i shouted he pursed his bloodless lips yes he breathed his breath reeked of whisky i flung him back so that his head crashed against the wall now i said youre going to tell us what happened after we left the trikkala he moaned and his smooth pudgy hand felt the back of his head nothing happened he murmured we abandoned ship and got blown i leaned forward then and collared hold of his jacket again he fought me off and i hit him across the mouth with my fist he cried out but i seized hold of him by the wrist and with a quick twist brought his arm up into the small of his back now then lets have the truth i shouted if you dont tell me the truth rankin ill break every bone in your body im not very proud of what followed we beat the wretched man up pretty badly but i wanted the truth and i had a year in prison to incite my fists to smash that white unhealthy face in the end his fear of us overrode his fear of halsey was number two boat seaworthy i demanded for the third time i dont know he moaned oh yes you do i insisted was that boat seaworthy come on tell me the truth i dont know i dont know anything about it he struggled and then writhed as i brought the whole weight of my body on to his twisted arm no he screamed no it wasnt thats better i relaxed it wasnt anything to do with me i only did what captain halsey told me it wasnt my idea i couldnt have done anything anyway hed have killed me he was mad mad to get at all that silver i just did what he told me i tell you it was nothing to do with me it wasnt my idea what wasnt your idea but the sudden spate of words had dried up he stared at me in obstinate silence i returned to my original line of inquiry were either of the boats seaworthy i asked him his little bloodshot eyes looked up at me with a grotesque expression half crafty half pleading i wrenched at his arm again and repeated my question no his reply was like a strange cry forced from his lips did captain halsey know they werent seaworthy i still had the whole weight of my body thrusting at his twisted arm yes he screamed when did you find out i asked then he struggled i heard berts fist hit him again i felt sick but we had to get the truth out of him i clenched my teeth when did you find out when i reported to the bridge he answered thickly so he knew the boats were unseaworthy halsey had told him twentythree men had been murdered and this stupid fool could have saved them i saw red then i wrenched his arm so that he was doubled up with his head to the floor he began to scream with the terror of what he had told us bert silenced him with his foot what a beastly swine bert muttered he was beside himself with anger i pulled rankin back to the bunk now youve told us so much i said youd better tell us the rest and make it quick youre as guilty of the murder of those men as if youd slit their throats with your own hands what did halsey offer you to keep your rotten little mouth shut all right ill tell you rankin breathed ill tell you everything what did he offer you i repeated money he replied a share of the silver and then in quick succession it wasnt any of my business he was the captain it wasnt my idea i tell you hed have killed me along with the rest if i hadnt done what hed said i couldnt do anything t save them i couldnt help them you must believe that it was nothing to do with me i shut up my voice was thick with anger and the horror of what hed done and what he was you were a warrant officer in the royal navy you could have stopped it if youd any guts and if youd wanted to youre as guilty as halsey he stared at me unbelievingly his eyes wide with fear now then i said when wed abandoned ship what happened then we we got into the captains boat and drifted his voice trailed away as i caught hold of his collar the way he spoke the look in his eyes i knew he wasnt speaking the truth then before i had hit him he cringed away and said all right ill tell you i knew it had to come ive known that all along ive been scared stiff ever since it happened well i asked we we got the trikkalas engines going again there was a device for sealing off the hole in the ships side it was all planned all planned i echoed then all the little inexplicable things on the trikkala fell into place you mean it wasnt a mine i asked no just cans packed with cordite and then we sailed where to i asked i was excited now here at least was proof the trikkala afloat and hidden in some port under another name where to i repeated i dont know he began then as he saw me leaning towards him he hurried on no i just meant i dont know the position i had seized his arm again let go he screamed in a panic let go for gods sake where did you sail to i asked again towards spitzbergen he murmured an island called maddons rock near bear island we beached her there through a gap in the reefs on a little patch of beach to the east of the island es lyin jim bert whispered beached er on an island thats a jolly likely tale i dont fink i can see that brutealsey leavin alf a million quid lyin rottin on an island for a year rankin heard him its the truth he blubbered half crying with fear i tell you its the truth and then as bert leaned over him he added quickly we beached her on maddons rock thats the truth i swear it we beached her silver and all he was almost whimpering with fear i pulled bert back hed never make up a story as incredible as that i said having told us enough to hang himself he wouldnt have lied about the rest berts brow was furrowed it dont seem ter make sense to me he muttered his head jerked up a door had banged wots that he asked i switched the radio down footsteps sounded in the passageway they stopped outside the door of the cabin i saw the handle turn there was no time to do anything we just stood there the door opened framing the figure of a man in the dark gap gilt buttons gleamed and a collar showed white the rest merged into the background then he stepped forward into the cabin it was halsey he had taken in the scene at a glance his eyes jerked to the handle of the door and then back to rankin if thered been a key in the lock hed have slammed the door to and locked us in but there wasnt he stood in the doorway and for a moment he was uncertain what to do his eyes came to rest on me and as i met his gaze i felt all the courage drain out of me i was scared a year in a place like dartmoor makes you subservient to authority and the power of authority was vested in this man his personality dominated the cabin the moment he entered his uncertainty was gone in a flash his eyes were cold authoritative as he said you fool vardy youve escaped from prison thats nothing to do with me but you come here and beat up one of my officers that does concern me youre a convict and you come here and beat up the man who sent you down a court will give you a heavy sentence for an act of revenge that i didnt come here for revenge i interrupted him my throat felt dry and my voice sounded unnatural his eyes narrowed then what did you come here for he asked i wanted the truth i replied the truth he looked at rankin what have you been telling them his voice was cold and menacing rankins fat bulk seemed to wilt i didnt tell them anything he whined i told them nothing i tell you he was cringing against the cabin wall his body tucked up on his bunk what did you tell them halsey repeated nothing lies anything that came into my head they were breaking my arm i said nothing i halsey cut him short with a gesture of disgust and turned to me what did he tell you i found myself looking into those black eyes and i was suddenly no longer afraid i was thinking of sills and the cook of all the men crowded into that boat and this was the man who had sent them to their deaths what did he tell you his voice was less controlled now and in his eyes was the same expression that i had seen when jennings had mentioned the penang and i suddenly knew that he was scared he told me how you murdered twentythree men i said i saw his hands clench as he took a grip of himself he suddenly laughed it wasnt a pleasant sound it seemed to cling to the walls of the cabin it was a wild uncontrolled laugh murder murder and piracy i said try and prove it he snarled i will i answered him how his eyes were watching me like a cat i know where the trikkala is i said a reconnaissance plane can be there but he wasnt listening he had swung round on rankin you lying drunken sot he said what did you tell them and rankin his body quivering with fear seemed to brace himself with his hands clenched to the edge of the bunk and said i told them the truth halsey stood watching him rankins sudden unexpected bravado collapsed i didnt mean that i dont know what im saying i told them a lot of lies he stretched a white hand out to the bottle of whisky and poured himself a drink the neck of the bottle clattered against the rim of the glass halsey turned to me what is truth he asked smiling in his beard a man says one thing one minute another thing the next is that truth you think im a murderer and a pirate well go and tell the police tell them what you like and see if theyll believe you see if theyll believe the droolings of a drunk wholl tell a different story tomorrow he laughed you beat rankin up out of sheer spite thats what theyll believe if you go to the police all theyll do is to give you a longer stretch they may not believe me at first i said but they will when they know that the trikkala did not sink for gawds sake lets get at of ere bert was plucking at my sleeve but i shook him off i was thinking of those men in the boats and this coldblooded devil stood there laughing in his beard you cant get away with murder when the evidence of your guilt still exists the trikkala is my witness you may get away with murder and piracy in the china seas but not in this country you wont at the mention of the china seas his eyes glittered wildly his hands clenched i suddenly realised that he was wrought up to a pitch of madness one more thrust and his brain might topple into the past how many men did you coldbloodedly send to their death when you were master of the penang i asked him i thought he would rush at me if hed had a gun in his hand hed have shot me then a cold madness glazed his eyes what do you know of that he asked and then with sudden lucidity you know nothing you tried to bring it up at the trial but you knew nothing i knew nothing then i said his eyes glittered god he cried with an extravagant theatrical gesture does death not stop their mouths but they must come to me in the guise of convicts is nothing secret can they rise up through fathoms of salt water to accuse me of what was their inevitable and predestined end i do not know whether he was quoting from some old play or whether he had made up those words but the next passage i recognised macbeth in the great banquet hall of duncans palace the times have been he cried that when the brains were out the man would die and there an end but now they rise again with twenty mortal murders on their crowns he stopped then panting i realised suddenly that reality had no substance for him he transmitted life into words and so felt neither pity sorrow nor affection for gods sake stop your playacting i said does murder mean no more to you than an opportunity to rant shakespeare playacting he snarled his eyes had widened and his breathing seemed to have stopped i remembered then what the trikkalas cook had said why do you hide yourself behind a beard i cried are you an actor thats afraid to show his face to the world i thought he was coming at me with his bare hands each individual hair of his wiry beard seemed to stand out against the sudden pallor of his skin for gawds sake bert whispered impatiently e gives me the creeps lets get cracking okayi said halsey didnt try to stop us he seemed dazed i dont believe he saw us go his eyes were dull as though they saw things beyond the tiny cabin the cold night air was like a breath of sanity we crossed the gangplank and hurried along the wharf that bird oughter be in a loonybin bert muttered as we threaded through dark alleyways towards the lights of newcastle wots the next move guvnor reckon the police would swallow a tale like that i sppose rankin was tellin the truth yes i said hed never have made up a story like that but halseys sane enough in his reasoning the police wont believe a word of it and rankin would deny the whole story weve got to get proof i added proof bert laughed derisively the only proof we got is beached on a rock near spitzbergen if only halsey hadnt turned up when he did i said i was planning to get a written confession out of rankin as it is hed say wed beaten him up for revenge wed be in a hell of a spot they might send a plane to investigate like you said bert suggested hopefully what with halsey making an open bid to salvage the bullion i said theyd laugh at us thats whats so devilishly clever about the whole thing this isnt a holeinthecorner business halsey has organised it in a blaze of publicity even if wed got a signed statement out of rankin i doubt whether the police would have paid much attention to it rankin would say wed forced him to write the nonsense in order to try and clear ourselves no the only way well be able to convince the authorities is by going out to maddons rock and bringing back a bar or two of the bullion an ow the ell dyer fink were going ter do that chum spitzbergen e said an even i know where that is way up in the ruddy harctic thats where wed ave ter ave a boat he suddenly seized my arm a boat blimey i wonder if miss jennifer just what i was wondering bert i said it was just a chance a ton ketch with an auxiliary engine it might make it well go to oban i said ere old on a minute guvnor bert said yer just kiddin yerself thats all wed never make it i aint a sailor wed need two more for crew and well i reckn wed be a lot safer in dartmoor safer i agreed but not so happy theres just a chance we might make it and its the only chance that i can see lets go up anyway id like to see jenny again okay he said gloomily the ruddy harctic it is but dont say i didnt warn yer gawd why wasnt i in a reserved occipation at that moment we came out into a busy thoroughfare full of lights we took a bus to the outskirts of the town and at a roadside cafe we found a lorry going north to edinburgh chapter seven maddons rock we reached oban shortly after midday on sunday th march the sun shone and the water between the town and the island of kerrera looked almost blue beyond kerrera the mountains of mull stood out clear and brown in the rainwashed atmosphere we hitched a ride to connel ferry and there we were directed to the sorrels house it stood back from the road on a sloping hillside surrounded by pines from the drive we could see past the iron girders of the railway bridge that spanned the narrow racing waters of loch etive out to the morven hills and eastward through a gap in the first we got a glimpse of the lofty mass of ben cruachan the tip of it gleamed white in the sunlight with the remains of the winters snow an old woman opened the door to us i told her my name and she disappeared reckn you oughterve telephoned bert said sppose she dont want ter see us i mean it aint as if we was respecable dont ferget were a couple o escaped convics until he spoke of it i dont think it had occurred to me that our presence might be an embarrassment i had no claims on jenny and yet i had turned to her naturally taking it for granted that she would assist us as though she were my own kin i had been so excited at the thought of seeing her again that i had not considered it from her point of view but standing there on the doorstep of what was obviously a respectable scottish home i felt like a trespasser for all i knew her father might be a local justice of the peace the old woman returned and led us down a long carpeted passage she opened a door and we found ourselves in a big booklined study with french windows leading out on to lawns sloping away towards the loch a fire blazed cheerfully in a big open hearth it was jennys father who came forward to meet us we have been expecting you he said shaking me by the hand expecting us i echoed in astonishment yes he said smiling and leading us to the fire you see ive little else to do these days but read the papers as soon as i showed her the paragraph about your escape she was sure that if you succeeded youd come here shell be sorry shes not here to welcome you shes away to mull about some fowl the macleods have promised her and he went on talking quietly in his soft highland voice until i felt as though id arrived home after a long journey i dont know what we said or how much we told him then looking back on it all i can remember is that he gave us the nicest welcome any man could give to two tired wanderers the warmth of his personality like the warmth of the fire gave us a delightful sense of ease and relaxation peace stole over my taut nerves and i became drowsy with the luxury of feeling that i was amongst friends no longer on the run with every mans hand turned against me he gave us tea a real scots tea with all sorts of homemade scones and girdle cakes homemade jam and farm butter and when we had finished he said jim if youre not feeling too weary and would care for a walk youd just about be in time to meet jenny coming up from the village she said shed be back by four bert and i will have a wee chat whilst youre gone and his blue eyes twinkled at me from beneath the shaggy white brows he came with me to the door we anchor the eilean mor down under dunstaffnage castle he said you cant miss it go through connel and youll see it amongst some trees on a promontory across a little inlet of water shell be coming ashore in the dinghy at dunbeg he paused in the open doorway and put his hand on my shoulder shell be glad to know youre safe he said and dont be worryin yourself about staying here well be glad to have you and youll be safe here well consider whats to be done about you later i didnt know what to say i tried to thank him but he pushed me gently out into the drive and closed the door as i walked down to the cold waters of the loch i could not believe there was such a place as dartmoor i reached the road and followed it through connel till i was clear of the houses and had a view across a little inlet of water the wavelets sparkled in the westering sun the pebble beach shone yellow and there was dunstaffnage castle its mellow stone merging into the trees that half hid it from view and out beyond the tip of the little promontory a small ship stood in towards the shore under a press of white canvas heeling gracefully to the wind that blew down the loch it luffed easily and came round on to the starbd tack making for the inlet then the sails dropped gently from her mast the anchor clattered and she swung round pointing her bows to the ebbing tide that raced under connel bridge i could see jenny dressed in jersey and slacks helping an elderly man to stow the sails then the dinghy was pulled up alongside and he began to row her ashore i didnt wave i was excited and wretched all in the same moment if only things had been different she saw me when she was halfway to the shore she was shading her eyes from the dazzle of the water with her hand behind her the eilean mor rode gracefully at anchor her reflection dancing in the water suddenly jenny waved i waved back i went down to the waters edge and grasped the bow of the dinghy as it beached she jumped out and took both my hands in hers oh jim she said is it really you her face all white with salt was alight with excitement how did you get here was it difficult and then she laughed ive got so many questions to ask you she turned to the man who was pulling the dinghy ashore mac she said i want you to meet an old friend of mine jim this is macpherson our boatman hes my water shadow he goes everywhere the eilean mor and i go the old man touched his cap he was gnarled and bent with very blue eyes in a dour weatherbeaten face she sent him off then and as soon as he was out of earshot she said jim did you go to newcastle i was startled by her question why do you ask that i said daddy said you would she replied hes convinced that you escaped because of that she looked up at me quickly her grey eyes inquiring you did know that halsey was fitting out a salvage tug at newcastle to lift the trikkalas bullion didnt you yes i said was that why you escaped i nodded so daddy was right her eyes danced with excitement did you go to newcastle did you find anything out oh do tell me what did you discover that the trikkala never sank i told her her mouth fell open with astonishment never sank then she laughed oh jim youre fooling then she gazed at me seriously you meant what you said didnt you she was puzzled groping for the truth the trikkala never sank she repeated slowly unbelievingly to herself who told you that rankin i said we beat him up and got the truth out of him nothing would content her then but i must sit down with her on that pebble beach and tell her the whole story when i had finished she sat silent for a moment it was then i discovered that all the time i had been talking i had been holding her hand in mine its unbelievable she whispered to send those men to their death like that i cant believe it jim its as though youd told me he made them walk the plank and yet it explains all those little things we couldnt understand even so i cant believe a man would really do a thing like that its true enough i said no good my going to the police with the story is it she shook her head no she said i believe you because i know you and know the circumstances but the police wouldnt believe you its too fantastic the truth is often fantastic i said yes she said but not that fantastic the authorities would say youd made it up rankin would swear he said the first thing that came into his head to save himself from being killed youll see tomorrow the papers will have a full story of how he was beaten up by two escaped prisoners in revenge for bringing the charges all the evidence would be against you the trikkala crowd would hang together just as they did at the courtmartial she looked at me suddenly her grey eyes level and serious jim she said weve got to get proof i could have kissed her for saying we as though the problem were hers as much as mine and as though she guessed what was in my mind she gently withdrew her hand theres only one way i can get proof i said yes she said only one way where is maddons rock she asked near bear island rankin said i replied thats just south of spitzbergen she sat thoughtfully sifting pebbles through her fingers for a moment its a bad sea area up there she said and then whens halsey due to sail the nd of april i replied but he may get nervous and advance his sailing date and todays the th of march she murmured if you could bring back some of the bullion that would be proof that even the dimmestwitted official would understand she turned to me and said hesitantly jim was that why you came here how do you mean i asked because you wanted me to lend you the eilean mor i stared at her i i am afraid i had some idea like that i said hesitantly you see jenny i didnt know anyone else who had a boat whod stand by me but i thought i stopped then her eyes were veiled and she turned away yes she said ill let you have the eilean mor her voice was flat and she was staring out to where the bare masts nodded gently against the setting sun i thought she was thinking of the terrible seas through which the little ship would have to batter her way i knew she loved the boat she suddenly scrambled to her feet come on she said well go and have a look at the charts the admiralty very kindly left me with a complete set for this area id like to see exactly where maddons rock is she was tugging at the dinghy i got up and together we pulled it down to the water then i rowed her across to the eilean mor it was a sturdy little vessel very neat and wellcared for with white paintwork and gleaming brass as i followed her across the deck i experienced that wonderful sense of freedom that a ship of whatever size gives she took me aft to the little wheelhouse from a locker under the chart table she produced a stack of admiralty charts there you are she said you look through those ill see if i can find a book that gives the danger spots of the north ive got one here somewhere i began to run quickly through the dusty charts at length i found the one i wanted bear island jenny suddenly interrupted my search for maddons rock here we are she said ive found it she had a book open in her hands latitude north longitude east she read would you like to hear what it says about the rock yes read it i said and ill try to locate it on the chart fraid youre not going to like it she said maddons rock she read a lonely rocky island inhabited at certain times of the year by a variety of seabirds little is known about it landings have been made on it on less than a dozen recorded occasions ships will do well to avoid this area heavy seas run here throughout the year and the island and the reefs round it are mostly hidden in spray the extent of the reefs is not known the area has only been superficially charted drift ice can be expected in the winter thats all sounds a pleasant spot doesnt it not too good i agreed thats probably why they chose it here we are i said ive found it on the chart its just in the barents sea and a good miles inside the southern limit of drift ice she leaned over my shoulder as i marked the spot with a pencil thank god its spring not winter i said then i straightened up and youll really let me have the boat jenny i asked i thought the account of the place might have made her change her mind i mean you do realise that you may never see her again i added she was looking at me with a strange expression in her eyes yes she said i realise that she hesitated and then said quickly you can have her jim but on one condition she loved the boat i knew that and when she gave it to me like that i felt staggered at her trust in me i took her hand in mine you really are a pal jenny i said i dont know when ill be able to repay you but i will and if we find the trikkala ill claim salvage then i really will be able to repay you she took her hand away you havent heard my condition yet jim she said ill accept any conditions you know that i was so excited by the prospect of actually having the chance to beat halsey to maddons rock that i would have agreed to anything i hope so she said doubtfully well what is your condition i asked youll go in charge of the expedition of course she said but i want to put in my own skipper and crew your own skipper and crew i echoed but where will you find anyone to go on a madcap expedition like this besides how will we explain i mean theyll want to know who bert and i are and not my skipper she interrupted well who is he i asked a local man she shook her head no she said and then suddenly looking straight at me im going to skipper her myself jim she said her tone was flat decisive she hurried on macpherson will come in charge of the engine hes been a ships engineer since he was a boy i was staggered but jenny youre not serious she was though i could see it in the set of her firm jaw the level look of her grey eyes she was serious all right i tried to argue her out of it but all she said was you need a crew of four on the eilean mor you know that anyway thats my condition but jenny i said you can t come on a trip like this theres your father and ill settle it with my father she interrupted i started to argue again but she cut me short either i come as skipper or you dont get the boat she said you mean that i asked i felt dispirited yesshe replied then theres no alternative i said ill have to give myself up and just hope that the authorities will believe what i tell them you know they wont she said yes but what else can i do she put her hand on my arm jim im offering you a boat and a crew she said oh dont be silly i said i felt exasperated to be offered the means i needed and then for the offer to be coupled with a condition i could not accept she said if you give yourself up i shall sail for maddons rock myself i looked at her quickly that expression was back in her eyes something i could not understand could not be sure of why i asked why she shrugged her shoulders i caught her hand yes tell me why why would you do that she took her hand away and bent over the chart just for the hell of it i suppose i caught her shoulder then thats not the reason my voice sounded harsh yes it is she said i like taking risks if youre scared to take me to maddons rock ill go myself i stared at her i believe you would too i said she pushed the hair out of her eyes and looked at me yes she said i would now are you accepting my condition i said all right if your father agrees she seemed satisfied with this and we went back to the house it never occurred to me that her father would agree to her going on such a dangerous expedition but that night when jenny had gone to bed he produced a bottle of old liqueur whisky he sat over his glass for a while staring into the fire at length he turned to me youve heard jennys condition yes i said i told her id accept provided you agreed aye he nodded well i agree he said suddenly but good god i said you dont realise the danger he chuckled och yes i do he said but theres no holdin jenny when shes the bit between her teeth she intends to come with you and theres an end of it she always was a headstrong lass shes as wild as her mother was he turned back to the fire and began to chuckle to himself i mind the first time her mother and i worried about her shed smuggled herself on to the macleods boat when they were away to the fishing gone more than thirty hours she was and her only seven years old after that it was just one thing after another until we ceased worrying about her yes she was always a madcap he looked up again but then you see the way i look at it is you can be as careful of yourself as you like and then get killed crossing the road and theres no fun in life if youre always worrying about whether its safe or not he got up to refill our glasses as he handed me mine he suddenly put his hand on my shoulder as hed done that afternoon i like you my boy he said youve got guts and youre no fool whats more i believe your story i dont pretend to understand the nature of this man halsey but i know this ill do what i can to help you come out the winner and ill even trust jenny to you he chuckled as he sat down but for you she wouldnt be alive now anyway and so the matter was settled for me jenny came as skipper at breakfast next morning she had a smug little grin on her face i still didnt like it it was bad enough going up there myself in a ton ketch but to be responsible for her life as well however her enthusiasm was infectious she and her father went at the preparations like a couple of children planning an outing there was plenty to do stores to be acquired for three months a second suit of sails storm sails diesel oil for the engine spare rigging ropes tools fishing tackle oilskins sheepskin duffle coats her father financed us but it wasnt easy to get these things in restricted regulated rationed britain it took us nearly three weeks to acquire all the things that we regarded as absolute essentials for a voyage of this nature in such a small boat bert and i could do little for we dared not risk being questioned most of the stores and equipment were acquired by jenny and her father jenny knew her way about oban and tobermory she wheedled some of the stuff out of the navy the thing that really stumped us for a time was diesel oil but we got it in the end from a dutch freighter that put into oban during a storm those three weeks were as happy as i could remember for a long time i took the eilean mor out most days to get the feel of her and to teach bert the rudiments of sailing she was easy to handle and rode a rough patch well the more i saw of her the more confident i felt that we had at least a chance even bert a landlubber if ever there was one began to regard her with respect in the evenings wed discuss the successes and failures of the day but always there was something good to report jenny had managed to get some tinned meat or her father had persuaded some firm to let us have the clothing we needed till finally the day came when wed everything that we could reasonably want i could have wished for a radio transmitter but since none of us knew anything about it perhaps it was just as well on the afternoon of friday the th of april we took the eilean mor into oban and filled up her tanks with diesel oil two great gallon drums were lashed to her decks below everything was stowed and packed even our quarters were cramped because they had been invaded by our provisions god knows where it had all come from but there it was and now the final snag had been overcome we had got our diesel oil that evening jenny and i strolled down to the loch and along the road under connel bridge till we could see the eilean mor lying under dunstaffnage castle there doesnt she look lovely she murmured she had her arm in mine and her face looked dreamy as she gazed out to her boat yes i said she looks lovely everything was very still there was no sound except for the weird cry of an oyster catcher down by the shingle strand the water was flat and silvery the eilean mor looked like a toy ship on a sheet of glass she had her bows pointed to the north as though she were eager for the adventure out beyond dunstaffnage castle was the island whose name she bore beyond the hills had all gone purple in the evening light they seemed remote but friendly the hills of mull morven ardgour moidart and in the far distance the hills of skye tomorrow early we should glide out from the shelter of those hills through the sound of mull up past skye through the little minch to the hebrides then we should turn nornoreast past cape wrath and the shetlands and the faroes out into the unknown i wondered whether we should ever see those friendly sheltered lochs again isnt it wonderfully still jenny murmured i love to come here and look at dunstaffnage when its so still you can see the castles reflection clear in the water the world seems so at peace then she suddenly turned her face to me i feel you know like one does when one is very happy afraid it wont last i was looking down into her eyes i felt tenderness and longing fused in my blood are you happy jenny i asked and my voice sounded hoarse and strange yes jim she answered meeting my gaze very happy then she looked away towards the eilean mor again but she hesitated scared she shook her head laughing just a funny feeling inside she was still looking out across the loch i wish the barents sea was calm and still like this she said if it were they wouldnt have beached the trikkala there i said they chose maddons rock because there was little likelihood of anyone landing on it i was looking at the little vessel lying so quiet and at home in that backwater she looks sturdy enough down there i said but out beyond the faroes well hit some pretty big seas i hope shell seem as sturdy then the forecast is for fine weather jenny said and shell stand up to anything within reason within reason yes i agreed but we may meet storms out there that are not within reason and when we get to maddons rock we may have to hang around for days before we can get in through the reefs and by that time halsey and his tug may have arrived anything could happen then my imagination pictured it all so clearly the giant seas the barrier of wicked reefs with a narrow foamfilled gap and the black frozen rocks it was frightening enough to face it on ones own but with jenny why dont you drop the idea of coming with us i asked and then i had an idea suppose we dont come back if you were here you could get in touch with the police and get some sort of an investigation going she looked up at me with an almost boyish smile no good jim she said thats already taken care of daddy will see to it ive left a letter with him explaining all the circumstances hes to let the police the board of trade and the press have it if were not back within three months or if halseys tug gets in before us dont you see she added the mere fact that ive gone on such a trip will make the press at any rate interested i see i said youve thought of everything havent you but i still wish youd stay dont lets go into all that again she pleaded not tonight its so lovely out here lets pretend just for now that weve not a care in the world im saying goodbye to places i love just for tonight i want to feel happy and at peace with the world yes but she interrupted me with a sudden flash of anger in her eyes macpherson and i are coming and thats all there is to it her voice was strained almost violent i can handle the eilean mor better than anyone and macs been a sailor all his life i know hes getting on he must be nearly sixty but hes tough and hes no family to worry about just leave it at that will you jim her voice had dropped to a pleading note again we stood silent for a moment staring out to the fading line of the hills her hand was still on my arm i could feel the warmth of her body as she stood close against me i want to go up to the top of the hill behind here she said suddenly up there through the pines theres a grassy knoll you can see ben cruachan from the top of it as we turned and climbed slowly through the tall pines she said ben cruachans my old man of the mountains i always feel that if i say goodbye to him nicely hell look after me and see me home safely so we said goodbye to that distant snowcapped mountain and came down to our farewell dinner mac was there and bert and the old man was drinking hot rum punch with jennys father when we came in jenny disappeared and came down later radiant in a long black evening gown with a silver girdle the table groaned with the best that the farm could offer and afterwards there was old port and liqueur whisky the only reminder of the dangers ahead was when jennys father proposed the toast of the eilean mor when i gave you the boat jenny she was the best i could find i hope she proves worthy of her trust and then he added the lord bless you all and go with you there were tears in jennys eyes as she drank to the eilean mor it was late that night when her father lighted me to my room we were warm with drink he paused at my door and said dont let her do anything foolish jim shes a wild lass and shell be trying to play the man her mother is dead and her brother was killed at st nazaire shes all ive got left at the same time she must not be a hindrance to you im trusting you to do what you think is right he took my hand the skin of his fingers was dry and old but the warmth and friendliness of that handshake brought a lump to my throat i like being old he said his eyes twinkling in the lamplight but there are times when its irksome if i were just a few years younger id be coming with you i thought i should never go to sleep so many thoughts were chasing themselves through my mind as i climbed between the cold sheets but the warmth of the drink closed my eyes almost at once and the next thing i knew it was morning and maggie their old servant was shaking me it was a cold crisp morning the sky was blue the sun sparkled on the waters of the loch the hills were hidden in white trailing mists jennys father came down to the lochside to see us off his tall erect figure stood alone on the yellow beach as we rowed out to the eilean mor mac went below and started the engine the decks throbbed gently as we weighed anchor jenny stood in the wheelhouse i felt the little ship shudder slightly as the screw bit into the water and we slid quietly out into the tideway and made the tip of the promontory jenny left the wheel for a moment and stood on the deck looking back to the beach where her father stood his figure looked very small and solitary alone there on the beach we waved he waved back and then turned and walked resolutely up towards the road he never looked back through the pines we caught a glimpse of the house the brick mellow in the morning sunlight then the promontory shut us off jenny went back into the wheelhouse i think she was crying i went forard our bows were pointed towards the white pinnacle of the lighthouse on eilean musdile beyond lay the sound of mull the water was oily calm with a long flat swell running after a while i went into the wheelhouse jenny had the log out i watched over her shoulder as she wrote saturday th april am weighed anchor and left mooring under dunstaffnage castle outward bound for maddons rock weather fair the voyage had begun in the firth of lome we picked up a steady soueasterly breeze and set our sails as the mainsl filled jenny ordered mac to switch the engine off every drop of fuel was precious shortly after eight we passed between the halfsubmerged ladys rock and eilean musdile the race that runs below the lighthouse frothed with broken wave caps on our starbd beam the sound of mull opened out before us the veil of mist was drawing back from the hills now and we could see their lower slopes as we came under the lee of mull the sails flapped idly and we ran on our engine through the sound midday found us clear of the sound with tobermory astern and leaning under full canvas to a steady soueasterly breeze we rounded ardnamurchan point and with the wind on our starboard quarter we made a steady six knots in a long easy swell by nightfall we were abreast of skye and running into the little minch between skye and the hebrides and when morning came cold and grey with a damp drizzle cape wrath was astern of us there were no friendly hills around us now the sea stretched in a desolate restless waste to the horizon in every direction and our bows were headed some degrees east of magnetic north the third day out we ran between the shetlands and faroes without sighting either of the island groups the thin drizzle that we had picked up off cape wrath stayed with us reducing visibility to a few miles the wind had gone round to the souwest raf weather forecasts which we were able to pick up easily on the long waveband of our radio in the wheelhouse remained fair with the wind practically dead astern we were being hurried north with the long lines of the waves that heaved themselves regularlymonotonously under our keel we had no need of the engine we sailed under full canvas and the eilean mor went like a bird an incident occurred that monday which had a bearing on a decision we made later it was just after two in the afternoon i was forard repairing a cleat that had come adrift jenny who was at the helm suddenly hailed me into the wheelhouse her voice was urgent excited when i joined her i found her listening to the radio two men were talking its the bbcs broadcast to schools she said see if you recognise anyone i listened a bbc reporter said and how do you propose to locate it a voice answered were using asdic that is the instrument used during the war to locate uboats this vessel was fitted with asdic when we bought her there was something about that voice that stirred a memory it was clear distinct it was as clear a voice as the reporters it might have been an actors voice he was speaking again as soon as we have located the wreck we shall send a diver down to investigate we are equipped with the very latest in diving gear if as i believe the trikkala is resting on a rock shelf my godi said halsey yes halsey jenny said listen just before the end of the broadcast we heard the information we wanted and when will you sail captain halsey asked the reporter i was planning to leave a week today but equipment has been coming through quicker than i thought and with luck i may be away the day after tomorrow well captain halsey we wish you all the best in your treasure hunt and well look forward with interest to hearing what you bring back with you jenny and i looked at each other the day after tomorrow that meant that if he got away then wed only be five days ahead of him the margin seemed all too narrow still five days could be time enough if luck was with us and the weather held fair i stared out through the glass windshield at the grey tossing waters not a ship not a sign of land and yet through that radio we had just heard halsey talking in newcastle from the deck of his tug it seemed incredible that we could be linked for an instant like that so great did the distance between us now seem five days isnt much of a start for a small sailing boat against an exadmiralty tug capable of around twelve knots but all that week the wind was with us varying between souwest and norwest the weather kept fair and the seas moderate at any rate moderate for these waters for five days we ran before the wind on a line almost parallel to the norwegian coast which was about miles to starboard of us if anything our course was a little north of the line of the norwegian coast for maddons rock lies almost midway between bear island and jan meyen island and all that time the eilean mor made between five and eight knots without our once having to make use of the engine on the tuesday we ran into a long vicious swell that had us all feeling a little uneasy in the stomach even mac had a faraway look in his eyes bert who was acting cook emerged from the galley with a face that was a pallid green and glistened with sweat strewf he said me breadbaskets playin me tricks then he added jist my luck to click fer the job of cookin me names bin me danfall ever since i joined the army you wots yer name cook right you fer the cookhase joke see never knew a sergeantmajor wot could resist it he suddenly clutched his stomach and dived for the rail by nightfall the wind had freshened and the movement of the ship was more violent and consequently not so disturbing bert with the adaptability of the cockney was becoming a passable seaman by the end of the week he was standing his turn at the wheel though only during the daytime the first week of that voyage i enjoyed with a following wind fair weather and a moderate sea the work of sailing the ship was not great i spent a lot of the time in the wheelhouse chatting to jenny in blue slacks a red polonecked jersey and her hair brushed straight back from her forehead she looked neat and businesslike she was a very efficient skipper and knew how to get the best out of her ship we logged nearly miles in that first week and if it hadnt been for the uncertainty of what lay ahead that would have been the happiest trip of my life but on the sunday it began to blow hard out of the north the glass fell and the weather forecasts spoke of nothing but depressions their centre was iceland which lay on our port bow with every days sailing it had got colder and now an icy sleet closed about us with promise of bitter cold ahead but luck seemed to be with us by monday the wind was back in its old quarter souwest and we were running full on our course before a small gale by the middle of the second week out the glass had risen again and we were sailing through cold brittle sunlight with only a little over miles to go weather forecasts were good again and the chances of arriving at maddons rock in fairish weather looked reasonably bright one thing only was really worrying me halsey in that broadcast had spoken of advancing his sailing date to the th of april if he had in fact got away on that day and if he had set a course direct for maddons rock i figured that at an average of ten knots he couldnt be more than two days behind us i wished to god we had definite information as to the date of his departure another thing would he dare set his course direct for maddons rock surely he would play safe and at least make a show of going to the supposed wreck of the trikkala i kept my counsel to myself but i realised that it was a point that was worrying jenny for on the wednesday she suddenly said i wonder where halsey is jim i think hed make for the position at which the trikkala is supposed to have been sunk before running north to maddons rock dont you i hope so i said he must do she added hed want a ship or two to be able to say they had seen his tug on the right course hed never make direct for the rock unless hes worried about you getting there first she gave me a quick glance you didnt give him any indication that you were planning to go after the trikkala yourself did you of course not i said her brows were wrinkled still hed naturally be worried if you were capable of escaping from dartmoor he wouldnt rule out the possibility of your making an attempt to get to maddons rock thats probably why he advanced his sailing date i wish i knew when he actually sailed since that broadcast ive listened to every news bulletin in the hopes of hearing some announcement about it but theres been nothing the weather was very cold now we struck a lot of sleet and visibility generally was poor but the wind held varying as before between souwest and norwest so that we made good progress on sunday the th of april i managed to shoot the sun through a gap in the clouds i was thus able to confirm our position it checked up pretty well with our estimate for with the wind mainly astern wed not been blown off our course at all were approximately miles sousouwest of the rock i told jenny who was at the wheel when do you reckon well make it she asked i glanced at my watch it was threethirty we were logging just over four knots in a rather steep sea about midday tomorrow i said if we keep our present speed she nodded goodshe said we may just make it in time ive just heard a meteorological bulletin its not so good theres dirty weather coming up behind us the glass is falling too im afraid were about due for a blow well weve been lucky enough so far i said she turned suddenly towards me you know jim even with the sea like this we may not be able to reach the trikkala we dont know what the place is like rankin said theyd beached the trikkala that means inside the reefs doesnt it yes i said he spoke of going in through a gap and that gap may only be navigable on a really calm day dont forget what that book of mine said there are less than a dozen known instances of landings being made on the island this is probably quite a calm day for these waters but the seas are big enough right now maddons rock is probably hidden in a mist of spray and the gap in the reefs made unapproachable by a mad tumble of waves dont forget i pointed out that they managed to beach the trikkala and get out again through the gap in an open boat that was smaller than this and from the time we abandoned ship to the time they were picked up near the faroes was only days they must have taken the trikkala straight in and come straight out again in their boat they may have struck lucky with the weather she said pray god we strike lucky with it at best well only have a few days to spare before halsey arrives with his tug if we dont get in before then well we might just as well not have come well get no proof and if he catches us inside she didnt complete the sentence lucks been with us so far i said well manage somehow she faced me then jim she said youre sure rankin was telling the truth i mean it seems so fantastic beaching a ship right up here and leaving it packed with silver bullion for over a year it sounded all right when you told me about it but that was in oban right up here in this waste of sea it seems well it seems daft your guess is as good as mine jenny i answered but at the time i certainly felt it was the truth it was too fantastic a story for him to have made up i shrugged my shoulders oh well i added well know tomorrow if the weather holds as if in answer our conversation was interrupted by another meteorological announcement my heart sank as i listened to it a gale warning was now in operation in sea areas hebrides and irish sea from midatlantic to the north of scotland the weather was uniformly bad with the wind strong to gale force according to the locality that night the glass began to fall in earnest next morning the sea was about the same but the wind had risen and was coming in gusts so that the eilean mor would suddenly heel over and thrust her bowsprit deep into the back of a wave all that morning the wind was erratic in both direction and strength the eilean mor took it all in good part but it was not easy keeping her on her course there was no sleet but the clouds were low and visibility poor not above two or three miles the glass continued to fall weather forecasts were uniformly bad i tried to appear unconcerned but deep down inside me i was scared the bad weather must be right behind us now and we were approaching an island surrounded by reefs that were only superficially charted my chief worry was that we should fail to locate maddons rock before nightfall by then the gale would be upon us and the idea of running before a storm in these seas with no certainty that the island was behind us was a frightening thought midday came visibility was still not above three miles at the outside the wind was beginning to whine in the shrouds and the gusts were angry buffets of air that whisked the broken tops off the waves and flung them in great curtains of spray across the ship we were reefed down but even so the little ship was inclined to bury her bows under the weight of the wind bert staggered into the wheelhouse with a couple of mugs ere we are he said cup o char fer the skipper an one fer you mate he put the mugs down on the chart table nearly there he asked me any minute now i said trying to appear confident an abat high time too he said with a grin that failed to hide his nervousness me guts is fair dizzy wiv all this pitchin an tossin an mac e says theres bad wevver blowin up claims e can smell it he can too jenny said as she reached for her mug ive never know mac wrong about the weather if he cant smell it his rheumatism tells him i drank my tea and went out on to the heaving deck visibility was getting worse i strained my eyes through the leaden murk there was nothing absolutely nothing but the grey gusttorn sea heaving and breaking all about us every now and then the break of a wave crest caught us at the gunl and bathed the ship in spray bert came out and joined me fink were runnin past it he asked i dont know i glanced at my watch it was getting on for one its possible difficult to correct accurately for drift up here any sign of the rock yet jim jenny called from the wheelhouse no i shouted back not a sign gawd luv us its cold at ere bert said got a nice drop o stew on when yer want it ullo mac yer old misery the scot lifted his nose to the weather as he emerged from below and sniffed at it like a bloodhound coming out of its kennel come up ter ave anuvver sniff at the wevver bert went on es bin bellyaching abat is rheumatics all this mornin aye theres dirty weather on our backsides the scot gave a cackle yell see yell no be worrit aboot yer stew then nice cheerful bloke you are i dont fink bert answered back then suddenly he seized my arm hey jim wots that straight ahead come ere yer cant see it fer the jib he pulled me a few paces to the side so that i had a clear view forard there yer are looks like a bad patch dont it straight ahead of us about a mile distant the sea was all broken up and thrown about as though it were in the grip of a tidal race i yelled to jenny but she had seen it ready about she shouted gawd exclaimed bert look at that sea breaking the broken water was hidden in a great patch of white foam from which the wind whipped a grey curtain of spray i knew what it was then submerged rocks come on jump to it i shouted at bert a moment later the eilean mor came round canvas slatting violently in a gust and we were running due east with our port gunls awash and the wind on our starboard quarter the submerged rocks were away to port now a flurry of foamflecked water in the grey misery of the sea and then beyond that patch of foam something showed for a second black and wicked in a gap in the curtain of driven spray did yer see that bert asked yes i shouted back as i fixed the jib rock its gone now bert said idden in a beastly great sheet of spray no there it is again look i straightened up and followed the line of his outflung arm for a second the veil of spray was drawn back a great rock with sheer cliffs several hundred feet high stood out of the water which writhed and foamed at its base then a wave curled high and flung itself at the rock face a great burst of white water billowed up the cliffs like the explosion of a depth charge the next instant the wind had carried the spray of it across the rock and there was nothing there but a leaden curtain of mist its gone again bert cried his voice was pitched high with excitement and awe did yer see that wave it it seemed ter break right over it reckn we bin led up the garding paf nobody wouldnt beach a ship there the shock of that sight was like a blow below the belt it took all the strength out of me doesnt look like it i said no ship could live in a place like that and this was a relatively quiet day what in gods name was it like in a inn storm i thought of the gale that was mounting behind us i you two stay here i told mac and bert and watch out for reefs i m going to relieve jenny at the wheel aye said macan yed best tell miss jenny to shorten sail an rin clear of the area whilst we can still see what were running into bloomin pessimist you are bert shouted but his face looked small and scared i went into the wheelhouse jenny stood close against the wheel her legs braced her body taut her head was lifted slightly as she watched the sails ill take over for a bit shall ii said she handed me the wheel and took up the log book i suppose that is maddons rock she asked doubtfully i think it must be i said she nodded and wrote monday th april pm sighted maddons rock wind rising expecting gale she closed the book and straightened herself peering out through the glass windshield do you think theres any chance of a ship existing there for a whole year she asked i glanced away to port where the rock showed momentarily through a gap in the spray well i answered if they did beach her there they must have had a reason to think it was safe again a glimpse of the rock it was smooth and black like the back of a seal it was shaped like a wedge high cliffs to the west rising straight out of the sea and then sloping away to the east we were running along the southern flank of it i should say it was about three miles away the nearest reefs at any rate were a good mile probably two what about getting in a bit closer i said macs worried about the weather says we ought to get clear of those reefs before it closes in and begins to blow hes right too i suggest we edge in as close as we dare to the reefs run the length of them and if we cant find the gap or if its impassable drive east before the wind okay she took the wheel again whilst we went about and stood in towards the reefs when we had closed to within half a mile of the boiling surf we turned east again and began to run down the line of the surf eastwards when we were fully abreast of the island we could see it quite plainly why it was called maddons rock heaven knows it should have been called whale island for it was shaped just like a whale a hammerhead with its blunt nose facing to the west above the sound of the wind we could hear the perpetual thunderous roar of the surf along the reefs visibility had improved a bit and we could see them stretching in a line parallel to the island and far beyond it to the east it was as wicked a patch of sea as i have ever seen the rocks that formed the reef seemed much of a height as though they were formed by a ledge that had been tilted back by some disturbance of the earths surface they were practically submerged but now and then we caught a glimpse of black surfworn rock from which the water poured only to be lifted back by the next wave i picked up the glasses and searched the rock itself it was absolutely smooth as though worn by a million years of ice and sea bert came into the wheelhouse then fair awful aint it he said mind if i ave a look fru them glasses i handed them to him itll be dark in two or free hours he muttered dont yer reckn we oughter do as mac says i mean this spot aint the rand pond yer cant just anchor up for the night he was looking through the glasses now and i suddenly saw him stiffen hey he cried excitedly wots that on the far side a rock its sort o square like a shelter or summat square an black ere you ave a look he passed me the glasses just where it slopes into the water i picked it up at once low down to the east of the island as though it were the tail fin of the whale ive got it i said its not a rock it would have been worn smooth like the rest of the island if it were and then i realised what it was by god i cried its the top of a funnel i thrust the glasses into jennys hand and took the wheel its the top of the trikkalas funnel shes beached on the other side of that shoulder that slopes down into the sea all thought of the impending gale and of the danger of our position was lost for the time being in the excitement of watching that distant square lengthen into a funnel as we ran down the reefs soon we could see one of her masts and a bit of the superstructure it was incredible but there she was no doubt of that the reefs stretched eastward in a strip like a long forefinger it took us half an hour to double the tip and then closehauled we drove northward we were about two miles to the east of the tailend of maddons rock we could see the whole of the trikkala through the glasses we could see her lying high and dry on a little shelving beach like a stranded fish she was heeled over at a crazy angle and red with rust two shoulders of black sleek rock enclosed that little beach sheltering her from the prevailing winds curtains of spray poured across the back of the island spume thrown up by the waves dashing against the high cliffs at the western end every now and then this curtain blotted out ship and island it was less than two miles away now an anchorage under a lee shore a ton freighter and half a million in silver bullion and no sign of halseys tug there was the evidence we wanted almost within our grasp but between us and that sheltered beach was a band of raging surf the reefs seemed to encircle all but the sheer western side of the island but here to the east they were not a regular halfsubmerged line but a jumble of jagged blackened teeth amongst which the waves tumbled in a riot of unholy violence when we were within perhaps half a mile of this mad chaos of water we saw the gap perhaps i should say that we saw what we thought to be the gap for it was so smothered in foam that it was impossible to be certain it was then shortly after three to the east of us the sea looked clear of reefs and we decided to press on to the north to check whether there was any other break in the reefs by four we were heading norwest following the line of the reefs round the island we had seen nothing that looked like a gap and the trikkala was slowly being hidden from view by the northern shoulder of the rock we went about then and struggled back with our head almost in the teeth of the wind along the vicious line of tumbled surf no doubt about it that was the gap right opposite the little beach on which the trikkala rested it took us nearly an hour to beat back to the gap we didnt talk much i think we were all of us overawed by the decision that had to be made the wind was rising now and the glass was as low as id ever seen it but as yet the seas were not much bigger than they had been during the past few days especially in the lee of the island the waves had no weight behind them yet there was none of the heavy deepsea swell of the kind that might run in this area for weeks at a time after bad weather the decision that lay before us was whether or not to go straight in and risk being overwhelmed in the mad tumble of surf that smothered the gap chapter eight the trikkala at length we were abreast of the gap jenny was at the wheel she had edged the eilean mor in close so that we could have a good look at it it was barely a quarter of a mile away on our starboard beam there was no doubt about it being a gap a pinnacle of rock stood on a ledge to the left of the entrance it was like a lighthouse but bigger more solid it was against this that the waves broke each wave seemed to pile up to a great height on a submerged ledge crash against this pinnacle and then fling itself in a great wall of foam across the gap which was a good fifty yards wide on the farther side the wave seemed to reform pile up and break against a solid mass of broken jagged rocks from these it would fall back and its backwash would meet the next wave spilling across the gap and the sea would toss itself upward in a giant leap as though it were trying to reach up to the lowhanging cloud it was a most frightening patch of water just occasionally there would be a momentary lull it was then that we could see that it was a clear gap and beyond where the trikkala lay beached the water seemed reasonably quiet protected as it was on all sides by the reefs do you think theres any chance of getting through there jenny asked me we were alone in the wheelhouse god knows i replied all i know is that halsey took the trikkala in through that gap and there she lies apparently intact and he came out again in an open boat with five men in it what shall we do then jenny asked weve got to decide now the winds getting up itll be dark soon weve got to make up our minds her voice was uncertain she was staring at the gap the eilean mor lurched violently jenny turned to me as she tightened her grip on the wheel shall we stand away and run for it or shall we chance it and go in i didnt know what to answer there lay the trikkala within our grasp and yet the thought of jenny being flung into the boiling surf if the eilean mor broke up going through the gap scared me youre the skipper jenny i said at length oh be reasonable jim she cried i cant decide a thing like this on my own ive no idea what the reef looks like in fine weather weve had it fair for the better part of two weeks now this may be calm for maddons rock if we wait till the storm has blown itself out it may be weeks before we can approach as near the island as this and halsey would be here by then youve got to help me decide what would you do if you and bert and mac were here on your own i dont know i said i hadnt considered it you must make the decision yourself youre the skipper and its your boat the decision has to be yours she was looking straight at me her grey eyes very steady her brow slightly puckered the salt glistened in her hair youd go right in wouldnt you she said i looked towards the gap a great comber piled up against the ledge and broke in a seething mass of foam across the entrance met the backwash of the previous wave and tossed itself in the air like a giant sea horse tossing its mane i dont know i said i felt her watching me then suddenly in a tight little voice she said tell mac to start the engine up youre going to go in i asked yes her voice was strained but i knew by the tone of it that she had made her mind up you arent trying to be pigheaded are you i asked you do realise what its going to be like itll be worse than any sea youve ever been through and the odds are against our making it tell mac to get the engine going she repeated i did not try to dissuade her further when the engine is going get the sails stowed she added as i opened the door of the wheelhouse and have them put their life jackets on ive got mine here and well need to trail a sea anchor astern to hold her steady in that surf okay i said ill give it a tripping line and veer out about four fathoms itll need to be a pretty short tow with all those rocks mac got the engine started the steady throb of the decks was a comfortable feeling bert and i dropped the sails and jenny swung the eilean mors bows towards the gap we stowed the sails and battened everything down we got the sea anchor over the stern then i went back to the wheelhouse straight ahead of us through the windshield was the gap it was now about two hundred yards ahead of us from that distance the waves looked mountains high as they piled against the pinnacle on the left their shaggy heads would suddenly rear up curl over and then dash themselves against the great square slab of granite that formed the pedestal the sound of it was like a clap of thunder above the general tide of battle that stormed along the length of the reefs jenny stood slim and erect against the wheel her eyes looked straight ahead a sudden longing welled up in me it was all mixed up with a feeling of pride and tenderness she looked such a slip of a girl but she faced that ghastly surge of water without a tremor i went up behind her and took her by the elbows jenny i said if we dont make it id like you id like you to know i love you jim that was all she said i could barely hear it above the thunder of the surf she didnt turn her head does that mean you love me i asked of course darling she leaned her head back so that our cheeks touched why do you think im here she was halflaughing halfcrying then she straightened up and became practical have mac come out of the engineroom she said i dont want him trapped down there for all we know we may turn turtle it looks frightful i felt her shudder i let go of her elbows then and called to mac tell him to leave the engine running at full ahead she called out to me mac came up from below and i gave him the tripping line of the drogue i called bert into the wheelhouse too there was at any rate some protection here then i went back to the wheel it would need two to hold her running through that smother gawd bert exclaimed as he came in and shut the door you aint goin through that are you miss jenny you cant see nuffink beyond that surf there may be a ole cap o rocks there weve been all along the reefs and back i told him thats the gap all right and if the trikkala could go through without hitting any rocks then a boat this size can we were very near now the thunder of the waves breaking was almost drowned in the constant seething hiss of that monstrous surf ever seen anything like this before i called out to mac ave seen as bad he replied sourly but a didna go through it not in a wee boat like this yell no do me engine any gude miss jenny i dont care a damn about your engine mac jenny shouted so long as the eilean mor doesnt fall apart when she hits those breakers her voice sounded a bit wild i glanced round the wheelhouse we all had our life jackets on our faces looked pale and strained youve got that tripping line have you mac jenny asked well let it out as soon as we begin to swing in the surf well need the weight of that sea anchor when we get into it i dont think mac needed any telling the line was gripped in his gnarled hands and his eyes were creased into a thousand wrinkles as he gazed steadily ahead the light was pale and grey great sheets of spray were flung against the windshield so that it ran with water with the engine flat out the eilean mor was making about seven knots and driving straight for the centre of the gap the rocks on either side of the entrance were closing in on us a great spout of water shot into the air some twenty yards ahead of us it subsided and in a moment of slack i had a clear view of the trikkala lying red and rusty between the smooth rock shoulders of the island the eilean mor suddenly caught the backwash of a wave for a moment she seemed to slide backwards in a crazy millrace of surf then she was driving forward again straight into the gap running on her engine at full speed jenny could not pick her moment for going in not that it mattered there was no chance of escaping that raging surf hold tight jenny suddenly called here we go i gripped the wheel one of my hands over hers the eilean mor was lifted up and driven forward at a great rate on the seething crest of a wave i glanced to the left the pinnacle of rock towered above us like a colossus its great black pedestal was exposed an instant in the trough of a wave water cascading from it the wave that was carrying us forward was piling up on the pedestal curling crashing against the rock we dropped down the back of the wave our bows pointing to the leaden sky a great wall of surf was thundering across our bows the wheel jerked under my hand the bows swung we lay in the trough of the wave almost broadside on in the gap jenny spun the wheel slowly the eilean mor began to come round the sea anchor dragging at her stern she was shying like a frightened mare look at bert screamed right beind yer i turned my head we were inside the entrance now right in the path of the spilling surf and beyond the granite base of that pinnacle a wave was piling up mountains high it seemed to rise water streamed from its broken crest like white hair in the wind it was yellow with foam the top curled then it toppled forward it seemed it must crush our little boat but the rock pedestal was between us it hit the rock with a growling crash like thunder it split into a sheet of foam and came at us like an avalanche the noise of it drowned our cries as it hit the eilean mor the glass windshield smashed in like the shell of an egg the sea poured white into the wheelhouse the ship heeled rolled over was utterly buried under the weight of water i could not see i could not breathe i felt myself drowning there was a terrific weight on my chest i thought my arms would break as i clung desperately to the wheel we were being flung forward at a terrible rate as though plunging down a giant fall then the eilean mor righted herself with a jerk that shook her to the keel she was flung skywards the water poured off her it drained from the wheelhouse dragging at my legs through the torn glass of the windshield i seemed poised for an instant high above the yellow froth of the sea the screw raced as it was lifted clear of the water then we dropped back with a crash into the sea by the grace of god our bows were still headed towards the trikkala i felt the screw begin to drive her forward again the sea anchor tow had parted there was nothing to hold her the wheel bucked in my hand but i held her on her course out of the tail of my eye i saw the next wave pile up beyond the pinnacle the surf roared down on us again we were buried deep in a giant race but this time the eilean mor did not heel so far i felt her rushing forward at a great rate gradually the foam slackened the water drained off her ahead the water was comparatively calm we were through that second wave had spilled us right through the gap as though the ship were a surfboard jenny were through i cried she was lying on the floor her hair damp across her face bert was sprawled across her legs an ugly cut down the side of his head only mac was still standing the engineroom mac i shouted cut her down to slow aye aye he said jenny stirred then she opened her eyes and stared wildly up at me her mouth opened wide i think she was going to scream but she suddenly got a grip of herself she swallowed then said are we are we through jim yes i said were through are you all right she put her hand up to her head yes yes i think so i must have hit up against something when i fell she sat up pushing the dank hair out of her eyes bert groaned what about you bert she asked its me arm he groaned help feels like its broke its all right miss he added as she knelt beside him ill be all right the engine slowed the wind cut at my face through the open windshield huge flakes of scud floated through the air like scraps of paper in a gale the water was chopped up but here under the lee of the island the waves had no strength in them i ran slowly in to the beach close under the rusty stern of the trikkala which lay partly in the water i ordered mac to cut the engine then i scrambled forard and let go the anchor the eilean mor was a shambles she looked as though shed been hit by a typhoon but her masts still stood the dinghy lashed aft appeared to be intact the only serious damage seemed to be the wheelhouse which was stove in on the port side and all its windows smashed blood was dripping from my arm where i had been cut by the glass i went aft again hows the arm bert i asked he was standing up leaning against the broken chart table can you move it yes its all right guvnor caught it on the beastly binnacle thats all he suddenly grinned blimey that was a bit of a rough sea werent it jenny was smiling she seemed all right i think weve been pretty lucky she said she suddenly leaned forward and kissed me on the mouth her lips were warm and soft and very salt youre the best sailor ive ever met darling she said and then added quickly now lets go below and see if we can find some dry clothes and ill bind that cut of yours up i think we all want a little patching up i saw then that there was blood on her neck below decks everything was chaos everything that could had broken loose bunks had been wrenched from the wall lamps smashed crockery broken lockers thrown open clothes and books lay strewn on the floor all mixed up with provisions tins broken bottles smashed crockery but it was dry the hatches had held and the eilean mors stout timbers had stood the strain we were afloat and dry only the engineroom was half flooded with water that had come in down the companion ladder from the wheelhouse we none of us seemed much the worse for our experience our cuts attended to and dryclothed we left mac to clean up his engineroom and got the dinghy over the side by a miracle it had not been damaged first we took a second anchor out thus securing the eilean mor fore and aft then we rowed over to the trikkala the stern was only just in the water the waves broke against the lower blades of the twin screws the rudder was red with rust so was the hull she had bedded firmly down in the shingle beach and had a list of about fifteen degrees to starbd the incredible thing was that she hadnt broken her back nor did any of her plates appear to be damaged she might have been laid up on a slipway from her bows two hawsers anchored her to the low cliffs that edged the beach aft two more hawsers gripped her by the stern one was fixed to the rocks of a small reef that curved out like a breakwater from the southern shoulder of the island the other ran into the sea to an anchor we rowed round the stern the sides were sheer no ropes hung down to go into the beach meant risking the dinghy we went back to the eilean mor for a light line with this over the stern rails by the rusty threeinch gun i clambered up on to the deck there was rust everywhere it came away in flakes under my feet nevertheless the deck plates seemed solid enough below the rust just by the bridge on the starbd side i found a jacobs ladder heaped up and fixed to the rail i took this aft and soon we were all on deck wonder if the silvers still there bert said as he clambered over the rail thats what i was wondering we went forard to the afterdeckhousing never fort id see this beastly guardroom again bert said there was no padlock on the door we put our weight against it and to my surprise it moved we strained at the rusty edge of it and gradually it slid back inside were the cases of bullion just as we had left them our hammocks were still slung from case to case bits of our clothing were scattered about doesnt look as though anyones been here jenny said ullo ullo exclaimed bert who had gone right in somebodys bin muckin abat wiv these ere cases look at this one jim top ripped right off an that wasnt the one me an sills opened he flung the top off thats queer he said they aint taken nuffink look theres one o the smaller boxes opened and the bars still there youd ave fort old alsey would ave ad the door sealed up before they left wouldnt you jim i mean eres the ol bright an shinin all on its lonesome an not even a padlock on the jolly door there arent many burglars operating in these latitudes bert i reminded him oh you know wot i mean he saidsailors might land ere an ave a look rand the ship fer wot they could pinch food an clothes an things if the door were fastened they wouldnt bother abat it but left open like this why hits an open hinvitation ter loot thats wot it is i must say i agreed it seemed incredible that halsey should be so careless i went out and had another look at the door there were two catches on the outside made for padlocks but there were no padlocks and then i saw clean metal showing here and there at the edge below the rust i rubbed the brown flakes away below the red powder i saw distinctly the marks of a cold chisel come and look at this bert i said those marks ran all round the door the metal at the edge seemed blistered and lumpy weldin bert said thats wot it is you mean halsey had the door welded before he left jenny asked you bete did miss then whos broken it open yes i added whos broken it open and not taken a single bar of silver it puzzled me however the silver was there that was the main thing not much use worrying about it now i added anything might have happened whilst those five crooks were on board yes but to weld it up and then laboriously chisel it open it doesnt make sense jenny was staring at the door with a puzzled frown come on i said itll be dark soon lets take a look round the rest of the ship while its still light that doors a mystery we shall probably never solve we went forard then to the bridge accommodation it was strange walking along the trikkalas deck all red with rust and tilted at an angle i climbed up on to the bridge itself everything was orderly as though the ship were still afloat only time had left its mark in rust and a thick rime of salt there was even a pair of binoculars in the cubbyhole where the charts were kept i looked forard to the bows and the derelictlooking threeinch gun perched there like a relic of a longforgotten war an old tarpaulin was slung from the derricks it undulated in the wind beyond those high bows the island sloped up from the fringe of shallow cliffs there was no sign of vegetation it was all rock furrowed but smooth as though the stone were precious and it had been polished on an emery wheel it was as black and sleek and wet as it had looked through the glasses when we first sighted it a shiver ran down my spine it was the most desolate place id ever seen suppose we couldnt get out through the gap again to be marooned in this unspeakable desolation it would be a living hell down in the cabins everything seemed neat and orderly there were no signs of a hurried departure i went into halseys cabin and rummaged through the drawers papers books old periodicals a litter of charts and atlases dividers rulers two shelves of plays including a copy of shakespeare and bradleys shakespearean tragedies but not a letter not a photograph not a single object that might give a clue to the mans history jenny called out to me i went to the door come here jim she said i want to show you something she and bert were in the officers messroom look she said as i entered she was pointing to the table it was still laid just for one there were tea things on a tray an open tin of oleo margarine ships biscuits on a plate a pot of paste and a hurricane lamp almost as though somebody were living here she said and look theres an oil stove and a duffle coat hung over the back of the chair i i dont think its very pleasant wandering around a deserted ship it always seems as though there must be life on board i remember going over one of the freighters laid up in the clyde when i was a kid it scared me quite a bit as though i oughtnt to be there prying into the secret life of a ship with all its old memories i went over to the table there was milk in the jug it looked all right but then it was cold enough in these latitudes for things to keep indefinitely the paste was all right too and then i saw the watch and stopped with the pot of paste still in my hand jim what are you staring at jennys voice was startled almost scared that watch i said wot abat it bert asked blimey aint yer never seen a pocket watch before yes i said but i never saw one that ran for over a year without being wound it was an ordinary service watch rankins perhaps the little second hand jerked steadily round the others peered at it nobody spoke whilst the watch ticked off a whole minute youre right said bert at length its as though somebody had just left it there fair gives yer the creeps dont it dyer fink the free of us clumpin rand the room could ave started it off no i dont i replied my voice sounded unnaturally sharp this ship has been mattered by waves all the winter then how can it jennys voice trailed away for gods sake jim she added suddenly clutching my arm lets find out whether there is someone on this ship this table laid for one like that as soon as i saw it i felt she hesitated well i felt a cold shiver run down my spine come on then i said lets go and have a look at the galley if there is anyone on board hes clearly someone who needs to eat the galley will tell us we went down the long passageway this was the way i had come for cocoa and my chats with the cook the passageway had always been hot and pulsing with the throb of engines but now it was cold and dank the gratings that let on to the engineroom were dark and lifeless the galley door was open the air seemed warmer and there was a smell of food something moved on the cooks bed whats that jenny cried i swear i saw somefink move then bert said our nerves reacted on each other twentythree men the crew of this ship had been murdered i told myself not to be a fool jennys fingers dug into my arm two pinpoints of luminous light stared at us from the dark recess beneath the bunk two green eyes we stood petrified staring at those eyes they moved and then out from underneath the bunk walked the cooks cat the tortoiseshell that had jumped out of the boat just before it was launched it came stalking across the room towards us its soft pads making no sound tail stiff and waving gently from side to side its green eyes fixed unwinkingly upon us i felt the hair creep along my scalp i remembered how the cat had struggled and clawed at the cook it had known that boat was going to sink then the thing was rubbing itself against my legs purring as it had done when the cook had sat in that chair over there stroking it with his thick fleshy fingers i took a grip on myself that cat couldnt wind up a watch it might eat fish paste but not ships biscuits i went over to the galley stove and felt the top of it the iron was still warm and when i raked at it cinders glowed red in the grate somebodys still on board i said still on board jenny echoed but jim for over a year its the same person that burst open the bullion room door dont you see thats why none of the silvers missing he couldnt take it away because hes still here its almost incredible that anyone should be living on this derelict she said yes but not impossible i pointed out theres food and shelter here and water thats why that tarpaulin is slung from the derricks to catch rain water dyer fink they left im beind as a sort of caretaker bert suggested he made a face blimey nice sort o job that is i wouldnt stay at ere on me jack jones no jolly fear i wouldnt hes probably some poor devil whos been shipwrecked i said managed to get in through the reef and been here ever since at any rate that explains why the cats still alive its horrible jenny murmured yes its not very nice i agreed i saw she was worried i took her arm an abandoned ship always seems a bit uncanny especially when theres someone on it and you dont know who come on the sooner we find him the better i turned to bert you go aft i said well search forard berts eyes looked startled wot go aft by meself he cried why e may ave gone barmy a year alone wiv alf a million in silver nuffter make anyone go screwy i laughed but it wasnt a very assured laugh well just call to him i suggested make friendly noises oh orl right he grumbled but if i start ollering you come quick i aint a trickcyclist an i aint got a straitwaistct wiv me jenny and i searched from the engine room forard through the crews quarters and the bridge accommodation to the peak it was a dismal business to light us we had a hurricane lamp strange shadows flitted in the dark recesses of the silent engineroom along the deserted passageways and in the corners of the cabins we were just emerging from number one hold when bert hailed us from the after deck i found im jim he shouted dusk was beginning to close in around the ship the wind was rising fast and the noise of it whining through the superstructure of the ship was audible above the everlasting roar of the waves along the reefs spray drifted against our faces carried right across the island from the waves breaking against the cliffs to the west of it bert came hurrying forward behind him was a short darkhaired man in blue serge trousers and a seamans jersey he hung back he seemed scared of us like a wild thing that is shy and yet driven forward by curiosity ere we are said bert as he came up to us man friday isself ony hes white found im idin amongst the rudder gear poor fellow jenny said he looks scared like a badger i once saw trapped in a pig sty how do you come to be on this ship i asked and then when he did not reply i said whats your name yer wants ter talk slow bert put in e understands english orl right but e dont speak it very well es a furriner if yer ask me what is your name i asked again slowly this time his lips moved but the only sound that came was a sort of grunt he was not tall about berts height his face was lined and leathery it had that tired grey colour that goes with much suffering his mouth kept opening and shutting in a violent effort to become articulate it was horrible to watch him fighting down his fear in that dismal half light zelinski he said suddenly zelinski that is my name how is it that you are on the trikkala i asked trying to phrase the question simply his eyebrows jerked up his brows wrinkled in three tiers of deep furrows plees i not understand it is difficult i am alone too long i forget my own language i am here oh i have lost my memory he searched feverishly through his pockets and brought out a small pocket diary he flicked the pages over in nervous haste ah yes i arrive here on th march that is one year one month no he peered forward at us in sudden eagerness you will take me wiz you yes oh plees you will take me wiz you of course i said and that hard lined face creased into a quick smile his adams apple jerked up and down as he swallowed but why are you here i asked why he frowned and then his brow cleared ah yes why i am the pole you know at murmansk they say this ship is to go to england i wish to join general anders army so i go on this ship you mean you stowed away i asked plees never mind i said he must have been on this ship after everyone but halsey and his gang abandoned it jenny said yes i agreed we not only take back some silver as evidence but an actual witness the pole was speaking again plees he said he was pointing to the eilean mor plees your ship there is a big storm to come it will be bad here it is from the west and the water is all over the island it will soon be dark and you must have many anchors no does the wind ever come from the east i asked he frowned concentrating on his words no only once then it was terrible the bottom she nearly break into this ship the cabins all water the waves come right up and then he pointed to the masts he was exaggerating of course but if the wind was easterly it was obvious that the seas would pile in over the protecting reefs and this sheltered beach would become a raging inferno of water thank god the prevailing wind was westerly come on then i said lets see that the eilean mor is securely anchored we go yes zelinski said you must not sleep on your little boat you must come here plees it will be very bad the eilean mor was lying bowson to the beach facing up into the wind that came roaring over the rock we found two small boats anchors in the trikkalas stores and with these and stout haswers we moored the eilean mor securely two anchors forard and two aft with the long hawsers stretching seaward from the stern to hold her off the beach if the wind should change then we transferred to the trikkala and hauled our dinghy up after us zelinski insisted on cooking the meal he had lost all his shyness words poured from him in an excited jumble as he hurried to and fro preparing our beds getting us hot water searching out the medical chest to see to our cuts nothing was too much trouble in his crazy delight at human companionship he was an excellent cook and the ships stores had been preserved by the cold he was three hours preparing the meal but when he served it i cant remember a meal i enjoyed so much when it was all on the table he hurried out and returned with the tortoiseshell cat excuse plees he said i introduce this is my little friend i do not know his name but i call him jon he laughed nervously that is so that i shall not forget my own name he poured a saucer of tinned milk for the cat and then sat down with us by the time the meal was over the gale was upon us we went up on deck it was pitch dark the wind howled through the superstructure throwing a curtain of spray across our faces the sound of the surf thundering across the reefs was louder now and yet through it came a sound like distant regular gunfire it was like the sound of a giant battering ram a dreadful sound that seemed to echo through the frame of the ship it was the waves thundering against the cliffs on the other side of the island it will get more bad much more bad zelinski said we felt our way aft hoping to get a glimpse of the eilean mor but when we stood by the rusty threeinch at the stern all we could see was the vague jostling white of broken waves do you think shell be all right jenny asked me i dont know i said but theres nothing we can do about it now weve got four anchors out she ought to hold thank god we dont have to sleep on her though but oughtnt we to take watches she suggested in a small voice what could we do if she did drag her anchors i said anyway we cant even see her i had hold of her arm and i sensed her heaviness of heart no youre right but it doesnt seem right for us to sleep while she fights it out all alone i know dear i said but well just have to wait till morning well see what its like when its light before going to bed that night i searched for and found the sliding plate to which rankin had referred it was a neat affair operated from what had been hendriks cabin a large plate running in grooves fitted to the steel ribs of the ship it ran down inside the forard part of number two hold it had been held up by a chain fitted to a catch under hendriks bunk when this catch was released it had slid down with its own weight and had fairly effectually sealed the hole torn in the weak plate by the explosion it had later been welded the next morning bert and i were up early at seven oclock it was just beginning to get light even under the shelter of the island the wind was so strong we had to hold on to the rails as we struggled aft it was near the top of the tide and the trikkala was grinding her keel softly on the shingle beach a perpetual curtain of spray covered the ship water poured down the smooth black flanks of the island the air was full of wisps of scud driven like flocks of clumsy white birds before the wind aft the turmoil was frightful no sign of reefs now all around to the grey edge of visibility was a racing roaring cataracting welter of foam the sea was a giant millrace all white not white yellow rather and cold and grey and wickedlooking and just aft of the trikkala the little whitepainted ship that had brought us to this dreadful place flung herself about like a mad thing in the broken water still there bert yelled in my ear but she dont like it she looks like a orse tossin er mane and pawin the grand wiv terror no she didnt like it but one thing was in her favour the little beach was sheltered from the full force of the wind and what wind there was just off the beach drove the water out towards the reefs that i realised was why the trikkala had not been broken up the eilean mor was tossing about violently enough but the waves werent smashing at her and so long as the anchor held she would weather it i looked back along the rusty deck of the trikkala jenny was fighting her way towards us she didnt say anything as she joined us she stood for a moment against the rail looking anxiously down at the eilean mor straining at her moorings then she turned quickly away the gale continued all that day the sound of it was with us throughout the ship it tore at our nerves so that we became irritable only zelinski kept cheerful he talked incessantly in his limited english of his farm in poland before the war of cavalry charges against the germans in he had been a cavalry officer of the life in russian labour camps it was as though words had been dammed up inside him so long that they just had to come out and all the time our one hope of getting away from maddons rock lay fighting at her anchorage at the mercy of the elements i spent a lot of time that day rummaging through captain halseys cabin i felt that it must contain something of his past but i could find nothing i searched through his beautifully bound copy of shakespeare the pages were well thumbed but there were no letters no notes even i went through all his books but he was apparently a man who was not in the habit of using old letters as page markers his technical books on seamanship were copiously annotated in his neat rather angular writing but they were just notes there was nothing absolutely nothing of his past he had several privately bound volumes of the theatregoer there were three in all covering the years and being interested in the stage i finally gave up my abortive search and took these three volumes into the warmth of the galley to look through them and there i made a discovery it was in the volume for the picture of a young actor named leo foulds there was something about that upthrust chin and wideflung arm that worried me i knew the actor and yet i could not remember the name leo foulds and i certainly had not been going to plays in i showed it to jenny and she had the same feeling that she had seen foulds though she did not remember the name and then with sudden excitement i showed it to bert and he too felt he knew the actor and bert had never seen a play in his life i took a pencil and quickly sketched in a little pointed beard and a peaked cap and there it was captain halsey declaiming shakespeare on the bridge of the trikkala halsey in that cabin on the salvage tug there was no doubt about it i tore the page out and put it in my pocket book at dusk bert and i went up to have another look at the eilean mor jenny didnt come she just couldnt face the sight of it when she could do nothing to help as soon as we came out on deck we knew something had changed for a moment i couldnt get what it was it seemed quieter yet the roar of the breakers was as loud as ever and the terrible steady booming from the other side of the island continued then i realised what it was the wind it had died away completely queer aint it bert said not a bref yes i said it is queer the sky had a strange unholy light in it that foggy yellow light that goes with snow i didnt like the look of it its the sort of thing that happens when youre at the very centre of a storm i said to bert theres a lull blue sky sometimes and then the wind starts blowing again from the opposite quarter the polski said the wind ad only bin easterly once the ole time ed bin ere he reminded me it only needs to happen once i said we went below then i said nothing to jenny about it but that night as i lay in my bunk i found myself listening for that change of wind at what time it actually started to blow again i dont know it was just after fourthirty that i woke i rolled over in my bunk and wondered sleepily what had woken me the roar of the seas out on the reefs was as loud as ever nothing seemed changed then i was suddenly wide awake the bunk the whole room seemed to be moving the very framework of the ship quivered there was a deep grating sound from deep down in the bowels of her i lit the lamp a little trickle of water was running under the door the ship quivered again as though it had been given a terrific blow it lifted slightly and then settled back with that horrible grinding sound i knew what had happened then i got out of my bunk put on sea boots and oilskins and went up on deck water was pouring down the open companionway this companionway faced aft and the wind roared straight in as though into the mouth of a vacuum i fought my way to the top of the ladder it was pitch dark but foam washed the decks with a pale luminous light i could sense rather than see or hear the waves crashing against the trikkalas stern they must be piling in at a great height to lift the ship like that i thought of the eilean mor lying out there on the break of them and my heart sank the noise of the wind and sea combined was terrifying but there was nothing i could do that was the hell of it there was nothing any of us could do i shut the door at the top of the companion ladder and went along to the galley there i made myself some tea and it was there that jenny found me half an hour later her eyes looked wild and desperate i put my arm round her and we stood gazing into the red face of the stove i suppose there is nothing we can do she said at length nothingi told her bert came in mac and the pole joined us before dawn we sat there drinking tea and staring hopelessly into the fire quite frankly i didnt think the boat had a chance high tide was just about first light between six and seven yet already the trikkala was being lifted bodily up at each wave and flung down again on to the bed of the beach if those waves could lift a ton freighter like that what would they do to the little eilean mor built of wood and displacing no more than tons shortly after six we fought our way up on to the deck a grey pallid light was filtering through the storm the sight that met our eyes was one of ghastly chaos at regular intervals great waves would pile up out of the struggling dawn pile up till they seemed to grin down at the trikkala then their tops would curl and they would fling themselves with a demoniac roar at the stern and break into a cascade of foam that rolled boiling along the deck swirling round us till we were kneedeep in the hissing tugging water there was no question of going aft to look at the eilean mor we climbed up on to the bridge which shook like a bamboo hut in an earthquake each time the trikkala settled on to the beach the air was full of flying foam the wind driven spray stung our eyes we could see nothing in that tormented half light jenny had hold of my hand shes gone jim she said shes gone i thought it likely and gripped her hand tight then suddenly bert shouted i did not hear what he was saying it was lost in the wind but i followed the line of his outstretched arm and for an instant thought i saw something white rolling on the face of a towering wave then it was gone a moment later i saw it again then as the light strengthened we saw that it was the eilean mor one of the long hawsers had parted but the other three held her in their grip fore and aft shed ride stern first up the very face of a comber like a mountaineer scrambling over an avalanche shed almost make the top buoyant as a cork then suddenly all three hawsers would snap taut as bowstrings and the wave top would hurtle over her she had no masts her bowsprit was gone so was the wheelhouse she was stripped of all but her deck boarding jim jenny screamed at me shes being held down by her moorings it was the truth wed given her plenty of slack but it was the top of the tide and the wind was piling the water in on to the beach shed have needed several fathoms more slack to have a chance of riding those waves weve got to do something jenny shouted its horrible theres absolutely nothing we can do i said but shes being held down she isnt being given a chance she was sobbing i could feel the breath coming in her in great gulps a wave bigger than the rest piled in the eilean mor climbed gallantly halfway up the breaking comber then she was pulled up short by her moorings the wave curled it was like a hungry jaw opening then it crashed down on top of the gallant little vessel the moorings snapped like bits of string her bows dipped her stern rose she rolled over and then came driving in on to the beach still struggling like a live thing she hit the beach stern first not twenty yards from the trikkala her bows thrust up into the air like the arm of a drowning man and then she seemed to disintegrate into the original planks and timbers in that instant she was changed from a ship to a heap of driftwood i took jenny below then no use watching the remains being battered on the beach we had seen her death struggle and her end that was sufficient if only id been with her jenny sobbed i might have been able to do something i brought her right up here and then i deserted her all i did was stand by and watch her fighting for her life oh god its horrible horrible zelinski produced some brandy we finished the bottle then we had breakfast we were all of us pretty silent with the eilean mor gone we were marooned on maddons rock chapter nine marooned as we cleared up after breakfast that morning zelinski took mac on one side i dinna ken i heard the old man say plees i dinna ken what the hell yere talkin aboot zelinski took his arm mac turned to me as the pole led him firmly out of the galley a got an idea he wants me to have a look at the engines all be doon below if yere wantin me all that morning jenny and i and zelinski checked over the ships stores bert kept us informed of the weather with the fall of the tide the trikkala ceased grinding her plates against the beach but even at low tide the waves were still seething against her stern so high did the wind pile the sea in over the reefs by midday wed checked all stores and jenny and i sat dejectedly in the messroom working out how long theyd last us zelinski had disappeared into the galley it must have been about one oclock that bert came down and told us the wind was dropping it always drops with the tide i said ave it yer own way he answered but i say the winds droppin he rubbed his hands together and grinned an theres a luvly smell o grub comin from the galley decent chap that polski he ran on first time i ever knew a bloke volunteer for the cookhouse peels is own spuds too wheres mac still down in the engineroom i said leave him there jenny said so long as hes got some engines to play with hes happy itll keep his mind off things you two look pretty glum bert said wots up i pulled the sheet of paper on which wed written our stores figures towards me well bert weve just been doing a little profit and loss account i said and theres not much on the profit side oh it aint as bad as all that mate he said pulling up a chair we got ere we fand the trikkala complete wiv bullion an hintact we got ol slinky wotsis silly name jenny looked up zelinski bert thats right zerlinsky why dont they ave names yer can get yer tongue rand well we got im as witness for the prosecution that aint bad fer a start yes i said but how the hell do we get away from here look bert jenny and i have had a look at the ships stores there are five of us and we reckon that on a reasonable scale of rationing weve got food for just over three months well thats better than aving ter live on seagulls eggs his innate cheerfulness annoyed me you dont seem to realise that jon zelinski has been here over a year i said and in all that time not a single ship has come near the place nah look ere free munfs is a long time i know the eilean mors gone but in free munfs well in free munfs the five of us oughter be able ter do a lot for instance well he frowned get the radio going build a boat theres two ideas for a start and he smiled brightly it was clear hed no idea of our danger to begin with i told him none of us know anything about radio as for a boat all the wood on deck is splintered beyond use the only other wood is in the cabins matchboarding a lot of it quite unsuitable for building a boat thatll sail through these seas the dinghy is out of the question bert shrugged his shoulders wots the polski say lumme a bloke wots bin marooned up ere on is own for over a year es ad time ter fink up somefink jenny sat up then berts right jim why didnt we ask him before the mans a cavalry officer not a sailor i pointed out and then theres the problem of halsey alsey bert snapped his fingers and grinned thats the answer dont yer see hes our return ticket we knows es coming ere e aint likely ter let us down not with all that silver here an when e comes his voice trailed off aint we got no arms jim he asked yes i said eight rifles and a box of ammo four cutlasses and two verey pistols you dont reckon we got a chance of takin the tug do yer i shrugged my shoulders well be hard put to it to keep them from taking us wot free soldiers an a cantankerous ol scot wiv them eight rifles we oughter be able ter keep em at bay dont forget theyll have dynamite on board i reminded him in the dark they could just blow the ship apart obviously thats what they intend to do they wont leave a trace of the trikkala when they leave here yes youre right there mate he said brother alsey aint got much in the way of scruples like as not ell dump most of is crew too all but the old gang an if i was rankin i wouldnt reckn me chances of seein blighty again very igh ullo wots that he added as a steady humming sound vibrated through the ship sounds like an engine the floor was vibrating under my feet do you think mac has got the engines going jenny asked there was a note of excitement in her voice the door opened and zelinski came in with a tray piled with food plees dinner is sairved he said smiling quite the ead waiter aint he said bert with a grin as he helped to unload the tray wots under the cover mate smells orl right ravioli zelinski replied we ave so much flour you see it is necessary that we eat italian no eyetalian is it bert said and then shrugged his shoulders well i aint perticular beastly starvin i am at that moment the lights came on we sat there blinking too stunned to comment only zelinski did not seem surprised ah that is good he said it is mac no he is very clever with the machine he will get the engines to work and then we will go to england i have never been but my mother she was english she tell me it is a lovely place jenny leaned across the table towards him what do you mean jon he will get the engines going and then we will go to england how can we get to england when our boat is gone he looked up surprised why in the trikkala he replied she will float her bottom has not fall out of her yet all the time i am here i pray for someone to come who can work the engines i do not understand them i try but it is too complicated and always i was afraid i should kill them if i try so i wait but i prepare i take ow do you call them awzers out to the reef i make a raft of wood and carry an anchor out it was big work but i do it now the wind is from the east at high tide she can be pulled into the water but it is not safe wizout the engines he had finished arranging the table excuse plees he said you must eat it will get cold and then i shall be sorry for it ees good i will call mac he looked quickly round at us if the engines are okay i shall be zo appy i have given them grease always i have been down there wiz the grease he smiled and nodded his head like a happy father speaking of his children i know it is good for them excuse i must go to find mac and then he went out we stared after him in amazement well wot dyer know abat that bert said all yer questions answered how horrible for him jenny said and when bert asked her what she meant she added dont you see hes been here alone for over a year facing certain death when he came to the end of the stores and all the time he knew he had a chance of getting away if only hed learned less about horses and more about mechanics when mac came in i asked him about the engines weel he replied a wouldna say they were all richt theres some bearings gone on the port engine thats all richt a can replace them he nodded dourly towards zelinski yon fellers done a gude job o maintenance but am no sure about the starbd propeller shaft ave a notion its cracked and theres the boilers too all no be sure of them till theyre fired do you think we can get the port engine going i asked aye he nodded slowly his mouth full of ravioli aye a think a can do that when mebbe tomorrow morning if the boilers no rusted to pieces grand i said high tides somewhere between seventhirty and eight tomorrow work straight through the night mac weve got to take advantage of this east wind its only when the wind is easterly that the tide comes far enough up the beach to lift her stern and if we dont take advantage of it it may be months before we get another chance he raised his fork aye he said but what aboot the plates doon by her keel zelinski says shes all right jenny put in he canna be sure the old man said severely unless he can see through a cargo of iron ore i dont care i said its our only chance to get clear before halsey arrives whether the hulls damaged or the engines arent going we take her off at the high tomorrow morning when can you let us have steam enough to work the after donkey engines och mebbe in two or three hours ave got one of the small boilers fired a was just testing her right i said give us steam on the after donkeyengines just as soon as you can and keep the dynamos going ill need the deck lights while youre working on the engines well clear as much of the iron ore as we can out of the after hold and mac i added see that youve plenty of steam tomorrow morning shes bound to make water and well need the pumps going flat out i suddenly laughed i think i was almost lightheaded with excitement my god jenny i cried to think that half an hour ago we were sitting here wondering how we were to get back and here was our ship all the time lloyds will get a shock shes been officially sunk for over a year and then we sail her into port aye but yere nae name yet mr vardy mac said cant nuffink cheer you up bert put in with a grin i got up then and went on deck to take a look at the weather bert was right the wind was dropping but it was still blowing half a gale and there was no change in the direction of it up on the bridge the glass was beginning to rise a bit of planking lay high up the beach among some driftwood on it i saw the letters elan mor i hoped jenny would not notice it with bert and zelinski i got to work removing the hatch covers from number three hold we got the derricks rigged shortly after three jenny came up to say that steam was laid on to the donkeyengines it was wonderful to hear them clatter at the tug of a lever and the tackle of the derricks drop into the hold jenny quickly learned how to work them and with her operating the starbd engine and the three of us in the hold loading we began to clear the cargo from the hold and dump it over the side we worked steadily till dusk and then with arc lamps rigged worked straight on into the night in the intervals whilst we were loading jenny got us bully and tea that was the hardest nights work i ever did we were shovelling almost continuously for fifteen hours in a stifling hell of red ore dust each load seemed to make little impression on the level of the cargo but gradually imperceptibly the level dropped as we sweated we became coated in a thick layer of the dust so that we looked as though we were as rusty as the trikkala at six oclock in the morning when the stern was just beginning to bump on the shingle i gave the order to pack up cor luv ol iron bert grinned wiping the rusty sweat from his face i feel as though i done another ruddy year in dartmoor i was too excited to feel sleepy but by god i felt tired my limbs ached so that i could hardly move when we climbed up out of the hold it was to find that the wind had dropped to little more than a strong breeze the waves inside the reefs were much less violent they still broke with a shattering roar on the little beach and against the rocks on either side but there was not the same strength in them i sent zelinski off to get breakfast and jenny and i went down to the engineroom mac was under one of the boilers when he emerged he was hardly recognisable he was covered in oil from head to foot it was as though hed bathed himself in sludge well i said hows that port engine mac he shook his head yell have to gi me anither twentyfour hours mr vardy i forgot that jenny was standing beside me and swore violently whats the trouble i asked its the feed system to the oil burners he replied am having to take it all doon for a thorough clean ave steam enough for the donkeyengines and the pumps no more the feed system of the main boilers is choked and until ave cleared it a canna fire em there was nothing we could do about it engines or not i said im taking her off on this mornings tide well just have to hope that the anchors hold do you agree jenny she nodded you better come up and get some breakfast mac i said breakfast finished we all went on deck with the exception of mac who returned to his boilers we went aft and got the hawsers fixed to the capstan drums of the donkey engines the port drum took the line that ran out to the reef the starbd drum the line to the anchor do you think that anchor will hold i asked zelinski he spread his hands out in a gesture of resignation i have hope that is all i can say the bottom of the sea is rocky it was past seventhirty now the lightened stern was lifting as each successive wave spilled under it as it came down on the beach again the trikkala shivered through her whole length and that wretched grinding noise was audible above the din of the sea i sent bert and zelinski forard we had already fixed the bow hawsers to the donkeyengines their job was to pay off forard as jenny and i on the after donkeyengines endeavoured to pull the trikkala into the water when they were all set bert waved to me jenny and i took up the slack the powerful clatter of the engines filled us with a wild sense of hope if only we could pull her off if only her hull was not damaged if only the anchors held when we were clear of the beach and afloat if only if only if only okay i called to jenny she nodded i signalled to bert that we were about to commence operations then jenny and i waited tensely for the next big wave we let three waves dissipate their strength lifting the stern and crashing it down on to the beach then jenny pointed i had already seen it a great shaggyheaded comber that was piling in a good deal higher than the others its crest seethed white it curled then as it dashed itself in a great burst of spray against the stern i nodded to jenny the pneumatic drill chatter of the donkeyengines drowned the sound of the wave thundering on the beach i felt the stern lifted high i watched my hawser stretching in a taut line out to the rocks that seethed and boiled with foam would the line break or would the trikkala move the capstan drum revolved slowly the hawser tightened stretched to a thin line something had to give the engine laboured my heart was in my mouth something had to give and i thought that thin steel strand would never stand the strain then suddenly the drum was revolving faster easier the stern of the trikkala hung on the full flood of the wave i stole a quick glance at the other drum it was revolving faster like my own the trikkala was coming off i watched the ebb of the wave seeth down the beach i raised my hand and we stopped both our engines how far we had dragged the ship it was impossible to say there was nothing by which we could judge our progress but my guess was that we had wound in at least thirty feet of cable on that wave some of which was stretch we waited watching for the next big wave even the smaller waves were lifting the stern of the trikkala easily now so that at moments i could swear we were afloat and each time we crashed down on the beach with that wretched grinding noise i didnt dare wait long for all i knew we might be bumping on rock now a reasonably big wave came rolling in i nodded to jenny the engines clattered as the threeinch gun at the stern lifted against the background of foamflooded reefs again the hawsers tightened to thin lines the drums began to wind them in the trikkala was moving again floating on the flood of the wave suddenly my engine raced my line whipped out of the water and came sailing towards us snaking high above the ship then it fell with a crash against the funnel trailing its broken end in the water it had parted at the reef to which it was attached either it had rusted or it had chafed against the sharp edge of a rock whilst it was still snaking through the air i glanced quickly at jennys line it was very taut as it bore the full drag of the ship but the engine was not labouring and the line was coming in steadily on the drum i signalled to her to keep going the trikkala was coming astern quite easily now the wave ebbed i signalled her to stop but this time the stern did not sink with a grinding thud on to the bottom but remained uneasily afloat faintly i heard bert call i went to the rail and looked forard no more slack here he shouted through cupped hands and then pointed to the hawsers which were stretched taut from the bows to the black cliffs let em go i yelled back and made a cutting signal with my hand he acknowledged with a wave of his arm a moment later i saw them fall into the water on the very next wave jenny started her engine again at first i thought she wasnt going to make it the engine laboured the line became tauter and tauter till it seemed as though it must part and then at the full flood of the wave the ship gave a little wriggle and the engine ceased labouring a moment later and the hawser went almost slack we were afloat we took her out stern first on that single hawser till we were almost over the anchor then before we dragged the anchor on too short a hawser we let go the main anchor forard everything depended now on whether the anchors held as she had come off the trikkala had swung a bit so that she was not quite sternon to the wind we let her be blown a little shoreward so that there was some length to the after anchor chain and then hoped for the best wind and waves were both thrusting her shoreward it was a heavy weight that the anchors had to hold however silent and a little scared we got the pumps working and then settled down to the task of trimming the ship our work of the previous night had so lightened the afterhold that she was floating with her stern cocked up in the air and so whilst mac struggled with the engines the four of us got to work clearing some of the cargo out of numbers one and two holds one thing it kept our minds occupied the hours sped by and gradually we realised that not only were the anchors holding but that the pumps working flat out were able to take care of what water we were making by dusk the wind had swung right round into the west again so that we were once more under the lee of the island the sea dropped quickly and then there was no longer any danger of our being blown on to the shore we finally got the ship trimmed at three oclock in the morning in the galley with the cooks cat purring round our legs we had a little celebration party on tea and rum we were all practically asleep on our feet mac came up from the engineroom and reported that hed cleared the fuel system and as soon as hed got it back hed fire the boilers there was now no doubt of our safety peace of mind flooded through my aching limbs and with that and the warmth of the fire i fell asleep where i sat in front of the galley stove i woke to find jenny shaking me by the arm i felt cold and wretched bert was curled up on the cooks bunk snoring loudly zelinski was frying soya sausages its getting light jenny said i rubbed my eyes and stretched after a shave and breakfast i felt better mac took us down to the engineroom the place was hot and full of life one of the main boilers was fired the flames glowed red through the steel door the pressure gauge was beginning to register all have the port engine working before midday he said grinning i think that was the first and the last time i ever saw mac grin he looked like a schoolboy showing off a new toy up on deck smoke rolled out of the funnel in a black cloud i think i feel a bit lightheaded jenny said we were standing on the bridge and i was going over in my mind how best to handle the ship neither jenny nor i really knew anything about it mac was the only one of us who had sailed in steam and only he understood the engines with luck well be back in a fortnight i said and kissed her she laughed and pressed my hand the lucks been with us so far she said except for the eilean mor we went into the wheelhouse then and began checking equipment testing voice pipes examining charts we must have been there the better part of an hour talking and planning and going over things when i heard bert shouting as i stepped out of the wheelhouse on to the bridge his feet clattered up the bridge ladder jim he shouted jim whats the matter i asked as he stumbled on to the bridge look he panted pointing aft beyond the trikkala to the line of the reefs he pointed straight towards the gap a wave had just crashed against the pinnacle on the south side of the entrance it burst in a cloud of spray and then spilled in a flood of surf across the gap everything looked the same the line of the reefs the white boil of the surf the leaden scudfilled sky what is it i shouted in his ear there in the gap he shouted back the water tossed upwards as backwash hit the oncoming surge of water then as the sea settled i saw it out beyond the gap half hidden in a curtain of spray was the squat funnel of a small ship next instant i could see her bows coming up black with the sea running white off her snout like a submarine surfacing those bows were headed for the gap i felt my nerves tense as i strained my eyes to see her enter the gap jenny came out and caught my arm what is it jim i pointed and i felt her start as the black funnel showed for an instant in the foam the vessel was in the gap now a wave broke the funnel heeled right over the ship was lost in a great smother of foam then she rose up just as the eilean mor had done for an instant we could see her clearly a tug then she was down again smothered in surf and spray a moment later she spilled through the gap and was in calmer waters not half a mile away from us it was halseys tug no doubt of that unless there were two admiralty tugs headed for maddons rock which was hardly likely is it is it halsey jenny shouted yes thats im all right miss bert answered her thats capn blarsted alsey orl right bert get the rifles quick i ordered and the ammo in a matter of minutes we were at what was for us action stations we left mac with the engines if only we could get steam up before they boarded us we might still have a chance jenny and i with a rifle apiece were on the bridge which had armourprotected sides bert and zelinski were aft we all had revolvers as well as rifles the tug headed straight for us above the din of the reefs i distinctly heard their engineroom telegraph ring as they cut to slow ahead through the glasses i could see halsey standing on the bridge his black beard was white with salt he had no cap on and his long dark hair hung about his face beside him stood the lean long figure of hendrik will he try and board us right away jenny asked no i said hell hail us first he wont know whos on board hell want to know that before he starts anything jenny suddenly gripped my hand jim ive suddenly remembered something she said something bert said do you remember he said he thought that when halsey had got the silver hed abandon all the crew except the old gang probably rankin too they must have others on board besides the five who escaped from the trikkala if we could work h their fears she scrambled to her feet theres a megaphone in the wheelhouse she said it was a chance it might make them hold off for a bit we had to have time i seized one of the engineroom voicepipes and blew down it mac i called is that you mr vardy came his voice faint and distant through the tube yes i replied halsey has arrived whats the earliest moment we can get that port engine going weel a canna promise it for anither hour i okay i said im on the bridge let me know the instant we can use it another hour two hours later and we should have given halsey the slip our luck seemed to have deserted us utterly jenny returned and handed me the megaphone the tugs screws churned as she went astern she had fetched up within a long stones throw of the trikkala ahoy there trikkala came halseys voice over the loudhailer ahoy who is on board and then again ahoy trikkala this is the salvage tug tempest sailing under orders of the british admiralty he was lying of course but it showed that it had not occurred to him that bert and i had reached the trikkala ahoy trikkala he called again is anyone on board i put the megaphone to my lips then and keeping well under cover hailed the tug ahoy there tempest calling the crew of the salvage tug tempest trikkala calling the crew of the tempest this is a noncommissioned officer of the british army speaking to you i could see the crew lining the bulwarks i hold the trikkala and the bullion on board in the kings name further i order you to deliver to me the person of captain halsey charged with the murder of twentythree members of the crew of the trikkala implicated with him are hendrik first officer of the trikkala and two seamen jukes and evans these persons will be delivered on board this ship in irons i warn you that if you commit an act of piracy under the orders of the prisoner halsey it is possible that you will suffer the same fate as the crew of the trikkala halsey is a murderer and i stopped then for the tugs siren was blowing drowning my voice the screws frothed at her stern and she swung away in a wide arc her siren still blowing a feather of white steam at her funnel jenny seized my arm oh jim that was terrific you scared him and all that official stuff about wanted for murder she was laughing i felt a momentary thrill of excitement then it was gone halsey would come back the bait of half a million in silver bullion would soon settle the anxieties of his crew all i had done was to tell him who we were and gain a bit of time i went to the engineroom voicepipe again mac i called youve got to get that engine working a canna do anything till weve got steam up his voice sounded thin and peevish wisht if only halsey had been a few hours later what do you suppose hell do now jenny asked give his crew a pep talk and then hell come back i replied will he try and board us god knows i said if i were in his shoes i know what id do cut the trikkala adrift wed be on those rocks over there in no time then he could deal with us at his leisure the tug was hoveto now about half a mile to the north of us inside the reefs through the glasses i saw the crew assemble on the focsle under the bridge i counted about a dozen of them halsey was addressing them from the bridge berts voice came faintly from the stern i went to the port wing of the bridge and looked aft to see what he wanted he was standing by the threeinch i couldnt hear what he said but he kept beckoning to me and pointing to the gun then he went over to one of the lockers which he had opened and pulled out a shell he made a motion of ramming it up the gun i was down that bridge ladder in an instant and running aft it had never occurred to me that those ancient rustcaked guns could be used but then i wasnt a gunner bert was if it could be fired then here was our answer i bert was fiddling with the breech mechanism as i came up is there a chance of our being able to use it i panted he looked round and grinned dont know guvnor barrels pretty rusty but i managed to lower the breech block shes all right on elevation but the traverse is a bit sticky wot dyer fink shall we ave a go shes bin greased but then that was a long time ago the rust just flakes off the atside o the barrel like as not shell explode but if its our only chance wed better take it i hesitated the thing looked rotten with rust for more than a year it had taken the full brunt of the waves what about the one in the bows i suggested i aint ad a look at er she might be better but i dat it she was facin inter the wind all the time anyway we aint got time ter look er over ere comes the ruddy tug now he was right the tug was under way again she swung in a wide arc coming right round so that she was headed towards us again okay bert i said well take a chance on it right you take the traverse ill take the elevation and do the firing he began to sing praise the lord and pass the ammunition as he lowered the breech again and rammed one of the rounds home the breech block rose with a clang i told zelinski who was standing by to run to the bridge and get the megaphone ill give them warning i said if they dont stop well put a shot across her bows okay rightho chum bert wriggled on to the layers seat on the left of the gun the rand i got up the spat is fused for zero mind the awser he added as i climbed into the other layers seat it was the hawser that ran out to zelinskis anchor it was lying slack on the deck close by me its all right i said its the bow anchor thats holding her i didnt worry about it for the trikkala was lying with her bows turned to the wind and there was no chance of the stern anchor line suddenly pulling tight the tug was coming up fast now the decks were deserted halsey had ordered his men under cover through the glasses i could see jukes and evans with hendrik on the bridge both of them were armed with rifles they ducked down under cover as the tug neared the trikkala zelinski handed me the megaphone jenny had come down with him is that gun all right she asked anxiously i hope so i said you and zelinski get under cover and keep well away from the gun i saw jenny hesitate for gods sake get under cover i said the tug was close now she had cut down her speed as i had thought she was making straight for the point where the anchor cable dipped in the waves shed nose her bows under the cable and sheltered by the tugs hull the crew would cut through it with a hacksaw then theyd do the same to the bow anchor chain i put the megaphone to my lips ahoy tempest i hailed ahoy if you dont go about ill open fire es oldin to is course bert said shall we let im ave it the rusty muzzle of the gun dipped as he depressed i traversed right the gearing was sticky but forcing the gun round with all my weight on the traversing handle i found the tug in my sights on targetbert reported i laid her off a bit ahead of the tempest right i called out and then with my heart in my mouth i ordered fire there was a flash a violent explosion that made my ears sing deafly and in the same instant a great fountain of water shot up just in front of the tugs bows luvly bert called out excitedly thats put the wind up em he had jumped down from his seat and was thrusting another round into the breech i sat slightly dazed with the realisation that the gun had fired and we were still alive men were running about the tempests decks we were sitting on top of them at pointblank range and they knew it i saw somebody on the bridge working frantically at the wheel the engineroom telegraph rang the screws frothed white at the stern the breech block clanged to thatll teach capting stupid alsey bert said he suddenly laughed look at the poor fools fightin at the wheel blimey look theyre goin ter foul our anchor awser theyre runnin slap into it in their frantic haste to bring the tug round they seemed to have forgotten all about the anchor hawser they were aiming to run underneath i thought for a moment that it would sweep their deck of bridge funnel everything but it was the bows that hit the hawser the whole weight of the boat thrust at it pushing it out in a great loop jennys voice suddenly cried jim the hawser then berts voice shouted look at in that same instant i saw the whole length of the slack hawser rise out of the water and whip tight like a bowstring something rose up from the deck like a solid bar and crashed against my seat a terrible pain broke through my hip and back i felt myself flung forward then in a daze of pain and lost consciousness i felt myself falling falling then it was dark and i was struggling i could not breathe i was fighting in the toil of some nightmare fabric that seemed to have no substance yet was closed all about me i dont remember anything after that until i found myself lying in the bottom of a boat a mans sea boot close against my face my clothes were soaked and i was shivering with cold the boat pitched and tossed violently oars creaked rhythmically i looked up my head was lying between a mans feet two knees were hunched between me and the grey sky framing a mans face he looked down at me it was hendrik i closed my eyes i thought this must be part of the nightmare but slowly it all came back to me the hawser whipped suddenly taut the pain in my thigh and back that sensation of flying through the air i knew then that i had been flung over the stern of the trikkala the tug must have lowered a boat wind and tide would have carried me towards the tug i suppose bert had been afraid to open fire on them or they had threatened to shoot me if he did the boards were hard i tried to move myself into a more comfortable position but such a pain swept up my side that i think i lost consciousness again the next thing i knew i was being lifted out of the boat more pain but i could move my legs and i realised that nothing was broken is he conscious mr hendrik it was halseys voice aye replied the mate theres nothing the matter wi him at all legs and back a wee bit bruised thats all i was carried down a companion ladder a door was opened and i was dropped on to a bunk i struggled on to one elbow and stared around me i was in a small cabin hendrik was there so was halsey the two men who had carried me in went out halsey closed the door he pulled up a chair and sat down now dear boy perhaps youll tell me how you come to be on the trikkala his voice was soft gentle as a womans yet without warmth almost colourless i felt myself panicking what are you going to do with me i asked him struggling to keep my voice to an even pitch that depends on you and your friends he replied smoothly come lets have your story you and cook came on board the tempest at newcastle you found out where the trikkala was lying from rankin then what we got a boat and sailed to maddons rock i said how did you get the boat how many of you are there several of us i answered vaguely halsey clucked his tongue come vardy a little more precision please how many of you thats up to you to find out i replied i was scared but i had myself under control now he laughed that jeering mirthless laugh there are ways of making you talk or wait a minute he chuckled softly in his beard i saw a woman on board that was just after you had fallen into the water she was trying to persuade one of your friends to jump in after you there was something about her she was very like miss sorrel who went with you on that raft when we abandoned the trikkala would it be miss sorrel his voice was suddenly sharp would it vardy he was leaning over me sudden excitement blazing in his eyes i braced myself for the blow but the violence died suddenly out of his eyes and he leaned back in his chair i see it is miss sorrel and she is in love with you or she would not be here he chuckled again that makes it so much easier then he leaned forward vardy he said ill give you a chance advise your friends to give themselves up you are escaped convicts the law will be against you but if they let us come aboard the trikkala peaceably then when we get back to england im not a fool i interrupted him youve no intention of taking your crew back to england let alone us youll abandon all but your own gang as you abandoned the crew of the trikkala he sighed come come dear boy a little morbid arent you he shrugged his shoulders and got to his feet ill leave you now to think over your position in a court of law your action in seizing the trikkala and opening fire on us would be regarded as an act of piracy and what about your action in beaching the trikkala up here i countered he laughed so that his teeth showed white in the black frame of his beard yes he said i admit that i would not like it to come to a court case come ill make you an offer if a little of the silver is missing when i dock i can always say i was unable to salvage it all suppose i land you and your friends at say tromso in norway a man with money can always disappear he nodded think it over my friend now i will go and bring a little pressure to bear on your friends he shook his head smiling oh romeo romeo wherefore art thou romeo he quoted then with another chuckle he said come mr hendrik i think we will give juliet a hail his evil chuckle echoed in my ears long after he and hendrik had gone out locking the door after them i struggled off the bunk and stood up my whole body seemed sore as if i had fallen on to concrete paving but i was only bruised nothing worse god why did this have to happen our luck had deserted us with a vengeance up on deck the loudhailer came to life it was halseys voice muffled and faint tempest calling trikkala tempest calling trikkala unless you surrender ship and bullion within one hour i intend to hang vardy for an act of piracy he repeated the message and then the loudhailer was switched off for a wild moment i thought he was bluffing bert would call his bluff and but then i remembered the crew of the trikkala and the cooks story of the penang halsey meant just what he said in an hours time i should either swing from a ropes end or jenny and bert would hand over the trikkala in either case the end would be the same death halsey would leave us marooned on maddons rock he wouldnt kill us outright hed leave us to die a natural death on that ghastly rock thus he would pay lip service to his conscience the cabin was small smaller than my cell in dartmoor the sense of being shut in strained at my nerves i tried to fight down my fear but it came at me in a mist of terror that sent me shouting and beating on the door i tried to break it open with a chair but the door was stout and the chair broke in my hand i searched wildly round for some stronger weapon but there was nothing and in a frenzy i beat upon it with my fists when i came to my senses i found myself tugging at the handle and sobbing like a lunatic i forced myself to be calm i sat down on the bunk i must get out i must get clear of the ship chapter ten dynamite gradually i calmed myself there must be a way out there must be something i could do the cabin walls were of wood but it was stout wood no more chance of forcing a way through them than through the door the padding of gum boots on the deck planks sounded almost over my head i looked up the deck planks formed part of the ceiling of the cabin it was impossible to stand upright beneath them but the remainder of the cabin was loftier the increased height being obtained by a raised hatch that must rise about two feet above the deck and then i noticed that in the side of this hatch was a small porthole about six inches in diameter it was closed presumably they had battened everything down coming through the gap in the reefs i climbed on a chair and unscrewing the catch opened the deadlight i found myself looking out between a mans legs across half a mile of tossing waves to the rusty hulk of the trikkala if only that porthole had been bigger but i realised that it would be no use i could not swim that distance the water would be too cold but the sight of the open air and the trikkala raised my spirits and at that moment a mans voice said did yer ever hear the loike of it will oi bin at sea twentythree years now and oi never heard of a man being hanged for piracy and what if it is piracy to hang a man without trial thats murder to my way of thinking the legs shifted blocking my view of the trikkala another voice close by said murder his voice sounded scared well whatever it is man i dont like it the captain must be daft whatever a mans done hes a right to a trial and halsey now is he a judge of what is an act of piracy what happened on board the trikkala when all the crew was lost just tell me that man dont look round i said quietly i saw the legs jerk tense just keep standing there i went on quickly lean answer your question the trikkalas boats were tampered with so that the crew would all be lost twentythree men were murdered that night halsey and hendrik were chiefly responsible they fixed it so that they had the trikkala to themselves how do you know asked the irishman i escaped on a raft i replied listen this is the truth and your lives may depend upon it halsey will only take his original crew back to england the rest will be left here on the rock as soon as the silver has been stowed on board the tug and the trikkala destroyed do you understand they didnt answer has halsey issued arms to the crew i asked no he and the mate are armed and two of his old crowd jukes and evans so hes got you i said what about rankin hes scared its only the four of them that has been issued with arms ask rankin to come here i said tell him vardy wants to speak to him say its a matter of life and death for him and tell the others what i have told you if you dont do something quickly your bones will be lying on maddons rock is it true youre a convict one of them asked yes i said i tried to warn the crew of the trikkala i was convicted of mutiny dont ask any more questions but as you value your lives take over the ship they did not move for a moment then the irishman said come on will oid like a word with jessop and their gum boots padded off along the deck it was only a small ray of hope but it gave me courage and with that little porthole open the cabin no longer seemed to close in around me and crush my spirits the minutes ticked slowly by who was jessop would they believe me and if they did would they act before halsey carried out his threat questions poured through my brain and fermented into all sorts of wild ideas and the minutes dragged by slowly and inexorably i began to examine the cabin more for something to do than out of any real interest by the bunk was a small desk and over it a shelf containing books on seamanship and among them was a shakespeare and a complete bernard shaw several of eugene oneills plays and a copy of the plough and the stars with sudden interest i took a bunch of letters from a pigeonhole in the desk they were addressed to captain theodore halsey i was in halseys cabin after that time slipped quickly by as i ran through the contents of the desk i think i forgot that id only an hour to live in my excitement at ransacking his personal belongings for well i didnt know what i was looking for but i wanted a clue to his past and i found it it was a little waterproof letter case they were all personal letters in the case letters from his wife who signed herself toinette in a spidery foreign hand from lawyers from business men in shanghai and canton from shipowners i pulled out a halfquarto envelope and shook the contents on to the desk they were press cuttings and staring at me from the pile was the very picture i had seen in the copy of the theatregoer i had found on the trikkala underneath was the name leo foulds it was captioned arson suspect disappears below the picture was the story the young shakespearean actor leo foulds wanted in connection with the fire at the lyric theatre islington on january in which ten people lost their lives has disappeared foulds was the owner of the lyric where as actormanager he was running an extravagant shakespeare season it is believed that he was heavily in debt the lyric was insured for a big sum the fire began in the orchestra pit one of the stage hands saw foulds coming out of the pit just before the fire started the police have a warrant for his arrest it is understood that he may be charged with murder as well as arson the other cuttings were much the same they were from the papers of february i pushed them back into the envelope and slipped it into my pocket as i was replacing the letter case a voice called me softly by name i closed the drawers and jumped on to the chair again so that i could look through the porthole rankin was leaning with his back against the rail i could just see his face it looked white and flabby his eyes met mine for a second and then he looked away out towards the trikkala i was told you wanted to see me he said quietly his hand shook as he twisted nervously at one of the gilt buttons of his jacket yes i said youre to be left on maddons rock with the rest of the crew he turned towards me his eyes were crazed with fear how do you know he asked did halsey tell you what has he been saying about me i accused him of intending to maroon the tugs crew on the rock i answered him his reply was youre right and ill leave that gutless swine rankin there to keep them company it was a lie but he believed me he believed me because it was the very thing he feared what do you want me to do he asked what can i do his voice was broken pitiful i knew this would happen ever since that night in newcastle i knew it would happen all the way up here i knew this would be the end couldnt you have sent a radio message i asked no second day out halsey smashed the radio equipment explained it by saying secrecy was essential but i knew then i knew why he didnt want the radio working couldnt you tell your fears to the crew no they dont trust me theyre treasurecrazy anyway theyre a tough lot theyre scared now though i told him is there a man called jessop on board yes hes an american hes the toughest of the lot well go and have a word with him right away i said hes your man have you got a gun yes a revolver i hid it in my cabin listen vardy if i had a hand in saving your neck would you would you give evidence on my behalf at any trial yes i said youre not directly implicated in the murder of the trikkalas crew at worst youd only get a very light sentence i might be able to get you off altogether id do my best anyway mr rankin the voice was hendriks are you talking to yourself or by god thats where we put vardy i shut the porthole and screwed it up then i sat down on the bunk footsteps came tumbling down the companion ladder the key turned i buried my head in my hands as the door opened it was hendrik he glanced round the cabin and then up at the porthole he didnt say anything but shortly afterwards jukes came in to act as jailer he had a rifle and there was a pistol stuck in his pocket the door was locked after him on the outside so the minutes dragged by without my having a chance of any further contact with the crew i now felt more resigned but my brow was clammy and cold with sweat as though i had a fever jukes battered nose and torn ears seemed a constant reminder of the violence i faced at long last the engineroom telegraph sounded faintly from the bridge and the ship vibrated gently as the screws began to turn i could hear the water swirling past the tugs side after a few minutes the engineroom telegraph rang again and the vibration ceased then hendriks voice ordered all men to muster forard the crews boots clattered on the deck planking above my head somebody was coming down the companion ladder the key turned in the lock and the door opened it was hendrik he had a length of twine in his hand with this he bound my wrists behind my back then i was taken out on deck we were lying about four cables length from the stern of the trikkala i could see no sign of life on the deck of the rusty derelict i was taken along the deck and thrust up on to the bridge halsey was there pacing up and down evans was standing by the wheel a rifle slung over his shoulder and the butt of a pistol sticking out of his pocket the men were clustering forard below the bridge they looked a tough bunch a rope with a noose at the end dangled from a pulley fixed to the mast halsey stopped his pacing and faced me now he said smiling gently if you tell your friends to hand over the ship and the bullion ill undertake to land you somewhere safe yes i said loudly on maddons rock where youre going to leave these poor fellows and i nodded in the direction of the crew a slight murmur ran through the crowd of upturned faces gag him halsey said sharply jukes stuffed a dirty handkerchief into my mouth and bound it there with twine hell change his mind when he feels the bite of the rope round his neck halsey said and fell to pacing the bridge again several more men came forard to join the others there were about a dozen of them now as halsey passed me i heard him muttering blood hath been shed ere now i the olden time ere human statute purgd the gentle weal ay and since too murders have been performd too terrible for the ear then to hendrik in a whisper mr hendrik keep your eyes on the men theyre getting scared and i dont trust them and watch rankin rankin was coming aft he walked slowly with a strangely mincing step for such a large man his face was working and his eyes looked overlarge and fever bright he began to climb the ladder to the bridge mr rankin halsey said ill trouble you to stay down there with the men rankin stopped his mouth fell open he hesitated for a moment as though fascinated by halseys gaze then he turned and went down on to the deck again and forard to join the men halsey went to the windbreaker of the bridge and faced the crew all his own men were behind him on the bridge men he cried dramatically his arm flung up as though he were anthony calling a roman mob to silence men i have called you forard to witness the execution of a man for piracy on the high seas the words rolled off his tongue with a violence that was accentuated by the background roar of the surf breaking along the reefs that enclosed us this man is a convict a mutineer who escaped from dartmoor and but there he was interrupted by a tall lankilybuilt man capn halsey some of the boys and meself feel that when we shipped with you we didnt figure on being a party to murder who talks of murder halsey answered with a thrust of his beard this is no murder this is an execution youve no rights under international maritime law to hang a guy without trial the fellow interrupted again when i want your views jessop ill ask for them halseys voice was sharp almost a snarl but the american stuck to his guns and i felt a sudden hope see here capn we feel this fellers a right to a trial halseys fist crashed down on the bridge rail if you dont keep quiet you mutinous dog he shouted ill clap you in irons and then in a quick undertone to hendrik keep your gun handy and watch rankin hes as nervous as a kitten he turned and faced his crew again men he said quieting the murmur that had risen with half a million pounds at stake its no time to consider the niceties of international law we must get aboard the trikkala and if it is necessary to string up an escaped mutineer to achieve our ends then it must be done however much we may deplore it either he orders his people to hand over the trikkala or we string him up he turned to me then well vardy i nodded my head and made noises to indicate that i wanted to speak several of the crew murmured let him speak halsey came over to me and undid the gag heres the loudhailer mike he said thrusting the little black bakelite box towards me theres one question id like to ask first i said loudly so that the crew could hear i saw his eyes watching me narrowly and hurried on what are you going to do with these men i nodded towards the crew when youve got the silver are you going to abandon them as you abandoned his fist crashed into my face and i staggered back against jukes at the same moment i heard hendrik cry lookout sir my eyes were half closed with pain but i saw the crowd below open out round rankin he had a pistol in his hand rankin put that gun down halsey ordered like a man dazed with fever rankin suddenly levelled it at halsey there was a flash and an earsplitting report close beside me rankins mouth opened a look of surprise crossed his face he gave a deep gurgling cough a dribble of blood flowed from the corner of his mouth the pistol clattered to the deck and his arm went slack then slowly he sagged at the knees and slumped across the anchor chain halsey stepped forward his revolver smoking he went to the bridge and looked down at the dazed faces of his crew mutiny ehhe said then in a wilder voice hear me you wrangling pirates that fall out in sharing that which you have pilld from me which of you trembles not that looks on me his tone suddenly became steadier the first man that takes a step forward ill shoot him they were dumb with fright cowed it was the madness of the man as much as the gun in his hand that held them back they were afraid of him hendrik plucked him by the sleeve and pointed to the trikkala theyre training that gun of theirs on us capn halsey do ye think it wise to risk being blown oot o the water so long as vardy is alive they wont shoot halsey retorted sharply anyway he added in a lower tone weve got to risk it we could wait till nightfall and board them under cover of darkness the mate reminded him halsey gave a sneering laugh with a mutinous crew like this the first time vardy hailed us did the damage and now rankins shot theyre scared if i thought there was any other way mr hendrik believe me id take it jukes slip the noose over his head and stand him at the top of the bridge ladder get hold of the rope man the hemp was rough and wet with sea water i passed my tongue across my swollen lips the blood tasted salt in my mouth there was only one chance now the crew wouldnt do anything they were unarmed and he had them at his mercy captain halsey i said ill do as you want give me the loudhailer he hesitated his black eyes fixed on me as though he would read what was in my mind but apparently i looked sufficiently dejected for he held the mike out to me and switched on so that i could hear the crackle of the loudhailers amplifier on the mast above my head bert i hailed i could see him sitting on the elevation seat of the threeinch with jenny on the traversing side the muzzle of it pointed straight at us these are orders i went on open fire immediately the mike was jerked out of my hand the noose closed like a rough vice round my neck and i gasped for breath at the same time somebodys fist crashed into my face i saw nothing then i was blinded by pain and gasping for breath dimly i heard halsey on the loudhailer saying stop the instant you fire vardy will be killed listen carefully i shall steam clear of you now and i will give you a further quarter of an hour to vacate the trikkala if you are not clear of the ship by then vardy will be hanged is that clear trikkala then berts voice came floating across the water distorted by the megaphone he held to his lips i got yer capn alsey but im warning yer the instant vardys feet leave the ground ill blow yer at the water and dont yer try steamin at o range or ill open fire and then in a louder voice men of the tempest the man standin on the bridge there is a omicidal maniac if you aint got the guts ter rush im ell murder you same as he done full ahead both ordered halsey hendrik leaped to the telegraph and clanged it sharply twice full ahead it is sir he reported the bridge trembled as the screws bit into the water bert had seen the water frothing at her stern stop those engines he called there was a murmur from the crew i heard the american jessop call out for gods sake stop capn get ready to use your gun mr hendrik halsey ordered and then to the crew keep back all of you in that instant there was an explosion and the whole scene seemed to disintegrate into a great upthrust of water flame and debris i was flung against the bridge rail slipped and fell the first thing i remember seeing was the funnel toppling crazily against the sky hendrik lying with his back across the wheel saw it coming i remember his mouth opening but i could hear nothing my eardrums were dead in a soundless world i saw the funnel fall leisurely forward smash the edge of the bridge and finish up with the steam whistle embedded in the mates stomach whilst he writhed and twisted then the bridge slowly collapsed the windbreaker folded outwards and we were pitched amongst the crew when i staggered to my feet i found the rope was no longer round my neck the tug had a great hole driven in her amidships flames were licking out of the centre of it muffled sounds penetrated my numbed ears there were screams and shouts and a sudden roar of escaping steam somebody cut my hands free i saw the american take halseys pistol from him as the captain staggered to his feet hendriks body lay motionless in a pool of blood jukes was stumbling about blindly with his hands to his eyes evans stood dazed and unarmed jessop seemed to be getting some order amongst the men they scrambled aft and got the two boats lowered somebody took my arm and hustled me into one of them as we pulled away from the tugs side i saw flames leaping through the gaping rent in her side smoke poured from the black hole where the funnel had been i remember looking up and seeing halsey come running aft he was pleading to be allowed to come in the boat but jessop just laughed go tell your worries to the crew of the trikkala he called and then he turned to the men at the oars aint you fellers got any sense pull damn you when the flames reach that dynamite shes gonna blow up an i aint aimin to be in the vicinity come on fellers pull he urged i saw jukes and evans were among those straining at the oars back on the tug halsey was hacking feverishly at the ropes that secured the raft he freed it and then found he couldnt lift the thing he seemed frenzied with terror he looked round wildly and then seized a bucket and began trying to put out the fire with it i turned to jessop was there much dynamite on the tug i asked him why sure he said enough to blow up the empire state building guess old man halsey intended to leave no trace of the trikkala you knew that when you refused to take halsey in the boati asked see here mister he said i got you away didnt i well there wasnt any more room in the boat thats my story see let halsey have a taste of his own medicine the rusty side of the trikkala towered above us berts voice called down you orl right jim im okayi said comin dan a rope ladder hit the water beside the boat i swung myself on to it and scrambled up my legs were weak and my face felt swollen and huge bert helped me over the rail those red flaking deck plates seemed like home jim jenny was in my arms laughing and sobbing allin the same breath i touched her hair i couldnt believe it was only just over an hour that id been on board the tempest darling thank god i thought id never see you again i felt suddenly relaxed and exhausted your poor face come below and ill fix it no i said no there are things to do i turned to bert watch these men as they come up i told him keep them covered with your rifle and fall them in on the deck i want a word with them okay mate one by one the men from the two boats climbed over the rail several of them had weapons taken from halsey and his gang bert disarmed them and lined them up against the rail thats the lot guvnor he reported then he went to the rail and leaned over looking aft blimey he cried look at the tug winds fannin them flames a fair treat we all crowded to the rails staring at the tug she was like a fire ship the wind had spread the flames aft so that she was like a blazing torch and in the midst of that inferno halsey was straining frenziedly to thrust the raft overboard he had got it upended against the bulwarks and his figure stood out clear and black against the flames as he struggled to thrust it overboard with what must have been a superhuman effort he got the end of it under his shoulder straightened his body and the raft slid with a splash into the water and in that instant there was a series of short explosions from deep inside the tug then suddenly the whole vessel opened out like some trick firework and with a shattering roar flung fire and debris high into the air slowly the debris fell back into the water all that remained of the tempest was the bows and stern these collapsed inwards and then very slowly slid beneath the waves nothing remained then but a dark cloud of vapour that held for a moment in the shape of a smoke ring and then was dispersed into long trailing wisps by the wind well thats the end of alsey bert said with a shrug of his shoulders cant say im goin ter miss im he turned his attention to the crew of the tempest nah then get fell in he said come along you he snapped at jukes who was looking scared aint no use muttering prayers for is soul when they were lined up i went over to the american i take it youre acting as spokesman for the rest i said i guess so he replied i nodded right i hope youll appreciate my position im shorthanded and theres bullion on this ship youll be assigned to a messroom and locked in that is until we re in the shipping lanes two men will be allowed out at a time for exercise so long as you give no trouble ill see that when we reach port you have a chance to get ashore and disappear if you want to in any case ill support your plea of innocence at any inquiry jukes and evans youll be put in irons who is the wireless operator jessop pointed out a small man with crafty eyes and a shock of curly fair hair youll report to the radioroom and get to work right away on repairing the equipment i want to contact a shore station as soon as possible i turned to bert right take em away put em in the crews quarters then to jenny whats the engine situation i dont know she said we were too worried to bother about the engines well lets go up to the bridge and get mac on the blower i said he should have steam up by now and i want to get out of this place while the going is good it was a welcome sound to hear macs voice coming up faintly from the bowels of the ship whats the engine position mac i asked ye can get going noo mr vardy he said but yell have to be content wi half speed all mebbe have the other engine going by tomorrow morning okay mac i said good work but with only one engine ill need full ahead through the gap weel ye can have it mr vardy he said but dinna blame me if the whole engineroom falls oot through the bottom of her shes no jist oot of the yards ye ken ye canna afford to take liberties wi a ship in this condition as long as i can have full steam through the gap i told him thats all i ask five minutes later bert came up on to the bridge he had zelinski with him they were both so festooned around with weapons that they looked like a couple of brigands well i got em all locked up usin the crews messroom as a calaboose jukes an evans the ripe pair o rotters i gave em a cabin to themselves fand some handcuffs an clapped those on their wrists ter keep em quiet that foxy little sparks i locked in the wirelessroom an told im ter get to work good now you and zelinski get the anchor up you can slip the after hawser were getting out of here right away suits me bert grinned i ad abat enough of maddons rock he and zelinski clattered down the bridge ladder and hurried aft a curtain of rain swept over us blotting out all sight of the beach where the trikkala had lain i looked aft towards the gap in the reef the surf broke across it in thundering cascades then my view became blurred by the driving rain the reef was blotted out so was the patch of oil and floating driftwood that marked halseys grave i wish we could get the radio going jenny said if theres another storm corning up im not sure we oughtnt to stay here the trikkala wont stand much of a beating in her present condition we darent risk it i said weve got to get out of here whilst the goings good if a storm blew up and the wind backed round to the east again wed be piled up on that beach and that would be the end all right she said but dont forget weve no boats i wont i replied as i went into the wheelhouse and got some oilskins as i came out bert and zelinski passed below the bridge on their way forard okay bert called up to me we slipped the awser hang on till this squall is over i told him a few minutes later the rain suddenly ceased and the gap was visible again a stretch of foaming white against a leaden background of sea and sky i signalled to bert and an instant later the rusty anchor chain began clattering inboard pulling the trikkala slowly towards the beach suddenly the donkeyengine raced the ship ceased to move i went to the starbd wing of the bridge and looked forard along the side i caught a glimpse of the broken end of the chain thrashing loosely in the break of a wave the chain was rotten with rust it had just snapped it did not matter now we shouldnt need that anchor again until we got to england but it worried me the rest of the trikkala was probably as rotten as that chain for all we knew the engines might do just what mac had said fall out through the bottom of the ship i glanced at jenny she was looking at me and i could see that the same thoughts were in her mind too well the gap would tell us if we got through those seas safely with that one engine at full ahead the probability was that the trikkala would make it if we got through that gap my stomach was a void of fear as i stretched out my hand to the brass handle of the engineroom telegraph then i had grasped it rung it twice and set it to full astern on the port engine a tremor ran through the ship i felt the bridge vibrate under my feet i waited scarcely daring to breathe suppose the shaft of the port propeller was cracked if it broke it might rip through the rusty bottom of the ship or the bearings on the turbines might be rusty the engine might seizeup the vibration seemed to increase i could see flakes of rust breaking away from the side of the bridge and on the deck red rotten iron seemed to be peeling off her but slowly almost imperceptibly the trikkala began to back away from maddons rock towards that patch of oil where the tempest had gone down the vibrations died as the ship got under way i put the wheel over and gradually the bows came round when she had swung almost broadside to the beach i signalled stop on the telegraph the vibrations ceased altogether we were gliding astern softly quietly with a feather of smoke from the funnel and that comforting aliveness of a ship with its engines running when we had lost sufficient way for the risk to be reasonable i ordered slow ahead on the port engine but even at slow ahead the ship seemed to be shaking its rusty plates apart she trembled from stem to stern as that single screw bit the water and tried to force her ahead at last our sternway was checked and we began to glide slowly ahead i spun the wheel hard over to port and ordered half ahead the long line of the reefs swung across our bows as we turned in a wide arc and headed for the gap viewed from the bridge of a ton freighter that gap didnt look quite so bad we were no longer looking up at the waves but down at them nevertheless it was a pretty aweinspiring sight a ship in good condition could make it all right for the wind having recently gone completely round the waves had less weight probably than when we came through in the eilean mor nevertheless thatwall of surf cascading across the gap was a good ten feet of solid raging water with only one engine and hull as rotten as cardboard it looked suicidal jenny was standing close by me she did not say anything she just kept looking straight ahead but i saw her knuckles white as she gripped the bridge rail with both hands better have your life jacket handy i said and you might get mine i yelled down to bert you and zelinski get your life jackets and stand by to let the tempests men out if we get into difficulties he nodded then i picked up the voicepipe and whistled down to mac give her full ahead now i ordered and mac stand by the voicepipe if we dont make it youll have to look slippy getting out of the engineroom och yell make it mr vardy he said for once he was optimistic the vibration increased the rust danced on the rotten deck plates the ship slowly gathered speed like an old steeplechaser taking a last fling at bechers brook the roar of the surf grew until it was no longer possible to speak the vibration of the trikkalas engine ceased to be a sound and became only a pins and needles sensation on the soles of my feet i hugged the southern side of the entrance as close as i dared gripping the wheel tight in my hand for i knew the instant the surf hit our bows the whole ship would begin to swing across the gap then anything might happen the steering gear might break the propeller shaft might snap the whole of our bows might break away it was impossible to time our arrival in the gap but we were lucky our bows thrust into the boiling surf just behind the break of a wave they swung slightly but i was able to hold the ship on her course away on the port bowl saw the boiling foam fling itself high into the air as it met the backwash of the previous wave beyond the pinnacle with its black rock pedestal cascading water the next wave built up even from the bridge it seemed like a frightful mountain ridge piling up and foaming at its crest like a thundering avalanche then it broke flung itself over the pedestal and crashed against the ships side with a roar that was unearthly a blinding sheet of spray rose high above the starbd rail the trikkala started like a thrashed horse the bows swung away to port the deck heeled over and then the broken spray fell in solid water on our decks as though endeavouring to beat us down into the sea for a moment i could see nothing i was clinging to the wheel struggling to put it over to starbd in an endeavour to hold the ship on her course then the spray cleared the surf went roaring past us and the next wave was piling up the bridge still vibrated under my feet the trikkala was still moving forward she was going through the gap now and taking it at an angle the full weight of the second wave was astern the wheel was whipped out of my hand and spun wildly our direction was altered as the whole stern of the ship was swept round by the force of the water the trikkala virtually pivoted on her bows i got hold of the wheel again we were facing south into a welter of foam i swung the ship back on to her course through a piledup wave that came green over the decks and then we were clear i couldnt realise it at first there was the boiling turmoil of the gap full astern of us and we were headed out into the rolling furrows of a quieter sea the trikkala was rolling madly but the engine was still running the deck still vibrated she was still afloat jenny seized my arm weve done it she shouted my body seemed to relax quite suddenly and i felt desperately tired it was then i became conscious of the pain of my left hand it had been caught by the spokes of the wheel and the little finger was broken but i didnt care we were through the gap and homeward bound we set our course sousouwest and before dusk closed in on us maddons rock was no more than a mad tumble of surfwhitened water far astern on the edge of visibility ahead of us lay a grey deepfurrowed waste of restless water the rustreddened bows of the trikkala thrust deep into the marching waves great clouds of spray drove the length of the ship as we struggled forward on our one engine just over miles away lay scotland and home well thats the story of the trikkala there is not much i can add that has not been published already just after passing between the shetlands and faroes the wind swung round and blew a gale from the noreast it was the worst may gale for several years the seas rolled green over our stern we lost our funnel and the whole bridge structure collapsed we began to make water faster than the pumps could deal with it our acting wireless operator had got some sort of a transmission working and i decided to send out an sos the call was answered strangely enough by loch ewe naval station we were then about miles north of the hebrides there were no ships in our immediate vicinity but when they realised who we were and had been informed that the bullion was on board they told us that an admiralty tug was being dispatched immediately to our assistance that was on the th of may we then had eight feet of water in number three hold and were badly down by the stern the following day the gale slackened and by dusk the tug had us in tow the ether fairly buzzed with messages from the board of trade from the kelt steamship company the owners of the trikkala from the admiralty and from practically every national newspaper before we docked at oban bids for the exclusive story had risen to ј and a film company had offered ј just for the first option on the story this should have prepared us for the excitement that our arrival at oban caused but on a rusty hulk with the desolate wilderness of the sea all round us it was quite impossible to realise that we were the topic of conversation of a whole nation for three days we topped the headlines on the front page of practically every newspaper in the country well i suppose it is pretty unusual for a ship reported lost to be thrown up out of a gale over a year later and of course there was that half million in silver bullion that is what really made it a story when we docked we faced an absolute barrage of newspapermen cameramen and officials sir philip kelt chairman of the kelt steamship company had flown up to meet us and on the fringe of the crowd stood jennys father that evening when the barrage of questions had died down and we had all of us made long statements we were allowed to go our way bert was catching the train to london with him went jon zelinski and the cooks cat zelinski was bound for polish headquarters jenny and i and her father saw them off so did about twenty newspapermen the engine whistled well ill say slong fer now mate bert said see you at the inquiry an you miss an i opes he gave us a sly wink i opes you two dont go an make a mess of it we shant was said almost in unison then as the train began to move jenny ran forward and kissed him cameras clicked he waved his hand well slong then he called an thanks fer the trip that night after dinner jenny and i walked down to the loch a nearly full moon hung over ben cruachan the highland hills were a vague huddled mass the water of the loch was like beaten pewter we walked silently along the road beyond connel bridge to the little inlet under dunstaffnage castle there was no ship lying at anchor there now only the little island of eilean mor stood in the placid water just off the end of the promontory she was a game little boat jenny said she was crying silently i said nothing but i decided then that part of my salvage money would go to the building of eilean mor ii and that that would be my wedding present to jenny the end
