chapter one bomb look jane cole said here she comes now the two americans looked along the street there were crowds of people everywhere in the middle of the road soldiers were riding towards them on horseback behind them came a golden coach pulled by six black horses thats my father jane said hes the coachman the man driving the horses the american woman said fantastic your fathers driving the queen quick harry use the video camera i am using it her husband said but shes too far away cant we get a little nearer jane we can try jane said follow me she took them nearer to the entrance to parliament this is where the coach will stop and the queen will get out then shell go upstairs to open parliament for this year didnt someone put a bomb under your parliament once the american man asked i read about that at school guy something guy fawkes jane said in he tried to blow up parliament thats right but dont worry theres no guy fawkes here today she smiled at the americans she was a student and this was her parttime job to show tourists round london she felt proud to show them her father driving the queen on a wonderful day like this then the queens coach came past in front of them the golden roof bright in the sunlight there were people everywhere trying to take photos jane saw a woman with redbrown hair behind the american man pressing the button of her camera thats stupid jane thought she can only see the backs of peoples heads there the woman shook her camera angrily there seemed to be something wrong with it the american woman pulled jane forward laughing happily come on she said lets get to the front use that video harry alan cole stopped the coach outside parliament and sat there quietly holding the horses a man opened the coach door and prince charles and the duke of edinburgh got out then the queen got out she was wearing a long white dress and carrying a gold handbag she walked slowly towards the entrance to the building excuse me please the woman with redbrown hair said i must get closer she pushed past jane and held out her small black camera oh all right jane said but my god there was a loud bang jane saw a bright white light in front of her eyes and felt a terrible hot wind on her face the wind threw her backwards and she fell to the ground with a lot of other people for a moment she lay there not thinking not seeing her eyes were open but she saw nothing only blue sky she heard nothing only silence her body felt no pain but she could smell something smoke smoke she thought i dont understand why smoke and this blue sky where am i then the screaming began the screaming was high and loud and terrible it didnt sound human it went on and on and on jane saw a hand in front of her on the ground a mans hand with blood on it and broken glass she moved her head and saw broken glass everywhere and blood and bodies lying on the ground she stood up slowly for a moment she thought everyone was dead there were bodies everywhere but no one was moving then a man ran across the road and one of the bodies moved the body wasnt human it was a horse as it moved it screamed the horse tried to stand up but it couldnt because it only had three legs there was blood allround the horse and a big bit of wood in its stomach the queens coach was broken into a thousand pieces and there were bits of wood and clothes and bodies everywhere the bodies looked like broken dolls dad she screamed oh god my father she ran quickly towards the coach a policeman with a bloody hand tried to stop her but she pushed him away my fathers over there she screamed at first she couldnt find him there were so many bodies and so much blood she saw the horse in the middle of a great lake of blood trying to get up on its front leg there was blood coming from the horses nose and stomach and under the back legs something that looked like a body a man father alan cole was covered with blood and his face was as white as paper when he saw jane he opened his eyes and screamed its my leg my leg get this horse off me his leg was under the back of the horse which was moving wildly trying to get up each time the horse moved it fell on alan coles leg and he screamed jane ran and pushed the horse but it was too big too heavy she pulled its tail but that was no good it tried to get up and fell on her fathers leg again twice she could hear his bones breaking then a policeman came and held the horses leg jane held its tail and another policeman held alans arms jane and the first policeman pulled the horse to one side while the second policeman pulled alan free the horse screamed kicked jane on the shoulder and died jane went in the ambulance with her father to the hospital there were lots of people there she heard a reporter talking on the telephone to his office five he said five dead and about thirty are very badly hurt it was a bomb it must be terrorists but the queen is safe she was inside parliament with her husband and prince charles and never mind the bloody queen jane thought what about my father the doctors took alan away from jane and she had to sit and wait her shoulder was hurt but not badly for nearly four hours she walked up and down drank coffee and thought why why try to kill the queen how will that help anyone why kill tourists and soldiers outside parliament why try to kill my father janes father was the most important person in the world to her when he was a soldier she had travelled around the world with him he had taught her to climb mountains win judo fights ride horses sail boats he was a great father now she thought he may be dead at midnight a young indian doctor came to see her he was tired and serious he looked at her sadly its bad news isnt it jane said is he dead no miss cole the doctor said we have saved your fathers life but i am afraid he hesitated yes what then please tell me i am afraid he has lost his leg it was too badly broken we had to cut it off oh my god jane sat down suddenly you cut his leg off she stared at the doctor and thought dad will never be able to climb or ride or sail again oh poor man its worse than being dead she began to cry im very sorry miss the doctor said we had to do it to save his life hell get an artificial leg hell learn to use it at least hes alive yes i suppose so jane looked up im sorry doctor im sure you did your best can i see him now yes of course the nurse will show you in the hospital bed alan cole lay quietly his face was as white as the sheets on the bed but when jane came in he opened his eyes slowly jane took one of his hands in hers the hand was cold like ice janie are you all right me im fine dad and youre going to be ok too arent you the doctor told me he closed his eyes and for a long time he didnt answer perhaps hes asleep again jane thought then very quietly alan cole said stay with me janie of course dad im not going anywhere jane sat down on a chair beside the bed you sleep now her father closed his eyes and the nurse smiled at jane would you like a cup of tea miss yes please jane said its going to be a long night she held her fathers hand and watched him sleeping he looks happy now she thought like a baby next day the doctor told alan about his leg jane sat by the bed and held his hand while he listened he didnt say anything but tears came into his eyes im very sorry mr cole the doctor said but we had to do it your leg was broken in forty places and you lost a lot of blood youre lucky to be alive lucky alan cole said angrily with this damn it man ill never walk again oh yes you will mr cole well get you an artificial leg theyre very good they move like an ordinary leg no one will see it under your trousers and will i be able to ride horses with it or swim or climb mountains well perhaps not the doctor hesitated well do our best for you mr cole believe me now heres something to help you sleep youll feel better later all day jane waited in the hospital she drank tea read newspapers had a meal and held her fathers hand as he slept no one came to visit her mother was dead and her brother lived in australia at four oclock her father woke up and looked at her with big frightened eyes janie he said yes dad what happened the doctor said there was a bomb didnt he and i lost my leg but i cant remember very quietly jane told him what she had seen then she read the newspaper aloud five people have died and forty are in hospital one man from the queens coach lost a leg and the other three are dead but the queen prince charles and the duke of edinburgh were not hurt yesterday some irish terrorists rang the bbc to say they exploded the bomb we are sorry that ordinary people died they said we meant to kill the queen not them but accidents happen sometimes the queen was lucky this time because the bomb exploded too late but she has to be lucky every time we only have to be lucky once my god alan said the bastards who who died one policeman a tourist and three coachmen jane said you were the only coachman who didnt die oh no alans eyes were filled with tears george bernard john dead what harm had they ever done to the irish or to anyone why did the irish have to kill them with their bloody bomb theres no justice in this life is there well perhaps the police will jane began yes i hope they catch those murdering irish bastards i really do i hope they lock them in prison until they die thats what i hope by god i do of course they will dad jane stroked her fathers hand softly the police are out there now looking for the bombers theyll catch them before too long chapter two anna that night alan was moved to another hospital where they would fit him with an artificial leg jane went with him and slept in a visitors room there in the morning she bought a newspaper she was right about the police theyve got them dad she said read this police yesterday arrested two irishmen who they think put a bomb in the queens coach last week the police said last week the coach went to a factory in south london to have new wheels fitted and we believe the bomb was placed in the coach there the two irishmen worked at this factory and two days before the bombing they went on holiday to ireland we think the bomb had a clock in it which was meant to explode at eleven oclock outside parliament luckily for the queen the bomb exploded after she had left the coach alan cole put the newspaper down slowly he looked pleased thank god for that he said but why did they want the bomb to explode outside parliament jane asked the queen was in the coach for twenty minutes why not blow the coach up earlier i dont know perhaps they wanted good pictures on tv alan said it was lucky for the queen but not lucky for me or for the poor people who were killed no jane put her hand on her fathers and remembered those minutes outside parliament the american man using his video camera and the woman with redbrown hair shaking her camera angrily then she shut her eyes and saw the smoke and the horse screaming and the blood and bodies everywhere what kind of people could do that i suppose the terrorists watched it on tv she said they were in ireland when the bomb exploded i expect they did alan said i expect they were laughing as people died but im pleased the police have caught them now perhaps theyll leave me alone who the police dad what do you mean alan sighed well yesterday they came to ask me about the night before the bombing i went back to the mews at about ten oclock that night you know to look at a horse with a bad leg i often do that they asked if i saw anything strange or looked at the coach and what did you tell them alan looked angry what do you think janie of course i saw nothing strange i was looking at the horse not the coach and we were only there half an hour we dad jane asked was someone with you alan hesitated well yes a lady friend of mine anna you havent met her janie but ive told her about you shes nice youll like her she sometimes comes to see the horses with me jane felt embarrassed after her mother had died four years ago jane had lived at home with her father once he had brought a woman home to the house but jane had had a terrible argument with her and the woman had left there had been no other women until jane left home to go to university now well her father was an adult of course he could have women friends but jane hated it she had loved her mother too much and she loved her father too what kind of a woman is she she asked angrily hes my father she thought i dont want another woman taking him away from me tall pretty redbrown hair she likes horses and films we go to the cinema a lot is she in love with you well perhaps janie i dont know ive only known her a few weeks youll like her janie shes good fun jane was still angry she couldnt stop herself then why isnt she here why hasnt she come to visit you now alan looked embarrassed well i was going to ask you janie she doesnt have a phone you see and perhaps she thinks im dead like the others god knows what shell think of a man with one leg but i do want to see her so ive written this letter could you post it for me janie please jane took the letter and read the address anna barry bowater gardens london nell dad your name was in the newspapers this woman can read cant she she must know youre alive yes but perhaps she doesnt know which hospital i dont know janie please dont be difficult have you told the police about this woman dad not yet why not theyll ask her questions wont they alan sighed yes i suppose so i warned her about that in the letter perhaps thats why she hasnt come you see its a bit difficult janie anna has a husband and so it will be embarrassing for her if he finds out about us perhaps the police will want to ask her husband questions too and then therell be all kinds of trouble i see jane said she felt miserable my own father she thought is in love with a married woman then she saw the tears in his eyes and his tired white face and felt angry with herself not him why she thought shouldnt my father fall in love it happens to everyone and you cant always choose the best person now hes here with only one leg and im angry with him im his daughter i should help him perhaps this anna really is a nice woman with a cruel husband she smiled and said im sorry dad of course ill post your letter but isnt it a hit dangerous sending a letter her husband could read it no its ok bowater gardens is just where shes living at the moment it isnt her home i dont know where her husband lives i dont want to know he smiled and took her hand shes a lovely woman janie really she is youll like her if you meet her you know outside the hospital jane walked slowly down the street she felt sad and a little lonely i wish my mother was still alive she thought i wish mum was alive now sitting with dad in the hospital i dont want all these problems why does dad need another woman oh mum why did you die i need someone to talk to she took the letter out of her pocket and looked at it i wonder what this anna barry is like she thought perhaps she is nice like dad says perhaps i could talk to her perhaps she really does love dad perhaps she can help me look after him but why hasnt she come to see him she looked at the address again bowater gardens london ne that wasnt far from her own student flat why not take the letter myself she thought then if this anna opens the door i can talk to her myself if i meet her at least ill find out what shes like jane put the letter in her bag and walked quickly to the underground station am i full of anger she wondered or hope bowater gardens was an old house in a quiet street in north london jane took the letter out of her bag and rang the bell nothing happened damn she thought she rang again still no answer she tried the door but it was locked so she put the letter through the letterbox and turned away then she stopped ive come all this way to meet this woman jane thought and i want to know what shes like shes important to my father so shes important to me ill wait as she stood there a woman came out of the nextdoor house she had grey hair and the kind of face that enjoys watching the neighbours and talking about them theyve gone theres no use waiting the woman said i saw you ring the bell so i came to tell you are you sure jane said i was looking for anna the girl with red hair thats right she did live here but she moved out with her boyfriend two days ago it was the morning of that terrible bomb thats why i remember it the house is empty now i had a look through the windows and theyve taken everything boyfriend so anna had another lover jane thought not just dad my poor poor father did you know them well the woman asked no not really jane said i just wanted to they were only here about three months the woman went on they werent very friendly never said good morning or anything like that they were irish i think well he was theres a lot of irish around here jane began to move away from the door and the woman added helpfully perhaps your friend will write to you yes perhaps jane smiled at her and walked sadly down the street so that was the kind of woman anna was she probably never loved my father at all jane thought how am i going to tell him poor dad perhaps ill just say that i posted the letter and not tell him that i came to the house and found out about her but jane wasnt very good at lying and she didnt want to look at her fathers sad eyes and tired white face let him hope for a few more hours she thought ill go home now and tell him something tomorrow she hadnt been back to her flat since the bombing she loved having her own home it was only one big bedroom really with a small bathroom and a kitchen but it was her own place she could do what she liked there she shut the door then took off her coat and threw it on the bed then she heard the bathroom door slowly open behind her she jumped round her heart beating fast with fear and saw a woman standing in the doorway who the hell are you she screamed a thief she thought jane had learned judo from her father she knew what to do she grabbed the womans arm and threw her towards the bed but as the woman fell she grabbed janes hair pulling it forwards to stop herself from falling jane screamed and pushed a hand into the womans face harder and harder until her hair was free then she hit the woman in the face and the woman fell to the floor jane stepped back looked at her and saw a man coming out of the kitchen he had cold grey eyes and a thin hard smile and worst of all he had a gun in his hand he said dont jane stood still shaking dont what move or talk dont do anything the little black hole in the end of the gun watched her like a cold eye the woman got up off the floor pulled jane onto a chair and tied her hands behind her then jane remembered that there were people in the other flats and opened her mouth to scream the man hit her in the face dont even think about it he said he took a long piece of cloth out of his pocket and tied it twice round her head covering her mouth and the lower part of her face jane felt her body shaking with fear who were these people what did they want with her she stared at the mans cold hard face the womans blue eyes and redbrown hair she thought she had seen the woman before but where the woman tied janes legs to the chair the little black eye of the gun was only a few centimetres from her face the man watched her and smiled just sit still and be sensible little girl he said then perhaps youll live a few hours longer chapter thre i made him happy alan cole lay in his bed listening to a bird singing in the hospital garden it was nearly dark outside now and very quiet he liked to lie like this remembering he remembered the way anna had kissed him and looked into his eyes he remembered her redbrown hair her blue eyes the soft dry touch of her lips her deep happy laugh she liked to drink whisky before they made love and afterwards she often held his head on her chest and stroked his hair i loved that he remembered i felt like a child again safe and comfortable sometimes i fell asleep and then what on the night before the bombing he and anna had been out for a meal in a restaurant then they had gone to the mews to look at the horses the guards knew she was his girlfriend so they didnt think it was unusual one of the horses sandman had hurt his leg that morning alan remembered in the evening the leg had been hot so he had put ice on it lucky sandman alan thought he couldnt pull the coach next day so he was still alive now afterwards they went back to his house and made love anna had been very excited alan remembered it had been very good then he had slept until morning he woke at six oclock and dressed quietly but she woke up just before he left she opened her eyes smiled at him and held out her arms to him sleepily he kissed her and she said goodbye lover that was the last time he had seen her he was still thinking about anna when he drove the queens coach to parliament with the six fine horses in front of him for a moment he thought he saw her in the crowd watching alan didnt want to think about what had happened next he stared into the darkness outside the hospital window and thought why hasnt she come to see me perhaps she never really loved me he thought perhaps shes gone back to her husband or found a younger man its cruel and painful but i cant change it ill never see her again he remembered her warm body next to his and the way she whispered his name there must be another reason she loves me i know she does shell come to see me when she gets my letter i wish jane could meet her outside night had fallen and the birds had stopped singing alan cole lay quietly on his bed the tears running slowly down his face jane sat on the chair in her flat and listened to the man and the woman arguing in her kitchen she could hear but she couldnt speak or see because the man had put a bag over her head her arms and legs were still tied to the chair and her face ached where the man had hit her she tried to get her hands free she pulled as hard as she could but the rope just burned her wrists all she could do was listen to the voices in the kitchen we must phone him now kev we cant wait weve got to wait its too dangerous to do it from here anna wait until were ready to go anna jane thought was this her fathers anna no no lots of women were called anna but we cant go until tonight anna said there are too many people around during the day and every minute is important perhaps cole has already talked to the police about me oh god i wish the bomb had killed him with the others well it didnt and it didnt kill the queen janes body was shaking this was her fathers anna the woman was talking about her father and the bomb and then jane remembered where she had seen the woman before outside parliament with a camera shaking it angrily taking photos of the back of peoples heads then pushing forwards to get closer pressing the camera button again a second before the bomb exploded the voices in the kitchen stopped the door opened someone came into the room what now jane heard the click of a gun phone call for you mr cole youre popular today arent you the nurse smiled pushed the telephone table next to his bed and went out alan picked up the phone hello mr cole this is detective david hall you remember i came to see you yesterday im ringing because ive got a few more questions to ask you is it all right if i come over to see you now er well i suppose so but ive told you everything i know yes im sure but its just that we have to get all the facts right ill come over now is that ok yes fine i great see you in a few minutes then alan put the phone down slowly he felt old and tired and very very lonely perhaps ill ring jane later when this mans gone he thought i hope she remembered to post the letter kev pulled the bag off janes head and she saw the gun a few centimetres from her eyes im going to untie this cloth round your mouth kev said if you scream ill put a bullet through your head this gun is silenced no one will hear anything they untied the cloth and pulled her chair over to the wall where the phone was the gun was pointing at her head all the time do just what we tell you anna said and everything will be all right jane was suddenly wild with anger she said youre anna arent you my father loves you he thinks youre wonderful but you dont care about him at all do you you wish the bomb had killed him of course i care about him anna said softly hes very important to me thats why im going to phone him now and youre going to talk to him too jane stared at her then at kev why anna laughed im going to ask him to keep our love a secret i have a very difficult husband you know whats the woman talking about jane thought what does all this mean then suddenly a lot of things came together in her mind and everything became clear anna had been with her father in the mews on the night before the bombing in the kitchen anna had spoken about her father talking to the police jane could hear from kevs voice that he was irish and he and anna had moved out of bowater gardens on the morning of the bombing later anna had been outside parliament doing strange things with a camera when the bomb exploded if it was a camera perhaps it had been a radio sending a signal to the bomb oh god youre the terrorists arent you she whispered you did it anna you put the bomb in the queens coach you exploded it with a camera i saw you outside parliament youre terrorists murdering terrorists both of you kev smiled coldly well well what a clever little girl but youre wrong the police have arrested the terrorists it was in the newspapers this morning so theyre the wrong men arent they it was you two i know it was you killed five people and took away my fathers leg and now two innocent men will go to prison for thirty years for something you did but you dont care kevs eyes were suddenly full of hate care about what were fighting to free ireland if the british put the wrong people in prison thats not our problem we care about staying free thats good for ireland yes and i suppose its good for ireland to use innocent people like my father to make love to him just because you wanted to get into the mews to put the bomb in the coach did you enjoy that anna do you feel proud of it anna laughed a strange quiet cruel laugh yes of course i enjoyed it little girl and your father enjoyed it too i made him happy happy jane said you nearly killed him yes im sorry he didnt die while he was so happy silence there was no answer to that jane thought lets get on with it said kev angrily were losing time tears came into janes eyes you dirty murderers she whispered kev hit her across the face with his gun jane felt blood in her mouth one of her teeth was broken we could kill her now kev said and get out of the country tonight no no anna said we must talk to cole first but we cant let her go kev said shes seen our faces she knows too much oh no anna said her voice was soft and cruel of course not but well keep her alive for some weeks to make sure that cole stays quiet pick up the phone kev chapter four phone call the phone rang again in alan coles room hello he said alan he recognized her voice at once anna he said his heart beating fast yes now listen carefully alan oh anna ive been waiting for your call have you heard about about my leg anna never mind your leg listen to me ill say this once and once only what anna what are you weve got your daughter alan jane thats her name isnt it speak to your father jane now over the phone alan heard the high frightened voice of his daughter dad im sorry dad they say if you tell the police anything about anna theyll kill me but i dont care i oh alan heard a scream which was suddenly cut off then annas voice again she wont die if you keep quiet lover boy but if you say a word a single word about me to the police youll find her body in the river thames do you understand alan tried to speak but there was something wrong with his voice yes he said but please no buts if you want to see your daughter again keep your mouth shut the phone went dead alan cole sat very still there was a terrible pain in his chest his mouth was dry and he couldnt move he sat like a stone its like a dream he thought surely it didnt happen but that voice on the phone it was jane all right and anna too anna saying that she had kidnapped jane but why what was going on slowly he tried to understand he hadnt told the police about anna because of her husband but why was that so important why has anna kidnapped jane because anna has a secret something very important that i alan know about but mustnt tell the police anna will kill jane if i tell anyone about it but what is this secret what am i supposed to know there was a knock on the door a nurse came in hello mr cole a policeman to see you are you ok yes yes fine thanks you dont look ok the nurse put her hand on his head and felt his wrist well youre not too hot and your hearts ok she smiled at the policeman just half an hour now remember hes had a very serious accident i know that the policeman came in and sat down and the nurse went out pushing the telephone table in front of her im detective hall mr cole we met before yes alan said the policeman had a kind friendly face the kind of man you could trust hell help me alan thought hes probably a father himself no fear burned alan like a fire i mustnt tell him about anna if i do jane will die youve probably read in the newspapers mr cole that weve arrested two men the policeman told alan the story about the two irishmen in the coach factory so we know they bombed the coach and how they did it i suppose youre pleased about that er yes alan said quietly thats good but why have you come to see me i just need to ask you a few questions about the day before the bombing you see we think these men put the bomb in the coach three days before the bombing while the coach was at the factory so the bomb was already in the coach when it came back to the mews was it alan said he didnt really understand what the policeman was talking about we think so yes and in your job you look after the coach dont you the coach yes and the horses mostly the horses well did you notice anything unusual anything at all no i dont think so lets take this slowly the policeman said the day before the bombing when did you leave work at about six oclock half past perhaps and you didnt go back no alan said quietly then he looked away quickly out of the window he felt cold frightened lonely are you sure about that mr cole you see a guard told me you came back later at about ten he did oh yes of course i went back to see a horse sandman he had a bad leg i see the policeman wrote in his book alone im sorry were you alone mr cole when you saw the horse for a moment alan didnt answer a new very unwelcome idea came to him and he began to feel sick with fear it wasnt those two irishmen he thought it was anna she put the bomb in the coach when i was with sandman i was alone with the horse for at least ten minutes she had plenty of time and that means she didnt love me at all she just used me i thought i was so lucky an old man with a young pretty woman in my bed and all the time she was laughing at me worse than that shes a murderer she killed george and bernard and john and she took my leg and now shes going to kill jane as well and i cant say anything about it thats why she phoned me to make sure that i never tell the police if i tell this policeman jane will die in a strange shaky voice alan said i was alone when i was with the horse yes the policeman said nothing alan felt his hands shaking and put them under the sheet why is he looking at me like that he thought what does he know are you sure mr cole the guard says you have a lady friend and sometimes she visits the horses with you was she with you that night no youre sure about that mr cole yes i am and shes not my friend any more now weve ended it i see the policeman sighed wrote in his notebook and stood up thats all then mr cole the guard wasnt sure probably it was a different night yes im sure it was right then thank you for your help good night mr cole he walked to the door and went out alan watched him go unable to say another word he had never felt so helpless so frightened i have to speak he thought i have to do something but i cant if i speak jane will die but if i say nothing will they ever let her go as the door closed he opened his mouth and said detective hall but the policeman walked away he didnt hear oh god alan thought what do i do now after the phone call kev and anna tied the cloth round janes mouth again and went back into her kitchen anna had the bag over janes head too but jane could hear most of what they were saying they were angry arguing youve made too many mistakes with this plan anna kev said the queen of england is still walking around buckingham palace because of you annas voice was high and angry because of me what about you you were supposed to understand bombs and radio transmitters and what happened the transmitter in that camera didnt work when i pressed the button you probably didnt press it hard enough kev said coldly it worked in the end didnt it yes too late anna said that was your mistake not mine so now weve got cole to worry about and this girl weve got to get her away from here fast wait until midnight when the house is quiet there was an icy fear in janes stomach they know i can hear them and they dont care she thought im sure dad will keep quiet but they can never let me go now theyll have to kill me because i know too much if i dont get away from them soon im going to die alan lay in the dark and listened to the voices in his head arguing this way and that way until he thought he would go crazy keep your mouth shut if you speak shell die but theyll still kill her if shes seen their faces they wont anna wont shes a woman she couldnt do that she was your lover woman she killed five people she blew my leg off those two men the police have arrested are innocent theyll go to prison for thirty years if i dont speak i dont know them i dont care about them jane is the only person who matters to me the police will think that i helped anna put the bomb in the coach ill go to prison that woman is laughing at me she was laughing at me when we made love i hate her i hope she dies she wont die jane will i must keep quiet what can i do if i speak theyll kill her but if i dont speak theyll kill her later so ive got to tell the police now its janes only chance i cant its too dangerous i cant i want to see my daughter for two hours he lay in his room and listened to the voices in his head and thought he was going crazy his leg ached his chest felt very hot twice he decided to get up and tell someone but his body wouldnt move then the third time he got into his wheelchair and went out into the corridor it was midnight nurse he said nurse i need a telephone now oh god he thought where is jane now jane was in the boot of a car her hands and feet were tied the piece of cloth was round her mouth and the bag was over her head but she knew she was in a car boot because she could hear the engine and when she tried to sit up she hit her head she didnt know how long she had been there there wasnt much air but she couldnt do anything about it she just lay there and thought it cant be much longer we must get there soon and then theyll let me out and then what how long before they kill me chapter five you must believe me when alan phoned the police detective hall came to the hospital quickly bringing an inspector lee with him they listened to alans story then talked for a while outside the door then they came back in ok mr cole inspector lee said detectives are now searching the house in bowater gardens and your daughters flat ive informed the police at ports and airports too its possible that the kidnappers will try to take your daughter out of the country you know oh my god alan held his face in his hands shes probably dead ill never see her again lets hope thats not true said the inspector now lets talk about this woman anna again why do you think shes a terrorist again alan explained the visit to the mews the evening before the bombing the ten minutes when anna was not with him her phone call telling him not to talk to the police or jane would die it was hard to speak clearly because he was so angry and afraid he began to cry its no good he said janes going to die try to keep calm mr cole said the inspector you see were not sure that this anna is a terrorist we have already arrested the two men who put the bomb in the coach in fact one of them confessed to it this morning the other one will confess soon but theyre the wrong people they must be if they are the murderers why did anna phone me why is she saying shell kill my daughter if i dont keep quiet about her are you sure it was annas voice on the phone of course i am and it was janes voice as well i know my own daughters voice dont i alan shouted mmm the inspector said slowly now your daughter was she unhappy to hear about anna do you think sometimes daughters dont like their fathers to have girlfriends you know perhaps she was angry with you no not really well perhaps a bit i see some very strange things in my job mr cole and a lot of them are because of family arguments its just possible you see that your daughter hasnt been kidnapped at all perhaps shes angry with you and wants to stop you seeing anna perhaps ive seen it happen before shes asked a friend to ring you and pretend to be anna no alan shouted jane isnt like that she was frightened i could hear it in her voice on the phone anna has kidnapped her you must believe me at that moment another detective came in and spoke quietly to inspector lee who immediately got up and left the room when he came back his face was serious the house in bowater gardens is empty he told alan the two people there left on the morning of the bombing we didnt find anything useful at your daughters flat but we did find her handbag with her flat keys in it it seems strange for her to go out without her keys doesnt it where is she alan whispered can you find her if your daughter has been kidnapped she could be anywhere the inspector said our only hope is that the kidnappers call you again and then we can find out where the call came from were fixing up a phone for you now and therell be two policewomen here with you all night if anna does phone keep her talking tell her that you have said nothing to the police and ask to speak to jane say you must hear her voice they put the phone on a table next to alans bed he stared at it saying to himself over and over again i must hear her voice i must hear her voice they put jane in a small bedroom untied her feet and took the bag off her head but they tied her hands behind her back and then tied them to the end of the bed youll stay here until those two men are sent to prison anna said every day well send your father a picture of you with todays newspaper to show youre still alive then what then well see perhaps if your father is a good boy well let you go anna said if you keep quiet too but jane was watching kevs face he wont let me go she thought never if i dont escape ill die here when they had left the room she lay in the dark wondering how she could escape i dont want to die she thought and how terrible it will be for dad if they kill me and then there are those two innocent irishmen who will spend thirty years in prison for something they didnt do that bastard kevs going to kill me ive got to try to escape i just have to for hours she tried to get free but it was impossible the rope only hurt her wrists more but at least she could move her hands up and down the end of the old bed once towards morning she pulled the rope hard against the bed but it didntbreak instead something cut her hand and she had an idea could it cut the rope as well she moved the rope up and down across the end of the bed it was very difficult because she couldnt see what she was doing three times she cut herself and there was blood on the rope but by early morning the rope broke her hands were free what now she tried the door but it was locked downstairs she could hear a radio and she could smell coffee so one of them at least was in the house then she had another idea she lay down on the bed and arranged the rope around her wrists behind her back then she screamed hey you terrorist murderers come up here now im thirsty get up here and give me a drink in a few minutes she heard someone on the stairs breakfast mr cole the nurse said eat up like a good boy then youll feel better she smiled im not a child alan thought oh god im a father whos lost a child he pushed the eggs and tomatoes away and drank a cup of black coffee the policewoman in the armchair woke up and smiled brightly well no one has phoned mr cole perhaps your daughter has been to an allnight party and shell be along to see you this morning alan stared at her hopelessly he had not closed his eyes all night so the police didnt really believe him perhaps they thought he had gone crazy because he had lost a leg he stared at the silent phone ring damn you ring kev came in carrying his cup of coffee in his hand he wasnt wearing a coat so jane could see the gun under his arm stop making that noise he said or youll be sorry jane looked at him you stupid little man she said softly and as kev stepped angrily forwards she freed her hands from the rope behind her back and jumped at him with one hand she pulled his head down and with the other she grabbed his cup and threw the hot coffee into his face then she kicked him hard in the stomach ah damn you kev fell onto the floor trying to get the hot coffee out of his eyes immediately jane jumped on top of him her knees landed hard in his stomach and her fingers tried to get the gun under his arm but kevs hand found the gun first jane tried to pull it out of his hand but he was too strong for her with his other hand he hit her hard on the side of the head jane fell forwards but as she fell she put her head down and bit his nose until her mouth was full of blood he screamed tried to pull his head away and let go of the gun ive got it jane thought ive really got it then kev hit her head again hard and she didnt know what was happening she moved away from him bringing the gun down towards her chest her head hurt terribly and there was blood in her mouth but all the time her fingers were trying to use the gun why wont it shoot she thought how do i make it work then as kev hit her again there was a bang and another bang and a third and a fourth she didnt know what the bangs were but she held on to the gun as hard as she could and there was a fifth bang and a sixth and then it stopped she opened her eyes and saw that kev wasnt hitting her any more his hands had gone all soft and there was blood coming out of his face and his neck and his chest there was blood all over the floor and half of his head was missing jane stood up shaking where is anna she thought chapter six in the tunnel alan put down his coffee when the call came he picked up the phone with shaking hands a voice said alan anna alan whispered the policewoman went out of the door and spoke in a low voice on her radio do you remember what i said yesterday alan yes alan said please dont hurt jane please i havent said a word to anyone i promise you anna good not today not tomorrow not ever alan do you understand not if you want her to stay alive yes i understand anna but i must speak to jane i must hear her voice anna how do i know you havent killed her already alans voice was shaking anna laughed gently cruelly well send you something alan in a day or two if youre good anna please but the phone went dead alan put the phone down slowly and suddenly the room was full of voices weve got it a phone box in south kensington station by the ticket office calling all cars in kensington calling all cars in kensington a woman has just made a phone call from the policewoman put her hand on alans arm theyll be there in two minutes she said gently theyll take me there alan said please the policewoman looked at alan then at the wheelchair then back at alans white face all right weve got a big van outside we can get the wheelchair in that as jane came down the stairs she realized two things she was covered in blood and anna wasnt there the house was very quiet and all the rooms were empty but i cant go out all covered in blood she thought people will think ive killed someone i have but i had to he was going to kill me and hes a terrorist he killed five people he and anna i must get out before anna comes back she found a mans coat put it on and went out into the street i should call a policeman she thought but she could only see ordinary men women and children she saw an underground station and walked towards it she went into the station found some money in the coat pocket and bought a ticket i must find my father she thought and tell him that everythings all right then she looked behind her and saw a woman coming out of a telephone box oh my god she thought its anna jane walked quickly away from the ticket office down the escalator towards the platform and the trains halfway down the escalator she looked back up behind her anna had seen her anna was following her down the escalator quickly jane ran down to the bottom and onto one of the platforms there was a train there with its doors still open she ran towards them but as she ran the doors closed and the train moved away into the tunnel anna was now coming onto the platform behind her annas hand was inside her coat and jane was sure she had a gun why didnt i bring kevs gun jane thought but it was empty and i hate guns and its no use thinking about that now what do i do now as the police van screamed through the london traffic the policewoman listened in to her radio and passed the information to alan inspector lee is on his way she said there are six cars at the station already and theyre watching all the entrances ah two detectives have seen a woman with redbrown hair going down the escalator but the trains alan said shell catch a train theyll stop the trains as soon as they can but there are hundreds of people in the station the detectives could lose the woman in the crowds please god whispered alan let them catch her as anna came towards her jane ran towards the end of the platform then looked behind her and saw anna running after her her hand still inside her coat quickly jane turned and ran towards another escalator but there was a crowd of people there she looked again and saw anna twenty metres behind she turned round a corner back onto another platform which was empty no people no train anna will find me here in a second and shoot me she thought what now she jumped off the platform onto the railway line and ran into the tunnel it was very dark in the tunnel she knew that one of the lines was electric if i touch it ill die she thought the trains come every six minutes and if a train hits me ill die too and there are only thirty centimetres between the sides of the train and the tunnel walls but there are holes in the tunnel walls every hundred metres for workmen ill find one of those wait for the next train and then go on to the next hole its probably only a kilometre to the next station and perhaps anna wont be sure which way ive gone she ran on into the darkness once she fell and her hands nearly touched the electric line when she got up there was a terrible noise like a train coming but it was a train in another tunnel not this one she ran on with one hand on the wall looking for the hole three minutes four then she found it a hole just big enough for one person she got in and stood very still waiting she heard the terrible noise again this time from the station behind her then it stopped the train will stop in that station for one minute she thought then it will come past she laughed aloud in the darkness anna is still looking for me back on the platform how angry she must be a hand touched her arm she screamed what oh god no the hand grabbed her arm and pulled her out of the hole into the dark tunnel get out there two hands pushed her and jane fell between the lines she got to her knees carefully afraid of the electric line then the terrible noise started the ground shook beneath her feet and a white light came towards her faster and faster in the light jane saw anna standing in the hole with a gun in her hand she jumped towards the hole but the train was coming faster much too fast and there was only room in the hole for one person a woman with a gun when alan arrived at the station there were police cars everywhere and crowds of people watching them the policewoman helped him out of the van and he pushed his wheelchair through the crowd shouting angrily whats happening where is she at the top of the escalator a policeman said im sorry sir you cant go down theres been a terrible accident then some ambulance men arrived where is it they asked down in the tunnel two women a trains hit them the policeman said the ambulance men hurried down whats happening alan shouted which women theres a murderer down there a terrorist and my daughter ive got to find my daughter he began to climb out of his wheelchair but the policeman pushed him back im sorry sir then the policewoman hurried up and explained they helped alans wheelchair onto the escalator and went down at the bottom alan saw an empty train and a lot of police at the end of the platform the ambulance men talked to the police and then went into the tunnel alan wheeled his chair slowly along the platform then two of the ambulance men came out of the tunnel there was a young woman between them she walked slowly she was very dirty and there was blood on the side of her face but alan knew who she was janie he said janie are you all right jane looked along the platform and saw him dad why are you here she walked towards him shakily i came to find you alan said oh god janie what happened did anna try to kill you jane touched the blood on her face yes she tried to shoot me but she missed then i threw her in front of a train i killed the other one too she smiled a strange shaky smile you said there was no justice in this life didnt you dad well those two terrorists murdered five people and took away your leg and and now theyre dead so there is some justice dad isnt there then her eyes were filled with tears and she sat down suddenly on a platform seat that woman hated you dad she whispered shakily really hated you alan wheeled his chair close to her and held her hands in his im so sorry he said anna hated everyone not just me but she doesnt matter now janie youre alive thats all that matters to me thats all that matters in the world the end
